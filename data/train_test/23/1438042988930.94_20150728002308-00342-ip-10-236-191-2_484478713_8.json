    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{80721=The memory map of the screen is not tied to the video display width but is defined independently. The base address of the screen can be anywhere in system memory 45. The width of the screen memory is the power of 2 from 128 to 2048 bytes. The height of the screen is a power of 2 from 32 K to 2 megabytes. Video addresses on the same line wrap within the smaller boundary. This arrangement allows the screen to be placed within a larger virtual screen and panned and scrolled within it., 150935=The CD drive controller 74 also has a block decoder. The block decoder synchronizes to the start of the 2352-byte sectors, performs the descrambling, and computes the EDC (error detection code) to detect errors. It operates in either short mode where a 2048 data bytes are transferred after the header, or a long mode, where the 2340 bytes after the sync pattern are transferred. This allows the header and error correction data to be read if desired. The header size is either programmable to either 4 or 12 bytes to support CD drive mode 1 and CDI/XA mode 2 form 1, but header matching is only performed on the main 4-byte header. The mode 2 forms are only supported by operating in long mode and extracting the required data. Header matching is performed on the first sector of the transfer to ensure that the correct data is being read. The desired header value should be programmed into the header registers. If a multisector transfer is performed, then no further matching occurs after the first sector., 124058=The command bits are as follows. Setting the RUN bit causes the bltter 72 to start operation. It is used when writing to the command register as an I/O port to start the blitter 72 reading a command. If the bltter 72 loads a command with the RUN bit cleared as part of a command read, then operation ceases. Setting the COLST bit causes operation to stop if a collision (write inhibit) occurs. From that point, print operation can be resumed by the CPU 48 or aborted, and various internal registers may be read. Setting the PARRD bit requires the blitter 72 to read a new parameter set from the program counter address, every time the inner loop exits and the outer loop has not reached zero. Setting the SRCUP bit requires the contents of the step register to be added to the source address on exit from the inner loop if the outer count has not reached zero. Setting the DSTUP bit requires the contents of the step register to be added to the destination address on exit from the inner loop if the outer count has not reached zero. Setting the SRCEN bit enables the source address read in the inner loop. This also causes the source address register to be incremented according to the pixel size. Setting the DSTEN bit enables a destination address read in the inner loop. This does not affect the destination address register, which is incremented as part of the destination write cycle. Setting the SRCENF bit causes the source address to be read when the inner loop is first entered, but not subsequently entered. This is a special case of SRCEN and is relevant to the character paint mode, as described above. SRCENF has no affect if SRCEN is set. The two bits PSIZE0 and PSIZE1 select the pixel size, 0 to 3 corresponding to 4, 8, 16, and 32 bits respectively. 32 bits is for data moves in a 32-bit system only, as described above. The 2-bits WIDTH0 and WIDTH1 select the screen width, in bytes, 0 to 3 corresponding to 256, 512, 1024, and 2048 bytes, respectively. Setting LINDR puts the blitter 72 into line-drawing mode. This mode uses both the source and destination address registers to generate the line-draw address, which may be used for both reading and writing. Setting the YFRAC bit indicates to the blitter 72 which of the X and Y addresses have the fractional increment in line-drawing mode. It is set if the Y address has the fractional increment. Setting the PATSEL bit selects the pattern data register to replace the source data register as the source input to the logical function unit. This bit is relevant to character painting, where the source data register will contain the font data, and the pattern data register contains the ink color. Setting the shade bit enables output from the shading ALU as write data. This bit is only valid for 8- and 16-bit pixels., 63921=In the alternative, the ADC/DAC/CODEC 59 can be replaced with a TDA1311 DAC manufactured by Philips. If this chip is used, the ADC and CODEC functions will not be available., 106581=The inner loop performs the actual blitting or line drawing operations. An inner loop cycle can contain up to three memory cycles. These are a read from the source address, a read from the destination address, and a write to the destination address. All three cycles are optional. If the loop includes a source read, or a source read and a destination read, then the comparator inhibit mechanism is tested before the destination write occurs. This allows the write cycles to be bypassed when a comparator inhibit condition is met. When the comparator inhibit conditions are met, it is possible to have the current operations cease and control returned to the CPU 48. The program may then examine the address registers to determine where the inhibit has occurred, so that collision detection may be performed. The CPU 48 may then determine whether to resume the operation or abort it. The inner loop performs operations until the inner loop counter reaches zero. The inner loop counter is a 10-bit counter, so the inner loop can iterate any number of times from 1 to 1024., 162039=A three axis device permits a type of operation which has been described as \"press to select\". That is, manipulation of the control element may direct movement of a selection display element, such as a cursor, from side-to-side and up-and-down through the field of a displayed visual image and then be used to also make a selection of a display feature. Side-to-side movement may, for example, be coupled to thumb pressure to one side or the other; up-and-down, to pressure away from or toward the manipulator. Selection, then would be coupled to thumb pressure along the third axis, as by pressing downwardly against the control element. An early example may be found in the disclosure of Garrett U.S. Pat. No. 5,065,146, issued Nov. 12, 1991 and held in common with the inventions here described., 88566=The bootstrap ROM is always 16 bits wide. The bootstrap ROM comprises two 27C512 erasable programmable read-only memories, manufactured by numerous manufacturers, thereby giving 128K of bootstrap ROM. Following a reset, the one megabyte window from F20000H to FFFFFFH containing ROM and internal memory is repeated throughout the 16 megabyte address range. This allows for a variety of processors to boot with the video processor 39. The memory map above is adopted the first time with the memory type register is written to by the CPU 48. The video/memory controller 78 performs page mode cycles on the system memory 45 wherever possible. These are quicker than normal memory cycles and occur if successive reads and writes are within the same page. The video/memory controller 78 needs to know the number of columns in the DRAM, which is programmed in the memory type register. In the memory type register, bit 0 and 1 determine the number of columns in the DRAM, with 0 indicating 256 columns, 1 indicating 512, 2 indicating 1024, and 3 indicating 2048., 27526=This application is a continuation-in-part of copending application Ser. No. 08/700,606 filed Aug. 12, 1996 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,801,941 and of application Ser. No. 08/899,038 filed Jul. 23, 1997 now abandoned, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/551,620 filed Nov. 1, 1995 and now U.S. Pat. No. 5,657,091. The present subject application claims priority from each and all of these prior applications., 61035=The video controller 60 of the video processor 39 connects to the external video DAC 55, which converts eighteen bits of pixel information (six bits each of red, green, and blue) from the video controller 60 into an RGB signal, as is well known in the art. Each color channel (R, G. and B) of the video DAC is implemented with an R2R resistor tree and a 2N2222 transistor. The RGB signal is converted to NTSC composite video with the NTSC/PAL encoder 62. The NTSC/PAL encoder 62 accepts chroma clock, HSYNC and VSYNC signals which are generated by the video controller 60 of the video processor 39, and red, green, and blue video outputs which are generated by the video DAC 55, and generates a composite video signal in the well known NTSC or baseband video format. In the alternative, the well known PAL (European television signal standard) format can be generated. The composite video signal is connected to an optional external composite video display device with a single female RCA type phono jack, as is well known in the art. In the preferred embodiment, the NTSC/PAL encoder 56 is an MC1377, manufactured by Motorola Corp., 62187=An RF modulator 58 merges the composite video signal from the MC1377 with the left and right audio line out signals from an audio ADC/DAC/CODEC 59 onto a carrier frequency to generate an RF video signal, indicated by RF Video, suitable for being directly input into the television receiver 10. To generate the different PAL (European television signal standard) and NTSC formats a different RF modulator and crystal must be used. The RF video signal is connected to external devices with a single female Type F coaxial connector, as is well known in the art.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In the drawings and specifications there has been set forth a preferred embodiment of the invention and, although specific terms are used, the description thus given uses terminology in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Inasmuch as the mobile client system 210 has a touchscreen 250 which overlies the LCD 215, input of data into the system can be accomplished by a stylus, pointer or finger applied to fields of the touchscreen. Thus, referring to FIG. 26, should a user desire to input information identifying the gender of a particular patient, the user could target or touch (with stylus, pointer or finger) the buttons \"male\" or \"female\" to enter that data. Similarly, should a user wish to enter an annotation, the user could target or touch the field defined by the notebook icon to change the icon between the closed and open states and thereby open a field for entry of appropriate numerical or alphabetic data. Display of such fields results from execution of a control program by the processor of the mobile client system. More particularly, the processor 230 of the client system executes an operating system program and a browser program stored in the system flash memory 246. In executing these programs, the system exchanges data with a supporting server by passing data through the radio link provided by the transceiver 213 and interface 258 or the modem",
