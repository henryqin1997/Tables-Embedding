See Moritz, U.S. Pat. No. 3,339,920, issued Sept. 5, 1967., 13150=The raising of the beam or the tilting thereof creates tension and anxiety in the child who walks the beam. See for example the beams used by experienced gymnasts in Sorenson et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,404,884 issued Oct. 8, 1968 or the rocking beam of Pitkanen, U.S. Pat. No. 3,485,493 or the tilted beam of Lowman, U.S. Pat. No. 1,747,721.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A combination face-abutting double beam educational development and play toy embodiment is illustrated in the alternate embodiment of FIG. 19, which toy may be used with or without a pedestal. There are four play or instructional surfaces. This embodiment of double beam employs the dovetail-type connector 54 in the top surface of each trapezoidal half 70 and the connector is inserted at each end face into recess 72. It is contemplated that a child will crawl on the beam and will pass decals, puzzles, symbols, instructing sounding parts as part of a game emphasizing discovery perception and tactile tasks, using all of the limbs. By separating the beams, the child can practice straddling both beams at a lower height preferably at 3 inches and try to negotiate the entire length preferably about 30 inches. Obviously, this embodiment may incorporate the sounding tape device of FIG. 9. Briefly summarizing magnetic and mechanical connecting means simple in construction, yet easy to operate by teacher or child have been disclosed in the preferred embodiments herein and a great variety of beam to beam, pedestal to beam, and pedestal to pedestal arrays are provided to challenge the creativity of the child and to promote visual motor and perceptual skills as part of the child's total development and growth. The sound unit may be mounted on a base and removed as a unit after detaching the mounting screws as shown in",
