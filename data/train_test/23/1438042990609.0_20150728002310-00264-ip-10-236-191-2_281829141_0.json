Back on March 2nd, a powerful, F3 tornado slammed into the small town, rendering it nearly unrecognizable and leaving many of its citizens devastated. Even now, a full month after the catastrophe, the people of West Liberty and Morgan County still require the aid of their fellow Kentuckians. This was the Johnsons second trip to the area. On this occasion, the Johnsons, along with ALC student Robin Warrix, worked with West Liberty\u2019s Index Community Church in receiving and taking inventory of supplies, as well as filling the requests of the town\u2019s families and other tornado relief workers., 25618=For those students who couldn\u2019t venture off campus, several ALC clubs joined forces to host a fundraiser event. The IMPACT Club, Law Society, Alpha Chi, Allied Health Club, and Phi Beta Lambda came together to host an event in The Meadow on Tuesday, March 27th. The students organized several activities, including a \u201cpie in the face\u201d booth, a cornhole tournament, and a concession stand. Kimberly Patton, one of the students involved with the on-campus efforts, said, \u201cThe event was a success! We raised more than $300 and had a great time.\u201d}",
