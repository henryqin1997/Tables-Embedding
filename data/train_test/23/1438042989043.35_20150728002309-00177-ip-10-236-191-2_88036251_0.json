The brothers then began work on a sports car before leaving to found the Osca marque. The engine from this car was the basis of a Formula Two car which became eligible for the World Championship when Formula One fell by the wayside in 1952-53. This was a time of Ferrari domination, but Fangio won for Maserati at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza., 27189=Jul 7, 1958, 20059=When hostilities ended, Alfieri Maserati raced his own special and then the brothers embarked on building a straight-eight engine for the Diatto Grand Prix car. They bought it and modified it to conform to the 1926 regulations, with Alfieri taking a class win in that year's Targa Florio., 21973=Maserati looked good for the newly introduced 2.5-litre formula of 1954, but once again Mercedes was to launch a major onslaught and spoil the Italian party. Fangio won the first two grands prix for Maserati in 1954, while he waited for the Mercedes programme to come on-stream. He was driving the 250F, which was destined to become the best-known Maserati ever., 23200=Maserati also gave Fangio his last grand prix, at Reims in 1958, although by that time the factory team was no more. Despite a successful 1957, Maserati was in big financial trouble and the 250F continued to race only in private hands until it became outmoded by mid-engined development., 28435=Juan Manuel Fangio finished second at the 1957 Italian GP, 22354=The 250F proved a very popular car among privateers and was progressively improved, with various weight-saving exercises being carried out. With Mercedes withdrawing, Stirling Moss won two races for Maserati in 1956, while Fangio took his fourth world title for Ferrari. The next year, Fangio, disgruntled with the politicking at Ferrari, returned to Maserati. He won four races to collect his fifth title., 26719=Mar 13, 2010, 27680=Sep 8, 1957, 20366=Maserati then did some twin-engined experimentation before building the 8C-2500 and 2800 chassis. The 8CM was built to take the fight to rival Alfa Romeo's P3 and was the start of a rivalry between the two marques that would continue until after the Second World War. Baconin Borzacchini was an early Maserati faithful, and was joined in an 8CM by Tazio Nuvolari in 1933.}",
