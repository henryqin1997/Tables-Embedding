He willed the school to a 13-1 ledger as a quarterback, safety, wide receiver and on special teams to aid the march to the Suburban East Conference title. Ranking fourth in the state in scoring (158 points), he rushed for 1,480 yards (7th in the state) while averaging 8.76 yards per carry and scoring 26 touchdowns his senior season. In addition, he passed for another 1,038 yards (65-128) and 13 scores. Also was afforded first-team all-state accolades on defense as his team\ufffds second-leading tackler posted 71 stops (60 unassisted) along with seven interceptions (5th in the state), three quarterback sacks and two fumble recoveries. Completed the package with six catches for 125 yards (20.8 avg.), 10 kickoff returns for a 30.1-yard average, 15 returned punts for a pace of 13.3 yards per attempt in addition to punting the football 18 times for a 37.6-yard clip. After moving from Wisconsin prior to his junior year, he ran for 1,700 yards and 19 touchdowns in 2003 as a quarterback in addition to snagging five interceptions as a defensive back. The son of former 10-year NFL defensive back standout Gill Byrd also was a first-team all-league choice in baseball and basketball., 180101=Oregon Preview: Defense \u2014 11/13/2007, from GOAZCATS.com, 180774=Undersized Forsett brings big game \u2014 9/28/2007, from Rivals.com College Football, 177440=Four Ducks chosen All-Conference \u2014 12/8/2008, from Duck Sports Authority, 179234=Oregon defense needs to produce \u2014 7/28/2008, from Rivals.com College Football, 183222=Stewart steals the show at Oregon NIKE Camp \u2014 6/20/2004, from Rivals100.com, 182675=Missouri athlete deciding on fifth visit \u2014 1/14/2005, from OrangeandBlueNews.com, 52197=Class: 2005 (High School) Rating/Rankings: | 5.3, 176532=Byrd to forego senior season \u2014 1/19/2009, from Duck Sports Authority, 178879=Pick the winners Pac-10 Preview \u2014 8/24/2008, from USCFootball.com, 179412=Oregon has holes to fill on offense \u2014 4/2/2008, from Rivals.com College Football, 179952=Ducks go down \u2014 11/16/2007, from GOAZCATS.com, 178569=Game 4: What Now? \u2014 10/2/2008, from USCFootball.com, 177779=Oregon Preview: Defense \u2014 11/13/2008, from GOAZCATS.com, 64403=The Latest: Practice Report: Session No. 5 \u2014 4/8/2009, 181303=Rivals.com All-Pac-10 Team \u2014 12/9/2006, from Rivals.com College Football, 177613=Simulation: UA wins exciting game \u2014 11/15/2008, from GOAZCATS.com, 176701=Byrd declares for NFL draft \u2014 1/16/2009, from Duck Sports Authority, 182157=Jarius Byrd: Strong influences in his life \u2014 2/12/2005, from Duck Sports Authority, 182859=Son of Rams assistant has two offers \u2014 9/21/2004, from OrangeandBlueNews.com, 180589=Ducks find themselves in familiar spot \u2014 10/2/2007, from Rivals.com College Football, 177245=Respect for the D: Coaches not overlooking defense \u2014 12/30/2008, from OStateIllustrated.com, 180955=DSA Interview: Jairus Byrd \u2014 12/19/2006, from Duck Sports Authority, 178721=Dissecting the Ducks \u2014 8/29/2008, from HuskyDigest.com, 180417=Ask the expert Q&A: Oregon Ducks \u2014 11/3/2007, from ASUDevils.com, 177053=Holiday Bowl: Oregon's Kelly willing to wait \u2014 12/30/2008, from Rivals.com College Football, 183039=Eugene NIKE Camp: Top Players By Position \u2014 6/28/2004, from StudentSports.com, 182495=Oregon Ducks land defensive standout \u2014 1/24/2005, from Duck Sports Authority, 181649=Oregon Preview: Defense \u2014 11/16/2006, from GOAZCATS.com, 181808=First Look: Oregon Ducks \u2014 11/13/2006, from GOAZCATS.com, 182343=Byrd to fly west \u2014 1/24/2005, from Rivals100.com, 176181=Unit #4: Defensive back \u2014 3/6/2009, from Duck Sports Authority}",
