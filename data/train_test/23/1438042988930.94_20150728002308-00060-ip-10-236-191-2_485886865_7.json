The presence of a substoichiometric amount of halide anions has a significantly favourable effect in that the conversion reaction proceeds at high rate, even at moderate temperatures. By \u201csubstoichiometric\u201d is understood that less halide anions are present than required to neutralise the palladium cations, i.e. that the molar ratio of dissociated halide anions versus palladium cations is less than 2:1. It has surprisingly been found that when the catalyst system comprises a tertiary carboxylic acid and a substoichiometric amount of halide anions, even further improved catalyst activity can be obtained, resulting in surprisingly high reation rates., 37165=These ligands can be prepared as for example described in M. D. Fryzuk et al., J.Am. Chem. Soc., 1977 (Vol.99), p. 6262-2667)., 41585=The presence of other acids, such as for example a linear carboxylic acid as pentanoic or pentenoic acid, can have a disadvantageous effect on the catalyst activity. Therefore the tertiary carboxylic acid is preferably present in a molar ratio of at least 2:1 with regard to any other acid present, and more preferably a molar ratio of at least 5:1., 51674=The quantity of, for instance in-situ prepared, carboxylic acid used in the carbonylation reaction can vary within wide ranges. The amount of acid preferably ranges between 0.1 and 40 wt. %, more preferably between 0.5-10 wt. % and most preferably between 1 to 8 wt. % (based on the total reactor mixture). Preferably, the amount of acid ranges from 0.1 mole to 1000 mole of acid per mole of palladium cation. If halide anions are present, the molar ratio of dissociated halide anions versus palladium cations is preferably in the range from 0.001:1 up to 1.5:1, more preferably in the range from 0.001:1 to 0.5:1., 49882=The molar ratio of hydroxyl group containing compound to conjugated dienes, in particular butadiene, can vary between wide limits and suitably lies in the range of 0.1:1 to 10:1, more suitably from 1:1 to 6:1. Generally a molar ratio near the higher limit of this range favours the preparation of diesters and a molar ratio near the lower limit of this range favours the preparation of mono-esters., 26450=This application is the National Phase of International Application PCT/NL01/00709 filed Sep. 26, 2001 which designated the U.S., which claims priority to European application 00203356.1, filed Sep. 27, 2000 and application 00203355.3, filed Sep. 27, 2000., 50300=The palladium concentration in the reaction mixture is preferably as high as possible because the rate of reaction per unit of reactor volume will be higher. The upper limit will normally be determined by the solubility of palladium in the reaction mixture. The upper limit can be determined by one skilled in the art. Preferably, the amount of palladium is between 400 and 4000 ppm and more preferably between 800 and 1200 ppm.}",
