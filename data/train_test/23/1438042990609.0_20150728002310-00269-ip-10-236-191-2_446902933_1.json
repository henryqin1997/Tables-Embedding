But the last few of those years haven't been kind. Since 2003, Nygren's and Grant's picks have trailed both the S&P and category peers. However, the beaten-down stocks they favor have staged a rally during Mr. Market's 2008 tantrum; Oakmark is up nearly four percentage points on the broader market year to date, and outpacing category peers by even more than that., 23247=Tim Beyers first began writing for the Fool in 2003.

This strikes me as a pretty strong portfolio. Even with Intel's suspiciously coy guidance, for example, the chip maker's growth easily outpaced that of rival Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD\u00a0\u00a0) in the latest quarter. CAPS investors are betting that will continue. Of the 44 who've rated Intel since Friday, only two believe the stock will underperform. AMD has its own fans, of course, but many are placing faith in the firm's cash-burning ATI unit.
