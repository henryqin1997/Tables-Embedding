Transcend's industrial type CompactFlash\u00ae (CF) Memory Cards are specially designed and engineered to withstand higher temperatures and the more severe environmental conditions, which can be experienced in industry. Transcend Information, Inc., a company always at the cutting edge and a world leader in flash memory cards, has increased the capacity of its Ultra performance industrial type CF Memory Card to an incredible 8GB, currently the highest capacity industrial CF Card in the world. Transcend's industrial type CF Memory Cards are thoroughly tested to comply with the most popular digital cameras, storage products and industrial devices. Ultra performance and the ability to work in the most demanding environments with an extended operating temperature range of -40\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C (normal CF Card ranges 0\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C) makes Transcend's industrial type CF Cards (128MB ~ 8GB capacities) the perfect choice when performance is required in extreme temperatures. Transcend insists on only using original SLC (Single-Level-Cell) NAND Flash chips in our industrial CF Memory Cards to achieve higher write",
