The mode in the message indicates which mode the command belongs to, these same mode values are used in the mode switching command below. Request/Response Structure The connections uses a standard 8N1 serial protocol. The original speed rate is 19200 baud - higher rates (up to 57600 baud) work properly (tested the 5G) but make trouble sending large amounts of data (picture blocks) faster than 38400 baud. The Honda Music Link communicates at 9600 baud. The Apple Accessory Protocol is used for communication between the iPod and serially connected accessories (such as the Remote, iTalk, Honda Music Link etc). The protocol was introduced with the 3rd generation iPods, and at present it is assumed is also compatible with the 4th generation iPods and mini iPods.

Voice Memo (Mode 1) The Mode 1 commands are used for the voice recording functions. To initiate the recording mode on the iPod the send the switch to mode 0x01 command - this will switch the iPod display to the \"Voice Memo\" screen. When the record button is pressed the iPod will send the command \"0x00 0x00\", sending the command to switch to mode 0x01 will start the actual recording.
