    "textBeforeTable": "A tariff average measures the average level of nominal tariff protection. There are two types of tariff averages: a simple average and a trade weighted average. The example below illustrates how those two types of tariff averages are calculated. Average (Tariff) See Statutory Duty Autonomous Duty Goods are differentiated (imperfect substitutes) by exporting country. This assumption is used in the SMART model included in WITS in order to avoid a big bang solution. Armington Preferences Shortcut used in WITS to select all trade partners. When All Partners\u009d is selected, WITS returns one row of information for each and every partner. All Partners U.S. legislation providing duty-free access for a large number of products for 35 African economies. AGOA (African Growth and Opportunities Act) See Product Aggregate Aggregate An ad valorem equivalent is the equivalent in percentage of a specific duty, mixed, compound or other duty containing a specific element. An ad valorem equivalent is calculated for each customs duty that is not ad valorem. The AVE is calculated from the actual duty collection or from the unit value of imports. For example, the AVE of a specific duty of $1.00 per KG levied on a product with a unit value of $10.00 per KG is equal to 10% ($1.00/$10.00). Ad Valorem Equivalent (AVE)",
    "textAfterTable": "B Backward Conversion Consists of converting information from a given nomenclature to an older one. Backward conversion is generally safer (than upward conversion) since the destination nomenclature is made of fewer lines. The conversion mostly consists of line aggregation and reduction of the product structure. Binding See Tariff Binding. Binding Coverage Statistical measure defined as the number of bound lines divided by the total number of tariff lines. Binding Overhang Often used to describe a situation where there is a large difference between the tariff that is actually applied (MFN Applied) and the level at which the tariff is bound in GATT (the ceiling'). Border Tax Adjustment Fiscal measure compensating, in whole or in part, for the different treatment either between imports and similar domestic products or between exports and similar products sold on the domestic market. For example, refunds of domestic indirect taxes on goods destined for export; or changes on imports similar to the taxes levied on like domestic products. Also see Duty Drawback. Bound See Tariff Binding Breakdown Used in WITS when a region (group of countries) is used to produce individual information for each and every country belonging to that region. C Cairns Group",
