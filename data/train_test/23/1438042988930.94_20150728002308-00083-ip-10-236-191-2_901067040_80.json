            "as long as you walk in groups late at night, or use 624-walk, you'll be safe. the residents halls are very safe. there are just some areas of campus that you need to be smart about.",
            "greek life is a big part of homecoming but doesn't overwhelm campus activities at all.",
            "there is literally a club for anything and everything someone could be interested in. and if there isn't, you can start your own!",
            "no matter who we are playing in a sporting event the cheer goes, who hates iowa?! we hate iowa! as an out of state student from iowa, this takes some getting used to.",
            "there are many colleges that do not cost as much as the u but don't have the same opportunities that it does. living in the dorms is where you don't necessarily get a lot of bang for your buck because meal plans are so expensive and you have to have one.",
            "the twin cities has so many things to do for fun and campus is very close to downtown so everything is only a short bus ride away. there are also things to do on campus every weekend and most week nights.",
            "know what you want to do before coming to college if at all possible. the sooner you have a plan the better, but there are plenty of resources to help you out if you are still unsure.",
            "the uofm is one of the biggest universities in the nation. it is also located in one of the biggest cities. because of this there are so many opportunities available to students and it the individual colleges and small class sizes keep it from feeling too big."

However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majors\u00e2??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum. This building stands out from any other building on campus because of its postmodern architecture. It was just reopened in the fall of 2011 after it underwent a major expansion project. The museum now has many more works of art on display than it ever had before., 929488=I'd definitely give the University a 9.5 out of 10. I've actually been living here since the beginning of June and honestly I feel welcomed everyday I'm here. The University of Minnesota is full of fun, energetic, and friendly people that make up the rate 9.5, 347397=just a warning: the light rail won't be done until 2015 which blocks off all of washington ave., 770830=There's lots of cheap dates. There's a telescope on the physics building that is free to use after 8 o'clock and they show free movies in one of the buildings before the movies come out on video., 1062419=There are crime alerts that go on and it is very convenient that the university will text you on your phone and email you. Also you can call someone walk with you at night if you feel unsafe, you just call an escort. In addition there is the Gopher Chauffeur that takes calls till 2:00 AM., 929067=If you want to get into the University of Minnesota feel proud. The U of MN had 43,000 applicants for the incoming class of 2017, and only 5500 applicants were accepted. Definitely take your application seriously and meet every deadline.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students The U of M is a school for every type of student. Seriously, it might sound cliche, but whether you are all about studying and keeping the grades up in hopes to go far, or are just testing the waters and taking some classes, coming back from years off of school, or just winging it... there are a million more students just like you and life on and around campus has stuff for everyone :) Tips for prospective students I was so scared as an incoming freshman, because nobody from my high school or town lived in the cities, so I thought I would never meet anyone. Believe me, when you get to school it is so easy to meet and get along with everyone on campus, and you can't let yourself worry for one second. Everyone is in the exact same boat as you are, and it will all go way more smoothly than you might be scared of. So just don't worry and have fun with it, because it is a serious step in life, but the U of M makes it so much fun and so easy to meet people, and you won't be alone at all, because you'll make such good friends even the first day you're on campus!
