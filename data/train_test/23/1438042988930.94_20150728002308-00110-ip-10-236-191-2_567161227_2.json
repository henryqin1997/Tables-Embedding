Profile information lists the test performed, inclusive of the test fee, when a profile is ordered and includes reporting names and individual availability.

This includes reflex and additional tests. If IgA is age-specified normal, then tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA will be performed at an additional charge. If tTG IgA is equivocal, then endomysial antibodies IgA and deamidated gliadin antibody IgA will be performed at an additional charge. If IgA is > or =1.0 mg/dL but lower than age-specified normal, then tTG IgA, tTG IgG, deamidated gliadin IgA, and deamidated gliadin IgG will be performed at an additional charge. If IgA is below detection (<1.0 mg/dL), then tTG IgG and deamidated gliadin IgG will be performed at an additional charge. \u00a0 The following algorithms are available in Special Instructions: -Celiac Disease Comprehensive Cascade -Celiac Disease Diagnostic Testing Algorithm -Celiac Disease Gluten-Free Cascade -Celiac Disease Routine Treatment Monitoring Algorithm -Celiac Disease Serology Cascade Special Instructions and Forms Describes specimen collection and preparation information, test algorithms, and other information pertinent to test.
