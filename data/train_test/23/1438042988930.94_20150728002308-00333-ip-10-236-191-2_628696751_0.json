That implies that up until that point it could be easily removed. Also, @badmouthsadmouth Totally agreed on all accounts (although, SPOILER, I rather liked Phantoon as the final boss. He fit really well into the atmosphere) I'm playing the Prime games now and...wow. The art direction is just so above Other M. Don't get me wrong, Other M has some very cool environments and enemy designs, but Retro's sci-fi environments trump pretty much all other sci-fi environments--in any medium.

I know it's not going to happen, but I believe it's what should happen. They've already said they're going to carry the story forward and of course Samus is going to be the star. I don't care for reboots personally, but I like the idea of letting another character star or co-star. What I'd prefer most of all though would be for a completely different story / universe with just a similar concept. Video games are way too obsessed with sequels, which is weird when story is not really the biggest drawing point in the first place, so why draw them out, I don't understand. Edit: In regards to the second post, sounds like silliness. He approved the Prime games in the conceptual phase. It's not like he was surprised by what they had to offer. Not that I'd care if it were true. I don't like Prime much and don't care all that much about what's canon or not. Metroid: The Life of Anthony The cover can have him saying \"Remembuh me?\".",

I never had an issue with the gamecube control layout (which most people did) but it never feels as slick as Other M or any of the 2D games. Another thing Other M has going for it is that it doesn't have any filler. As good as the Prime games are, they all have some BS scavenger hunt toward the end in an attempt at lengthening the game. I'd gladly give up a few hours of pointless backtracking if it meant I'd have a more all-around enjoyable game. Other M didn't have any of that--front-to back, I'd say its one of the stronger Metroids in terms of pacing.",

While I don't agree with him, I understand that a lot of people are upset about the first attempt to TRULY personify Samus Aran. However, it doesn't really stand to make claims, like this dude does, that the character we see in Other M is \"out of left-field.\" Samus has never been given a voice and a backstory, so what basis for comparison is there? Just because YOU thought Samus was an impossible bad doesn't mean her creator pictured her like that, or she was ever meant to really be perceived as such. I think that was the main idea that went into the original revealing of Samus as a girl. Originally, like back back in the day, none of us were really sure if she was even human, and then, upon beating the game, we found out the truth. And it wasn't surprising because she was a woman, not a man, it was surprising because there was a girl behind all that armor and weapons. It made your reexamine the whole adventure you had just partaken in. There was someone feeling and thinking through that entire game, not some emotionless robot just doing work.

Posted: Tue 21st Sep 2010 03:20 BST right. when people say \"they ruined samus' character\" i have to wonder, \"what character?\" she was a blank slate just the same as link and mario with no defined personality until fusion came along and laid out some of her history with adam. this game builds on that story that was begun nearly a decade ago and it does it pretty well at that, so it's not like the person we're seeing in other m is a total surprise. http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/metroidotherm/video/627654... new interview here with.... he addresses the backlash and it's very interesting to hear him talk about his motivations for the story. he says that every metroid fan has their own image of samus, which as we know now is very true, and he didn't think that was a good thing for the series in the long run. he wanted to define her character across the board and get everyone on the same page about who she is, which of course is going to be a noisy chaotic mess, but in his opinion it had to be done.

I think a big thing of the piece is that she identified Samus as a strong, typical gender-role-defying protagonist, but Other M ruptured that identification for her (which i don't necessarily agree with, but as i said i'm not in the best position to judge from that perspective).",

I can see why people might be off-put by this game, but I'm playing Fusion now, and I've got to say--it's pretty consistent. Nothing in that game makes Samus out to be a bad bounty hunter. It's all introspective, somewhat whiny, and, when referring to the baby Metroid, quite maternal. I just don't see why people think it's inconsistent if they've really played every game in the series.
