The Foxes took the lead halfway through the first half when Iain Hume waltzed through the Canaries defence almost untouched and slid the ball under David Marshall in the visitor's goal. Steve Howard doubled Leicester's advantage on 57 minutes after a big boot from the back was completely missed by the City defence, allowing Steve Howard to tuck the ball away at the far post after Jason Shackell had eventually wheezed his way into view. But if the shocking defending for both goals didn't give Glenn Roeder's side enough of a mountain to climb, Darel Russell's red card for a challenge that forced Leicester's Richard Stearman leaving the game on a stretcher certainly did. And by the time DJ Campbell beat the offside trap to make it 3-0 with thirteen minutes to play and Stephen Clemence made it 4-0 five mintues later, the 3,000 City supporters who made the journey would have long since wondered if they had made a wasted trip.
