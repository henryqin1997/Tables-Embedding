    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Campus Safety just read what i said above. i had to leave for safety issues. i dont really care if people rate my comments badly. this is seriously for the people who really want to know what this college is like. Clubs and Activities there are a ton to choose from. but they don't do anything usefull for the most part. it is mostly ra-ra we are happy christians sort of thing. Great for these types of students holigans Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus the ras told my roommate secret places on campus to smoke..... Bang for the buck don't feel special if you get a scholarship. everyone does. you will still pay way to much to go to this supposed christian college. i actually became less of a christian while attending csu. What to do for fun wannamaker park is down the street. and there is a mall about 10 min away. beaches are anywhere from 30-50 min away. isle of palms is the cleanest and best. night life in downtown charleston is scary.",
