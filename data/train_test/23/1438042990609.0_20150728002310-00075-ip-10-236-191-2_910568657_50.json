            "Almost unheard of if your a commuter and you missed the club day on the quad good luck finding them after that.",
            "Very good nursing program and art students just got a new building.",
            "The anchor on the quad is said to bring luck if you rub it.",
            "Its the cheapest 4 year school in the state. Thats pretty self explanatory.",
            "Well the school is basically in the middle of no where in a street where there's a highschool, a middle school, and an elementary school (so good luck with traffic when schools let out). In the school itself theres not much to do except the recreation building which you pay for anyway whether you use it or not so might as well. The 92 bus conveniently has a stop there so you can hop on that and it will take you to downtown providence where theres a mall, waterfires, ice skating in the winter, and a whole lot of restaurants.",
            "Food is not the best. It isnt buffet style, more like every thing is separate and you pay for what you can afford. The best things are the quesadillas but even that gets boring after a while. The salad bar is also nice.",
            "Like I said, most people commute including myself so I have no idea how dorm life is like.",
            "It is essentially high school part 2 depending on how much you care and what professor you have. Some are really difficult and blunt and actually care about you turning in the assignment and being in class. Oh yeah attendance usually damages your grade here so try not to miss more than 2.",
            "Not in the slightest difficult to get in unless you really didnt care in high school at all. It's nice if you have extracurriculars and possibly a job because it shows that you like to get involved. If you end up going here and happen to commute, the best spot to sit and take a nap or just relax in between long hours before the next class is in the alex and ani second floor lounge.",
            "Cheapest school in the state and pretty much an alternative to URI. Not as bad as people make it out to be, a lot of people are here because of financial reasons. Most people commute so its difficult to make friends and get involved otherwise."

I came from NH and usually travelled back home every weekend. This may have changed, but from 2005-2009 it was mostly commuter students attending., 197961=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 97765=free period on Wednesdays between 12:30 and 1. the students get a break from classes to have fun. Each Wednesday there is something else going on in the quad., 75585=I don't recall any greek life at Rhode Island College. This may have changed since 2009 though!, 112412=Rhode Island College does not have a great dorm life, being that oct of the students are commuters, there are few students who live on campus. The dorms are not that great either, but with the right friends you can still have a blast. If you are looking for a party school this is not the school for you., 172611=Pick classes that will fit into your schedule but also times that are appropriate for yourself. From my experience, my first semester I chose a 8:00 A.M. Monday-Thursday however I am not a morning person so it reflected my ability to focus in class. As long as you pay attention in class, the work is not that hard. Papers are usually given ahead of time so its best not to procrastinate and leave for last minute. Good luck to those who think about attending!, 11050=I started school at Rhode Island College in August, and from then on it has been a period of discovery. The resources available on campus are great, and everyone is so helpful. Although the tuition is inexpensive in comparison to other schools, parking is constantly crowded. This is a minor setback when your talking about getting a good educational experience. Socially, there are a lot of clubs and organizations you can join. Overall RIC gets 5 stars in my book.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck It's definitely a cheap school money wise and you do get a lot for your money although the freshmen dorms are disgusting and leave a lot to be desired but that is to be expected from such an inexpensive school. The food isn't great either. Am enjoying being here There is never anything of real interest going on on campus until the end of the year. The clubs are geared toward very specific groups of people and none seem interesting, personally. Everyone here is from Rhode Island so if you're coming in from out of state, prepare to be excluded and feel alone. I'm a really social person and everyone here seems to have a way of shutting out anyone who they didn't know before college. I hate being here almost 100% of the time. Am learning a lot I'm just finishing my first year at RIC and the best part of school has been the classes which is not what I wanted in the college experience. Some professors are helpful while others are rude and awful. Login to rate or flag the reviews Ashley from",
