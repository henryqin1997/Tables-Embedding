The construction may cause a bit of a mess in terms of parking but the new nursing building will be beautiful., 419723=TIP do not over take any classes, you will fail, it's not like highschool, take your education seriously since you're paying for it, it's a different life in college, it's difficult and not financially stable at times if you don't have everything sorted out, I didn't which is making things difficult, I don't even know if I'm getting the education I want for upcoming semester of Spring 2014. Do not procrastinate in turning in your FAFSA, make sure you talk to a counselor, do not be shy, it's your future, your goals, and your career you're wanting here. I wish I WOULD'VE done all of those things. I WOULD'VE been on track and not slipping back., 21590=I started here in the fall of 2010 and currently still attending. Long Beach City college it's a really good school with the most helpful teachers. The staff are great as well and everyone is friendly. It has a really good learning environment and plenty of sources for you to succeed.}",

Don't stop playing sports if you loved them in High School, or if you did not do so well back then. Now is your chance to redeem yourself. Tips for prospective students If you're just getting ready to become a part of Long Beach City College, or any college for that matter, I would suggest that you take your most challenging courses first. Doing this will help you speed through school by staying in your high school mode. Take summer school classes because they usually have less homework and are a lot faster than taking a full length class. Pace yourself like a runner. Push hard in the summer, stride in the Fall, and build up momentum in the Spring. Bang for the buck",
