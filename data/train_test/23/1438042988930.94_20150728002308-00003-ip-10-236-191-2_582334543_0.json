JOB EVALUATION The Job Family 3 Job Evaluation Plan is made up of 6 compensable factors (education and experience requirements, supervisory responsibility, skill, complexity and technical mastery, budgetary control, work environment and physical demands, and work impact and effect) and can be found by clicking here or on the link on the left side of the page. Each of the compensable factors contains 3 to 13 different levels, and as the levels increase, more of that factor is demanded by a job, and more points are awarded. All jobs were evaluated by a job evaluation committee on each of the compensable factors. Distributed User Support Specialists and Instructional Technology Support Specialists were individually interviewed by students in Dr. Steve Thomas\u2019 Management 546 (Compensation Management) class to gather information about the job duties of these positions.\u00a0The compensation team updated those two job descriptions based on this information and any information provided by supervisors about the job duties of those two jobs. DUSS and ITSS Job descriptions must be accurate in order for the jobs to be evaluated properly and placed into appropriate pay grades.\u00a0With the exception of two jobs, Distributed User Support Specialists (DUSS) and Instructional Technology Support Specialists (ITSS), job description review was conducted by the unit",
