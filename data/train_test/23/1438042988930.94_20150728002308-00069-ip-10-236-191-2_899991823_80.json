            "Three tips i would give prospective students would be one keep track of your syllabus and due dates. second would be get familiar with your professors they are there to help you succeed. Thirdly would be stick with your major i know a lot of time you get into something a class start to get tough and you change your major instead of getting help from professors and tutors but if you keep changing your major you're only going to be in school longer and waste more money doing it.",

I have mixed feelings about CSU due to my personal academic experiences. I believe that money is more important than the students, at CSU., 478833=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 425748=If you're starting out as a freshman prepare to be in debt! Fall and Spring semesters cost around $5000 for a full-time schedule. That doesn't include books, food, supplies, and every other educational expense. I transferred from a community college where a full-time semester cost about $1200-$1500. CSU also has University partnership programs with some community colleges. You attend CSU classes through the community college and it's cheaper., 219755=The Penthouse 2011-2012}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students -City-lovers -Adventure-lovers -Commuters -Those who want to be close to home Another thing to remember about college - you get out of it what you put in. You make the experience. Tips for prospective students Like stated above, APPLY EARLY for scholarships and to the Honors/Scholars program. I am in the Scholars program and they have lots of counseling and advice available if needed. Just remember this, the faculty at Cleveland State University is ready to help YOU. If any of you have questions, just e-mail/message me and I'll try to help out as best as I can. Good luck with everything! Bang for the buck Other than the school having a great learning environment, it has a lower tuition than most schools out there. While this wasn't the main factor that pulled me into the school, it definitely helps that you and your family won't have to worry as much about getting money for school. On top of that, the scholarships that are available are abundant. One word of advice with all of the scholarships though - APPLY EARLY! Being early with things, especially when it comes to academics, is one of the best things to do. Am enjoying being here",
