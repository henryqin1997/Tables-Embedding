            "Our campus is very safe, there are rarely any instances of theft or of that sort. The campus even feels safe to walk around at the dead of night, even though you should be cautious because people from the neighboring neighborhoods like to walk around campus for exercise.",
            "We do not have a greek life, no fraternities or sororieties",

            "We have Winter Cotillion right before you leave for finals and such, it's a winter dance where you do Ballroom Dancing. We have Charity week where we pick a charity to donate all this money to and have fun activities like a jail and such. In the Spring we have Spring Formal, a normal dance you probably had in high school and we celebrate Groundhog's Day with a big outdoor concert with smores and burgers and it's a unique tradition.",
            "Downtown Dallas and downtown Fort Worth are just a few minutes drive away and there is plenty to do there. The DART is available for Dallas. Also, many upperclassmen are willing to drive you somewhere if you are going to the same place. There are also field trips that are organized throughout the semester, nearly every week to do different things like ice skating, to painting, to concerts and more.",
            "As always, cafeteria food is cafeteria food so always be careful what you eat and enjoy yourself. You will get tired of the food regardless of where you go.",
            "The University of Dallas is a strong and highly academic school, which focuses on a basic core curriculum for all students to go through in order to become a more rounded individual. This school is a Catholic university but it is not necessary to be Catholic to attend because the school prides itself on the diversity of the students from all around the world with different religions and other views."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students UD embraces many different types of students, but most share a love of learning. If you are - curious - want to learn about more than just your major through the Core Curriculum - want to spend a semester abroad in Italy - are a Catholic looking for a supportive, moral environment - want a small school with small class sizes - love a good challenge, then you should definitely consider the University of Dallas. UD has very strong Biology, Theology, and Philosophy programs, and is a good choice for those who would like to go on to law or medical school. It\u2019s also a very good place for science majors who want a liberal arts education while still learning the technical information required by their chosen field. Tips for prospective students If you're a prospective student, the best thing you can do is visit the campus. It's what convinced me to attend UD, and I know many other students who had a similar experience. If you do attend UD, then DO: - Go to Rome. UD has a campus in Due Santi (just outside Rome), and students often attend school in Italy for an entire semester during the Sophomore or Junior year. More information about the program can be found here: http://www.udallas.edu/aboutus/offices/advancement/giving/givingopportunities/rome - Visit Campus Ministry. The people there are the most",
