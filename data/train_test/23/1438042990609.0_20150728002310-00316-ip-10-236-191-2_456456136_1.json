Worrell, and the first to be released direct-to-video. This motion picture is also the only film in the Ernest film series not to be directed by John R. Cherry III. This was Will Sasso's first film role. Its opening theme is \"Hail to the Muskrats!\" which was the alma mater. It is the second \"Ernest\" movie to be filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Like Ernest Saves Christmas, it does not have an antagonistic character. [ - ]}",
