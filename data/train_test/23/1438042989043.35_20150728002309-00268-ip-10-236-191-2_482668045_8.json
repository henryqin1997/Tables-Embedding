No. 4,743,022 to Michael Wood, 1988, discloses a poker game which can be played on a computer video output screen gaming machine or as a table game. At the start of the game, the player makes a first wager and receives five cards, which constitutes a first hand. As is known to those skilled in the art, five-card poker hands are ranked, for competitive purposes, according to the following order from lowest to highest: (1) High Card in Hand; (2) One Pair; (3) Two Pair; (4) Three of a Kind; (5) Straight; (6) Flush; (7) Full House; (8) Four of a Kind; (9) Straight Flush; (10) Royal Flush; (11) Five of a Kind (which is possible only if a joker is used). Then each player may discard up to five cards and receive five new cards to form a second hand. The player loses the first wager if the second hand (or the first hand when no cards are discarded) does not have a pair. The player receives the wager back if the hand has a pair. The player receives a payout which exceeds the first wager in accordance with the posted odds if the hand is of higher order than a pair. The player is also entitled to make a second wager and to receive a sixth card. A five-card third hand having the highest possible ranking is then formed by combining the newly dealt card and any four of the five cards in the second hand. If the third hand is ranked lower than a straight and is of lower order than the second hand, the player loses the second wager. However, if the third hand has a ranking of a straight or greater and is of higher order than the second hand, the player wins an amount which depends on the second wager and the posted odds., 29836=There are a wide variety of poker games available to players in private games, club games, casino table games and video gaming equipment. In casino video gaming equipment, the easiest format to work with comprises variants of five-card draw poker. This game is played in a video gaming format with many variations, for example, by having five cards dealt to a player. The player selects his best cards (e.g., the cards most likely to provide a highly ranked hand when the player discards and draws replacement cards), discards unneeded cards, and then draws replacement cards. The objective in these video games is generally to achieve the best possible hand, according to conventional poker hand rankings, with hands of various ranks being awarded payouts that are multiples (usually with limits from about 1:1 to about 4000:1) of the wager. The game has such a readily appreciated ease of understanding and play that the format has been highly successful. Common variants of this game include games where deuces within the playing deck are wild, jokers added to the playing deck are wild, multiple mixed decks are used for the dealing of hands, extra bonuses are provided for unique hands, and the like. These variations in the rules are still readily understood and add variety to the basic pure game of five card draw.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The method of the present invention is suitable for a wide variety of card games, including games in which players play against the dealer, (Caribbean Stud\ufffd poker, Pai Gow poker, Three Card poker\u2122, and Blackjack), games in which the players compete against each other (i.e., poker), and for resolving side bet games (e.g., Pairs Plus bets in three card poker, the bonus bet in Let It Ride\ufffd, and a bonus bet in Caribbean Stud\ufffd poker). For a side bet game, the wild card can be used to score a base game, the side bet or both. When the method is used to score a side bet, the game can pay a proportional or progressive payout for combinations of the above. The wild card may be used in a wide variety of games as indicated herein. The wild card may also be used in games where payouts are determined by hand evaluations other than just ranks of hands, as in draw or stud poker games. Fore example, payouts may be determined on the basis of the value or numerical totals of hands, such as Blackjack, 7\ufffd and 21\ufffd, Over/Under, and the like. In Let It Ride\ufffd (registered trademark of Shuffle Master Gaming, Inc.) Poker, it would also be advantageous to have the display card that determines the Wild Card turned face-up after the first election to retain or withdraw the first bet amount is made, but",
