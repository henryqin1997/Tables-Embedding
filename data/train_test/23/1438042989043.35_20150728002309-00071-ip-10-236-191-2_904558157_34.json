            "The campus is extremely safe. It is located in a small town and the campus is relatively small located within. Campus security is also available all the 24/7.",
            "Great for students who are really focused on their academics and want to go to college for that reason.",
            "A lot of things happen on campus: join a club, intermural sports, varsity sports, greek life. In Meadville there are two movie theaters, a bowling alley, and plenty of restaurants. Just a short trip away in Erie there is all of that plus much more including a large mall.",
            "Allegheny has a large all you can eat dining hall and a pay as you go style type of dining. There are many different choices at both dining locations that will satisfy even the pickiest student.",
            "The dorms are nothing special, but they serve the intention of housing all of their students and immersing them in a community. The friendships you form in your dorm help you feel immersed in the college.",
            "You will be challenged in this school. Allegheny prides itself in the fact that their academics are top notch and students will receive a prestigious degree.",
            "Allegheny is a great school for those looking to be challenged in the classroom and receive a prestigious degree. Study hard, work hard, but never forget that one of the great things about college is just having fun. Chose the college that fits everything that you want, you will experience different atmospheres and pick the one that you feel most comfortable in.",
            "Allegheny is a rigorous academic college that challenges students to excel inside the classroom. While the school promotes academics, there are plenty of options for just having fun as well, including division 3 varsity sports. The campus itself is gorgeous and everyone I have met is incredibly nice and helpful."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Students who are interested in pre-med, students who do not mind living in a small town, and students who understand that studying is a top priority would do fine at Allegheny. Tips for prospective students Visit the campus; talk to the professors, but do not be wooed by the admission staff, because when you get into Allegheny you won't see these people very often, and them knowing your name and where your from will not really matter. Also I would not suggest staying over night, since it does not give you the true experience of living on your own. Bang for the buck Allegheny has a trustees scholarship that is very helpful, and most students get some sort of scholarship. But even with the scholarships, I feel that Allegheny is a little too expensive, and the financial aid department is not very helpful at times. Am enjoying being here Allegheny provides many opportunities to learn inside and outside the classroom. Right now I am part of a volunteer group that is based on campus, but helps the individuals within the community. Most of the students are open and nice, however there are some who seem to be here for the wrong",
