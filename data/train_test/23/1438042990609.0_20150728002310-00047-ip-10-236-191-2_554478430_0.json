During those years, Korn has always been known as an innovative, edgy band. 2011 proved to be no different for the Berkeley, Calif. band. \u201cThe Path Of Totality\u201d was released on Dec. 2, 2011. Fans that have followed Korn since the 90s, may have a hard time following the band on this album, as it breaks away from the classic heavy bass and guitar sound to adopt dub-step beats. With collaborations of big name dubstep artists such as Skrillex, Noisia and Kill The Noise, \u201cThe Path\u201d boasted high chart-topping singles., 29680=Jan. 15-21, 2011 For information, call the Betty Ehart Senior Center (BESC) at 662-8920, the White Rock Senior Center (WRSC) at 662-8200 and \u201cDay Out\u201d (adult day care, 8 a.m.-4 p.m.) at 661-0081.
