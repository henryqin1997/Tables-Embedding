Signals were displayed and stored on a PC by a software package (CED Spike 2, version 4). Needle EMG form GC was levelled at > 50uV, off-line to convert the multi-unit analogue EMG signal to a point process, which was then used for subsequent frequency analysis. Concentric needle recordings and level\u00adling were performed so as to avoid contamination of GC signals by volume conduction from TA and movement artefact., 72308=The finding of an abnormal common drive to spinal motoneurones innervating the lower limb in symptomatic patients with DYT1 but not in other forms of leg dystonia should also be placed in context of the other electrophysiological abnormalities identified in dystonia (see Berardelli et al., 1998 for review). Abnormalities in cortical (Ridding et al., 1995; Iko\u00adma et al., 1996), brainstem (Berardelli et al., 1985; Tolosa et al., 1988; Nakashima et al., 1989) and spinal inhibition (Panizza et al., 1990; Deuschl et al., 1992) have been found in dystonia, but these too cannot alone be responsible for the abnormal movement pattern as they may be seen outside of the clinically involved area, and, like the 4-7 Hz drive, may not be limited to patients with dystonia (Berardelli et al., 1998). However, these abnormalities of inhibition do not serve to distinguish different aetiological forms of dystonia., 45075=Analysed record lengths were kept constant at 200 s for all muscles and all tasks. Sig\u00adnals were down-sampled to 1 kHz and EMG was rectified. Rectification emphasises tremor peaks in spectra (Fig 1 F) and accentuates firing rate information, thereby improving EMG-EMG coherence estimates (Myers et al., 2003). The discrete Fourier transform and para\u00admeters derived from it were estimated as outlined in chapter II by dividing the records into a number of disjoint sections of equal duration (1024 data points)., 53452=The averaged transformed EMG-EMG coherence in TA is illustrated in Fig. 4.2B. Again, the spectra are dominated by a distinct peak at 4-7 Hz, only present among sympto\u00admatic DYT1 patients. The remaining groups, including the healthy controls, show a broad band of increased coherence over 8-30 Hz. That over the 15-30 Hz band is most likely due to rhythmic synchronised discharging in the corticospinal neurones (see Farmer, 1998; Brown, 2000 for reviews). Fig. 4.2C illustrates individual coherence spectra from a sym\u00adptomatic DYT1 patient. Note that this patient (case 9) only had clinical evidence of leg tre\u00admor during a specific task (extension of the hip and knee, with dorsiflexion of the ankle joint), which occasionally alternated with spasms without tremor. Nevertheless, an abnor\u00admal 4-7 Hz peak was seen regardless of task. None of the individual coherence spectra from asymptomatic DYT1 patients, patients with dystonia due to focal cerebral lesions, patients with fixed dystonia nor healthy controls showed a peak in the 4-7 Hz band.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Table 4.1: Clinical details of the DYT1 gene carriers [page\u00a052\u2193] The 12 symptomatic carriers of the DYT1 gene had generalised dystonia, although in two patients clinical manifestations were exclusively task specific (cases 9 and 10). The four carriers of the DYT1 gene had no clinically apparent involvement (Burke-Fahn-Mars\u00adden scale score = 0; Burke et al., 1985). Some cases were related (cases 2, 3 and 13; cases 6, 9 and 15). The six patients with symptomatic dystonia had cerebral lesions, of whom four had imaging evidence of involvement of the basal ganglia (table 4.2), but only three had major leg involvement. The majority of the 11 patients with fixed dystonia had a hi\u00adstory of peripheral trauma and complex regional pain syndrome (table 4.3). All of the latter patients presented with one leg affected, except case 33 in whom all four limbs were in a fixed dystonic posture. Three of these patients had clinically apparent regular or jerky tre\u00admor. All patients with fixed dystonia were DYT1 gene negative. Frequency analysis of EMG from the lower limb was performed in three groups of pa\u00adtients: 12 symptomatic carriers of the DYT1-gene (5 men, 7 women; mean age 41 yrs, range 21-63 yrs; table 4.1), three patients with symptomatic dystonia due to trauma or in\u00ad[page\u00a051\u2193]farct leading to",
