But I'd prefer to stay rather general on these points and not comment on all the reports and speculation. There are things that we want to do and we've got a couple of weeks to try and improve the team - actually we've got to the end of August - but ideally it would be great if the season was kicking-off and we had a number of players in position. We are working as hard as we possibly can do behind the scenes to improve our squad, which we need to, and that hard work will continue.' Vital Villa asked, were the fans right to boo Gareth Barry at the Walsall game? 62% voted no. 33% yes and 5% weren't fussed either way. Were Villa Fans Right To Boo Gareth Barry? And there are quotes from Martin O'Neill today saying he is fed up with the Gareth Barry saga and although he would like him to stay, wants the situation sorted out one way or the other very soon + he says he might well be in line to play on Saturday v Odense BK: O'Neill Still Wants Gareth Barry To Stay At Villa Press talk for Thursday is pretty short on the ground, apart from the Barry saga we have talk of Brad Friedel's move being held up by Rovers want for a replacement first and also more Shaun Wright Phillips and Younes Kaboul links. Full article: Thursday's Press Talk For Aston Villa Whilst talking about Brad Friedel, who Villa yesterday agreed a fee with Blackburn Rovers for (Blackburn To Lose Friedel ) we have an interview with Vital Blackburn editor Walker, looks like we have a gem on the way! Blackburn Fans 'Gutted' At Brad Friedel Departure The wait is over - Villa's new home kit is now available to buy. Click Here Craig Gardner says the Villa must make sure they finish the job against Odense on Saturday warning that they can't afford to blow the chance of Uefa Cup football next season. 'We can't mess it up now. We worked so hard all last season and now we're so close to qualifying for the UEFA Cup. But Odense are no mugs and we'll give them plenty of respect at Villa Park on Saturday. They came from behind twice last weekend so they won't give up.' Adding on the official site: 'I want to play in European football this season and the rest of the lads are just as determined to get through to the UEFA Cup.' Vital Villan: Season Ticket sales for the coming season are up 7% on this time last year. The Villa faithful, despite transfer concerns, are voting with their bums! After an extraordinary season last campaign, and consistently high gates, the club were confident that fans would respond when it came to season tickets this year, but I doubt even the club predicted a seven per cent increase. Full article: Season Tickets Soar Vital Villan: Ashley Young is at it again, last season all he would talk about was getting into Europe - now he's started on the Top 4 speeches! Speaking on the official site, Young said: 'This really could be the year we break into the top four! We came sixth last season and the next step is to finish in the Champions League places.' Full article: Young - Top 4 Aim Vital Villan: After having a somewhat inconsistent and 'homesick' season, Shaun Maloney is hoping to get the chance to build on his performance against Walsall the other night. Speaking to the official site, he said: 'Fingers crossed I can play a part against Odense. The boys played pretty well in patches in Odense so I think it will be difficult to break into the starting line-up for the second leg. But I`ve done all I can so hopefully the manager knows I`m ready if the call comes. Saturday is a great opportunity to move closer to the UEFA Cup but at the same time we can`t afford to be complacent.'

I guess I could polish my head for a good cause?!??! A close shave for Villa fans? Walsall v Villa pre-season match report by Randy.Stand: Click Here We reported on Tuesday: Martin O'Neill has blasted reports in the press that Villa have bid \u00a35million for Valencia's giant striker Nikola Zigic are totally wide of the mark. In an unusual step, to help quell the rumour, he said: 'There's not a grain of truth in the story that we've put in an offer for the player and I don't know where it's coming from.' Vital Villa asked Which winger would you like to see at Villa Park? Chelsea's Shaun Wright-Phillips came out top with 34%, David Bentley was next up with 21% closely followed by the option to give Maloney a chance, at 18%. Only 3% wanted Aaron Lennon, the rest wanted Wayne Routledge to get a chance. An article by me about the doom and gloom over the transfer window and asking What's Happened To The Villa Money? Nothing! Our latest poll asks when you think the majority of signings will be made by Villa.
