            "The city of Boston is obviously always offering things to do, whether it be a trip to Quincy Market, a walk around the Common, or shopping at the Prudential Center, but BU offers a lot to do, too. Every weekend BU Central (in the basement of the GSU) has some sort of entertainment, and they're always highly publicized. Sporting events are a good time, especially the hockey games, and Fenway is only a short walk off campus for Sox games.",
            "Food at BU is MUCH better than other colleges I visited. Obviously some dining halls were better than others, but the dining hall on West campus was fantastic and I could almost always find something I legitimately wanted to eat. Next year a new dining hall is opening on East campus that should rival (if not beat) West's. BU has great food at the GSU, too. Definitely not the horror stories of some dining halls at other schools.",
            "During my freshman year, I lived in a dorm mostly full of upperclassmen. It made the transition to school exceptionally difficult because a lot of my floormates already had friends and rarely left their suites. My roommate was from Hong Kong, and we had too little in common to be friends. I'd say my dorm life was definitely different from the norm, but I also think it's very hit-or-miss at BU. Some dorms have wonderful reviews and everyone got along; others, like mine, were very antisocial. Every school is going to have floors and halls that don't get along and those that do, but I feel as though I got an exceptionally short end of the stick last year. However, I'm much more content with my housing assignment for next year and can't wait to move in.",
            "BU is very academically rigorous. I was actually shocked by how much harder my classes were than they had been in high school. A's aren't easy to come by but are possible, if you put in the time and effort, go to professors' office hours, and don't wait until the last minute. I find BU classes to be very difficult, but still maintain a high GPA.",
            "Prospective students should definitely look forward to coming to school here, but should keep in mind that nowhere is perfect. As a freshman living in a mostly-upperclassmen dorm, it was much harder than I expected to make friends, but I did meet some amazing people and absolutely cannot wait to get back for my sophomore year. Also, BU is notorious for being extremely academically rigorous - and it really is. Prospective students should keep in mind that easy A's in high school do not equal easy A's in college, but that with patience and work, high grades are still attainable. The hardest transition is learning to balance free time and still get enough sleep and work done.",
            "BU is an incredible school with an outstanding location and amazing opportunities for its students. Sometimes the academics seem nearly impossible, but it only pushes me to work harder. BU is the perfect place to spend four years - it's academically enriching as well as fun, and being in the city provides a whole new sense of independence."

Also, study hard because Boston University accepts mainly AP class kids and 2000 SAT score kids., 40346=As soon as I visited BU on Accepted Students Day in Spring of 2010 I knew I wanted to go here! Ever since it's been perfect. I can absolutely see myself here for the completion of my undergraduate career. The only reason why I'm not really considering it for graduate school is because of the weather - coming from Maine, I'm already sick of the winters. I always say that BU is in its own corner of Boston; if we want to stay only around college peers all we have to do is stay on campus, but there's literally a 5 minute walk to Kenmore Square, 10 minutes to Fenway, and 20 minutes to Newbury St. It's amazing!, 584975=It is what you make of it, Busy schedules don't leave a lot of time for social interaction on the floor. I met my roommate on BU facebook page class of 2017. We chatted for several weeks before we felt we were compatible. We love the same music, books, poetry and we are both science majors. Our floor has monthly meetings, but we haven't had any social outings yet., 548355=The new mean SAT score at BU is 2016, and it's rising every year-- 2013 had an all time low admittance rate of around 30%. It sits right across the river from the mavericks: MIT and Harvard-- and it's doing everything in its power to compete., 612040=Unfortunately, SATs are one of the most important things BU looks at when awarding financial aid. Make sure you score above a 1950 and you'll probably get a merit scholarship., 694949=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608687=There is a huge seal on the ground in Marsh Plaza (located in central campus) that is rumored to hold bad luck (namely, no diploma awarded) for those students who walk over it. After graduation in May, one can see many graduated seniors triumphantly standing on top of it, having their pictures taken., 225778=I love living in Warren Towers. It houses about 1800 students (primarily freshman) and you get that true dorm living lifestyle!, 329832=All dining foods are great. There are special nights in each dormitory where chefs come in and compete. The GSU (student union center) also has good food. There is a new dining place opening fall 2012 with a whole new variety. There are literally tons of good restaurants in nearby Boston that anyone could access although the food may be a little overpriced., 126853=Let this be a cautionary tale for those with tight budgets (or budgets at all...)- This is the only field I can really fill out- I just got accepted here as a transfer student, and I was nominated for a scholarship through my community college. Shortly after my acceptance, however, I received notice of my financial aid assistance. Out of the $50,000+ in tuition and fees, I was eligible to receive only $9,100, which includes the loans they offered me, which is a hole I am not planning on digging for myself. No- I did not receive my scholarship, and I was frankly not expecting to. A scholarship is a gift, a happy surprise. But still - the ONLY need-based aid they were willing to give me was my $2600 Pell Grant! Seriously? Let me give you my background- I am one of four children. We live in a *tiny* condo. Only *one* of my parents works full-time, and his pay schedule is at times unreliable. OK, we do have enough money to eat, be clothed, and have heating and electricity, but still! We don't go on exotic vacations. We do stay-cations in Boston. Or sometimes hop on a bus to NYC to visit my aunt and baby cousins. C'mon. I'm sorry, no matter how great of an academic/social/whatever experience other students have had, this is a big deal-breaker. I kind of hope this some mistake- someone forgot to add an extra zero, or they fell asleep at the calculator. But I am only too sure that I would be so wrong., 352084=You name it they have it. I am into music, accapella and theater groups. However, there are so many to mention. SPLASH, in September, is where they all come together.}",

There is definitely something for anyone as long as you are willing to look. Tips for prospective students Save save save your money and work work work hard! Then you will get the bang for your buck. Bang for the buck Simply put, BU is expensive. Am enjoying being here There is so much to do here! Thousands of students that provide student-led activities as well as the school providing stuff to do. For example, at BU Central, students book bands to come and play for students for FREE! The school also does things for students, like teh parade held last year to honor the hockey team in their national victory. Am learning a lot",
