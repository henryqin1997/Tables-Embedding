Changes may be made in details, particularly in matters of shape, size, material, and arrangement of parts without exceeding the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is as defined within the language of the appended claims. FIG. 16 represents another embodiment of the catheter of the present invention in which the channel 70 extends from the opening 68 through the distal tip of the catheter. In other embodiments, the channel 70 may reach the distal tip of the catheter but not extend through it. This configuration may allow the operator to completely withdraw the catheter without the need for an assistant. FIG. 17A is a cross-sectional view taken along line 17\u201417 of the catheter shaft 32 in FIG. 16, showing the channel 70 having a U-shaped cross-sectional profile. FIG. 17B is a cross-sectional view taken along line 17\u201417 of the catheter shaft 32 in FIG. 16, and showing an alternative embodiment in which the channel 70 includes a C-shaped cross-sectional profile. In one embodiment, a proximal portion of the channel 70 includes a U-shaped cross-sectional profile as shown in FIG. 17A, and a distal portion of the channel 70 includes a C-shaped cross-sectional profile as shown in FIG. 17B. In an alternative embodiment, a proximal portion of the channel 70 includes a C-shaped cross-sectional profile as shown in",
