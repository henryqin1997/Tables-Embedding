            "i have never had any problem with campus safety. in orientation they provided a telephone number to call if you feel unsafe to walk to your car. the campus police are not sparse and are very friendly.",
            "i was really involved in biology club and absolutely loved it. they are really involved and include a great variety of things. i had no problem finding clubs to get into.",
            "great for small town kids who are broke. teachers will take their time with you and make sure you are learning the materials. they really care about their students.",
            "all my credits will transfer to my next college and i will transfer with my associates. tuition is a inexpensive (about 3000 a semester) and you get quite a bit for it.",
            "corsicana does not really have a mall, but they have a good many small shops. they just put in a new movie theatre, and you are about and hour or two away from dallas.",
            "the food is really good and inexpensive! i can get eggs two strips of bacon and two biscuits for five bucks and it actually tastes good. they have a variety of foods that are really inexpensive.",
            "i do not really know because i did not live in a dorm. quite a few of my friends lived in dorms and enjoyed them but dorms are only available at the corsicana campus.",
            "i am working full time and i took sixteen hours last semester. while i did have to forfeit my personal life, i did not spend an outrageous amount of time studying.",
            "get involved with the school. navarro has a great many things to do and a lot of great programs. do not be afraid to dig in to the college culture.",
            "they have good teachers and decent facilities, although i never lived in a dorm. your going to learn a lot and have fun doing it. my only regret is not moving into a dorm instead of living at home."

This year, in the month of March, National Health Month was celebrated by introducing new, healthier food choices in the school's cafeteria. This change was for the interest of those looking for healthier, more vegetarian food choices which is great for a growing college. The college not only hosts a cafeteria, but a deli, as well. Access is simple, fast, and easy. Food portions are aplenty and caters to every culture., 163847=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 106486=I recently visited Navarro College Monday, July 22nd. I loved the tour instructor she was nice, funny, and let me know everything i needed to know about the campus. The school is clean seemed relaxing and like a good environment.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck The teachers are worth it, and so are some of the staff. However, their financial aid department (on the Waxahachie campus) leave much to be desired. They are not very helpful, and they are very matter-of-fact. That would not be a bad thing if they actually helped you and guided you. I am a first generation college attendee, and they gave me no help or guidance. So, for my associate's degree, I had to pay out of pocket. You'll have to learn on your own, or (maybe) go to the Corsicana campus for help. Am enjoying being here I have been to both the Corsicana and Waxahachie campuses for courses. Both of them are very clean, the teachers and administrators are friendly, and they love seeing their students excel. Am learning a lot The teachers I have had, especially in the science and math departments, are very good about teaching you exactly what you need to know. They show interest in the subject that they teach, and they guide you when need be. Login to rate or flag the reviews Anonymous from Corsicana, TX",
