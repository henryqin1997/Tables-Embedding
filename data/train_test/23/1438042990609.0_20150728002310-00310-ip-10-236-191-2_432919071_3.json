They fell slightly in January, which could be the start of a positive trend. As the economy gets stronger, I would expect more people to start looking for work. At this point, the fact remains that there are still 5.8 million missing workers. And, if the missing workers were actively looking for work, the unemployment rate would be 9.0 percent., 311003=As a reminder, the sequester is the result of legislation Congress passed and President Obama signed in 2011. At the time, the discretionary caps and sequester were a bad idea; today they are a bad and dangerous idea. This self-imposed austerity was the major factor in the slow recovery from the Great Recession. Recently, Erskine Bowles, a deficit hawk and co-chair of the 2010 National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (often called Simpson-Bowles) said \u201cI don\u2019t think it gets any stupider than the sequester.\u201d I agree. Let\u2019s hope the president forcefully pushes Congress to end the stupid sequester., 228911=Similarly, we saw a tick up in the employment-to-population ratio for prime-working-age population in January, following a trend that has been slowly moving in the right direction for years. That said, it\u2019s clear that there is a long way to go before we return to pre-recession labor market health., 314631=Today, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released the Employment Cost Index (ECI), a closely watched measure of labor costs, for the last quarter of 2014. Nominal year-over-year compensation for private industry workers rose 2.3 percent, while private sector wages and salaries rose 2.2 percent., 44295=As I\u2019ve written before, a good illustration is provided by U.S. trade with China, which was responsible for nearly half (46.5 percent) of our $736.8 billion goods trade deficit in 2014. Jobs in industries exporting to China did pay well in 2009\u20132011 (the last years for which we have complete wage data)\u2014an average of $872.89 per week, or 10.3 percent more than workers making non-traded goods and services (who earned only $791.14 per week), as shown in the figure below. However, workers in import-competing industries were paid even better\u2014an average of $1,021.66 per week, or 29.1 percent more than workers in non-traded industries., 119305=The hires, quits, and layoffs rates all held fairly steady in the\u00a0December Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey\u00a0(JOLTS). As you can see in the figure below, layoffs shot up during the recession but recovered quickly and have been at prerecession levels for more than three years. The fact that this trend continued in December is a good sign. That said, not only do layoffs need to come down\u00a0before we see a full recovery in the labor market,\u00a0but\u00a0hiring needs to pick up. While the hires rate has been generally improving, it\u2019s still below its prerecession level., 287662=Second, labor force participation. While the unemployment rate continued to fall through 2014, it remains elevated across the population (by age, race, gender, education, sector, occupation)\u2014and even so, it does not reflect the full picture of the labor market. Some of the decline is due to an increase in employment, but some of it is due to a drop in labor force participation. Between November and December 2014, 70 percent of the decline in the number of unemployed people was caused not by workers finding jobs but by people leaving the labor force, or not entering it in the first place., 254334=The BLS revisions to 2014 payroll employment suggest moderately faster growth than initially reported last year, particularly in the last quarter of 2014. If we were to use the highest rate of growth last year\u2014November\u2019s 423,000 jobs added\u2014in each ensuing month, we would return to 2007 labor market health by April 2016, over a year sooner., 22464=The recovery has entered a period of solid job growth. That good news shouldn\u2019t be overstated\u2014if we continue to see 2014\u2019s average rate of job growth, it will still be 2017 before we return to pre-recession labor market health\u2014but the economy has been adding jobs at a respectable clip. However, decent wage growth has yet to be seen., 292902=The White House released its annual budget on Monday for fiscal year 2016. On the one hand, this may seem like a low-value exercise, given the dim prospects for its major initiatives passing a Republican-controlled Congress. But on the other hand, the raft of stories written about it prove the president continues to have unrivaled power in setting the terms of policy debate., 48288=*\u00a0Average wages by education group are from a 3-year pooled sample of workers by industry from 2009\u20132011., 352537=On Monday, we released new estimates of top incomes by state for 2012, based on the work done by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. Coincidentally, Saez just released a preliminary update to 2013 of the national top income time series. Saez\u2019s key finding is that the average income of the top 1 percent in the U.S. fell in 2013 by 14.9%. This decline at the top was large enough to lower overall average incomes in 2013 by 3.2%. The good news is, the bottom 99% saw their earnings climb\u2014but by a very modest and somewhat disappointing 0.2%., 84116=Apple fails to report that its own data shows that labor practices are getting worse in several important areas. In its new report, which covers 2014, Apple says that in 92 percent of cases, the workweeks of the employees in its supply chain fell below its 60 hours per week standard. Apple fails to report that this compliance rate is down from the 2013 compliance rate of 95 percent. In 2014, Apple found that the overall labor rights compliance rate in the area of Health and Safety was 70 percent; it fails to state that this is down from the 2013 compliance rate of 77 percent. Notably, while Apple fails to report prior year data on those issues, which reveal negative trends, the report does provide such data on other topics\u2014those where this year\u2019s data is better than that of prior years., 110960=Note: Because the data are not seasonally adjusted, these are 12-month averages, January 2014\u2013December 2014., 28191=In a report released this week, I found that 2014 continued a 35-year trend of broad-based wage stagnation., 346344=The medical device tax is a small 2.3 percent excise tax on the manufacturer\u2019s price of medical devices. It applies to manufacturers and importers of medical devices. The purpose of the tax is to raise revenue to help offset the costs of the ACA by taxing industries that benefit from health care reform: as reform leads to more people with health insurance coverage, the demand for health care\u2014including medical devices\u2014is likely to rise. The medical device tax became effective on January 1, 2013 and is projected to raise about $3 billion per year, or almost $30 billion over 10 years., 310190=President Obama released his 2016 budget proposal this morning. While president\u2019s budgets are rarely implemented, especially if Congress is controlled by the opposite party, they help to set the agenda for the upcoming legislative year. And this year the president has a great idea that should not be disregarded: ending the sequester., 347648=This appears to be pretty damning evidence against the medical device tax, but how does it square with what really happened? Every year, Ernst & Young (E&Y) issues a report on the financial condition of the industry; the E&Y data come from a variety of sources including company financial reports. E&Y shows that industry revenues increased by 4 percent between 2012 and 2013, R&D spending increased by 6 percent, and employment increased by 5 percent. In the first year of the medical device tax, the industry created over 20,000 jobs! Oh, and profits were up by 32 percent., 77109=Rampant wage theft in the United States is a huge problem for struggling workers. Surveys reveal that the underpayment of owed wages can reduce affected workers\u2019 income by 50 percent or more. Most recently, a careful study of minimum wage violations in New York and California in 2011 commissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) determined that the affected employees\u2019 lost weekly wages averaged 37\u201349 percent of their income. This wage theft drove between 15,000 and 67,000 families below the poverty line. Another 50,000\u2013100,000 already impoverished families were driven deeper into poverty., 22942=From 2013 to 2014, real, inflation-adjusted hourly wages stagnated or fell across the board, with one notable, revealing exception., 223027=Note:\u00a0Volatility in the number of missing workers in 2006\u20132008, including cases of negative numbers of missing workers, is simply the result of month-to-month variability in the sample. The Great Recession\u2013induced pool of missing workers began to form and grow starting in late 2008., 293422=And the terms set by the 2016 budget are really useful., 62441=Source: USCIS I-129 microdata; BLS OES Tables, http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_31084.htm#15-0000; \u00a0SCE workers' average wage from AON Hewitt compensation study, 18232=Judge Hanen\u2019s opinion does not enjoin the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) immigration enforcement priorities or other executive immigration actions announced on November 20, 2014. Only the affirmative application process for deferred action under DAPA and expanded DACA are temporarily halted from getting underway. Yet even if the states ultimately prevail on the merits of their claims, it will only be a temporary victory, because the president has alternative means available to him that are legal and would achieve all or most of the goals of his DACA and expanded DACA initiatives.\u00a0Read more, 91775=A case in point is provided by U.S. trade with China, which was responsible for nearly half (46.5 percent) of our $736.8 billion goods trade deficit in 2014. Jobs in industries exporting to China did pay well in 2009-2011 (the last years for which we have complete wage data)\u2014an average of $872.89 per week, or 10.3 percent more than workers making non-traded goods and services (who earned only $791.14 per week), as shown in the figure below. However, workers in import-competing industries were paid even better\u2014an average of $1,021.66 per week, or 29.1 percent more than workers in non-traded industries., 28642=The figure below shows changes in real hourly wages throughout the wage distribution between 2013 and 2014. What is particularly striking is that almost every decile and the 95th percentile experienced real wage declines from 2013 to 2014, with two exceptions.\u00a0First, there was a very small increase at the 40th percentile wage, up 3 cents, or 0.3 percent. But a more economically significant increase occurred at the 10th percentile where hourly wages were up 11 cents, or 1.3 percent., 120581=Over the year, the quits rate has averaged 1.8 percent, an improvement over its average rate of 1.4 percent in 2009 and 2010. Each consecutive year has seen modest improvement, an average increase in the quits rate of 0.1 percentage points per year. Before long, we should look for a return to pre-recession levels of voluntary quits, which would mean that fewer workers are locked into jobs they would leave if they could., 170742=With the December data, we can also look at what\u2019s happened throughout 2014, compared to the rest of the recovery. The job-seekers-to-jobs-openings ratio has been consistently falling, from a high of 5.9 percent in 2009 down to an average of 2.1 percent average in 2014. The average annual ratio fell 0.8 over the last year., 353250=Illustrating that the top 1 percent really are different from you and me, Saez notes the fall in income at the top is due to high income earners shifting income from 2013 to 2012 in an effort to reduce their tax liabilities in anticipation of higher top marginal tax rates which took effect in 2013. In an earlier EPI analysis in October 2014, Lawrence Mishel and Will Kimball reported on the decline of wages among the top 1 percent of wage earners, which prefigured these results for households. Similarly, Mishel and Kimball also noted the changes in taxes and suggested this decline was probably only temporary., 169789=The number of job openings hit 5.0 million in December, according to this morning\u2019s\u00a0Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary\u00a0(JOLTS)\u2014a slight increase from 4.8 million in November. Meanwhile, according to the Census\u2019s Current Population Survey, there was a slight drop in people looking for work, to 8.7 million. Taken together, this means there were 1.7 times as many job seekers as job openings in December\u2014the lowest this ratio has been since November 2007., 378736=The Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Consumer Price Index for December 2014 today, which lets us look at trends in real (inflation-adjusted) wages over the year. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the U.S. economy has seen very little real wage growth. Real hourly wage growth fell 1.0 percent in 2011, and then 0.1 percent in 2012. Over the last two years, real wage growth has been positive, but slow: real wages rose 0.5 percent in 2013 and 0.4 percent in 2014. Even with the drop in inflation over the last couple of months, average wages increased in 2014 slightly less than in 2013. This means that, by definition, there has been no acceleration in wage growth. Decent wage growth would look like inflation plus productivity growth (around 1.5 to 2.0 percent). Given this, it is clear that the Federal Reserve should not take action to slow the economy down., 84974=The effects of Apple\u2019s reforms are often dubious and overstated by the company. For example, in reporting that 92 percent of the time workers in its supply chain are working less than 60 hours per week, Apple ignores the fact that workweeks at its Chinese factories still consistently break Chinese law, which restricts workweeks to less than 50 hours and which Apple has repeatedly pledged to uphold. The average workweek Apple reports still exceeds this legal limit by a substantial margin. Apple also continues to make the remarkable claim that nearly all its suppliers have achieved freedom of association (the right to organize unions and bargain collectively), saying its suppliers achieved 96 percent compliance with this standard. As Apple is aware, such freedom is non-existent in China. Independent unions are illegal. Workers who try to form them go to jail. Moreover, the information available about a program run by the Fair Labor Association (FLA), which was supposedly going to provide a greater voice for Apple\u2019s workers (within the cramped confines of Chinese law), indicates it has fallen woefully short of its stated goals. Further, Apple touts training programs under which, according to the company, 2.3 million workers were trained in labor rights in 2014. This is a large number, to be sure; unfortunately, it is the suppliers themselves, not worker rights advocates or worker representatives (and not even Apple or its new training academy), that provide this training\u2014and Apple provides no substantive information on its actual content or impact. Independent reports indicate that this management-provided training may be entirely cursory.\u00a0(Apple\u2019s repudiation of the use of bonded foreign labor was a positive step, but does not address the much larger, multi-faceted problem within Apple\u2019s supply chain in China of the excessive use of domestic labor hired through dispatch agencies.), 170335=This slight decline in the jobs-seekers-to-job-openings ratio is a continuation of its steady decrease, since its high of 6.8-to-1 in July 2009, as you can see in the figure below. If the economy were stronger, the ratio would be even smaller\u2014a 1-to-1 ratio would mean that there were roughly as many job openings as job seekers\u2014but this indicates that we are moving in the right direction., 28384=Real, inflation-adjusted hourly wages stagnated or fell across the board, with one notable, glimmer of positive news: Unlike the rest of the wage distribution, wages actually increased at the 10th percentile between 2013 and 2014., 57245=The outsourcing companies involved in the Southern California Edison (SCE) scandal I wrote about last week\u2014where U.S. workers were replaced with H-1B guestworkers\u2014are Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services. These two India-based IT firms specialize in outsourcing and offshoring, are major publicly traded companies with a combined market value of about $115 billion, and are the top two H-1B employers in the United States. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2013, Infosys ranked first with 6,269 H-1B petitions approved by the government, and Tata ranked second with 6,193. As with the SCE scandal, these leading offshore outsourcing firms use the H-1B program to replace American workers and to facilitate the offshoring of American jobs. Because of this, it\u2019s likely that Americans lost more than 12,000 jobs to H-1B workers in just one year. FY13 H-1B data I\u2019ve analyzed, acquired through a Freedom of Information Act request, reveals new details about how firms like Infosys and Tata are using the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program. Spoiler alert: they don\u2019t use the H-1B visa as a way to alleviate a shortage of STEM-educated U.S. workers; they use it primarily to cut labor costs. But the other main arguments proffered to support an expansion of the H-1B program are easily debunked with even a cursory look at the H-1B data., 15587=Twenty-six states, led by Texas, have convinced federal district court Judge Andrew Hanen to temporarily enjoin two important executive immigration actions\u2014DAPA and the expansion of DACA\u2014which President Obama announced in November of last year. DAPA is the \u201cDeferred Action for Parental Accountability\u201d initiative, which would grant a temporary reprieve from deportation, along with work authorization (known as an employment authorization document or \u201cEAD\u201d) for up to 3.7 million unauthorized immigrants if they have been present in the United States since 2010, are not an enforcement priority, and are the parent of a child who is a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident. DACA is \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,\u201d announced in 2012, which grants similar relief from deportation and an EAD, but was created to protect younger unauthorized immigrants who entered the United States as minors. The original version of DACA from 2012 is not at issue in the litigation\u2014only the expansion of DACA announced by the president, which could cover an estimated additional 300,000 persons., 223412=Source: EPI analysis of Mitra Toossi, \u201cLabor Force Projections to 2016: More Workers in Their Golden Years,\u201d Bureau of Labor Statistics Monthly Labor Review, November 2007; and Current Population Survey public data series, 353961=Saez expects top incomes to rebound in 2014, but fall short of their 2012 values. Indeed, James Parrott of the Fiscal Policy Institute noted in his summary of New York State top income trends (look up your state\u2019s top income trends here) that data from the New York State Division of the Budget indicate that the top 1 percent\u2019s share of New York personal income tax liability is expected to reach 42.5% in 2015\u2014just shy of its 2012 value of 43.2%., 22059=Yesterday, I released a report that looked at the most recent reliable data on Americans\u2019 wages\u2014by decile and by educational attainment, through 2014. These data are illuminating, because they let us look beneath the hood on the overall wage story, going beyond the topline trends that are usually covered by the media., 391516=1333 H Street NW, Suite 300 East Tower, Washington, DC 20005 Phone: 202-775-8810 | epi@epi.org \u00a92015 Economic Policy Institute Privacy Policy | Contact Us, 286822=The economy is slowly recovering from the Great Recession. We saw stronger job growth in 2014 than in 2013 or 2012. In 2015, I hope to see signs of even stronger job growth, pulling the missing workers back into the labor force, and achieving decent, if not strong, wage growth for most. I\u2019ll be looking at these factors when the jobs report comes out tomorrow and throughout the year., 120069=The\u00a0voluntary quits rate had been flat since February (1.8 percent), and saw a modest spike up in September to 2.0 percent, before falling to 1.9 percent in October and holding steady through December. \u00a0A larger number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs indicates a strong labor market\u2014one where workers are able to leave jobs that are not right for them and find new ones. In December, the quits rate was still 9.2 percent lower than it was in 2007, before the recession began., 257911=This morning\u2019s jobs report showed the economy added 257,000 jobs in January, and the numbers for December and November were revised upward. But even with the positive revisions to 2014 and the solid jobs growth last month, there\u2019s clearly still tremendous slack in the labor market, as evidenced by lagging nominal wage growth. While January\u2019s 0.5 percent jump in wages is a good sign, it\u2019s important not to read too much into any one month, as there\u2019s considerable volatility in the series. Over the year, nominal average hourly earnings have only grown 2.2 percent.\u00a0From the figure below, it is clear the nominal wage growth has been hovering around 2 percent for the last five years., 287224=First, jobs growth. If we continue to see the average rate of job growth experienced in 2014, it will be the summer of 2017 when we return to pre-recession labor market health. 2014\u2019s rate of job growth was a positive step, but I\u2019m hoping for even more., 380137=Turning to monthly wages, the figure below shows real average hourly earnings of all private employees (top line) and production/nonsupervisory workers (bottom line) since the recession began in December 2007. For both series, you can see that real wages fell during the recession, then jumped up in late 2008, in direct response to a drop in inflation. When inflation falls and nominal wages hold steady, the mathematical result is a rise in inflation-adjusted wages. After the deflation leading up to 2009 stopped boosting real wages, wage growth has been flat., 78759=The DOL study vastly understates the total impact of wage theft because it reported only on minimum wage violations, which are more frequent than overtime violations but usually involve smaller per violation dollar amounts than many overtime pay violations. A bookkeeper, for example, earning an annual salary of $45,000, who works 10 hours of unpaid overtime a week might lose $325, whereas a minimum wage worker forced to work \u201coff-the-clock\u201d unpaid for 10 hours would lose \u201conly\u201d $72.50, or ten times the state minimum wage if it were higher than the federal minimum. (Overtime violations are very frequent among low wage workers: a 2009 study found that on a weekly basis, 19 percent of front-line workers in low wage industries were cheated out of overtime pay to which they were entitled.), 253972=Today\u2019s job report is a solid start to the new year, and could be a sign that the economy has shifted into a slightly higher gear. At 257,000 jobs a month, we would get to pre-recession labor market health\u00a0by\u00a0May 2017 (as shown in the figure below)., 347028=The medical device industry, which apparently is represented by Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), argues this small tax is a job killer. According to a recent \u201cstudy\u201d by AdvaMed, the tax reduced industry employment by 14,000 jobs in 2013, or 3.2 percent of the employees in the industry. Furthermore, the \u201cstudy\u201d argues that R&D has been reduced in the industry, although no numbers are reported. AdvaMed says they estimated this number from a survey of 55 companies in the industry\u2014less than a quarter of the firms in the industry., 298364=President Obama released his fiscal year 2016 budget proposal earlier this week. The proposal is full of good ideas, so-so ideas, and some not so good ideas. One great idea is to devote more money to the Highway Trust Fund for infrastructure investments, which improves job growth now and in the future. At the moment, however, it\u2019s paired with the not-so good idea to pay for it with a mandatory one-time 14 percent tax on the $2 trillion of tax-deferred foreign earnings of U.S. corporations, which would bring in $268 billion over the six years. To be clear, this is an improvement over the other \u201cone-time\u201d corporate tax change often floated to realize a temporary revenue windfall\u2014a full repatriation tax \u201choliday\u201d for earnings accumulated overseas. So if the Obama proposal is a lot better than a full holiday, what\u2019s the problem? The proposed one-time tax rate is still too low.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Percent change in real hourly wages, by wage percentile, 2013\u20132014 Figure A So, why did wages at the bottom tick up when they fell for nearly everyone else? What is so special about that wage that sits below 90 percent and above 10 percent of workers (i.e., is not generally earned by particularly privileged workers)? The figure below shows changes in real hourly wages throughout the wage distribution between 2013 and 2014. What is particularly striking is that almost every decile and the 95th percentile experienced real wage declines from 2013 to 2014, with two exceptions.\u00a0First, there was a very small increase at the 40th percentile wage, up 3 cents, or 0.3 percent. But a more economically significant increase occurred at the 10th percentile where hourly wages were up 11 cents, or 1.3 percent. Real, inflation-adjusted hourly wages stagnated or fell across the board, with one notable, glimmer of positive news: Unlike the rest of the wage distribution, wages actually increased at the 10th percentile between 2013 and 2014. In a report released this week, I found that 2014 continued a 35-year trend of broad-based wage stagnation. This post originally appeared on TalkPoverty.org.",
