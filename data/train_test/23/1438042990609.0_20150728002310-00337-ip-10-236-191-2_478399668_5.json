No indexing means is described in that disclosure. Such a sorter is also disclosed in Japanese Published Application No. 53-79545 where a unidirectional indexing system includes a Geneva wheel which allows the bins to fall past the feed throat one at a time.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although specific embodiments have been described above, it will be understood that various modifications may be made to the specific details referred to herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. For example, the sets in adjacent bins may be relatively offset, for example, by having offset inner end stops in every other bin. It should also be noted that if desired the control system may be programmed to provide bidirectional sorting. That is, once the bins have been filled with copies one through five of sheet number 1 in bins B1-B5, they can be sequentially rotated clockwise to insert copies one through five of sheet number 2 in bins B5-B1. When the sorting job is completed a pause of measured duration exists in the sheet path which is detected by the control system which in turn indexes the fan-like array back to the home position where the collated sets of sheets may be easily withdrawn from the sorting bins. The operation of the sorter will now be described. Firstly, in non-sort mode, the baffle 26 is arranged in its lowered position as shown in the dotted line position of FIG. 2 and sheets are delivered face-up to the tray T forming an uncollated stack. In sort mode, the solenoid 31 is actuated to raise the baffle 26 to guide sheets from the processor 10 into the path 27",
