            "There are so many choices for clubs and activities on campus. If we don't have it you can start it!",
            "There is a cemetary on the center of campus, it's kind of spooky. Also one of our traditions is to have the freshman paint the road leading to the football stadium, Warhawk drive, purple for homecoming.",
            "The only place i like spending money outside my meal plans is Freshens, the smoothie place on campus. Delicious!",
            "There's a lot of stuff you can do in the UC. You can bowl or play billiards. You can also attend any of the SEAL events on campus like comedians or movies in the Summers Auditorium. Otherwise you just hang out with friends and find something to do. My friends and i like getting together and making a weekly dinner in the basement then watch a movie all together. It's a blast.",
            "I wish there were more options on campus for eating. There is variety but not enough.",
            "I absoulutly love the dorm life at Whitewater! I'm a junior here and still live in the dorms. Its where you meet most of your friends, and to be honest i think it's the best choice.",
            "I would say to make sure you do some extra curricular activities and good grades and you're set. I also would say to live on campus, it makes life so much easier.",
            "I think Whitewater is a great college. My heart was set on going here all through high school and I'm so glad i chose it. It's an awesome atmosphere."

It is all you can eat buffet, however, severely over or under cooked food, particularly chicken, is a daily occurrence. Food in the University Center is very good, however, it is expensive. Drumlin Hall and P-Street Cafe have similar food which is OK but selection is either a burger or sub, everyday. Drumlin Hall is closed for the 2012-2013 school year. Only eat at Esker Hall on their occasional steak and shrimp nights as it is cooked right., 208029=UW-Whitewater is in the process of re-opening one of the main dining halls; the tenative date of opening is February 28th. The quality of the other dining halls on campus is good. We have a lot of options that range from pasta to pizza! We have a couple well known restaurants on campus such as Unos and Erberts & Gerberts. We also have a few sandwich shops and a buffet as well., 312411=Dorm food is nice because it's easy to not have to try to figure out dinner on your own, but it can be a little gross sometimes. Drumlin was just renovated in 2013, so it's pretty nice and tastes okay from what I've had. Esker is low-quality food, but you get a lot of it. Erbs and Gerbs is always busy and frequently runs out of ingredients. P-Street is pretty good depending on what you get. The UC has a lot of good food but doesn't cover it in the meal plans for the most part.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Whitewater has a great campus. It is very open and spacious. It takes no more than 15 minutes to walk across campus. Off campus, there is not that much to do unless you are 21. Then you can go to the bars. There is a movie theater and bowling alley off campus. There is a lot to do on campus. The University Center has a movie theater where a different movie plays every weekend for only $1. Every Thursday night different comedians and bands come in to entertain students in the UC. There is also a medium sized bowling alley where students can bowl for $3. If you live in the dorms, programs are put on every week to entertain students. Am learning a lot Whitewater has a great environment for learning. Class sizes can range from a small number of students to a lecture hall but you are usually able to find classes where you can choose whether or not you want a small or large class size. Most professors know their subjects really well. Occasionally you will come across some who teach a class that is not their specialty and then it is hard to learn because they don\u2019t know what they are talking about. But in general, the professors at Whitewater are very competent and try",
