Both options have a wide variety of food to choose from and I like it all. Although I am not a picky eater, I know my friends who are always find something good to eat., 130328=A new garden was donated in the fall of 2012 by a alumni of the class of 1967 and in that garden there is a metal dome that incoming freshman will walk through and walk through again during graduation., 1078=Take advantage of as many Widener days as you can, even schedule a daily tour with the Admissions Office at Mueller Hall. Our average tuition is around $30,000 a year, but the school does offer many scholarships to help out the students. We have a great faculty, (75%+ possess a doctorate in their particular field). And we also have a student to teacher ratio of 12:1 meaning small class sizes. We have a large campus with plenty to do on weekends, along with nationally recognized varsity athletic teams and various club sports and student life organizations.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Anyone who wants to be more serious about getting a quality education. There are tutoring programs, along with a writing center for students who need to get their paper's reviewed. In the writing center, they also help you brainstorm your essay topic. Tips for prospective students If you do decide to come to Widener, join a club or two. Stay active on campus in extracurricular activities. Also get a planner, you will need to have good time management or you will be a mess.
