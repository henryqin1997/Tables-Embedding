Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Champion plastic in general - it is more stable than all other plastics. It provides outstanding performance and durability. Champion golf discs retain original flight characteristics much longer and are distinguished by their clear or pearlescent colors. Speed 10, Glide 5, Turn -2, Fade 2 The era of the wide rimmed disc golf drivers was issued in by the Beast. It was an instant classic when released, giving players more distance while using less power. The Innova Champion Beast is a maximum distance driver that is straight. It glides long to a predictable finish. Its high glide, high speed, and high speed turn all combine to give big distance. It is suitable for beginners and pros alike. The Beast disc golf disc is a great choice for maximum distance, a turnover driver, tailwind drives, rollers and beginner players looking for more distance from a driver. It's sure to increase distance for beginners and pros alike. A favorite of two-time World Champion Barry Schultz. 21.2 cm diameter",
    "textAfterTable": "\"A very controllable driver, yet it's so fast it makes a great distance disc. I usually carry 2-3 Beasts depending on the course and weather. I tend to use a durable Champion Beast in the woods, and a DX Beast when it is cold/wet or at an open course. \" - Barry Schultz \"The Beast has quickly become a favorite of mine. MY USE RANGE: 280-400ft. Very versatile disc...Flick or RHBH! My main use for it is the big \"S\" turn shot to usually dodge trees up the middle. This thing dodges trees like nothin! Glides well & is VERY accurate!\" - Eric Friedman \"I use a Champion Beast for my tomahawk shots. It is easy to manipulate and seldom rolls when it hits the ground.\" - Sandy Gast If you are looking for a disc that has more Fade, try the Orc more Turn, try the Monarch more Glide, try the Mamba Other Speed 10 discs include the Monarch, Monster, Orc, SL and Starfire.
