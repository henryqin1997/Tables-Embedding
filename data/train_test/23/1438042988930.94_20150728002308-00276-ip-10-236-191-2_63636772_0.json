Compatibility One of the main goals of this project was to achieve maximum compatibility with CraftBukkit. And the end result is quite good - in tests I successfully ran an unmodified ProtocolLib on CraftBukkit 1.8.0, and it should be resilient against future changes. It's likely that I won't have to update ProtocolLib for anything but bug and performance fixes. How is this possible? It all comes down to reflection in the end. Essentially, no name is hard coded - every field, method and class is deduced by looking at field types, package names or parameter types. It's remarkably consistent across different versions.
