            "I have never had any issues and feel that enough safety precautions are taken. There are blue lights in the parking lights for if you feel unsafe and JJC campus police are always patrolling.",
            "No Greek life on campus.",
            "GREAT variety. I truly feel there is something for everyone.",
            "Commuters. students unsure of major, wanting to stay at home.",
            "There are a variety of little nooks around the campus that are quiet and secluded from the rest of the students. Great for cramming for finals!",
            "I was highly satisfied with the qualitiy of institution I attended and felt that it was a great way to invest my money for the first two years.",
            "The school offers a great deal of opportunities for having fun and interacting. There are a variety of clubs, sports, and social activities to meet other.",
            "There is always a great selection of food and I have never had a bad meal.",
            "This school isn't centered around dorm life, it is much more of a commuter school. There is a dorm option though, but I do not know many who do it.",
            "I have had some challenging teachers and others who are not. It is definitely based on your teachers and the effort you put forth.",
            "Make sure to complete all parts for registering and becoming a student before classes are set to begin. Will save a lot of head ache!",
            "JJC is a great school for whatever stage of your education you are at. It is great for getting your footing in college and saving money at the same time. I would highly recommend JJC for any students interested."

I always saw security guards and campus police in squad cars patrolling., 285941=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 100786=Have never seen/heard about any fights. (From the 2011-2012 Student Handbook): Main Campus-2010: 7 Aggravated Assault/Battery; 80 Theft; 1 Motor Vehicle Theft; 3 Theft from Motor Vehicle; 3 Drug Abuse/Violations; 4 Arrest: Drug Law Violations ZERO: murders, sex offenses, arson, robbery, burglary, liquor law violations, hate crimes, weapons violations, arrests: illegal weapons, arrests: liquor law violations. JJC is a really friendly environment and everybody is very welcoming., 84849=If you live in district, full time can be anywhere from $1500-$2300, much better then $10000-$20000 at a university., 212023=It is an awesome school for money because the classes are relatively low price so to get your general requirements done it is wonderful. It is better than going to a big school and paying thousands of dollars for what JJC offers at maybe two thousand, and that is a high price at our school. Average is about $1500 dollars a semester., 96675=The food is good, but it can be a little expensive. They offer many choices of food. You can consider sub sandwiches, the grill station, healthy foods, grab-n-go items, salad bar and vending. You can also choose smoothies, hot chocolate, coffee and many other drinks. The cafeteria is clean and new. It's a great spot to hang out with friends and to have lunch. You can also dine outside in our picnic area. The cafeteria stay open from 7 am - 7 pm Monday - Thursday. On Fridays it stays open from 7am - 2:30 pm., 95993=There are many fun and exciting activities to get involved in. A wide range of activities to attend are talent shows, dances, theatre productions, sporting events, daytime activities on the bridge and many more. The last week in April for Spring Fling week is not to miss. There many activities going on during that week such as free food, free earth day t-shirt giveaways and fun activities.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Did learn a lot Overall I learned a lot, but each class is really a hit or miss in terms of how much you can expect to learn. Some of my classes were fantastic. I took a psychology class that both challenged me and taught me more than I could have expected to learn. On the other side of the spectrum, I took a history class in which I learned hardly anything. A lot of the time the instructor was off topic. There were no assignments or tests. It was a great class for those who wanted something easy, but not if you wanted to increase your knowledge of history. Overall, very few of my classes were like this, which is why I still think JJC is a great starting point for your college education.
