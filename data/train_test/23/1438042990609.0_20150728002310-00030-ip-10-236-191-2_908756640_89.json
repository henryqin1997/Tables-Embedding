            "I am definitely satisfied with the campus and it being affordable is just an extra plus.",
            "They are always having their organizations putting together fun activities and events to do around campus.",
            "Cafeteria is actually really nice and they have a great variety of food, which is pretty good!",
            "Phoenix College takes their academic rigor very seriously. Not only do they expect us to learn the material that is taught to us, but also the applied skills and critical thinking about the disciplines being taught. They hold us to high standards by assuring the difficulty of a course through insignificant amounts of content knowledge to be gained or complexity of the materials to be learned.",
            "Check out ratemyprofessor.com and read reviews on the teachers before enrolling in classes to make sure you pick the one you feel will be the best for you.",
            "I am beyond happy with the campus, teachers, and education I have received. The financial aid and advisement office provided so many helpful resources and all the information I needed to figure out the right path for me. Phoenix College has been a phenomenal experience."
