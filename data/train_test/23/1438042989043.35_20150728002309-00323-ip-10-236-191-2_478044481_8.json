The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes that come within the meaning and range of the equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate, respectively, the fixation of a BPTB graft and an ITB graft within the graft fixation devices of the present invention. In FIG. 8A, a bone plug 15 of a BPTB graft is secured in a radially compressible split collet 35, which is held in compression between drive elements 24 and 32 in collar 12 (shown in phantom). Ligament portion 17 extends into the bone channel along axis 14. In FIG. 8B, a plurality of ligament bands 19 of an ITB graft are looped over transverse members c of a disk fastener 39, which is held compressively between drive elements 24 and 32 within collar 12 (shown in phantom). The novel construction of the device 10 ensures fixation of the bony or fibrous segments 42 of a graft 44 within a bony channel 54, and permits independent axial and angular movement of the graft 44 without dislodging the graft from the channels 54 or from the fixation device 10.
