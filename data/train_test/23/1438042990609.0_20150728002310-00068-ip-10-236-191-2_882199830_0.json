George Bristol, who's the vice chairman along with I want to say this I'm old friends for a number of reasons with Chairman Montford. I enjoyed working with him in the Senate when he was in the Senate and I was in the House but we worked together on a lot of issues in the Legislature but outside the Legislature too. And I was I think you couldn't have picked a better person to lead the advisory committee., 108461=Steve is a devoted family man, married to his high school sweetheart for 13 years and has one six-year-old son and an 18-month-old daughter.

Returning to TPWD, he became the district wildlife biologist in Dumas on the Panhandle Regulatory District., 130693=For a number of years, our parks in Texas have struggled for funding. In 1993, the Legislature established a sporting goods tax as a source of funding for our state parks.

It's a pleasure to be here this morning and I just want to congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, for appointing the Committee and commend the committee the Montford Committee and all the members for the fine job they've done. In particular, I welcome all the recommendations but in particular, I like the thrust and welcome the really finishing the job we started in 1993 about making this more of a user-based funding system and that's what I think this recommendation if you really look at it there's some things that we've talked about before, some things that were included in legislation in the past. I'll comment on those things but really it's drawn a lot of public attention that's going to help our cause and we're going to get the job accomplished largely because of the public attention and focus that's been generated by this most recent efforts., 250265=It would require our proposed changes would require a daily log. Now, this is what's in it for us. When I spoke with you in January, we had really one mussel expert. Bob Howell's the author of the book that was distributed to you. Well, since then Bob has retired so we don't really have much of a staff to collect information on mussels., 218856=When these results are applied to the 2006 Super Combo revenue, fund allocation falls out as depicted here. For comparative reference, I've also included a fund allocation schedule based on the old 2005 methodology. As you can see, there's some swing of funds one way or another but nothing really significant., 72337=BE IT REMEMBERED, that heretofore on the 24th day of August, 2006, there came to be heard matters under the regulatory authority of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission in the Commission Hearing Room of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Headquarters Complex, to wit:, 102437=MR. COOK: From the State Parks Division, Ellen Buchanan, Manager V from Tyler, Texas, with 25 years of service. Ellen began her career with TPWD on August 17, 1981 as park superintendent at Monument Hill and Kriesche Brewery State and Historical Sites., 180628=I think I believe that whenever these ATVs even if they are gone some of the time, hunting season for me starts September 1st and ends about mid-February and then it opens up again in the spring for turkey season. There are also several turkey roosts there on this piece of land they're going to buy. There are several good draws that aren't actually right on Baylor Creek but branch off the creek that are on the property. The turkeys roost there. They come to my place to feed and there's no doubt that ATV activity anytime is going to run the turkeys off and they won't come back and that's a good part of my income., 265031=And then lastly, the option is to resume the council amendment either at our November meeting or our January meeting. And we certainly will resume it in January if nothing else takes place, but we could even resume it at our November meeting. With that, I'd be happy to answer any questions at this time., 213555=MS. FIELDS: Good morning, Commissioners. For the record, I'm Mary Fields, Chief Financial Officer for Parks and Wildlife, and I'm here to present the Proposed Fiscal Year 2007 Operating and Capital Budget and the Budget and Investment Policies for your adoption., 115967=Ranft has been awarded the Bronze Star, the Combat Action Badge, and the Iraqi Campaign Medal. Jim was also called to active duty in July of 2002 and served until July of 2003. Game Warden Captain Jim Ranft now serves as division inspector for the Law Enforcement Division. Jim, again, we thank you for your dedication and your service to your country and to the state of Texas. Jim Ranft., 118608=While on active duty, Staff Sergeant Detwiler was awarded the Bronze Star and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. In December of 2005, Detwiler returned home to Chambers County and once again became Game Warden Detwiler. Thank you, Shane, for your service and for the sacrifices of your family. Shane Detwiler., 133276=On August 18th, the Dallas Morning News editorial was published entitled, With Fund Cap, Life No Picnic For Parks. The Express News in my hometown on July 31st ran an article, Remove the Revenue Cap: Help Fix Texas Parks. The Houston Chronicle on July 30th ran the following column: Budget Cuts Threaten Low Performing State Parks., 283518=On average, 14 to 15 million fingerlings are stocked in more than 400 water bodies in Texas each year as part of the statewide management efforts. To date in 2006, approximately 12 million fingerlings have been stocked in 370 locations. To accomplish this, hatchery staff make more than 600 stocking trips and drive over a quarter-million miles distributing fish each year in Texas throughout the state., 235211=These are the death cases that have been reported in humans as a results of this. In many cases in some of these Asian and African countries, people do live in close contact with poultry. They may keep a pet or a food duck or chicken in their house and this close interaction it can jump that species barrier but it is very uncommon. So this is since 1998, this is all the human cases and you can see that it's not always fatal., 214481=Since this is the second year of the '06-'07 biennium, we are basically carrying over several of the same issues that we dealt with in 2006, including the reductions that are highlighted on this slide. We based our budget on 100 percent of the 2006 base and added our contingency revenue of $8.5 million via Rider 27. We did not budget salary lapses at the beginning of the year, which is a change from prior years., 103078=While there, she graduated from our leadership program from the Leadership Jasper and Leadership Southeast Texas programs. On December 1st of 2003, Ellen became regional director of the Region 8 State Parks, which covers the Northeast section of Texas., 107082=David Modgling began his career with TPWD as a seasonal worker at Lake Brownwood State Park in May of 1992. In July of 1990, he was promoted to Park Ranger II at South Llano River State Park and remained there until he entered the Game Warden Academy in October of 1992., 109752=This year's recipient strives at being the best by volunteering for new duties and tasks, including taking a Spanish class designed just for peace officers, becoming a Certified Breath Test Operator for Boating While Intoxicated, a background investigator for the Game Warden Cadet Hiring process, and a Glock pistol Armorer Ruger and Rifle Armorer. At this time, it is my honor and privilege to present to you the 2006 Midwest Game Warden of the Year for Texas, Steve Stapleton., 214908=We raised our capital limits to the maximum allowed at 125 percent. We applied the 3 percent pay raise per state employees. We continued to absorb inflationary costs for utilities and gas. And finally, we anticipate having the $15 million for the East Texas Fish Hatchery encumbered in fiscal year 2007 via contract with most of the other unexpended balances that were discussed yesterday., 117872=MR. COOK: Staff Sergeant Shane Detwiler was deployed to Iraq in January 2005 as a counter-intelligence special agent on a tactical human intelligence team. His mission included recruiting and exploiting intelligence sources, tactical questioning of Iraqis during raids and cordon-and-searches in order to determine target identities, gather evidence, and coordinated follow-on targets., 123586=Ken Pollard received the 2005 TPWD's Community Outreach Award, as well as the 2005 TPWD Outstanding Team Award, and the 2005 Preservation Texas Treasures of Texas Heritage Education Award for the Huff Wagon Train and Diary Project., 101488=He was then promoted to Lieutenant Instructor at the Game Warden Academy in Austin in 1978.

He retired from the Navy Reserves after 26 years of service. Thank you, Andy, for your service to your country and the people of Texas., 215309=That concludes my presentation on the Proposed Fiscal Year 2007 Operating and Capital Budget. I'll move on to the next item, which is to review the budget and investment policies for your approval., 249893=So our proposed changes would restrict the commercial license purchases to those who held license between September 1, 2003 and May 1, 2006. It would restrict recreational harvest to 25 pounds of whole mussels or 12 pounds of shells. Now, there still is a recreational demand for pearls in several parts of Texas and this would allow this activity to continue., 146264=But also the whole idea that this needs to be a user-based system and this helps us move toward realizing that really important goal. So I really welcome the report. I welcome the support that I'm seeing that we're gaining in the Legislature. For some time now, I like to point out since your August meeting of last year some things occurred in that meeting and there was a lot of public attention on one of the things on your agenda that day that tended to bring the public more into increased public interest in this whole issue. And since then, the work that you've done here, the committee, the work we've continued in the Legislature and our committee, I think, has brought us to where we are now where it's an exciting day because we have a report that's workable, that's something we can all embrace, and work on to turn into a legislative proposal that we have a really promising opportunity to pass legislation to bring this about and to bring this into reality., 105254=Bill McDonald, native of Hillsboro, Texas, graduated from Texas A&M University in 1977 with a Bachelor of Science degree in landscape architecture. He began his career with Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Repair and Technical Support Division in 1981., 131885=This would represent an increase of approximately $85 million above what was appropriated in 2005 but it would accomplish three critical goals. First, it would provide funding for identified and acute operational equipment and local park grant needs. Secondly, it would establish a ten-year capital program for major repairs and park acquisitions and development. And third, it would adhere to the ten-year Land and Water Resources Conservation and Recreation Plan completed at the direction of the Legislature in 2003., 132416=These recommendations are also consistent with the needs that Chairman Harvey Hilderbran of the Texas House of Representatives sought to address with House Bill 1292 in 2005., 218486=This rule was published in the Texas Register in the July 21, 2006, Texas Register and to date, we've received no public comment. Also, as discussed in the May Commission Meeting, the Department has conducted a dedicated survey of Super Combo and senior Super Combo buyers to determine license and stamp uses. The results to date are presented in this slide., 117404=During this deployment, Tim earned the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, and his unit also received the Army Superior Unit Award. Tim Spice returned to his job as the Urban Outdoors Program Coordinator for the Communications Division in August 2004 and was promoted to Command Sergeant Major in January 2006. Thank you, Tim, for your dedication and continued service to your nation and to our outfit. Tim Spice., 282251=Since 1925, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department or its predecessor agency has operated 17 freshwater fish hatcheries in support of fisheries management objectives across the state. Today, we operate five facilities: the Dundee Fish Hatchery located near Wichita Falls, the Possum Kingdom Fish Hatchery located near Mineral Wells, the Texas Freshwater Fisheries Center in Athens, the Jasper Fish Hatchery in Jasper, and the A.E. Wood Fish Hatchery in San Marcos., 220753=Lots of changes at Expo. This is our 15th annual logo, which you'll be seeing on the grounds and around the building. The date, Friday, October 6th, is the Expo Conservation Dinner and Auction, and Saturday and Sunday, the 7th and 8th, is the actual Expo here at Parks and Wildlife Headquarters. A week later, we know that'll make it about 75 degrees., 264455=Where that leaves us today is National Marine Fisheries Service could for the year 2000 use an interim rule or an emergency rule to go ahead and set the TAC. It could be set it could remain status quo at 9.12 or it could be set at any of the options that were in the previous amendment ranging, I would guess, from 5- to 7 million pounds., 229979=First a little bit of background and these are very important facts to be kept in mind at all times. There are no cases of HPAI H5N1 in North America. Surveillance for this virus has been in effect in Alaska since 1998 when this form was first discovered. It is a disease of birds, primarily water birds and poultry. Human deaths have occurred and I will report on those in a moment., 119388=Adrian has been awarded the following medals: the National Defense Ribbon three times; Global War on Terrorism Medal; and the Texas Faithful Service Ribbon. Sergeant Edmundson has been in Kosovo since December 2005. His supervisor, Mark Miller, has joined us today to accept this honor on Adrian's behalf. We look forward to congratulating him and seeing him in person when he returns in December. Mark?, 218093=At the May Commission Meeting, you authorized staff to publish a proposed administrative rule in the Texas Register that would define that receipts from the Super Combo licenses component that's both the licenses and the stamps and allocate as a value calculated from relative weighting, using both the price of the stamp and the purchaser use as established by a dedicated survey., 151065=MR. BRISTOL: Well, as you know, Mr. Chairman, members, my name is George Bristol. I'm president of the Texas Coalition for Conservation. In late 2002 going into 2003, we the Coalition commissioned a report on 40 parks and their economic impact on the state of Texas and their local communities. That was expanded to 80 parks. In every instance, those parks, when you add in the money spent in the local communities at grocery stores and motels and service stations, et cetera, et cetera more than paid for themselves., 101785=Bill retired from TPWD in April 1996. After a brief retirement, he was reinstated in 1997 as a field game warden assigned to Hays County, which included assignment to Lake Travis. He transferred to Comal County in 2002 and was promoted to Chief of Inland Fisheries Enforcement at Austin headquarters excuse me Chief of Fisheries Enforcement at Austin headquarters in 2004., 284355=An essential component in meeting the production demands and maximizing hatchery operating flexibility and efficiency are continuing facility improvements. With the exception of the Texas Freshwater Fishery Center, most of the facilities that are currently in operation were constructed prior to 1950. During the mid-80s and early 90s, renovation efforts were started, starting with the A.E. Wood Fish Center in San Marcos then in the Dundee Fish Hatchery in Wichita Falls., 261730=When you look at kind of the where we stand today with regards to the red snapper stock assessment as I indicated the previous assessment was in 2000 the ideal is that you get a benchmark assessment every five years. So we were presented a new assessment in the fall of 2005. The Gulf Council started working on a joint Reef Fish/Shrimp Amendment Plan. It's Reef Fish Amendment 27 and Shrimp Amendment 14 and I was really here and anticipated the next slide would be showing you where public hearings were going to be held in the fall, but based on action in Baton Rouge of last week, basically, the Council passed a motion on a 10-5 vote that stalled all action on this amendment until January 1, 2007., 233921=In October and November of '05, there was 165,000 pounds of smuggled Asian poultry products that were intercepted on their way to this country. And recently, within the last few months, a shipment of chicken feed was smuggled into the United State from Thailand. They arrived in Connecticut marked \"jellyfish.\" So if these poultry products are contaminated and they arrive this way or there are people traveling worldwide today carrying poultry products, knowingly or unknowingly, that is a way the flu could come to North America not necessarily going to come from wild birds., 98513=Jim Dillard worked as a wildlife biologist for Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for 40 years and will retire at the end of this month. He began his career with TPWD in the summers of 1965 I was just a mere child then and 1966 as a summer intern for TPWD on the Edward's Plateau Regulatory District and on the Matador Wildlife Management Area., 256432=Currently, we are under the guidelines of the Magnuson-Stevens Act which was re-authorized in 1996 and there's current draft language on the hill today that will re-authorize this once again. And they kind of thought it was going to go through this fall but it's looking more like spring if at all right now., 232014=The first major outbreak of the disease was in China at Qinghai in 2005 and here you'll see that in May an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was reported in Qinghai and that is the large red dot in China. They were bar-headed geese were the species that were mostly impacted and almost 10 percent of that population was lost from this outbreak. From this location, researchers have been able to track the disease, the lineage, other reported cases in poultry and wild birds across Asia to Europe and Africa back to this outbreak., 246603=MR. PROVINE: In the January Commission Meeting, I briefed you on the status of the freshwater mussel populations in Texas and the need for protection against overharvest., 123147=Through Ken's efforts, the Texas Legislature has designated the month of July as Texas Buffalo Soldiers Heritage Month and has recently established the Texas Buffalo Soldiers Heritage Trail Project. The Trail Project connecting approximately 70 parks and historic sites along the 1800s military and civilian routes will bring education, tourism, and other social and economic opportunities to minority communities across Texas., 106256=Kenneth Coleman began his career with TPWD as a seasonal employee at Buescher State Park August 1, 1986. After four years, he was promoted to Park Ranger II. In his 20-year tenure, Kenneth has put his pride into keeping Buescher State Park a beautiful park to visit through daily maintenance and resource preservation duties., 232609=And why is this important to us? Flyways overlap, as we'll see. Some birds that are in one area, some go east, some go west. Migrating water fowls use these flyways and overlap with the area of the Qinghai Reserve that some birds come from. And you can see on this map that Qinghai is there in China. These are the dark lines are pintails that are moving from that area. They combine in Siberia, cross Alaska. They can be mixed up with birds that come into North America and Alaska. That's why Alaska has been conducting surveillance since 1998 because of that and most of those birds will come down the Pacific Flyway and so the Pacific Flyway is more of a concern. However, a lot of those pintails, as you know, end up in our state and along our coast. So that is why we are a critical state for this surveillance., 211772=The projects this time around include a pilot project with Brenham. You approved an initial planning grant for that Brenham project in April. This would comprise Phase II of that project and it is a pilot project because it is being administered by an independent school district and obviously we feel the benefits of serving both the youth in the school system, but also the law enforcement in the local community all at once is a good project., 260096=We're transitioning to an individual fishery quota or individual transferable quota system. It's been passed out of the council for over a year now or pretty close to a year. It's called Reef Fish Amendment 26. The Secretary of Commerce is out for comment on that right now and those comments are being accepted until October 1, 2006., 103961=In 1986, he transferred to Mission Tejas State Historical Park and then in 1990 transferred to Fort Parker State Park. In his 25 years with Texas State Parks, he has worked to protect both the natural and cultural resources of the park, developed educational programs to help the public appreciate those resources, and provide support facilities so that the public can enjoy interacting with those resources., 107608=MR. COOK: That concludes our retirement and service awards. Next, I want to recognize the Midwest Officer of the Year for Texas. In 1995, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Law Enforcement Division joined the Association of Midwest Fish and Game Law Enforcement Officers., 99312=In 1973, he transferred to Mineral Wells, where he spent 22 years as a district wildlife biologist on the Possum Kingdom Wildlife District. In 1995, Jim was promoted to Technical Guidance Biologist under TPWD's Private Lands and Habitat Program, and worked in a 21-county area in the Cross Timbers and Prairies and the Lower Rolling Plains Ecological Regions, providing wildlife and habitat management recommendations and assistance to private landowners., 284840=Of course, the Texas Freshwater Fishery Center was constructed in 1999 and most recently, renovations were accomplished at the Possum Kingdom Fish Hatchery. The Possum Kingdom Fish Hatchery was constructed in 1950 has been undergoing renovations since 2001. As part of the renovations, a total replacement of the water distribution and drain systems were accomplished. Construction of maintenance and equipment storage facilities was accomplished. Construction of intensive spawning and rearing facilities was done and also construction of administrative and laboratory and staff support building was constructed., 273537=I represent all the Red Claw crayfish farmers in Texas. Red claw have been farmed and sold for food and to aquarium stores since 1991 in Texas. I learned of your proposed rule-making and I called the Department of Wildlife. I talked to Bill Robinson who told me they were just tired of answering the phone and so they were going to try to create a white list for exotic species., 103735=MR. COOK: Again from our State Parks Division, Thomas M. Fisher, Program Supervisor II at Mexia, Texas, with 25 years. Tom Fisher began his career with TPWD in June of 1981 at Old Fort Parker State Historical Site., 275403=I believe this rule-making was not afforded any right of due process before being stripped of its right of commerce. I talked to our attorney last night and if passage happens as currently proposed, we will be filing a lawsuit in federal court regards to the lack of due process. My small company alone has gone from $120 a month to $3,000 plus a month in sales in the first five months of 2006 and I've spent $10,000 in importation costs and fees this year alone., 258449=Now, in 2000, there was a lot of discussion about lowering the TAC when a new assessment was done and in 2006, following an assessment that was given to us in 2005, there's a considerable amount of discussion regarding where the TAC will be set. It looks as if we're going to be in a range somewhere from 5- to 7 million pounds. Under a 9.12 million pound TAC, which is where we're at today, we have about 194-day recreational season and if we go to a 7 million-pound TAC, you're going to be looking at a reduction from anywhere from 76 to 94 days, and if you go to a 5 million pound TAC, you're going to be looking at a reduction in days somewhere in the order of 60 to 103 days, depending on the bag and size limit combinations you choose., 113306=These folks were called away from their families and their jobs to serve their country and they went willingly and have done a great job. First, Senior Chief Petty Officer Andrew Valdez, stationed in Iraq from February 2004 through November 2004 as a senior enlisted leader for the medical department of the Third Battalion 24th Marines 1st Marine Division., 116391=MR. COOK: US Navy Intelligence Specialist First Class Jimmy Dale Shively returned in March 2005 from a year of active duty at the Joint Intelligence Command Central with three months spent in Baghdad. Shively was a member of the High Value Targets Team tracking the location of key insurgent leaders fighting against Coalition forces. Some of his awards include: Joint Services Achievement Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal., 285465=The A.E. Wood Fish Hatchery in San Marcos was originally constructed in 1949 and was completely renovated in 1988 and 1989. In 2005, additional repairs were made to the water intake structures on the San Marcos River, as well as total replacement of production pond liners. In 2006 scheduled for 2006, additional renovations are scheduled for the storage reservoir which is the large nine-and-a-half-acre pond which is shown in the photograph, which will receive again new pond liners and renovations of its levees., 251409=So what the staff is recommending is that the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission adopt the repeal of 57.157 and accept the new 57157 concerning mussels and clams with changes as published in the June 9, 2006 issue of the Texas Register. Be happy to answer questions at this time., 240293=We hope to conclude this by December 31st. We understand we may run into problems but we're going to shoot for that. We do have some latitude to go beyond December 31st, particularly for geese as the arrive sometimes later in January, and also we'll be collecting Blue-and-Teal in March trying to watch the backdoor, if you will, from Mexico and Central and South America., 100460=Ken Baker began his career with TPWD by attending the State Game Warden Academy at Texas A&M University in September of 1971. He was commissioned in January 1972 and assigned to his duty station in Hidalgo County. He worked Hidalgo County for 30 years and was promoted to captain for the Rio Grande Valley District in 2003. With 35 years of service in our Law Enforcement Division, Captain Ken Baker., 202637=So if there's a way to defer the decision to November, that would be our preference if we could do that. Thank you very much., 174644=There have been two public hearings held in Childress, one back in May by the city and then we, as staff, conducted a second one in August. There was one person actually two neighboring landowners voicing opposition. Since then, one of them has withdrawn their opposition our understanding is., 190179=COMMISSIONER MONTGOMERY: I have a similar question that is would is there an opportunity Tim, you may know or Mr. City Manager you might know to take time until our November meeting to explore whether some way to deal with some of the mitigation, some of the issues he's raising? I would like to support this. I think we need these and I understand the impact that it'll have on Childress. Are there more avenues we might explore there to help mitigate some of those?, 136840=In light of the notice from this agency that the state railroad operations would cease December 31, 2006, the local community has been working diligently with task force leaders to develop a strategy for the transfer of operations of the Texas State Railroad, by year end, in order not to lose this unique park on rails. They have identified credible operators who have shown a strong willingness to operate the Texas State Railroad., 255451=Just kind of catch everyone up, our federal partners in this basically starts at the level of the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council, which is one of the eight regional councils that was formed by the Magnuson Act in 1976. The Magnuson Act, at that point, governed how those councils would behave basically., 214150=Of that total, the operating budget represents $242.6 million, which includes $12.6 million for grants and the capital budget is $52.4 million, which includes $48.9 million for construction projects and land acquisition. Our FTE cap for fiscal year 2007 is $2,901 and the Department will stay within that capped amount., 258095=Our history of our TAC and our TAC settings basically are as follows: In March of 1991, the TAC was set at 4 million pounds. After revision of the models and the assessment, it was revised upwards to 6 million pounds in 1993. It stayed in that ballpark until 1996, when it was increased to 9.12 million pounds and we've been there ever since., 124985=The Cowboys of Color Rodeo Tour is an educational and entertaining rodeo that reaches crowds of thousands in Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Fort Worth, and Mesquite. Next Thursday, August 31st, Ken Pollard will be inducted into the National Cowboys of Color Hall of Fame, along with Charlie Pride and Rosieleetta Lee Reed to name a few., 318814=9/09/2006 (Transcriber) (Date), 262445=Let me at least try to give you my opinion of how I heard the arguments for delay. The first, and probably greatest, argument or one of the greatest arguments by many of the people is that the assessment was based on a 2001-2003 time period and when you factor in Katrina and Rita impacts into that, the world has changed greatly in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and many people just believe that the assessment is no longer an assessment that depicts the reality on the ground in those states, as far as the commercial effort that's going on and the recreational effort., 137599=At my request, a few weeks ago many of my colleagues and I met with Mr. Cook and Mr. Boruff and we appreciate their diligent efforts to find resolution. We met to express to them where the task force is and what needs to be done from this point forward. And here is what happened: It was determined by your staff that there were significant barriers to finding and procuring a third-party operator or changing title prior to the static displayed deadline of December 31, 2006., 101083=Bill Robinson began his career with Texas Parks and Wildlife Department when he attended the 19th Game Warden School held at Texas A&M University in 1966. His first station assignment was Marble Falls in Burnet County. He was then assigned to Travis County in 1975 and continued to primarily enforce water safety on Lake Travis, Lake Austin, Town Lake, and the Colorado River below Austin., 107896=The Association is comprised of 29 member state agencies from the United States and Canada. In July of 2006 at the 62nd Annual Meeting held in Omaha, Nebraska, a Texas game warden was recognized for his outstanding accomplishments with officers from each of the other member states and provinces., 233571=The other routes of introduction to North America are probably human caused or human brought. In September of '05, there were 820 cases of eggs, 120 eggs each, discovered in a ship in California with no permits and it was not listed on the manifest. So if this had been in those eggs and this poultry, it could have been entered that way.}",
