    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention is by way of example only, and other variations of the above-described embodiments and methods are provided by the present invention. Components of this invention may be implemented using a programmed general purpose digital computer, using application specific integrated circuits, or using a network of interconnected conventional components and circuits. Connections may be wired, wireless, modem, etc. The embodiments described herein have been presented for purposes of illustration and are not intended to be exhaustive or limiting. Many variations and modifications are possible in light of the foregoing teaching. The system is limited only by the following claims. One skilled in the art will understand that the web server 185 may also include additional information, such as network connections, additional memory, additional processors, LANs, input/output lines for transferring information across a hardware channel, the Internet or an intranet, etc. One skilled in the art will also recognize that the programs and data may be received by and stored in the system in alternative ways. For example, a computer-readable storage medium (CRSM) reader 865 such as a magnetic disk drive, hard disk drive, magneto-optical reader, CPU, etc. may be coupled to the signal bus 310 for reading a computer-readable storage medium (CRSM) 870 such as a magnetic disk, a hard disk, a magneto-optical disk, RAM, etc. Accordingly, the web server 185 may receive programs and data",
