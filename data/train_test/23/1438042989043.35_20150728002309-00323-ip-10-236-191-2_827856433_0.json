That\u2019s why I\u2019v never put too much stock in New Year\u2019s resolutions. I\u2019ve resolved in March to lose weight. I\u2019ve resolved in July to exercise more. I\u2019ve resolved in September to be a gentler spirit. But somehow Jan. 1 always signals the advent of a clean slate, a time to start\u00a0 (or finish) something. This year, I purposely targeted Jan. 3 as my new beginning (had a lot of good food at the New Year\u2019s Eve party and I wasn\u2019t going to let it pass me by). Now you must understand, never in my life have I been waif-like. Shoot, I\u2019m a rawboned mountain gal, and I make no apologies for it. And if you think I\u2019m big, you should see the rest of the clan. Back in 2007, after catching a glimpse of the Michelin Man in my bathroom mirror, I decided to get healthy\u2013eat right, exercise and sleep more. It worked. In six months, I lost 35 pounds and was feeling great. Then Tom moved to Florida, we got married and before you can say Pillsbury Doughboy, I\u2008had gained all the weight back PLUS a few pounds more. With a closet full of wonderful clothes I could no longer wear, I vowed to shed some of those pounds-again. I\u2008am not a dieter. I don\u2019t do veggies but I can control portions, exercise and eat a sliver of cake instead of the entire thing. Armed with yogurt and a Lean Cuisine, I entered the office Jan. 3 with a new resolve and a plan of action. I sat down ready to sample the creamy goodness of the yogurt when something caught my eye. \u201cBest if used before November 2010.\u201d Oh, it\u2019s only two months past the date, I thought, and besides what is yogurt anyway? A variation of bad milk. So I ate\u00a0 it. No problem. Around 1, I popped my Lean Cuisine-Cheese Ravioli-in the microwave and while it cooked the required five minutes, I began reading the nutritional information, list of ingredients and wait, what was that on the end? \u201cBest Before Jan2009.\u201d January 2009? I\u2019m eating a frozen meal that\u2019s two years old? How can that be. Oh, my goodness, I bought this back in 2008 when I\u2008was still in the maintenance phase of my last weight loss foray. My coworkers were aghast that I was going to proceed with consuming it. \u201cShall I move your computer into the bathroom?\u201d Chris asked me. \u201cLook, it just says it\u2019s Best Before January 2009. It doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t eat it,\u201d\u2008I reasoned. \u201cIt just won\u2019t be its best.\u201d And so I did. And here I am, 10 days later having suffered no ill effects. Well, maybe. I am eight pounds lighter, and whether it was coughing up five pounds of lung butter or the out-of-date food that did it, is anyone\u2019s guess. I\u2019ll just take it anyway I can get it. \u00a0}",
