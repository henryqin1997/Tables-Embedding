    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The professors on campus are very knowledgeable in their subject matter. They are very helpful and want to assist students as much as they can, even if it does not pertain to the class's subject matter but life in general. Professor make class interesting by integrating hands-on activities and the use of technology to better their lectures. Also, the books they choose for the class are often excellent and up-to-date; although like many schools...expensive. The core major/minor classes are well taught and thorough...and the GER classes are not a waste of time. Attending St. Joe's will earn you a well-rounded education!
