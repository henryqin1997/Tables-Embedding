In 2013, against All Fastballs (933 seen), he has had a very poor eye (0.79 d'; 57% swing rate at pitches in the zone vs. 27% swing rate at pitches out of the zone) and a very patient approach at the plate (0.23 c) with a low likelihood to swing and miss (8% whiff/swing).Against Breaking Pitches (214 seen), he has had a very good eye (0.99 d'; 61% swing rate at pitches in the zone vs. 24% swing rate at pitches out of the zone) and a patient approach at the plate (0.21 c) with a low likelihood to swing and miss (18% whiff/swing).Against Offspeed Pitches (117 seen), he has had an exceptionally poor eye (0.55 d'; 67% swing rate at pitches in the zone vs. 45% swing rate at pitches out of the zone) and a steady approach at the plate (-0.15 c) with a below average likelihood to swing and miss (26% whiff/swing). Spanhttp://www.brooksbaseball.net/h_landing.php?player=452655, 44662=A DC Wonk said\u2026I have no faith at all in Span ever turning it around\u2026With all due respect, don't we hear that with _every_ player who goes through an extended rough patch? We heard it with Werth, ARL, RZim, and Desmond, for starters.ARL I said that about in May, i was wrongmy friend we are talking about 81 games with span, not a rough patch, 75558=Of Desi's 547 plate appearances in 2012, 116\u201321%\u2013ended on the first pitch. For Werth, it was 4%.Desmond and Werthhttp://ladyandthenats.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-tale-of-two-hitters.html, 66885=Unless baseballreference.com is incorrect, Harper NEVER batted leadoff in 2012. Not once. He batted 2nd 117 times, other positions a smattering.http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/split.cgi?id=harpebr03&year=2012&t=b, 218192=Thanks ever so, guys. That was teh awesomez!1natsfan1a said\u2026 Wouldn't it be nice to end the series on a high note, with another curly W, and a series win, in the books? How about it, Nats and Gio? kthxbai.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 108549=I got so fed up with the discussion yesterday that I left in about three minutes. Let me plug in a piece of history for all the sky-is-falling types.On July 10, 2005, the Houston Astros were 44-43. They went to their first world series that year. (My son lives in Houston and they were my NL team in those days\u2013even went to RFK three days in a row to see Oswalt and Clemens pitch.)In the previous 10 years they had won the NL Central 4 times and been to the playoffs six times. That was their 9th trip to the post-season. They got swept by the White Sox 4-0 in the series.Oh, and the White Sox? That was their FIRST WS championship since 1917!And if we don't win it this year, everything has gone to hell, right? And while I'm at it, our old nemesis, the Phillies, have won 3 in 130 years!I'm just as happy right now that the target is no longer on our backs. MLB has just posted that today's ATL-ARIZ game is an NL championship preview. GREAT! Let their jaws tighten up when we start creeping up on them., 79555=Maybe I will do this analysis again for the first half of 2013. Already I can say that Span is swinging at more pitches out of the zone than he did last year\u2026, 221417=PS. I remember the year Williams hit .406. I also remember exactly where I was on December 7 that year., 222172=Really, mick? You went on and on about Harper leading off in 2012, which I believe that he never did one time.You insisted that you were going to show us some box scores.also, I didn't attempt to make any referendum. My only criticism was directed at the poster that has posted what seems like a hundred times that he doesn't like Span at leadoff. It's become a broken record. You should look back at your posts today. I wasn't attacking you, but you were insisting that Bryce led off off last year. You were incorrect. No big deal. But, mick? Insisting that you're right when you're not isn't going to make you right.Thus, \"my quit digging\" comment.\u2014\u2013///\u2014\u2014\u2013mick said\u2026nats lady\u2026you need to stop nowJune 30, 2013 1:51 PM mick said\u2026ah\u2026found all the box scores for 2012\u2026 where do I begin??June 30, 2013 1:52 PM NatsLady said\u2026Unless baseballreference.com is incorrect, Harper NEVER batted leadoff in 2012.

Been a while., 51994=Tcostantwhat was Nats reocrd in 2012 after Bryce lead off??that is all I will say and most importantly, what will change with Span after 81 games\u2026what is an adequate sample size? missing post season and finishing under 500?I don't think so\u2026its clear Span should not lead off, 85651=In the on-going debate about Denard Span, it's probably worth noting the offensive stats for other NL lead-off hitters and center fielders by way of comparison:2013 NL CFs: .256/.320/.3982013 lead-off: .268/.334/.3972013 Span: .257/.310/.350Not great, I agree, but not that far off the league averages (slugging excepted).I also encourage you to look at the fielding stats for NL center fielders that Baseball Reference provides at:http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/2013-specialpos_cf-fielding.shtmlThey're somewhat hard to characterize in a single number, but click around and you'll see that Washington (mostly Mr. Span) is right at the top in most comparative categories., 49987=For the record, Bryce Harper has never batted leadoff in a MLB game\u2026 and Ian Desmond led off in 38 games in 2012 and posted a .294 OBP\u2026 I'm not defending Span, his performance offensively has been lackluster and a significant cause of the poor team performance\u2026 But, I had to point that out that Harper never batted leadoff and Desmond had a lower OBP then Span at leadoff\u2026Really, the bottom line is Span needs to get back to his career OBP of .352 and Harper just needs to get back, period, if we want to compete\u2026 at least the second part of that equation seems imminent, not sure the first part will happen or not\u2026, 220585=Jeffwx,Yeah, I am. You want to talk about the 1951 Giants? I was around for that, too. (Thirteen behind in August, finished 37-7.) They were my NL team until they left for San Francisco., 206237=Smatt1001 said\u2026And there goes Desi. Is it time to just take some really bad hacks?That's why Davey put Tracy in., 111007=Old Guy, you ain't that old.Cardinals played .500 ball thru July of 1964 before winning it all (acquisition of Cub cast off Lou Brock helped)..How about the miracle cubs in 08\u2026They were trailing most of the season before the great Merkle boner (didn't touch the 2nd base bag after the walk off hit)Don't you remember ?}",
