Minimize turns the window into an icon, and Maximize enlarges the window to its largest possible size, that is, the full screen. Figure 1-4 CDE Window Controls Application windows have common controls, title areas, and grab handles. Some of these are shown in the following figure. Working with Windows The appearance and use of windows, icons, dialog boxes, and so on differs slightly between the OpenWindows and CDE environments.

For example, when you choose Close from the File menu of a CDE application, the file is closed, but the application window typically remains open.

Clipboard CDE provides a clipboard facility that can handle text and graphics simultaneously. Most CDE applications have an Edit menu that provides the standard clipboard items (Cut, Copy, and Paste). Cut, Copy and Paste are also available through the following key combinations.
