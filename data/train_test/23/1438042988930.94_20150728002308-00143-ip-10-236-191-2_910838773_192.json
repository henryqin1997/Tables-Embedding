            "What can I say, the best part about going to a large university is that there is always something to do. Whether it is sporting events for the famous Wolverines Football team, hockey, baseball, basketball, golf, lacross, field hockey etc. there is always sport going on you can get a discounted ticket for. The big house and yost ice arena are iconic parts of University of Michigan history and I strongly suggest you go there at least once. The university has an excellent Intra Mural sports program, with all kinds sports going on from when school starts to when it ends in the summer. The central campus has the CCRB, and IM building both of which are excellent workout facilities (however lacking an indoor tennis court), while on north a campus ( a free bus ride a way) is the NCRB, which has all the amenities of the CCRB and IM building. If you are more into walks and canoeing the Nickel's Arboratum, or ARB as it's called here is a great place to run or walk through, a hidden area of trees and wildlife away from the ruckus of Ann Arbor. Meanwhile, Ann Arbor, is home to a great night life on main street, music and film festivals, and other events. There is a massive greek program here at UofM, both for social and business fraternities and sororities. The school of Music, and the Theatre and Dance schools all have events to keep an eye out for. We have a museum of History and and a museum of Art, and we are a free bus ride (for students) away from the Briarwood mall which has its own sources of entertainment. There is no shortage of food, and if you like eating out, and going to bars there is massive array of hometown favorites like Ashleys with over 140 beers on tap. Or, a nice dinner for two at the melting Pot, basically if you want something to do either Ann Arbor or the University of Michigan will have it for you, and you will be hard pressed to be bored outside of doing your homework.",
            "The food tastes good depending on where you go, but unfortunately one RH, North Quad has good food, but little space to sit, and because its so popular many students like to hit up for lunch and dinner making sitting an issue. I gave the food three stars, not because it tastes bad (the majority of the time food is really tasty, and after you swipe in its all you can eat), but because the food tends to be high on the calorie side. Vegan and Vegetarian meals are always available, and even for religious holidays like Passover and Lent, Ramadan, and others that I may not think about, the Halls always make sure to accommodate those students. Also, they have fresh vegetables, salad fixings, and coffee available. And, sometimes they have a theme day for bread, and different cheeses, soups, or breakfast for dinner which are all pretty good. Also, with the meal plan for students they get Blue Bucks and Dining Dollars, Blue Bucks go to the restaurants found in University buildings, such as the Panda Express, Wendy's, Subway, Auntie Ann's Pretzels, and others found in the union. Dining Dollars go to University Run snack bars, where students can buy toiletries frozen meals, freshly made sandwhiches or pizza, and many other things depending on which one you go to.",
            "Dorm life, or residence halls as they are called here, is awesome, I spent my freshman and sophomore years in the residence halls and had a great time. Each residence hall has its own feel to it, and you can find one that fits you. Michigan has several programs that specify for students to live together, the RC, or residential community, is a group of students that have meetings, events, and get togethers with focuses on their group members interests. Sometimes it may be the more artsy folk, and in general it is a great resource especially for those focusing on a foreign language, because you meet with your classmates over lunch and dinner and speak the language, and most of the classes will be held in that dorm. There is also Women in Science and Engineering, which is tough to get in to and maintain a high GPA, but it allows girls who want to go into the sciences to live in Mosher Jordan, a really nice RH, and gives them tools and credentials that they can put on there resume.",
            "Michigan maintians a rigorous course schedule for a variety of majors. Students should realize that if they get in, it won't be like high school where you maintained top of your class. You are surrounded by top class students from around the country and world here. Try to maintain your homework load, and not get behind, and if you don't get the subject, teachers always hold office hours, and GSI's and TA's also increase the amount of one on one help students can get. Not to mention if you are going into the sciences, the Science Learning Center holds free study groups that have students who have previously gotten A's or high B's in the course guiding you along the way with extra insight, and old practice problems.",
            "Prospective students should come into this school, hoping to explore every option open to them. Meet with advisers early, and join clubs and organizations that can open doors for you down the road when you are making decisions for your career. Make sure to stay on top of your classes though, it is easy to get behind, and Michigan upholds the stigma of its tough courses, but don't be afraid to get help. Whatever you do try to take advantage of the diverse life, and cultures this campus brings, there are events and promotions going constantly so just keep your eyes out and have a good time.",
            "The University of Michigan, is an excellent college with opportunities for almost all types of students focusing on a variety of different careers. For being a large school it has many chances to gain one on one interaction with professors, like that of smaller schools, while at the same time offering the research and career opportunities that a large school can. It has excellent programs in the sciences, especially biology and psychology, along with top ranked pre-law and business concentrations."

It has given me the opportunity to meet new people and has aspired me to do new things. I look forward to graduating in 2015 and continuing into graduate school at University of Michigan- Ann Arbor so I rate U of M- Ann Arbor a 10 out of 10., 823031=U of M looks for the ideal well-balanced individual. Make sure that you balance a high GPA with decent extracurricular activities and a high SAT/ACT score. For those that want actual numbers: based on the students I have met here, most tend to come in with around a 3.8 or higher GPA and a fairly decent SAT score of 2000., 888428=Check out Restaurant Week. Twice a year (one week in January, and one week in June), select restaurants have a fixed menu for a fixed price (usually both lunch and dinner). It's a great way to experience expensive restaurants for a fraction of the price you would otherwise pay. Also, in January there's a concert at Hill Auditorium called the Collage Concert. Students from the School of Music, Theatre and Dance put on an incredibly diverse and fun concert. It's fun to see what your fellow wolverines on North Campus are doing all year! Go to the Arb, too. While most of Ann Arbor is more industrialized, the Arb is a great getaway for some time in nature., 625593=Over a 1000 different clubs., 348117=Nichols Arboretum (The Arb) is a popular place to go for a run or to hang out and clear your head. The Safe Sex Store on South University is a classic store. Ann Arbor is well-known for Zingerman's deli, which has excellent sandwiches and other delightful treats. Legend has it that if you kiss someone under the arch between east hall and west hall by south university and the diag at midnight, you will marry them. Also, we have a hash bash in April that is one of the biggest. Not endorsing that, just saying, it's there and it's unusual., 825668=There are over 1200 clubs on campus, so you can definitely find something that interests you., 838537=Check out Festifall and Winterfest to learn about some of our 2300 student clubs. There's something for everyone! From the many premed clubs to the community service clubs to the squirrel feeding club, you're sure to fit in somewhere., 608871=The campus is right in the city of Ann Arbor and is open to the public. Therefore, anybody can just walk on campus. There were several crime alerts throughout the 2011-2012 school year, but there was nothing really serious or violent. There are also many safety officials on campus., 181321=One very important aspect that I foolishly overlooked when applying to college was their academic schedule. Every university has a difficult schedule and some are more desirable than others. Michigan'\u00c2?s is a bit strange in that its summers are exceptionally long. School begins in early September and exams tend to be over around May 1st. The generous 4 month long summer happens because our Winter Break is far shorter than those elsewhere. Since I am an out-of-state student, I found flying home for such a brief time to be fairly annoying. If you can'\u00c3?\u00c2?t decide between schools, consider which summer and winter break trade-off would best suit your plans. For in-state students, who comprise roughly 2/3 of the student body, a good tip is to try and forge your own path away from your high school classmates. I know many in-state students who hung out with high school friends instead of meeting new hall-mates and classmates at the beginning of Freshman Year and later regretted this thoroughly. Make sure to come to Orientation and the beginning of Freshman Year ready to make new friends and connections. My roommate of three years was actually the 2nd person I met at Michigan. Michigan's weather is something that should not be taken lightly. I always thought I wanted a cold, northern university but I soon grew tired of how cold it gets in Michigan. Coming from Maryland, I was neither physically nor mentally prepared for the 5 months of frigid, snowy weather that Ann Arbor gets every year. While this does not make me regret coming to school at Michigan, it does make me regret not having a heavy winter coat and boots during my Freshman Year., 311266=Apply early. The longer you wait, the more competitive the admissions process becomes. If you're applying to the LSA Honors Program, try to write a good essay, but if it's late April and you still haven't submitted your application, just get something in before they fill up., 918551=University of Michigan is a huge campus and a lot of things are going on all the time in every department. I'm going to be joining the music department and this department alone houses at least 1000 students and recitals occur every day as well as rehearsals and concerts. Like in music, UMich is extremely strong in many areas and those students who want a greater challenge can even apply to be in special colleges for those who desire to get more out of their education., 106843=Be sure to apply early, as the increasing number of applicants put those who apply after the Early Action deadline at a disadvantage. Since Early Action is non-binding, it's also helpful so that you find out earlier and can begin planning, especially since this year many applicants didn't hear back until the end of April, 393787=over 1300 student groups. enough said. there is always something to do here. oh, and yeah we have a squirrel club with like 900 members that feed squirrels every sunday with peanuts., 750942=Apply for the November 1st Early Action Deadline. TOUR., 1105043=Superb dining experience in the newly renovated halls, though a few of the older ones are left in the dust and serve lackluster food. Stick to the more popular, new dining halls and find one that you like and eat there often. It can be very difficult to maintain a healthy diet given the amount of unhealthy options, desserts, and oil/fat included in most foods but it is possible. If you're trying to avoid the freshman 15, you have to be one of the rare ones who keeps the priority of health all year! For 2015, the West Quad dining hall is the one being renovated and will be newly opened, so try there if looking for a first option.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Elizabeth from Rochester Hills, MI 10/25/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 35 out of 35 people found this review useful. 2 of 257 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Any student who loves a challenge will thrive here. There is a high level of competition here, but there are also classes and departments where group work is the main method for homework. All types of students can thrive here, they just need to find their niche. Tips for prospective students Apply early! You'll find out if you got in a lot earlier, and it will increase your chance of getting in, too. Also, don't expect A's here. There is a high level of competition and you can't just skate by just by going to classes and taking notes. One more thing, don't be intimidated by the huge size of this school. It's really easy to make your own smaller school within the bigger university, especially if you're in the engineering school, school of kinesiology, or the business school. Bang for the buck",
