The first weekend in May, which marks the two week celebrations before finals and the end of school, is May Weekend, the biggest party weekend at QU., 154552=The school has over 100 different clubs and organizations. They hold many events such as concerts, dinners, carnivals, etc. Despite what many people think about typical school run events, they are actually a lot of fun to go to. Sporting events are also very popular to students. Basketball and Ice Hockey are the most popular sports since there is no football team. The Men's Ice Hockey team was ranked #1 in 2013 and went all the way to the Frozen Four. The biggest game of the year is the Quinnipiac-Yale game., 16589=May weekend, two weekends before finals everyone likes to party hard for a final time. The school actually use to sponsor it. Now the school does everything in their power to prevent it though, but they can't do much against off campus housing., 337108=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 269133=Our school went to the Frozen Four finals against Yale in 2012.

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck It is VERY expensive to go here, but in my opinion it is worth the debt because I'm having the time of my life! The only bad thing is that the food in the Cafe and the Bobcat Den is way over priced and your meal plan will go quickly, so you have to ration it and sometimes mooch off of others with more on their meal plan :P Am enjoying being here Being on campus is a blast and there is so much to do. Hike Sleeping Giant, hang out in the quad, go shopping in New Haven and Hamden, and of course the clubs on Thursdays and the weekends are a lot of fun. The rec center is pretty nice and intramural sports are a great way to get involved. There are a ton of clubs and organizations to get involved with. I transferred to QU in the spring semester and i had no problem making friends and getting involved. Everyone I've encountered has been extremely nice and genuine. The people here is what really makes this school so enjoyable. Am learning a lot All of my classes so far have challenged me. The professors are knowledgeable and more than willing to help you outside",
