If majoring in any type of science classes, make sure you are taking plenty of Ap classes in high school in orer to avoid having to take them at UTC. Always look ate RateMyProfessors.com before you choose your classes.",

However, we're paying 1600 a semester for a meal plan and only get 450 max in mocs bucks which is a rip off., 284158=I visited this campus during the 2013 Fall Visit Day. The students and facility were warm and full of spirit, but the campus visit experience fell well short due to logistical issues. Visiting campus with several hundred other families, listening to speeches over a horrible public address system, being herded around the campus in large groups was not a positive experience., 359447=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 351207=I got accepted to UTC a few months ago and I cannot wait to attend! I will be a freshman in the Fall 2015 semester! Go Mocs!, 204406=Not very challenging compared to other schools. May be hard for students who had easy classes in high school., 2351=Chattanooga is a very beautiful place and the campus is small enough to pass at least someone you know everyday. Classes are medium in size and you can always get individual help from professors or tutors. The food is good ranging from Quiznos and Chik-fil-A to wraps, sushi and salads. The brand new gym is wonderful and the Aquatic center, once completed Fall 2010, will be decked out with a swimming pool, lazy river and water slide. There are plenty of clubs, intramurals, etc. to join and the musical performances are great. Plenty of things to do on and off campus with downtown within walking distance.}",

Other than general education classes, most have what I call a 'high school' class size, around twenty-ish. Calling all business majors, the business school here is ranked one of the best in the country. It is great for students who do not want to be overwhelmed by a 30,000 student school, but would get bored at a small school with a thousand students. I love it! :) Tips for prospective students Please come visit! Maybe I'll see you around! :) If a student does apply, please apply for housing at the same time, don't wait! Even if you are not sure you are going to attend it is worth the small deposit fee, to guarantee a housing spot. Make sure the application is complete and on time! Be yourself! Have fun with the college admission process. Bang",
