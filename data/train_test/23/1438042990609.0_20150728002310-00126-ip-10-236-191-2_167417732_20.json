While the application supports the import of .mov files that use a general codec (like H.264 or AAC) by using the Windows Media Foundation library, other QuickTime specific codecs are not supported. Also, QuickTime allows for the import of audio formats like .mid, .midi, .m4p and .m4b. If you require the use of QuickTime, then we recommend using the 32-bit Windows version of Anime Studio Pro 9.5.}",
