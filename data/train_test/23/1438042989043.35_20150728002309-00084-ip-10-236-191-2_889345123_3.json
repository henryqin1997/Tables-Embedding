Your distribution supplied packages should be sufficient for this. From KDE 4.6 onwards HAL has been deprecated in favor of uDisk, uPower and related projects, but all but the most recent distributions will still require HAL. Some very old distributions may require you to compile a newer HAL, but this is likely to require many other packages to be upgraded and you are probably better off upgrading your distribution instead.

Details Qt >= 4.7.0 >= 4.7.0 Yes Qt is the toolkit that all KDE is built upon. Most distributions package a recent enough Qt to build KDE, although you may need to add an extra repository to do so. At some stage, KDE master may switch to relying on a development version of Qt, or may require patches to Qt for bug-fixes that have not yet been released by Qt. In this case you may need to build your own copy of Qt and",
