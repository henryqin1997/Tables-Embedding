Lemme said the necessary preparations could be made in a timeframe of four to six weeks. In other business: \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Council members unanimously approved a resolution authorizing the city to borrow $9.5 million from the Kentucky Infrastructure Authority for the city's waste water treatment plant expansion project, which is currently under construction. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The city waited until a $1 million grant from the Kentucky General Assembly and local funds set aside for the project were spent before taking the state Revolving Fund Loan to put off accruing interest. Mount Washington officials began working on expanding the city's treatment plant when the current plant began operating over its 900,000 gallons per day capacity. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The new plant will have the capacity to process 3.5 million gallons of water a day and accommodate a population of approximately 35,000. The $12.9 million project is being constructed by Lexington water utilities contractor W. Rogers Company and will be operational by Dec. 14. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* With January marking School Board Member Recognition Month in Kentucky, the council unanimously approved a resolution of appreciation honoring Bullitt County Board of Education members Sammy Allen, Dolores Ashby, Lorraine McLaughlin, Tim Wiseheart and Gary Wooldridge. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\"...Our school board members have demonstrated an unwavering commitment that the children of this community will receive an education that will benefit them for the rest of their lives and set them on paths to being solid citizens of this or any other community,\" the resolution stated. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0* Councilman Barry Armstrong extended his sympathy to those killed and injured in the Arizona shooting that resulted in six deaths, including a nine year-old girl and a federal judge. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\"Our thoughts are with those who lost loved ones and we wish those wounded a swift recovery,\" he said. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The next regular meeting of the Mount Washington City Council will be held at 6:30 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 24 at the City Annex Building on Branham Way. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The public is invited to attend., 30725=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0MOUNT WASHINGTON - Near the end of the 2009-2010 Council city officials considered a measure introduced by then councilman Gary Lawson that would have permitted establishments with by-the-drink licenses to sell mixed drinks on Sundays after 1 p.m.}",
