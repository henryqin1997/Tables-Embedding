Rovers are approaching the game, determined to progress further in the competition and will not underestimate the passion and commitment of their near neighbours from the amateur game., 17925=THE Newtown Jets and Balmain Tigers are pleased to jointly announce that all future VB Premier League matches between the Newtown and Balmain clubs will be played for a trophy to be named after Trevor Ryan and Neil Pringle. Trevor and Neil were outstanding Rugby League footballers who played with distinction for both the Newtown and Balmain clubs in the 1970's and 1980's. Both of these champions said they were extremely proud to be honoured by their old clubs in this manner, and that they hoped the trophy would provide the focus for more great games between these famous Sydney sporting institutions. Newtown RLFC Chief Administrator Terry Rowney and Balmain RLFC Chairman David Trodden said they were very enthusiastic about this development, because it would add even more interest to the VB Premier League clashes between the two clubs. The Ryan-Pringle Trophy will create another chapter in the proud history of these two inner western 1908 Foundation clubs. Newtown meets Balmain at Henson Park this Saturday, 5th June, in the NSWRL VB Premier League, with the match timed to start at 3.00pm. In the NSWRL Jim Beam Cup curtain-raiser starting at 1.15pm, Newtown plays Souths Juniors.}",
