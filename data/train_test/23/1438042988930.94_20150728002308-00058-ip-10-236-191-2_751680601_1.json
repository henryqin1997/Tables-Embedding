Such individuals should have their regimens selected after a careful review of their treatment history in order to optimize the likelihood of success. This may have been difficult to do before 2002, when this cohort was assembled, since fewer treatment options were available at the time.

To answer, the researchers looked at the database of the Danish HIV Cohort Study, a large cohort of HIV-infected people in Denmark who are receiving HAART. For when highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is initiated, most practitioners have developed approaches to optimize factors such as an individual's commitment, adherence to treatment and management of any short-term side effects. Doing this helps ensure that treatment will be successful, with \"success\" generally measured as virologic suppression within the first six months. Thereafter, the goal is to manage HIV as a long-term, chronic illness, with few, if any, ongoing manifestations of",

The easy conclusion to reach from this study is that incomplete viral suppression during the first six to 18 months of therapy predicts loss of virologic suppression, more rapid immune disease progression and mortality six years later. However, a careful review of the patient characteristics shows that patients in Groups II and III were more likely to be injection drug users, for whom high levels of adherence to therapy and continuous virologic suppression may be more problematic, outside of specific programs such as directly observed therapy. Further, individuals in Groups II and III were more likely to have a lower baseline CD4+ cell count and to have received prior therapy (often during the first generation of HAART before 1999, and with interruptions), all of which are factors that predict therapeutic failure.",
