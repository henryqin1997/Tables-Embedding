            "The food and dining is wonderful because you don't have to wait in one line just for food and the is plenty of places that you can eat in the cafe and you also watch t.v while you are eating so I really like this a lot.",
            "I don't like the dorm life that much because the way the dorms are and I have to go up and down six flights of stairs to get to my room and I also dislike the fact that one floor has to share a bathroom but other than that I like the dorms.",
            "Well, for me I have difficulty in some of my classes due the fact that I don't have any books yet and other that everything is excellent.",
            "Make sure you check and see how much the school cost and if you don't have enough money to cover for your academic semester try to get scholarships. Also as a freshman its going to be harder than the rest of your years of college so the best thing for you is to focus the freshman year because its easy to drop your GPA but is hard to get it back up.",
            "Johnson C Smith University is one of the best HBCU college that is out here. I say this because even though this is historical black university it is a lot of diversity. This school also does a great job in preparing you for your career and how its going to be in the real world when we do graduate and be out on our own."

During the Golden Bull Academy which is a Program for incoming freshman I learned so much. Most importantly the school made me feel at home.

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Smith is a great place be for people who are: determined, optimistic, hard-working, unique, and confident. Incoming students should be confident in themselves before they get here because I've seen a lot of people come in one way and become completely swayed by their surroundings by the end of their first semester. Tips for prospective students - If you enroll here, do it for the long-haul, because the credits don't transfer out as easily as they transfer in. - Make sure if you have the opportunity to physically come and visit the school before you finalize your enrollment. While you are here ask a few students their opinion of the school, take everything into consideration but don't believe EVERYTHING your hear. Take all comments with a grain of salt. Bang for the buck In the past few years tuition has been on the rise. I wouldn't have an issue with this increase of tuition if things were being worked on on campus. This year it was increased to fund the acquisition of the street the school is located on. This is a great investment but many of the students would like the money to fix the issues on campus grounds before moving outward into the community. Am",
