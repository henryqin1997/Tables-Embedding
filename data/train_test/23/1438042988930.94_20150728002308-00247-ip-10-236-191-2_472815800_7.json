    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Though the invention has been described with respect to specific preferred embodiments, many variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the present application. It is therefore the intention that the appended claims be interpreted as broadly as possible in view of the prior art to include all such variations and modifications. Both embodiments 60 and 70 provide a DC peripheral power hub adapted to power a plurality of unique remote devices 72 from a single unit 44, such remote devices including a cell phone, PDA, MP3 player, etc. This peripheral power hub 44 may be an accessory to power converter 42, or, a stand alone device receiving power. For instance, the input cord 52 feeding PPH 44 may be directly coupled to an output of converter 42, as shown in FIG. 4, tapped from the DC coupler 48 without any down stepping by a buck circuit 28, or directly coupled to a DC source, such as via a cigarette lighter outlet, or other input source. Advantages of this embodiment 70 include that the buck circuits 28 are enclosed in the PPH 44, where each buck circuit 28 itself may be programmable using the associated programming resistor R1. In this arrangement, care must be taken that the remote device 72 is coupled to an output port having a desirable output voltage. Thus, the keys provide indicia of the output voltage",
