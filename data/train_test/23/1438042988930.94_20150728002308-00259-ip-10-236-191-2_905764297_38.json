            "All I have to say is there is security always patrolling the campus keeping us girls safe.",
            "There are multiple clubs and activities to choose from such as the event planners and Women of China club.",
            "For fun you can visit the library, relax on the grass with friends and have a picnic, our school is also next to USC so you can meet new people and explore the USC campus.",
            "For starters I love food. Mount St. Mary's has a variety of foods to choose from everyday. For example they have chicken salads, shrimp & chicken gumbo, french toast and many more options to choose from. There's also vending machines for light snacks.",
            "I actually don't stay on campus because I was a bit nervous being away from my family for my first year of college but like I said the campus is truly amazing and if I had the opportunity again to stay on campus I would have stayed.",
            "The classes are very challenging but at the same time if you don't understand the teachers are willing to provide you with information to help you better.",
            "My tips for prospective students is to definitely be very prepared. Study hard and learn to become more independent. Also, apply for Cal grant, scholarships, and financial aid. The more the merrier.",
            "Mount St. Mary's is a great school for women. The campus is astounding. Also, if you're someone who likes small schools and one on one attention this is definitely the school you want to attend."

I think the grill and the sandwiches are the best--only because it is the least salty. The breakfast is quite amazing here (FYI)., 140642=Mount St. Mary's College is great for women who are interested in female empowerment. The students could be more active on campus, and that may change in Fall 2012 now that we have our new President. We are a liberal arts college, so expect to be well-rounded!, 310675=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Nursing Biology Majors Sociology Physical Therapy also serious students who will not fall behind. Tips for prospective students Make sure you give your all once you start. Nursing program is extremely competitive. It is a small school so make sure you are out of the high school mind set and a serious college student. Learn to say no before you start, so you won't feel bad to saying no to go clubbing or a party. Also TIME MANAGEMENT. Bang for the buck Yes, even though it is expensive it is worth it. With your room and board you get an 80 dollar food allowance in the cafeteria. You get free tutoring, you can print papers, lecture notes, and personal items in the PC lab for free no charge. You have an online website called angel where you can see your lecture notes , and your grade. Some classes have online quizzes. The Psychological department you get free meetings with them up to 10 times. The library is wonderful with the study rooms. It is worth it. Am enjoying being here I love dorming it is a great experience. I have fun with my friends especially since it is a small campus it",
