            "For fun there are sooooo many events on campus. There are different organizations and sports to join to stay active. Also, look out for parties thrown by your classmates on facebook and twitter.",
            "Dining dollars were most definitely a plus. The cafe food is ok sometimes.",
            "Depending on where you are living is how your dorm life experience will be. My freshman year I stayed in Strozier main which is one of the final traditional dorms on campus. It was very small and I had a very bad ant problem. I wanted to go home :) but I stuck it out.",
            "Academics are rigor but most definitely useful and interesting. Make sure that your major is something that you are interested in so that going to class becomes something you enjoy.",
            "For prospctive students come with a ope mind because college is most definitely a big difference from high school. You have more freedom and more time on your hands, which could serve as a good and a bad thing. Just manage your time well and make the best out of everything. You may have to do stuff you never one before to enjoy your stay here because after all this is Carrollton (the country) and it's a big difference from the city.",
            "As the saying goes,Great things happen when you go west. West Georgia is by far one of the most academic and social inclined schools. It was one of the bet decisons I made!"

West Georgia has a great nursing program as well. Tips for prospective students As I have stated before, use your time wisely! The biggest change from high school to college is the responsibility. Set a pace for yourself and you'll do fine. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE! Procrastination leads to the overwhelming feeling and eventually becomes your enemy. The website www.ratemyprofessor.com is really handy. Check it out. Bang for the buck I like the fact that West Georgia isn't too expensive, and so do my parents. Am enjoying being here I am a commuter, just like a lot of other students that attend West Georgia, so for me, it",
