            "My safety on campus is rarely a concern. University of Kentucky has their own police department that surveillance the campus. They have recently created a safe path to all common areas and installed new lights.",
            "I plan to look into Greek life next year. During my first year at UK, I wanted to give myself time to acclimate to the demands of college. I have since been introduced to several members from a fraternity that have been great mentors for me.",
            "There are activities planned daily for University of Kentucky students. I have just joined the Arabic Language Club after taking Arabic as a foreign language. This is comical to those back home, because I used to be such a country boy.",
            "There is something for everyone at University of Kentucky. An outstanding aquatic and athletic center is available to all students interested in swimming, rock climbing, or general exercise.",
            "The campus library can be very intimidating when viewing it for the first time, but I have found that it has become my favorite place to study. It can be difficult to focus on classwork while in the dorm. I prefer to do all of my homework in the library.",
            "I have enjoyed my experience thus far at University of Kentucky. There are times when I may get a little homesick, but everyone is just a phone call or Skype away. I definitely made the best choice for my future by choosing UK.",
            "For fun, I often visit with friends, work out at the athletic center, catch a free movie on campus, or participate in an on-campus 5k run. There is always something to do on campus at University of Kentucky, and the staff and faculty are very good about informing students about upcoming events.",
            "The campus dining areas have excellent food. The Commons is great for home-cooked style meals, but there are several fast food options on campus, as well. Every eating place is clean and well-kept.",
            "Dorm life is what you make of it. Those who choose to stay in their room all of the time will not have as pleasant of an experience as one who takes advantage of the recreation rooms and lobbies.",
            "The academic work is challenging, but not impossible. As with any college, some courses are more difficult than others, especially depending on individual interests. However, I have learned a great deal and matured more with each course I've taken.",
            "Attend groups, activities, and events that are outside your comfort zone. This is your best way to meet new people. If you go to college with a friend, don't spend all of your free time with them. Go out on your own and create your own experiences.",
            "Coming from a very small town, I was anxious to experience life as a student at University of Kentucky. Thus far, I have enjoyed my courses, and my instructors have been very personable. The opportunities at UK are endless!"

I went from getting kicked out to returning three years later and accomplished a 3.25 GPA for the semester., 356203=This campus is gorgeous, there are safety measures everywhere, and everyone is incredibly helpful. I have yet to see someone who wouldn't point me in the right direction (or give me a completely random high-five when she realized we had the same major). I wish it was August already, and move-in day., 786307=Tour the campus in October - you'll see how big and beautiful the campus truly is before it's a little too chilly. Don't count UK out if you are from Lexington or a surrounding area: it can easily be your new home [somewhat] away from home!, 465115=Apply for scholarships and housing as soon as you can. The sooner you get this done the better chance you have of getting a good dorm or more scholarship money. Also apply for financial aid on Jan. 1., 513366=K Week introductory activities are awesome and a good way to get to know the campus, but don't get used to having fun and partying all the time. By September, you'll have to crack down on studying!, 355569=-Talk to everyone. That's why they're there. Financial aid counselor, admissions counselor, or just call. -Apply early. I had my application in as soon as I could (October) and got the decision letter in November. -GPA is important, so don't slack off, but practice your testing skills for the ACT or SAT. My GPA was 2.98, but I got accepted with an ACT score of 32. -Visit the campus anytime you get the chance. It's beautiful. And bring an umbrella!, 299375=The greek life is great they help with community service events the NPHC holds a Martin Luther King march every year which is fun. Also some of the Greeks in the NPHC have Yard shows, Step shows during homecoming and other fun events., 854033=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2528=When President Todd accepted the role as University President, he brought with him the Top 20 business plan meaning, thus, that the university will be a in the top 20 by the year 2020. Therefore, the University of Kentucky is making progress to become on of the top 20 schools in the nation. The William T. Young Library, a 58 million dollar complex, has the nation's second largest book endowment second only to Harvard University and is the largest among Public Universities. Also, on a side note the fifth floor was voted the best place on campus to get a date., 348057=Willy T which is the library is always filled during exam week and its almost a social event as well as a study event. Also during March Madness the city of lexington gets out of control and thats something that everyone should experience.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Even though UK is a pretty big school, they make it more like a small school by keeping many classes with a low student to teacher ratio, so you receive more one on one time with your instructor, which makes it easier to grasp the bigger concepts and master the small ones. Login to rate or flag the reviews Kelsey from Georgetown, KY 12/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 18 out of 18 people found this review useful. 3 of 196 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Anybody! UK is VERY diverse and offers opportunity for any kind of student. Tips for prospective students Definitely live on campus for at LEAST one year. It's awesome! Apply early for housing though... or you wont get your assignment until late summer and you definitely wont get the dorm you want. GET INVOLVED! There are so many opportunities to do this, don't worry. Take advantage of resources like The Study",
