Halie Smith, Director of the Appalachian Entrepreneurial Development Program at ALC, introduced guest speaker Johnathan Gay, Executive Director of MSU ICC. Mr. Gay interacted with the audience to inspire ideas that could potentially create a successful enterprise in eastern Kentucky. He continued to discuss the process of becoming an entrepreneur and encouraged students to work towards their goals. The conversation sparked an interest in a handful of students to create an entrepreneur club, which is already being implemented.}",
