A total of 14 two-man player groups will visit on average three schools each, reaching approximately 2,500 children from years three to nine over the course of the day. At each school the players, in conjunction with ARL Development Officers, will lead a 30 minute NRL Backyard League Clinic, to be followed by a question and answer session. Team Named to Play Roosters Trial The blitz takes place two days out from the Bulldogs opening trial match of the year, with head coach Kevin Moore naming a 24-man squad to tackle the Sydney Roosters at Leichhardt Oval on Saturday (kick off 5pm).
