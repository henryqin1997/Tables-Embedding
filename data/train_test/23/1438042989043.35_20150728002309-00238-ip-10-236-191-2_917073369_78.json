            "I feel very safe on campus. There is a campus police department near by the public transportation, located towards the largest part of campus. It is also a very trusting environment. I can go to the restroom without having to worry that someone is going to take my backpack and computer from my seat in the library.",
            "This is great for students who like big city living. It is smack in the middle of downtown Denver with many opportunities to get involved. It is also great for students who want to major in the maths and sciences. These are the strongest departments.",
            "A nontraditional location on campus is the Tivoli building. This building is similar to a student life center; but, it is much more diverse than usual. Not only does it have information for the colleges, student government, loans, internships, etc. It has a food court. It has 3 or 4 study areas for students. The campus book store is located there. There are theatres and class rooms in the building. There are a total of 5 floors and many, many rooms.",
            "I would say the worth is average. I like the campus and they have lots of things to do. Yet, the classes aren't as rigorous and involved as I would like them to be. I don't get challenging assignments or learn many new concepts in class.",
            "There are so many activities available for students. There are bulletin boards posted all over campus with fliers for fun things to do. They advertise for sports, theatre (open auditions), downtown Denver parties, block parties, dorm events, etc. The activities I have gone to have been really fun and not too expensive.",
            "The best food/dining place on campus is the Courtyard Cafe in the North Building. It offers really good tasting, healthy food for a lower price than normal. Whenever, I buy my lunch, that's where I go to eat.",
            "I do not, nor have I ever lived in the dorms; however, I have heard they are good for students from out of Colorado. They allow for social connections and college life participation. Many of my friends are enjoying the dorms.",
            "It is average regarding academic rigor. I don't find it very challenging or rigorous, except for the high amount of essays required in classes.",
            "I would suggest that prospective students look into their degree program before applying for and deciding to go to this school. For some degree programs, there is a strong, high curriculum with many opportunities to get hands on work. However, some programs, like the music program, are weak and very minimal. Also, many programs aren't offered at this school so look to make sure they even have your desired major/minor.",
            "The University of Colorado in Denver is on a very large campus with many students. It is often times a little overwhelmingly busy. But, the people are typically pretty welcoming."

Tips for prospective students Stick with it. The only thing i regret this year is backing out of somethings i shouldn't have. The best way to become a solid college student is to get involved. The rate of drop out students increses when they don't get involved with the UCD community. And if you're going to drop out it's just a waste of money. And trust me if",
