    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{260839=After losing four World Series over the span of eight years, the 1955 Dodgers finally broke through with a title, beating the rival New York Yankees in seven games., 169572=They were not as dominant as the 1907 team or even the 1906 team that came up short in the World Series, but the 1908 Cubs were still awfully good thanks to their terrific starting rotation., 204926=The offense was middle-of-the-road at best, with Paul Konerko (.909 OPS, 40 HR, 100 RBI) and Jermaine Dye (.846 OPS, 31 HR, 86 RBI) leading the way, but it came up with the big hit time and again in October., 278238=Though not quite as dominant at the 1927 Yankees, the Yankees were again a dominant force on their way to a title in 1932., 304057=Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees dominated much of the 1920s and 1930s, but the 1929 season was all about the Philadelphia Athletics, as they won the AL pennant by a whopping 18 games over those same Yankees., 108611=The 1994 Montreal Expos go down as one of the biggest what-ifs in baseball history, as they had the best record in baseball when the strike prematurely ended the season., 243375=The Atlanta Braves won 14 straight division titles from 1991 to 2005, but the only time they managed to cash in with a World Series title was during the 1995 season., 226028=Not quite as dominant at they were the previous year, the 1928 Yankees still featured essentially the same roster as the vaunted 1927 team, and they had no trouble claiming another title, sweeping the Cardinals., 230169=One of the best pitching teams of all time, the 1963 Dodgers won it all on the strength of their two aces, as Sandy Koufax (25-5, 1.88 ERA, 306 K)\u00a0was just beginning his dominant run and Don Drysdale (19-17, 2.63 ERA)\u00a0was a legitimate second ace., 143576=Behind offseason trade acquisition Frank Robinson, who hit .316 with 49 home runs and 122 RBI to win the Triple Crown and AL MVP honors, the 1966 Orioles swept the Los Angeles Dodgers and won the first of what would be four AL pennants in six years., 117311=The 2011 Philadelphia Phillies may have been the better team on paper with their trio of aces, but it was the 2008 version that took home a World Series title., 213027=A year after going 73-89, the 1969 \"Miracle\" Mets trailed by as many as 10 games on Aug. 13, but they mounted a fierce late-season push to win the NL East by nine games., 173837=After going 85 years between titles before winning it in 2004, it took the Red Sox just three years to claim another one. They absolutely dominated the Colorado Rockies in the World Series, out-scoring them 29-10 in a four-game sweep., 125978=The 1929 Athletics rank as one of the greatest teams of all time, but the 1931 team actually won three more games during the regular season. However, the team dropped the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games, so they fall down to the bottom of the list here., 313011=The marquee team of the \"Big Red Machine\" era in Cincinnati, the 1975 club won the title in seven games over the Red Sox in what very well may be the greatest series ever played., 299736=While the home run race between Roger Maris (.993 OPS, 61 HR, 141 RBI) and Mickey Mantle (1.135 OPS, 54 HR, 128 RBI) and the legendary mark of 60 home runs set by Babe Ruth took center stage, the 1961 Yankees were a great team top to bottom., 112889=The 1983 Baltimore Orioles claimed the team's first World Series title since 1970, and they have not won one since, only reaching the postseason three times in the past 30 years. The Orioles\u00a0dominated in '83 though, going 7-2 in the playoffs and besting the Philadelphia Phillies 4-1 in the World Series., 208776=The 1968 Tigers featured baseball's last 30-game winner, as Denny McLain went 31-6 with a 1.96 ERA to win AL Cy Young and MVP honors., 313470=Pitching was the real difference for the 1975 team, as its 3.37 ERA ranked third in the league and the staff was a legitimate weapon alongside the high-powered offense. Gary Nolan, Jack Billingham and Don Gullett all won 15 games., 346688=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Kenny Lofton stole 54 bases, while Manny Ramirez, Jim Thome, Paul Sorrento and Eddie Murray each had at least 20 home runs., 295420=Perhaps the greatest dead-ball era team of all time, the 1902 Pirates posted the second-best winning percentage in baseball history with a .741 mark that trailed only the 1906 Cubs (.763)., 204631=Behind the four workhorse arms of\u00a0Mark Buehrle (16-8, 3.12 ERA), Freddy Garcia (14-8, 3.87 ERA), Jon Garland (18-10, 3.50 ERA) and Jose Contreras (15-7, 3.61 ERA), the White Sox steamrolled through the postseason to their first World Series title since 1917., 321850=With their heralded \"Murderers' Row,\" led by legends Babe Ruth (1.258 OPS, 60 HR, 164 RBI) and Lou Gehrig (1.250 OPS, 47 HR, 175 RBI), the 1927 Yankees had one of the most fearsome lineups in baseball history.\u00a0They led the league in batting average and runs scored, as their pitchers got plenty of support., 247671=The highest-ranked team on this list to not win the World Series, the 1954 Indians are widely regarded as one of the best pitching teams of all time, and they piled up 111 wins to capture the AL pennant by eight games., 265183=After a dominant regular season in which they won the NL East by a whopping 21.5 games, it took the legendary Bill Buckner error and a Game 7 win for the 1986 Mets to come away with a World Series title., 322454=The 1927 Yankees are widely regarded as the best team in baseball history, and I tend to agree with that notion, as they earn the top spot in these rankings., 239000=At 116-36, the 1906 Cubs have the best winning percentage (.763) in baseball history, as they won the NL pennant by 20 games. However, they fell to the crosstown Chicago White Sox 4-2 in the World Series, keeping them from ranking higher on the list., 256449=After edging out the Brooklyn Dodgers for the NL pennant by just two games, the 1942 Cardinals won the first of what would be three World Series titles in five years when they topped the New York Yankees 4-1., 200009=The Toronto Blue Jays have only won two World Series titles during their time as a franchise, and they came back-to-back in 1992 and 1993. Thanks to the additions of Paul Molitor, Rickey Henderson and Tony Fernandez, the '93 club gets the nod as the better of the two., 147849=The 2002 Los Angeles Angels reached the postseason as the AL Wild Card, despite winning 99 games during the regular season, as the Oakland A's won 103 games to claim the AL West. They rolled through the ALDS and ALCS before falling behind 3-2 in the World Series., 139359=No World Series was played in 1904, or the New York Giants would have been the overwhelming favorites to win it, as they claimed the NL pennant by 13 games over the Chicago Cubs. They would win it all the following season with essentially the same group of guys., 161059=The 1912 Boston Red Sox won the first of what would be four titles in seven years for the franchise and just the second championship in the team's history. They claimed the AL pennant by 14 games over the Washington Senators before topping the New York Giants in seven games., 308559=The winningest team in the storied history of the\u00a0Yankees franchise, the 1998 squad rolled through the regular season and on into the postseason, where it went 11-2 and swept the San Diego Padres in the World Series., 186696=The A's pulled off a three-peat from 1972 to 1974, but the 1973 group is considered to be the best of the bunch, as the rotation featured three 20-game winners and the offense led the AL in runs scored., 221614=Connie Mack and his \"$100,000 infield\" were at their best in 1910, as the team won 102 games to claim the AL pennant by 14.5 games on its way to a 4-1 World Series win over the Chicago Cubs., 217416=At the plate, Orlando Cepeda (.923 OPS, 25 HR, 111 RBI) took home NL MVP honors for the 1967 Cardinals, while Lou Brock (.799 OPS, 21 HR, 52 SB) and Tim McCarver (.822 OPS, 14 HR, 69 RBI) had solid season as well., 200580=Joe Carter (.802 OPS, 33 HR, 121 RBI), John Olerud (.363 BA, 1.072 OPS, 24 HR, 107 RBI), Roberto Alomar (.900 OPS, 17 HR, 55 SB) and Molitor (.911 OPS, 22 HR, 111 RBI) made up a dangerous lineup, and Carter delivered one of the biggest home runs in baseball history to secure the title., 152420=The 1957 Milwaukee Braves captured the franchise's first World Series title since 1914, and it's first since moving from Boston to Milwaukee, besting the New York Yankees in seven games., 178018=The 1954 Giants were clear underdogs to the Cleveland Indians heading into the 1954 World Series, but they seized the momentum in Game 1 and ran with it on their way to a sweep, as Willie Mays turned in \"The Catch\" and Dusty Rhodes delivered the pinch-hit, walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th., 234637=The Red Sox reached the playoffs as the AL Wild Card in 2004 and wound up being the team that broke the 85-year title drought known as the Curse of the Bambino. Down 3-0 in the ALCS, they mounted the most impressive comeback in baseball history to knock out the rival Yankees and reach the World Series., 134935=In a World Series that was interrupted by the Loma Prieta earthquake, the 1989 Athletics dominated the San Francisco Giants, sweeping them in four games and out-scoring them 32-14., 191154=They came up short against the Braves in the World Series, but the 1995 Indians had one of the best offenses in baseball history and a solid rotation to back it., 317434=With the largest run differential in baseball history at plus-411, you can make a compelling case for the 1939 Yankees as the greatest team of all time, but they come up just short of their 1927 counterparts on this list., 182360=Though not nearly as dominant as the 1998 team from a statistical standpoint, the 1999 Yankees had little trouble bringing home the team's third title in four years. They were 11-1 in the playoffs and outscored the Atlanta Braves 21-9 in a World Series sweep., 269636=On the back of aces Christy Mathewson (31-9, 1.28 ERA, 338.2 IP) and Joe McGinnity (21-15, 2.87 ERA, 320.1 IP), the Giants best the A's in five games in the 1905 World Series., 282583=On the back of a phenomenal pitching staff, the 1907 Chicago Cubs won the first of two straight titles, as the team posted an MLB-record 1.73 ERA on the year., 121707=The first of three Orioles teams from the same era to crack this list, the 1969 Orioles came up short in the World Series, but they won a team-record 109 games while ranking second in the AL in runs scored and first in team ERA, earning them a spot on this list.}",
