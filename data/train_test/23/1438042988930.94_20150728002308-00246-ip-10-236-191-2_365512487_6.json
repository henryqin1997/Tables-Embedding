Route List Topo Be careful when parking as there have been break-ins. If you have a 4x4-type vehicle it might be better to drive farther up that dirt road. Alternatively park near the entrance of the naval base and endure the longer walk (about 500m). See Climb ZA Thread Drive up Ou Kaapse Weg from the Cape Town side and take the first turnoff to the left (after a few hundered metres). Park at the next turnoff to the right and walk up to the badly eroded dirt road (15 minutes) and then take the path to the left which leads to the crag. How to get there The Mine is one of the most popular sport crags in the Cape Peninsula. The rock is a hard sandstone with most routes involving at least one or two overhangs. The view from the crag is wonderful and there is plenty of space to roam around at the bottom of the crag. The crag generally dries out quickly after rain",
