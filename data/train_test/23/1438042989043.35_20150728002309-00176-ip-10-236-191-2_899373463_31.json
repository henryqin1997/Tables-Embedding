            "Our campus safety people are amazing, and always willing to help people out. I always feel particularly safe walking to my car after I get off work (I work in the Student Center as a student worker) because they want us to call them and make sure they are with us at night.",
            "We have a rather lengthy list of clubs at Highlands, but some of the ones that seem to have more student support would be Gaming Club, Phi Beta Kappa, Creative Writers Collaborative, Highlands Interactive Programming, Green Highlands, SGA, Cru, and Emerging Leaders",
            "Students who want to go to college, but don't have the money saved up to go to a 4-year institution yet. I have also seen quite a few 'adult learners' at GHC, and the fact that the classes run from early morning to late evening seem to work out well for these types of people. This is also a good school for someone who is looking to get their GPA up before transferring to another college.",
            "I am technically being paid to go to college at this point, because my financial aid covers the cost of the school and then gives me what is left over after that. I think that the education I am getting is on the same level with many students from institutions that cost a lot more than Highlands.",
            "We have recently acquired a Student Center on the campus I attend, and we now have a gaming room with a billiards table, televisions that are HDMI compatible with gaming systems. I often enjoy hanging out with the Gaming Club that frequents this area and we will play cards in the gaming room. We also have a good many sports through-out the year, and a great favorite of those is flag football which takes place in the Fall.",
            "I have never had anything from the Charger Cafe that I didn't like, but the choices are very limited since the cafe is just a small place.",
            "I attend the Cartersville campus, and there are not dorms there, but there are ones on the Marietta campus.",
            "While the classes here are no more difficult than from the 4 year school at which I began my college career, I will say that the fact that the professors enjoy teaching at GHC makes the classes much more interesting and easy to stay active in.",
            "Even though this is a community college never take things as if they were any easy than a 4 year university, because that will get you nothing more than a low GPA by the end of your first semester."
