Increased smartphone production helped sales in the consumer segment. However, the year-over-year decline in revenues was on account of a inventory imbalances and weakness in the distribution system., 14886=by Zacks Equity Research \u00a0\u00a0Published on December 13, 2012 |, 63768=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 20211=Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (MXIM - Analyst Report) is planning to sell its digital video processing business to GEO Semiconductor for an undisclosed amount. The deal is expected to close by Dec 31, 2012., 23473=As per MarketsandMarkets, the global smartphones market may reach $258.9 billion by 2015, which represents significant growth opportunity for Maxim. It therefore makes sense for Maxim to divest its video processing business and concentrate more on the smartphone market, which is expecting robust growth in the long term., 63707=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research}",
