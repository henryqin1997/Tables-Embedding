            "The police are always roaming around campus. There are also several call boxes located in random parts of campus. The police are very serious about their job and will come to you within three minutes of where ever you are. You must swipe a card in order to get into a lot of places so that keeps intruders from being able to sneak in as well.",
            "I'm not a part of Greek Life, but many of my friends are. From what I can tell, they seem to keep them relatively busy and sometimes it can be hard to balance that with their grades. However, it seems really fun and they get to go on educational trips sometimes. Also, it helps out in the long run by gaining connections like that.",
            "There's so many groups and activities, especially during the Fall semester.",
            "The campus is extremely diverse. Anyone with any particular hobby would be able to fit in with a lot of people. I feel like we're a pretty accepting campus. There's several groups and clubs who are open-minded.",
            "Like I previously stated, EKU isn't that costly of a school. However, the books and the meal plan is what takes a lot of students down. I recommend getting a job on campus if possible and make sure that you are able to get lower hours, but just enough to pay for the essentials.",
            "There's a lot to do at EKU during the weekdays, many clubs and frets set up different events in order to publicize their organizations. Sometimes you can participate for free stuff and get a free meal or two out of it too. Everyone loves the ravine because it's usually so beautiful during the warmer seasons so they go there and hang out to take a break from classes. Some clubs even host a video game night which a lot of people attend.",
            "The dining at Eastern honestly isn't that bad on the weekdays. During the weekends however, is a different story. The breakfast is always nice, they make bacon, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc. You can even make your own omelette. However, I feel like because most of the students either go out of town or back home during the weekend they do not try as hard. Plus, they have a roach problem. Other than that though, the food usually taste great and there's a lot to choose from on campus. There's Subway, a Chinese Restaurant, a Mexican Place, a Starbucks, and a lot of other locations to fit one's fancy.",
            "I love dorm life because there's always so many programs and events going on inside campus. I believe that if one were to live in an apartment off campus that they would probably miss out on getting to know a lot of new people. The dorms are also usually very safe and make me feel secure, beside the fact that it's really hard to find a parking spot. When that happens, sometimes one has to walk by themselves in the dark.",
            "The Noel Studio is one of the places that saved me in some of my classes. The Noel Studio is located in the library and its purpose is to help students with essays and tutor them in various subjects. There's always some kind of club on campus too in order to help struggling students. Most of the time professors are understanding enough to explain and give students individual attention outside of class.",
            "I recommend that prospective students should look on ratemyprofessor.com before signing up for any classes, it can be very helpful. I think that they should get into a club around their sophomore year. It's not a very costly school, but I recommend earning any types of scholarships or grants as possible, the books prices can be bothersome.",
            "Eastern Kentucky has a beautiful campus. Usually, the school is consisted with many understanding professors who will work with you. Lastly, the people who attend are very diverse, no one would have any problems making friends!"

I have completed a lot of my classes and have gotten extra certifications that I wouldn't have been able to at other schools and I feel that I am actually prepared for my career., 339489=I started here at EKU in Fall of 2013. I love the campus size, classroom sizes, teachers, and most importantly the students here as well. There will always be something to do on and off campus. You're not far from Lexington and Louisville, either. Everyone on campus is here to make sure you become successful. I plan on graduating from here. #ColonelPride, 108227=If you are looking to major in Education then EKU is the school for you. The major courses there are specifically designed to make you feel confident in all content areas. I am set to graduate in December of this year and I feel very satisfied with the education I have recieved.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The residence life here is more than I thought it'd be. I went to Colonel Camp before school started, and it really helped introduce me to my best friends! The best part is we all live in the same dorm and on the same floor. I love that the campus is so small. It takes about 5 minutes to get anywhere, so when you're hungry or you want to work out or go study, it just takes a very short walk to get there. Am learning a lot You learn a lot if you make it to every class and do all the readings required. It's tough, but anyone can do it. Get to know your teachers, they help more than you'd think. And they do understand what is happening with all the changes in our lives, don't be afraid to let them know what's going on!
