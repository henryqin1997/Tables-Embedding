    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{8499=In 1992, then-boss JOHN J. GOTTI was on trial for federal racketeering and murder charges in the Eastern District of New York. MODICA, along with various other Gambino Family members, took part in a plot to locate the anonymous, sequestered jurors sitting on that trial. MODICA and the others eventually penetrated various security measures, and located the jury at the hotel where it was sequestered. The plan to tamper with the jury was called off, however, when GOTTI came to believe that the jury would not convict him, even without outside interference., 7752=From 2008 to 2009, numerous defendants, including OREFICE, DIFIORE, MANZELLA, SCOTTO, EISLER, MAIURRO, and PORCELLI, operated a prostitution business where young women and girls were exploited and sold for sex. The defendants first recruited various young women and girls to work as prostitutes. They then advertised the prostitution business on Craigslist and other websites. The defendants drove the women to appointments in Manhattan, Brooklyn, New Jersey, and Staten Island to have sex with clients. They then took approximately 50 percent of the money paid to the young women. They also made the women available for sex to gamblers at a weekly, high-stakes poker game., 6518=In 1997, suspicion arose within the Gambino Family that FRANK HYDELL, MARINO\u2019s nephew, was cooperating with law enforcement, which he was. Based on these suspicions, various Gambino Family members and associates plotted to kill HYDELL and sought MARINO\u2019s approval for the hit. In his guilty plea, MARINO admitted that he gave his co-conspirators the \u201cgreen light\u201d for the murder to proceed. Upon MARINO\u2019s authorization to kill HYDELL, various Gambino Family members and associates lured him to a strip club in Staten Island where he was shot three times in the face and back. HYDELL, 31, died in the strip club\u2019s parking lot., 7262=On August 22, 1987, MODICA\u2019s motorcycle was used in connection with the drive-by shooting of two individuals in Staten Island, JAMES DIGUGLIELMO and RICHARD SBARRA. After the murders occurred, MODICA made false statements to the police and helped to hide and destroy evidence in an effort to protect the individuals who killed DIGUGLIELMO and SBARRA from being arrested and convicted., 22260=10.14.10, 4193=PREET BHARARA, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced the sentencing of nine members and associates of the Gambino organized crime family of La Cosa Nostra (the \u201cGambino Family\u201d) who were charged, along with five others, in Manhattan federal court in April 2010 with crimes including racketeering, murder, sex trafficking, extortion, and wire fraud. THOMAS OREFICE, DAVID EISLER, SALVATORE BORGIA, ANTHONY MANZELLA, ONOFRIO MODICA, DOMINICK DIFIORE, MICHAEL SCOTTO, MICHAEL SCARPACI, and KEITH DELLITALIA were sentenced yesterday and today by JUDGE LEWIS A. KAPLAN based on their convictions on various federal charges. The other five defendants were sentenced over the past several months. They are: DANIEL MARINO, THOMAS SCARPACI, STEVE MAIURRO, SUZANNE PORCELLI, and ANTHONY VECCHIONE., 9140=Between 2005 and 2009, OREFICE, DIFIORE, MANZELLA, SCOTTO, THOMAS SCARPACI, DELLITALIA, EISLER, and VECCHIONE extorted payments from various businesses and individuals through the use of violence and threats. The defendants targeted businesses in the construction, home heating oil, and financial services industries, as well as various individuals in and around New York City.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "United States v. Daniel Marino et al. The case is being handled by the office\u2019s Organized Crime Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys ELIE HONIG, NATALIE LAMARQUE, DANIEL CHUNG, and JASON HERNANDEZ are in charge of the prosecution. Mr. BHARARA praised the investigative work of the FBI. The charges contained in the indictment against each defendant, and the corresponding sentences, are contained in charts attached to this press release. OREFICE, MODICA, DIFIORE, MANZELLA, MICHAEL SCARPACI, THOMAS SCARPACI, EISLER, BORGIA, and DELLITALIA ran various illegal gambling operations for the Gambino Family. These operations included an Internet-based sports betting, or \u201cbookmaking,\u201d operation and a regular, high-stakes card game. Gambling OREFICE, DIFIORE and BORGIA trafficked in narcotics\u2014including cocaine, marijuana, and oxycodone\u2014for and on behalf of the Gambino Family. Narcotics Trafficking OREFICE and MANZELLA defrauded various high-end restaurants in New York City by inflating invoices for meat orders placed with MANZELLA\u2019s company and paying kickbacks to the chefs responsible for ordering the meat. The invoices were sometimes inflated by as much as 40 percent of actual costs. To ensure that the chefs at the restaurants would continue ordering meat from MANZELLA\u2019s company, and to encourage them to turn a blind eye to the scam, MANZELLA kicked back about five percent of the proceeds to them. Wire Fraud In the summer of 2009, SCOTTO assaulted an individual to collect an extortion payment for DIFIORE, leaving the individual unconscious. In the summer of 2009, OREFICE, DIFIORE, MANZELLA, THOMAS SCARPACI, and VECCHIONE plotted to extort the owner",
