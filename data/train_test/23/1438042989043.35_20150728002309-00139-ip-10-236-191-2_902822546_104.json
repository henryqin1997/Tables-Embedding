            "too many to name. music to golf to ping-pong to medieval and so on.",
            "anyone really. but definitely those who want an amazing education in an environment free from drugs, alcohol, smoking or other seemingly crazy party habits. there are tons of ways to have fun and still remember what you did the night before.",
            "oh the names. from h fack (hfac) to swicket (swkt) to the wilk (wsc) and more. traditions...at basketball games, all the chanting for every single different throw or pass, to football game flash mobs to true blue! (sliding down a blue foam covered slide during homecoming...it truly is great!)",
            "$2400 a semester! who wouldn't want that. housing ranges from heleman (being the traditional dorm) at around $700 a month to wyview being around $300 a month. wyview is the nicest apartment style living on or off campus for the price and condition it is in!",
            "there are always comedian shows and dances and game-nights and ballets and plays and anything and everything imaginable. there is always something going on. from board games in your apartment, a basketball game with the guys, to bowling on-campus...everything!",
            "there are three on-campus housing areas, one traditional dorm style, one full on apartment style living, and one slightly in-between. all three can be a part of the cannon center where it's all you can eat meals and heritage and wyview provide that opportunity or a certain amount of dining dollars a week, where you can spend it at the cannon, at the creamery (mini grocery stores right next to the housing areas), or directly on-campus at the food court (taco bell, subway, and more!). the food never ceases to be delish! from burgers, to international, to salad and fruit! plus, breakfast all-day long if you so desire.",
            "fantastic! with many opportunities and places to live, one can choose from a traditional dorm with a campus eatery buffet, to an apartment style dorm a little farther away but still considered on-campus dorm housing. there are always activities and adventures waiting! dance parties to hunger game type style competitions (minus the deaths of course!!!) to open-mic nights to study groups and more!",
            "the average student here merely says i'm only taking 14 credits where other university students often gawk at such a work load! the students here strive for perfectionism and many teachers throw in hard questions so that there can be an actual grading curve on tests. it is true, the students here truly are the best of the best and most all have attitudes where getting a b+ feels like failure. academics are difficult, but fair. they are so rewarding in the end, never failing to provide opportunity for growth and learning and definitely making us all better and more intelligent people in a forever changing world.",
            "plan ahead. be sure that, when you decide to take your sat or act, you take your time to prepare. although academics and your score is not everything, it does show a lot about how willing you are to make sacrifices for a wonderful education! so, prepare now to prevent failure or disappointment later.",
            "brigham young is full of life and spirit and is centered on giving the students here more than an education. they connect religious beliefs and living an overall better life in every classroom setting, providing each student the individual attention where needed. the people here are very diverse despite the stereotypes many assume and never fails to reward both, mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{35181=Starting 2011 Fall semester, BYU is requiring the ACT with Writing for admission. Take it., 1102362=Every week on Tuesday the entire campus shuts down, I mean the entire campus, as faculty, staff and students flood to the Basketball stadium to listen to a weekly devotional speaker. Like a cross between heterozygotes, 3/4 the time it is a spiritual topic and the other 1/4 it is an academic topic. Regardless, the talks are amazing and inspiring. Plus you will never have a class Tuesday at 11:00. It's a great time to scope out some of the opposite gender., 406966=$2400 a semester! who wouldn't want that. housing ranges from heleman (being the traditional dorm) at around $700 a month to wyview being around $300 a month. wyview is the nicest apartment style living on or off campus for the price and condition it is in!, 310671=Tuition here is mega cheap! At only $2280 per semester for LDS students, and $4560 per semester for non-LDS students, you won't find tuition so cheap at a private college, especially if you're out of state. And, if you're a great student, you might likely get a half-tuition or full-tuition scholarship. Living on-campus is a little pricey compared to the cheapness of tuition, but it's definitely more than worth it! The meal plans are also excellent, and the food at the Canon center is delicious!, 506288=Great education in world-class programs for under $12,000 total cost per year. Tuition is around $2000 for LDS students and $4000 for non-LDS students per semester. The biggest cost is housing., 133179=just about anything you want to do (that doesn't break the honor code) you can! there is a club night with over 150 clubs that meet, so if you want to make friends or practice hobbies or skills, that's the night for you. there are so many events on campus that you don't want to miss, too! also, every tuesday at 11:00 am, all of campus shuts down for a university devotional or forum (depending on which week it is) where a faculty member or esteemed public figure will come and speak to the students. it is a great time to enjoy learning without being held responsible for homework or tests. it also builds campus unity and helps everyone to relax part-way through the week., 806948=every sunday at 10:00 pm, there is tunnel singing in a tunnel by the bell tower, by the marriott center. We sing hymns, and the boys announce their mission calls. Its pretty fun!, 717268=At 5:15 every night the flag is taken down and everyone on campus stops while the national anthem is played., 261114=This is definitely worth the money. Great value of education for what you pay. Tuition/housing/books for this next year (Fall 2011- Winter 2012) will be from 8,000 to 9,000 and that not bad. That actually something I could afford with a partial scholarship and working full-time over the summer. I'm not expecting my parents to pay any of this!, 877909=The cost of a full-time LDS student, per semester, is about $2300 and the cost of a full-time non-LDS student, per semester, is about $4600. Even though BYU is a private university based on LDS values, you do not have to become LDS or Mormon to go there. You do have to commit to living a life with the same standards as the LDS church though, but it is intended for the student's benefit rather than the school's or church's. So per year, it costs under $10K for tuition which is extremely good for a private school, and still better compared to public universities. For information on tuition at BYU-Provo, go to http://finserve.byu.edu/content/tuition-and-general-fees ., 291344=Based on the online student and staff reviews of my professors and classes, I anticipate learning a great deal while at BYU. I am especially excited to be able to select from a wide variety of classes to fit my own personal learning interests. Also, BYU's Harold B. Lee library is an amazing place to study (the best corner of the library is reserved for Freshmen only) with all sorts of resources and study pockets. In fact, it was rated in 2010 as the 3rd best college library in the USA., 276885=It's one of the cheapest private universities you can go to. Just around $2200 a semester? Not bad., 288685=Work hard, and familiarize yourself with BYU's acceptance criteria. The average accepted BYU student has a 3.8 GPA and a 27 ACT (1860 SAT equivalent). That is a pretty tall order, but with some hard work and discipline its very attainable. The deal is, there are so many students who want to attend BYU (which was rated the #1 most popular US University in 2010) that BYU simply can't accommodate them all, so its extremely competitive admission. If you can get a 3.75 GPA, and a 26 or 27 ACT (or SAT equivalent) supplemented by an impressive list of extracurricular activities and leadership positions, this will almost guarantee you admission (NOT scholarships, just admission although you really won't need much scholarship money to pay for BYU). If you do get in, congratulate yourself because when they say in your acceptance letter that you've joined a select group of students they really mean it. *Note: Also, if you can play basketball like Jimmer Fredette, that could get you into BYU pretty quickly as well., 104846=Use the resources available to you on campus. There are so many offices made specifically to help you research, write, and learn. Take advantage of the opportunities to learn outside of your classes. Go to the Eyring Science Center and take some time to read about the different displays. There are a lot of free events put on by the different departments. There's a chemistry show in October that you don't want to miss. You can learn about the stars. You can go to the dinosaur museum, check out the art on display, visit the Bean Museum. Now let's get to learning inside the classroom. Make friends with your classmates. Don't be afraid to contact your professor with questions about the material. Get enough sleep OUTSIDE of class. You are on your way to learning a lot., 797927=BYU is a university privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and as such the students are expected to adhere to a standard that most universities do not demand of their students. This standard, though sometimes seemingly silly, turns out to be a blessing to those who take academic life seriously and truly wish to do something with their lives. If you are looking to party hard in college, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a place where you will get amazing schooling, make deep connections with friends from literally all over the globe that will last a lifetime, and learn about yourself as you learn about whatever you are studying, then this is one of the best schools for you. The campus is nestled just beneath the Wasatch mountain range, so the winters can get extremely cold and the snow can last from November to April, so be prepared for that. Also, the semesters are a bit different than most universities; fall semester starts at the end of August and continues through mid-December, and winter semester starts at the very beginning of January and ends mid-April. You may start school earlier than all of your other college friends, but at least you get a longer summer!}",
