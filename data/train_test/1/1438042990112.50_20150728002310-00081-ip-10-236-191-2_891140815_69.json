            "EXCELLENT. They have emergency call boxes every 20 feet and campus police are constantly patrolling.",
            "It is up and coming...it gets bigger every year.",
            "They do teal tuesday which is where they encourage all the students to wear teal colored clothing to support UNCW. They also have beach blast twice a year where they reserve a huge section of Wrightsville Beach so the students can hang out and win free stuff on the beach all day. They have Color Me Rad 5k each year where you can participate in a 5k and be splashed with all different colors. They also have several concerts and activities through student associations each year.",
            "The beach is obviously the number one activity if it is a good day. When winter comes around, there are many shopping areas around and historical places to visit.Also find a fraternity or sorority so you can go to parties.",
            "The dining on campus is phenomenal. Wag, Dubs, and Hawks Nest has something different at every hall and you will never be bored with the food; except maybe from Hawks Nest. The only downfall is the price if you only have food dollars or are paying by cash; meal swipes are the best.",
            "The dorm rooms are small and not exactly new. They get dirty often if you live on a rambunctious floor of a hall. They do frequent fire drills no matter what time of day it is.",
            "The classes can be difficult depending on the professor. For the most part, as long as you come to class and show that you are a hard worker, you will do fine. Just don't put things off till the last minute.",
            "Make sure you get involved on campus the first semester you come here. It is difficult sometimes to make strong relationships with people if you are not involved from the start. Make sure you stick to your studies and don't skip class often to go to the beach if it is a nice day; you'll regret it when you get your grades back.",
            "UNCW is a great school for students who are looking to study more than party. It is an absolutely beautiful campus with several dining halls and great professors. A con is that there isn't much going on on the weekends so lots of students travel back home instead of staying on campus for the weekend."

You won't regret it. Keep up to date with communication so you don't miss important information or dates. Apply early if you want to get scholarships. The honors college has many scholarships, but you have to apply to the honors college by april 1st to qualify., 360637=GET INVOLVED! Become a well-rounded student, not just academically achieved. Apply for scholarships, especially out-of-state applicants. If you plan to go here, bring an umbrella, rain jackets, summer clothes, and warm clothes-the weather is bipolar. Swimsuits and sunscreen- you can go to the beach in November. Always, always, ALWAYS use Rate My Professor...Always., 114309=Wagsgiving: In November, Wag gets people to cater thanksgiving food. It's a huge event and most of the campus goes. They even have shirts you can buy. Midnight Madness: It's pretty much homecoming. It's super fun, though. They give out free t-shirts and games. Haunted Hallways: Also a huge event. They decorate one of the dorms as a haunted house., 564030=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 393580=I love this school! It is currently October and still pretty hot, and the humidity can get pretty bad, but it is a really nice school! I am in the honors college so I am getting the best of both worlds: a great education and a great campus!, 6489=I am a transfer student from Appalachian State University and I'm just going to let you know, its a complete 180 from there. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and after about a week you know where all the buildings are. All the academic buildings are on this big long walk called Chancellor's Walk so if you're looking for your classroom, start there. During the first week Student Ambassador's are out there helping lost students and giving away free lemonade and water. Oh, and you probably already know this but the weather is gorgeous. It was the second week of November and I was out on the beach-where else can you do that?!, 240418=1. Get involved. I can't stress that enough. I was miserable first semester because I didn't do anything. Now I am having a blast! 2. Step out of your comfort zone. In order to make friends, you have to step out of your comfort zone and approach people! They're all friendly and nice! 3. GO TO EVENTS! Especially during the first few weeks of school, doing this will help you meet people. 4. Bring your car or make friends that have cars. You need a car to get around Wilmington... bikes and skateboards are only good for on campus! 5. Don't let the beach be the only reason you come here. It gets too cold to go in the water November-March, so you'll need things to do in the meantime! 6. MAKE SURE SCHOOL COMES FIRST! enough said. 7. If you live in the dorms, bring blankets. The AC is always blasting and it's freezing. 8. If you're in a big class, make sure you email and introduce yourself to the professor. This way it shows them that you care and they will eventually know your name! 9. Be open minded about classes. Take things that sound interesting to you. You may go in thinking you know your major, but you could be wrong, so have fun! 10. USE THE SERVICES ON CAMPUS! THEY'RE FREE!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Don't be intimidated to join clubs, organizations, Greek life, religious organizations and other groups. These are the BEST ways to meet friends that have common interests. I am involved in the equestrian team, Greek life, and two religious organizations and these people are some of my best friends. Bang for the buck Wilmington is a big enough city where there is tons of stuff to do but it's not like the campus is really spread out like State is. Wilmington offers a bunch of unique opportunities such as the ocean, close shopping, eclectic downtown area, historic landmarks, great professors, and tons of great opportunities on campus too.
