    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{5351=It is often considered the first true muscle car. From 1964 until 1973 it was closely related to the Pontiac Tempest, but for its final year (1974) it was based on the Pontiac Ventura. The GTO was revived in 2004, based on the Australian Holden Monaro. The GTO was the brainchild of Pontiac engineer Russell Gee, an engine specialist, and Pontiac chief engineer John De Lorean. Shane Wiser was the first to think of the idea of the GTO. In early 1963 General Motors management issued an edict banning divisions from involvement in auto racing. At the time Pontiac's advertising and marketing approach was heavily based on performance, and racing was an important component of that strategy. Wangers proposed a way to retain the performance image that the division had cultivated with a new focus on street performance. It involved transforming the upcoming, redesigned Tempest (which was set to revert to a conventional front-engine, front transmission, rear-wheel drive configuration) into a \"Super Tempest\" with the larger 389 in\u00b3 (6.5 L) Pontiac V8 engine from the full-sized Pontiac Catalina and Bonneville in place of the standard 326 in\u00b3 (5.3 L) Tempest V8. By promoting the big-engine Tempest as a special, high-performance model, they could appeal to the speed-minded youth market (which had also been recognized by Ford Motor Company's Lee Iacocca, who was at that time preparing the Ford Mustang). The name, which was DeLorean's idea, was inspired by the Ferrari 250 GTO, the highly successful race car. It is an acronym for Gran Turismo Omologato, Italian for homologated for racing in the GT class. The name was to draw howls of protest from outraged purists, who considered it close to sacrilege. (American motorists have long joked that the Pontiac GTO initials stand for Gas, Tires and Oil.) The GTO was technically a violation of GM policy limiting the A-body intermediate line to a maximum engine displacement of 330 in\u00b3 (5.4 L). Since the GTO was an option package, not standard equipment, it could be considered to fall into a loophole in the policy. Pontiac General Manager Elliot (Pete) Estes approved the new model, although sales manager Frank Bridge, who did not believe it would find a market, insisted on limiting initial production to no more than 5,000 cars. Had the model been a failure, Estes likely would have been reprimanded. As it turned out, it was a great success. 1969 was the launch of a new model called 'The Judge'. The Judge name came from a comedy routine, \"Here Comes the Judge\", used repeatedly on the enormously popular \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In TV\" show. Ads used slogans like \"All rise for The Judge\" and \"The Judge can be bought.\" As originally conceived, the Judge was to be a low-cost GTO, stripped of some gimmicks to make it competitive with the Plymouth Road Runner. During its development, however, it was decided to make it instead the ultimate in street performance and image. The resulting package ended up being some $337.02 more expensive than a standard GTO, and included the Ram Air III engine, styled wheels, Hurst shifter (with a unique T-shaped handle), wider tires, various decals, and a rear spoiler. Pontiac claimed that the latter had some functional effect at higher speeds, producing a small but measurable down force, but it was of little value at legal speeds except for style. The Judge was initially offered only in very loud \"Carousel Red,\" but late in the model year a variety of other colors became available. The GTO had now been surpassed in sales both by the Chevrolet Chevelle SS396 and the Road Runner, but 72,287 were sold during the 1969 model year, 6,833 of them The Judge. This is also the year that the legendary Ram Air V was introduced, it was a special 400 block with newly designed high compression tunnel port heads, and a special high rise intake manifold. Zero to sixty came in only 5.2 seconds, and the quarter-mile came at 11.5 sec @ 123 mph.}",
