            "My mom was so terrified for me to go to school in the city, however she had almost no reason. It is a safe area in general and the fact that people are always around helps you feel safe. Public safety people are present in buildings and sometimes seen outside. Just don't do something stupid like carry an unconcealed laptop.",
            "So I know NYU's Greek life will never compare to what it is down south, but I promise you it definitely exists. The way you rush at NYU slightly different from other colleges, but actually puts less pressure on you to get references and other stressful things. I actually like the way the Greek life works at NYU because it allows you to be involved without killing yourself to get in.",
            "There are literally hundreds of ACTIVE clubs at NYU. Whatever your interest is I am POSITIVE there is a club for it! There's even a cheese tasting club, and yes, they meet. There's a club fair at the beginning of the semester and I suggest you go just to see what you like, and have your options all in one place.",
            "Santacon, it's hard to describe if you don't know what it is but google it.",
            "Go out to museums, there's student discounts/free admission. Go out to eat (there's plenty of cheap and good place, just have to find them). Go to WSP or Central Park, just explore the city.",
            "No matter where you go to school, you will get tired of the dining hall food eventually, especially when you're forced to have a meal plan your first year. I do have to say that we have multiple dining options scattered around campus. There are also plenty of vegan/vegetarian options available (I am one and I've not once had an issue). They have gluten free options, but often you have to let the staff know. Definitely better than what I've seen at other schools.",
            "Okay so the dorms at NYU have personal bathrooms. Well, you share with your roommates but that is much better than communal bathrooms. A couple of the freshmen dorms have been renovated over the past couple years, and they are fantastic. One of the upperclassmen dorms *cough cough Grammercy* is absolutely gorgeous and the kitchen is most likely better than what most middle class people have in their houses. I'm not gonna lie, there are some gross dorms, but overall I have to say there are some good options.",
            "This is a tough school. Some of the colleges within NYU have a heavier work load then others along with different types of academic pressure. Overall, there is always pressure to do really well, even though a lot of times it may not be possible for you. Your classes will push you.",
            "-Make sure that if you don't have the best financial standing, start saving money now, even if you're in middle school -Don't come here if you cannot handle a challenge, the academics are hard -Connections are very important in NYC, use them",
            "NYU isn't for everybody, but if you want to become more independent, meet lots of interesting and diverse people, and eat a variety of food NYU is the perfect place for you. Even though sometimes it can feel like only wealthy people belong here, you eventually find your own place and embrace the city."

I wasn't even enthusiastic in August, the few weeks before I came to New York. I was terrified and starting to wonder if I'd made the right decision for me. That all changed the first week. I made friends, I met super interesting and creative people, I explored the city, and I was energized. There's nothing like being in New York City with amazing people in your college years. You have the whole world ahead of you, and the city isn't as scary as it seems (coming from someone whose hometown has 8000 people)., 1031362=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 13972=Academically speaking, New York University is somewhat of a hodgepodge in quality between its different schools, so make sure you apply to the right one with the right credentials. Among its more renowned branches include: The Tisch School of the Arts: Founded and supported by the late Laurence Tisch (who, by the way, graduated from what is now Stern) and his family, the Tisch School is known as the #1 film school in the U.S. That said, If you're applying here, make sure you've got artistic chops. You will need a strong portfolio that should blow people away with its creativity and uniqueness, and know that you are competing against the best amateur film makers and artists around the globe. On the bright side, standardized scores and figures aren't emphasized, so a low GPA and SAT aren't that hazardous. Known graduates include Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Oliver Stone, and even Angelina Jolie. Left-handedness is preferred. The Stern School of Business: Known for producing investment bankers that go on to work for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, etc, the Stern school is filled with people with great mathematical skills with good GPA's and high SAT scores. Aim for a > 3.6 GPA, > 2100 SAT and > 720 on SAT II's. Known graduates include: John Paulson, Robert Soros, Alan Greenspan. NYU's College of Arts & Sciences is a bit trickier than the other two schools, but its strong points include the Courant Department of Mathematics (#1 in applied math, USNWR), Philosophy and Economics. You can study anything here and the requirements are significantly lower than the previously mentioned schools. Aim for >3.4 GPA, >1900 SAT, >650 SAT II's. Gallatin is the school where you can create your own major. You have access to every course at NYU, so you can mix and match things around and end up as a specialist in Indian Agriculture. While the atmosphere here is extremely liberal, I would advise against applying to this school unless you are very independent. Keep in mind, if you wanted to major in Finance or a something in NYU's specialized schools (Tisch & Stern), you would have to do an internal transfer. Requirements are about the same as CAS Polytechnic is the new engineering branch for NYU. Since the school has just been incorporated in to the system, I expect that its requirements would be a little lower than CAS. There you go, a whirlwind tour of NYU's departments. Good luck on your application., 778748=I believe theres about 1000 clubs to choose from, you'll find something!, 244778=Not an unusual tradition, but the 2011 welcome week dance was Lady Gaga themed - called the Monster Ball. People went all out for this dance - some friends and I actually made our dresses out of duct tape!, 754581=Types of students that don't want the typical college experience of going to sports games and everyone in NYU attire. it's great for hipsters, people who march to their own drum, girls who are independent and like to dress up for class, and definitely international students., 538159=During May, there is what is called NYU Strawberry Festival. Basically, it is a celebration of springtime. Many free things are handed out, there is music, and you can see the very long strawberry cake that they have for you taste., 342810=It varies from hall to hall. Weinstein has the only Chick-Fil-A in the city (as of 2014 anyway). There's also a Subway and Jamba Juice in Weinstein. There's also an on-campus Starbucks that accepts Dining Dollars (a component of the NYU meal plan that all freshmen are required to sign up for). Palladium has an awesome all-you-can-eat Sunday brunch with a chocolate fountain, a bagel bar (bagels, smoked salmon, a few types of cream cheese, and scallions), fruit bowls, omelettes, and of course, cereal, eggs, and tater tots. Third North is supposed to be the worst dining hall, but I think we have it pretty good here if people say that. I always see a lot of people at Third North, and I personally like it. The pizza is the best of NYU (in my opinion), and their breakfast wraps are amazing. They also have incredibly addicting chocolate chip cookies. I swear, you can't stop at one. You have to have at least two cookies., 337289=There's a public safety bus that will take you from any NYU location to another from 12:00-7:00AM (I think those are the hours, I forget when the morning ones end). It's also very safe around campus though. There are scattered police on the streets. There are also other students. In general, Greenwich Village (where NYU is located) is a nice area of NYC. Just don't be stupid and you'll be fine. I usually walk back from the library with friends anyway because I don't like walking alone., 705191=Depends on how much tuition is for you, but the teachers here will make it worth your while. The only slight negative effect is that NYU has plans to expand their campus by 2031, and there's a lot of money being diverted to renovations and other things, all which take away from the scholarships that NYU offers. Look for other scholarships at Cappex!}",

The lights, Broadway, instant access to the World's biggest hub. Dispel that notion immediately. While these events happen somewhat frequently, they do not come close to encapsulating the NYU experience. As a student, you must become independent immediately. The learning curve here is slightly steeper than many other colleges, but it's manageable if you take slow steps in finding your place in the school's culture. Also don't worry about not fitting in with certain crowds, there is a niche for every type of individual, but many of theme are somewhat liberal (this varies from school to school). Also note that NYU is an expensive place. By the end of four years, you will have spent $57,228 per year (assuming you dorm), which is $228,912 overall.
