    "textAfterTable": "17 Items Customer Reviews I'M TORN... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Broken Headphones I've always been a huge Maroon 5 fan, but even I have to admit that their unique sound just hasn't been the same ever since \"Moves Like Jagger\" became a #1 smash hit last summer. Now, it seems as if the catchy guitar riffs and meaningful lyrics of \"Songs About Jane\" and \"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\" have been virtually replaced by generic dance-pop beats and uninspired verses. With the exceptions of \"Payphone\", \"One More Night\", and \"Wipe Your Eyes\", nothing on this album feels like something the band would write, let alone record in the studio. They all sound like overly produced, club-friendly techno tracks you'd expect to hear from a group like Cobra Starship. The funk-rock quality of Maroon 5's previous work seems to have disappeared almost completely, and it's really a shame. Let's just hope that Adam and the guys don't stick with this sound for the rest of their music career 'cause this isn't the right direction for them. Fan forever",
