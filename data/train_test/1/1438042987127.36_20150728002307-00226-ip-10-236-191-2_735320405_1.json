In 2006 and 2007, Yang also won the all-around world title, having previously been runner up at the 2003 Worlds and 2000 Olympics. This made him the first man since Yugoslavia's Petar Sumi (1922 and 1926) to successfully defend his all-around world title (since surpassed by three consecutive titles by Kohei Uchimura). More medals were collected by Yang in team competitions: gold at the 2000 and 2008 Olympics (nearly the entire Chinese team disappointed at the 2004 Games), and at the World Championships of 1999, 2003, 2006 and 2007. Being a true all-rounder, he rarely medalled in individual events, but did earn a silver on the rings in Beijing, and two apparatus bronzes at World Championships.
