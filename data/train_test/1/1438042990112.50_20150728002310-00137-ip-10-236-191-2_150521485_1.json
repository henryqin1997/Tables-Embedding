It's hard to believe Michigan walked into a game against a high profile defense and just decided they were going to run into whatever they called. You're not in a chess game because you tipped your king over before the play. A couple of basic checks to quick pass plays that MSU is not aligned to would back them off, force them to change up their defense, etc. Maybe Denard just can't handle it\u2014Rodriguez was the guy checking at the line in 2010. If he can't that's another obvious transition cost from trying to jam him into a square peg.}",

RB, he is going to do things that we will all love, but he is just not all that good at using Denard and company., 93925=People also often forget that our offense was frustrating in 2010 as well--a lot of its production came when games were no longer competitive.}",

There are lot of embeds this week and I've gotten some complaints that UFRs bog people's browsers down\u2014hmmm wonder why\u2014so taking most of the junk off the front page should help in that regard.] Shew shew. Substitution notes: Few surprises here. Line all starters; TE rotation about as it has been. No RBs other than Toussaint and Smith made appearances; Gardner was not announced as a starter and got a lot fewer snaps than he has previously. Speculation is he's carrying some sort of injury. Joe Reynolds got his first snaps in a heated situation\u2014all were runs. More about that later. Yes, throwback screen obvs. This is \"Ace Triple Stack\" as a reminder: MSU screwed their corners down into press man and walked their safeties up to about nine yards deep, ready to roar downhill at any run action. You won't get any bubble complaints from me in this game\u2014it wasn't there. Also shotgun 3-wide When Michigan split their WRs this was the preferred look: Shotgun 3-wide for M",
    "textAfterTable": "Funchess(-1) in the slot; he cracks down on nobody, letting Norman fly by. Omameh can't get outside on him anyway and probably isn't supposed to since on a pull he would need to kick it out. Playside DE flares to contain. Toussaint blocks him, S attacks hard and comes inside to tackle at the sticks. RPS -1, safety tackle at LOS. M44 2 7 Shotgun 2-back TE 2 1 2 4-3 even Run QB iso Robinson 1 MSU tips double A gap, M runs into it. Like, directly into it. Kwiatkowski eats Norman a yard in the backfield and Denard has to cut behind. Barnum(+1) buries the backside DT; Kerridge can't cut Gholston as he redirects back inside\u2014he's blocking him as if Toussaint has the ball. Robinson can dance for a yard or two. I do not know if this is a read or not, but I have to assume it is. Denard (-1); hand off after they tip they're blitzing into your face. Lewan(+1) had a badass block on the backside DT, which helped this get across the LOS. M45 3 6 Shotgun twin TE twins 1 2 2 4-3 even Pass TE out Kwiatkowski 10 For whatever reason MSU's coverage here is very soft on the edge versus the two TE setup. Funchess hits the LB, then releases into an out; Kwiatkowski just runs an out and turns",
