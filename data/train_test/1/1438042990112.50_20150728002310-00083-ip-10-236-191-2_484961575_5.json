    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{28694=A \"Multiple Transducer\" is described in Arkans U.S. Pat. No. 4,152,748, issued May 1, 1979. In this device, the dielectric layer is made of non-conducting sponge rubber. A first plate of a capacitor is a flexible, conducting layer coextensive with the dielectric, while the second plate of the capacitor is smaller in size than the first plate and has a shape that will best define a localized stress point. There are usually multiple second plates of different size and shape in this device., 29216=Another pressure sensing system is described in Lee U.S. Pat. No. 4,168,517 issued Sept. 18, 1979 for \"Capacitive Pressure Transducer\", in which the pressure transducer has a capacitor configuration. The plates of the capacitor are metal and the dielectric layer is air. This patent focuses on the use of a deep annular convolution in one of the metal capacitor plates to prevent slipping in the clamping area and the use of an elastic mounting ring to also aid in preventing slipping. The metal plate that defines the area of the capacitor is integrally bonded to a rigid ceramic which is not part of the dielectric layer of the capacitor., 28209=In U.S. Pat. No. 3,943,915 issued Mar. 16, 1976 to Severson for \"Intracranial Pressure Sensing Device\", two thin metal plates serve as the plates of a capacitor, separated by an air dielectric. The plates are spaced from each other and joined together near their periphery with a polyimide ring and epoxy adhesive. The pressure differential across one of the plates causes the air space between the plates to change and results in a change in capacitance., 27212=An earlier system developed by the assignee of this invention is described in Thoma, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,814,998 issued June 4, 1974 for \"Pressure Sensitive Capacitance Sensing Element\". The diaphragm element includes thin outer conductive layers on either side of a core of resilient silicone or other dielectric. The conductive layers are made of the same material as the core, with conductive particles embedded therein. One layer is spaced peripherally from the edge of the core layer (to prevent electrical contact between the conducting layers) and the unit is rigidly mounted with metal contacts connected to the conducting layers (e.g. using a silver conducting paint). The element will flex to the side of lower pressure causing a change in the effective conducting area of the opposed conductive layers and a simultaneous decrease in the thickness of the dielectric inner core. As a result, the capacitance of the unit varies as a function of deflection., 29886=Yet another sensor is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,177,680 issued Dec. 11, 1979 to Coleman for \"Dual Pressure Sensor\". The two halves of the sensor are identical in structure. Each sensor has one plate of the capacitor attached to a common substrate with the second plate of each capacitor being a metal diaphragm joined along its periphery to a common substrate. The two capacitors have an air dielectric therebetween, and when a change in pressure occurs across the metal diaphragm, the thickness of the air gap changes resulting in a change in capacitance for one of the capacitors.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While several structures are suggested in this specification, in many cases the materials, thicknesses, diameters and number and arrangement of the components are a matter of design choice after the principles of the present invention have been read and understood. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is not to be limited by the above-description, but only the scope of the claims which follow. As shown in FIG. 4, when the top and bottom plates, 70 and 80, are drawn together and held in place (for example by suitable fasteners or spring clips not shown), the rim 86 of the bottom plate prestrains the elastomeric electrode 75 as it approaches the bottom of the fixed electrode 73. The prestraining is continued until the elastomeric electrode touches the contact ring (not shown) of the fixed electrode 73, at which time the desired compression of the elastomeric electrode takes place, i.e. to about 1/2 of its thickness. Rim 86 should be rounded to permit the radial prestraining of elastomeric electrode 75 without tearing of same. The prestraining accomplished here is consistent and uniform and is preferred to fabricating techniques which physically prestrain an elastomeric electrode and attempt to hold the desired prestraining forces while clamping forces are applied between the fixed electrode and bottom plate rim. A retaining ring 78 having a groove 79 is used to contain the ring portion 76 in combination with the spacer 74. The",
