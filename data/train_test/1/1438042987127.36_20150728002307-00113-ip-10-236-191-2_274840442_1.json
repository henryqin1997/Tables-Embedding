            "\"Jansenism. Cornelius Jansen, the Catholic bishop of Ypres, published his Augustinus in 1640, which propounded a doctrine of justification by faith and predestination, based on the writings of Augustine, much as Martin Luther's doctrines were. Jansenism was progressively condemned from 1653 to 1713, but Jansen's deeply pessimistic view of life, particularly of sexuality, continued to pervade French Catholicism for centuries. Many Irish clergy who were trained in France (after England had become predominantly Protestant) absorbed the Jansenist viewpoint and transmitted it to America during the great Irish emigrations, after which the Irish dominated the Catholic church in America. \"",
