The cell 100 also comprises a generally vertically extending pillar 104 which, in this embodiment, also comprises silicon carbide doped p-type similarly to the substrate 102. Source lines 106 are also formed at an upper region of the substrate 102 so as to extend generally in a first direction 108 substantially along the view of the cross-sectional illustration of FIG. 2 or substantially into and out of the page. The source lines 106 in this embodiment, are positioned adjacent a base of the pillars 104 and are further arranged so as to be substantially not underlying the pillars 104, but rather extending substantially between adjacent pillars 104.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have shown, described and pointed out the fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to those embodiments, it will be understood that various omissions, substitutions and changes in the form of the detail of the device illustrated may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Consequently, the scope of the invention should not be limited to the foregoing description but is to be defined by the appended claims. The cells 100 use a high band gap energy semiconductor, silicon carbide, to provide a particularly low level of leakage currents which helps provide long retention times, extending the indicated intervals between refresh operations. The cells 100 also provide both memory and gain functionality. The cells 100 are much simpler than conventional stacked capacitor or trench capacitor DRAM cells and have a shorter vertical extend. The cells 100 replace the relatively large storage capacitors which consume a significant footprint in known DRAM cells with the relatively much smaller body capacitor 132. These cells 100 further utilize the active gain of the NMOS structure 130 to amplify any stored charge 136. Specialized processes are not required for the fabrication of the cells 100 and, thus, can be implemented using standard CMOS processing techniques providing significant financial advantages for implementation of the embodiments described herein.
