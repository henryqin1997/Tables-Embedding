Question number 1: What is your username on Vital Wolves? burgaboii wolvesfc Question 2: How long have you supported Wolves? All my life Question 3: Where do you travel from to see the wolves play? Wollaston, Stourbridge. Question 4: How did you become a Wolves fan? Through my Dad and my great granddad was a reserve Gk for wolves. Question 5: Are you pro or anti Mick McCarthy? Pro, Really like his stubbornness. So funny and interesting to listen to him. Question 6: What was your assessment of last season? Great, Especially Away from Home much better than 2003/04. Question 7: Do you think when Mick changed the whole side against Man Utd was a good decision or not and what would you think if he did it next season ? It worked out good in the end but Man Utd was their for the taking. Also when we played the Away fixture against West Ham 8 of those players played against Man Utd. Question 8: Do you think Wolverhampton can establish themselves in the Premier League and once again, become a great club? They are already great. We are more than capable to be establishing our selves. It`s looking like we have a very wealthy owner and if we stay in I can see 15 million pound players playing for us. Question 9: Predictions for Wolves next season, where do we need to strengthen, should Mick stick with one up front? Mid table doing the double over the baggies. Well I think we are sorted in defenders, probably one winger and a player like Mancienne. Question 10: Where do you think Wolves will finish next season? 10th would be brilliant. Question 11: How do you see Sylvain Ebanks-Blake figuring into the team this upcoming season, if at all? Send him on loan to a team like Blackpool where he will be first choice. Question 12: If you could pick one highlight as a Wolves fan what would it be? The away fixture at West ham where we won 3-1. Best ever away game I`ve seen from wolves. Question 13: What is the worst Wolves match you have ever seen and why? Well That`s pretty much obvious the home game against stoke. 'Boring`. Question 14: Has your support for Wolverhampton Wanderers ever wavered? Never. Question 15: Who is your all time favourite Wolves player? Well at the moment ' Ronald Zubar`, But all time I would have to say 'Steve Bull`. Question 16: If money and status was no object, who would you most like to see in a Wolves shirt? Hard one so many to choose from, I would say Robbie keane because he owes us one and with Stephen Hunt and Kevin Doyle at the club that will be some partnership. Question 17: What Wolves player from history would you want in next seasons team? Steve Bull. Question 18: If you could attend any game in Wolves history, which would it be and why? European semi final against Tottenham. Question 19: What is your favourite bit of Wolves trivia? ------- Question 20: What is your question for the next interviewee on Vital Wolves? Where do you see wolves in 10 years? Thanks to burgaboii wolvesfc for agreeing to be our sixteenth interview! Would you like to be interviewed?
