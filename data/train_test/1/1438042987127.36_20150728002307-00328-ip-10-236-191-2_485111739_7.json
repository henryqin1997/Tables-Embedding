    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention has been described with respect to a specific embodiment. However, other embodiments based on the principles of the present invention should be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such embodiments are intended to be covered by the claims. In a printer which has a page memory and a character generater, the communication interface connecting with the receive buffer through the DMAC may execute the high speed data communication in regard to the conventional printing data. In this embodiment, the designation of changing the data communication mode is executed by the host computer, however, it may instead be executed at the operation panel. This embodiment exemplifies the printer as the data processing apparatus but can be applied to other data processing apparatus which conducts parallel communications with the CPU, for example, a file storage unit and the like. According to this embodiment, the data processing apparatus may perform the high speed data communication as the occasion demands. Accordingly, when a large volume of data is transmitted to the data processing apparatus from the external apparatus, the wait time of the operator is reduced. FIG. 12 is a flow chart showing the high speed mode finishing process of the printer 100. This process is started in response to the first interrupt signal. The level of the signal transmitted on the R/nW line (j) and the signal transmitted on the HostBusy line (m)",
