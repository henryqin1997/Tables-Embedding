            "Oregon State is pretty big into keeping all its students safe even at odd hours of the night. We have a pretty big SafeRide program on campus that is almost always available to pick you up where you're at and drive you to any other place on campus during the day or night. The campus has a number of Stress Beacons that have buttons that you can press, setting off a blue flashing light, if your feel like you are being followed or harassed and campus security prides itself on being there within the minute.",
            "Anyone looking for a great Agricultural Science or Engineering program",
            "There are a ton of clubs and activities that go on at OSU and you can usually find something that peaks your interest. There is always the Beaver Fair at the beginning of the year which is a big fair sporting booths from all the Sororities and Clubs on campus to give you more information about each one.",
            "The University hosts a great variety of different food options both on and off campus. The dorm food isn't all that bad but there are certainly way healthier ways to eat if you want to avoid to notorious Freshman 15. They do offer a lot of options and Oregon in particular is a stickler for salad bars and healthy food options. Off campus food comes in a pretty wide variety including Chipotle, Cafe Yum, Yogurt Extreme, Roxy Dogs, Dutch Brothers and a number of other food types and of course the incredibly popular American Dream Pizza. Monroe St. right off campus is basically the college student hot spot for anything you could possibly want for close to campus dining.",
            "To be honest, I never had to live in the dorms so I don't really have any experience to rate this off of but I do have a number of friends who lived in or are/were RA's in the dorms on campus. I think it varies per person but a lot of the people I talked to said that the dorms were really a great experience. I think it also depends on the dorms; the nicer ones such as McNary and Wilson definitely gave a better experience to their residence. The dorms are expensive, but there is definitely no shortage of activities to do and friends to be made. One new policy that the University enacted this past year which might change life in the dorms drastically is requiring all Freshman to live in the dorms. I believe students staying at home are exempt, but this still means that many rooms will have to be changed from doubles to singles. Again, the experience definitely varies from person to person, but I could see the dorms getting pretty cramped pretty quickly this year,",
            "For the most part, the academics are pretty reasonable. It really depends on your major and the types of classes you need but as a Fisheries and Wildlife Major you could not ask for a better campus. The Agricultural Sciences department is amazing and unparalleled having a huge variety of specialties and hands on classes to choose from. Oregon State is also a huge Engineering school and has a number of great programs for multiple types of engineers. To be honest though, the math department is terrible so anyone looking into going into math could certainly choose a better University.",
            "Get involved in activities and develop a good group of fun and trustworthy friends! College is so much better when you have things to do with your time and you see people that you know on a daily basis. Students at Oregon State are extremely friendly for the most part so don't be afraid to just start talking to the person sitting next to you in class. I have made a ton of friends in classes over the years just by being friendly and it makes your college experience so much better.",
            "Oregon State is an incredibly beautiful campus with any number of relaxing and useful study areas and it's academic success center is extremely helpful in teaching students how to find effective and different methods of study. The University aims to constantly improve it's diversity and encouragement thereof (if anything a little excessively) and is incredibly welcoming to any number of cultures and ethnic backgrounds (LOTS of exchange students). To be honest, the math department is terrible, but the university does have above average Engineering and Agricultural Sciences programs."

Food options aren't all that great, but food from the dining halls are relatively cheap and taste good. The most expensive options are in the MU (Togo's, Carl's Jr., Panda Express), but you can also find Bueno's Burritos which gives you a massive burrito for really cheap, plus there's hardly ever a long line, even at 12:30 PM on a weekday., 671018=Its winner of the prestigious 2009 Ivy Award. There are multifaceted food service operation that provides meals and services to the campus community. The campus welcomes all students, faculty and staff to dine in our three dining facilities.

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students When going to a university such as OSU you need to be outgoing and ready to try new things. You also must be able to manage your time because no one else will do this for you. Being a science student I would suggest looking at the school if you are interested in the science or business area. Tips for prospective students The amount you learn in a class depends on many different factors. In the first year you really have to learn how to juggle a whole new array of things that can become quite overwhelming. OSU offers some helpful classes on time juggling, study sessions, and other recourses which should be taken advantage of. Teachers can also play a large role in how much you learn throughout your college experience. Check out www.ratemyprofessors.com for some reviews by people who have already taken the class so you know what to expect. Bang for the buck I have only been at OSU for a year but so far its been a lot of money for simple classes. At OSU you have the option of dual enrolling in Linn Benton. I would definitely suggest looking into this, especially in your first year. There is a Beaver Bus that will take you directly to Linn Benton which",
