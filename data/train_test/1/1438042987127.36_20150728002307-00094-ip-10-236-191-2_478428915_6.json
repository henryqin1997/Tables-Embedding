    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the hydrodynamic bearing of the invention is applicable to other typical spindle assemblies used in magnetic disc storage systems. In the present invention, the interface of the hydrodynamic bearing is extended over a greater area than in prior art designs. This provides increased bearing stiffness and stability. Further, the restoring moment is determined based upon the length of a line which extends from the center of the journal to an outer edge of the bearing member. In typical prior art designs, the hydrodynamic bearing interface is at a perpendicular angle with the axis of rotation. However, in the present invention, an angle between the interface and the axis of rotation is acute, i.e. it is not parallel. This is achieved by making the bearing have a narrow width at an inner side and widen towards an outer edge of the bearing. The curved surface of the bearing also facilitates smooth operation and reduces the effects of external loads or shock or precession. Generally, forces on the bearing cause the hemisphere to rotate within the receiving portion about its center. It will be apparent that this design is less likely to be damaged than prior art flat",
