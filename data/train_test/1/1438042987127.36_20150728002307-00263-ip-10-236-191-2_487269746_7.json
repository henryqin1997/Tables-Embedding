Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. It should be understood from the description here that the delivery system 100 can be employed to deliver electrode assemblies 120 to locations in the body other than the human 30. For example, the guide sheath 110 and delivery catheter 130 can be used to implant one or electrode assemblies 120 to tissue in the digestive tract (e.g., stomach tissue) for electrical stimulation treatment of digestive conditions or obesity. In another example, the guide sheath 110 and delivery catheter 130 can be used to implant one or electrode assemblies 120 to tissue in the urinary tract (e.g., urinary sphincter) for electrical stimulation treatment of incontinence or other urinary conditions. Accordingly, in these embodiments, the delivery catheter 730 or 830 may be configured to releasably secured to the heart wall tissue 35 during the implantation process. Such a releasable attachment to the heart chamber wall permits the delivery catheter 730 or 830 to maintain its position adjacent the targeted implantation site. After the electrode assembly 120 is inserted into the heart wall tissue 35, the delivery catheter 730 or 830 may be released from the heart chamber wall and withdrawn into the",
