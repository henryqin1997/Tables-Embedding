            "At FIU, there are a couple of unusual traditions that call attention. There are specifically three major special ones. The first one, on a short bridge that leads over a small campus lake, a couple once had their first kiss. This couple eventually got married as some couples do. But someone once pointed out that, at a certain angle, the lake was shaped like a heart and that it was the magic of the lake that cemented the couples relationship. Naturally, it became a campus tradition for couples to kiss on this bridge. However, the only way to break the 'spell' was to shove your significant other into the lake, and to this day, we see boys being thrown over the side of the bridge. Second, FIU has many architectural art sculptures around the campus. There is a large cube stood on its corner, and it is on an axis so it is allowed to spin. The campus tradition is to spin it before a text or exam and you will always pass. The catch? You must study. And lastly, inlaid on the floor of the entryway to a major metropolitan building is the prestigious seal of the university. The stories say that if you step on the seal, you won't graduate on time. In order to break the seal, the tradition calls for the person to walk around it backwards three times. Yes, we still see that today.",
            "There are a million things to do at FIU. The students at this institution are incredibly involved with every aspect of student life. Campus life has a motto: Live the Life. The whole school prides itself on it's inter-community involvement, arranging concerts and comedy shows, movie nights, building school pride through week-long homecoming events, hosting fundraisers, participating in national events. There's always something going on for someone and there's never a group left out.",
            "Dining is an amazing adventure. There are many different locations to dine at many hours of the day. They all vary in taste, pun intended, and they're scattered around the whole campus, making it convenient to dine on campus as there's always a restaurant at least three minutes commute from any building on campus. FIU also offers resourceful meal passes to cut individual spending on dining for every student.",
            "During freshmen orientation, it is mandatory for all students attending to stay overnight. Students were housed in one of the many residence halls and were comfortably accommodated with up to three other roommates to a suite.",
            "In order to prepare their students for university life, the students are thoroughly educated in their academic responsibilities. While still keeping a professional appeal, academia is stressed to make sure every student knows their track.",
            "When coming in for meetings, appointments, presentations, bring anything you find relevant. It's always best to be prepared for anything and just as well to expect the unexpected. If you start feeling overwhelmed with the waves of information, and if you're taking notes and feel you can't keep up, start writing down important questions you need answered. As the presentation continues, cross off the questions as they're answered, or jot down the answers and the questions they generate too. Never ever feel like you're asking too many things, and never give up, thinking you'll never get it. FIU has a great set of Peer Advisers (students specially trained to prepare incoming students) there to help with anything you need. It is a very close-knit family of Golden FIU Panthers.",
            "The campus, the faculty, the students, everything in the orientation program was highly organized and greatly thought out in the attempt to making this transition the least difficult. Most of the information given was clear, concise, and was appropriately weighed and presented to accurately give the students an honest view of the school, in all aspects discussed. The whole experience -- on campus, in class setting, etc -- was a highly educational experience and did much to prepare me as a new and incoming student."

Top 30% of high school class at Hialeah-Miami Lakes Sr. High. Earned Dean's List honor during Spring 2011 at Miami-Dade College., 146057=Florida International University(FIU) has been a welcoming and encouraging environment ever since i started my studies in the summer of 2012. Being a recent high school graduate, I was afraid attending this college so fast, especially during summer would be too much to handle. I was wrong, the professors and student alumni really reach out and help the freshman, in order to fit in to a more comfortable and friendly zone., 99034=There are lots of places to go eat around campus but mainly in the Graham center. They are constantly adding more and more places to eat, currently they are building a Panda Express and a Taco Bell on campus. adding these franchises to the present collection of Burger King, Pollo Tropical, Cafe Bustelo, Alamazar, Chili's, Chic-fil-a, Moe's, Dunkin Donuts, And several other franchise restaurants. there is also a cafeteria place called Fresh Foods Company, this place is a buffet and at the beginning of the semester the food here is always good, and it has many options for food, salads, sandwiches, pizza, and a variety of other hot foods. There are currently 2 Starbucks on campus and a new one is being built within a new building scheduled to be completed later in 2014. There is a salad place called Salad Creations also, and they make really delicious salads but they're kinda pricey so normally I just stick to Chic-Fil-A., 823125=FIU is the 18th largest university in the United States. FIU also has the distinction of being the largest minority-majority university in America and will have an enrollment of more than 60,000 for the 2012-2013 school year. FIU is an awesome facility and an exciting place to learn., 315685=be ready to walk or maybe even run to your classes. some may be right next to each other, but others might be on the other end of the campus. i suggest 10/11 o'clock classes. that extra hour of sleep is like heaven., 814044=FIU offers many places to eat on campus between the two campuses. On the north campus, there are many places to dine at like Moe's Southwest Grill, Bistro Subs, Grille Works, etc. On the main campus, there are twenty plus places to dine at like Chick-fil-a, Burger King, Pollo Tropical, Moe's Southwest Grill, Chili's, etc. Also, there are places on campus where you can go to get a snack at 3 o'clock in the morning and they offer cookies that are super yummy and fresh out the oven at all times of the day., 222832=I found a lot of information about this school. I am planning on attending in 2013 to study Premed. I researched their different programs and this will be a perfect school to study Premed to become a Forensic Pathologist., 129092=Florida International University was not my first choice when I was applying for schools back in 2011, but FIU has changed my life. It is a commuter school, but through my involvements I have grown as a person and as a leader. I believe that FIU is an amazing school and it is highly underrated.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Open-minded, Hard-working, Different. Almost all of these qualities can be found in the students as well as teachers enrolled in FIU. Tips for prospective students If you wish to do well, my advice would be to stay focused and involved. Although gaining experience in jobs and activities is important, how you do in school is your first priority! Study hard! Bang for the buck FIU has many opportunities for scholarships, grants and loans. They try to help you out as much as possible. And the classes are worth every cent as long as you put in the effort. Am enjoying being here The campus is simply great, especially the first week. There is so many activities and events happening all over the campus. There are many clubs and extracurricular activities to be involved in. For example, I am currently working with a group of other students to develop an on-campus series to air in FIU. The experience that is gained is simply amazing. There are a lot of opportunities that can open doors for you. Am learning a lot Florida International",
