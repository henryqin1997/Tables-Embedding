    "textBeforeTable": "Age Gates Gamecloud's Does The ESRB Enforce Its Age Gate Rules is a Q&A with ESRB president Patricia Vance as they continue to obsess on their pet issue of age gate restrictions for mature rated content on websites. Uwe Boll The Uwe Boll Q&A on Skewed and Reviewed talks with the director about his movies: \"BLOODRAYNE starts in over 2000 theatres in US and is a classic epic Vampire movie with a great cast (Kristanna TERMINATRIX Loken, Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Billy Zane, Meatloaf, Geraldine Chaplin, Udo Kier, Matt Davis and Michelle Rodriguez). And FAR CRY \u2013 we have a great script and we are scouting right now locations. We are in talks with a few actors right now.\" Thanks Kennett. John Romero Gamecloud's John Romero Q&A talks with The Romero about what he is up to at his new startup developer: \"Because I had excellent experiences at all my startups. In fact, since I started programming games in 1979 I've worked at other people's companies for less than 5 years total (Origin, Softdisk, Midway). More than anything I love the feel of a startup, the unlimited possibilities, the feel of having a true mission to accomplish. Too many people just shuffle from job to job...just so they can have a job, with no fire left in them to change the world.\" [Oct",
