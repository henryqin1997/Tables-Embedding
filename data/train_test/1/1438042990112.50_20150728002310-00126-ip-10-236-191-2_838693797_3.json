(AVB - Analyst Report), an Arlington, Va. \u2013 based real estate investment trust (REIT) recently disclosed the divestiture of 2 communities \u2013 Avalon Decoverly and Crystal House. This comes as part of the company\u2019s portfolio restructuring activity in the Washington D.C. area and the deals helped fetch a total of $332 million. Specifically, AvalonBay sold off Avalon Decoverly \u2013 a 564 apartment home community situated in Rockville, Md. for $135 million. The other property \u2013 Crystal House \u2013 an 828 apartment home community property in Arlington, Va. was disposed for $197 million. Crystal House was acquired by Mack-Cali Realty Corp. (CLI - Analyst Report), an Edison-based REIT through a joint venture (JV) with a fund advised by UBS Global Asset Management of UBS AG (UBS - Analyst Report). AvalonBay disposed the 2 communities at a weighted average initial year market capitalization rate of 5.2%. The amount gathered would be used for meeting general corporate needs. AvalonBay purchased Crystal House as part of its Archstone acquisition deal. As a matter of fact, in Nov 2012, AvalonBay alongwith Equity Residential (EQR - Analyst Report), entered into an agreement with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to acquire the entire ownership stake of Archstone Enterprise LP. \u00a0 The deal envisaged AvalonBay acquiring 40% of Archstone\u2019s assets and liabilities, while the rest would be taken by Equity Residential.\u00a0 The transaction closed on Feb 27, 2013 and Archstone Enterprise LP is now known as Jupiter Enterprise LP. \u00a0 We believe that the asset dispositions are a strategic fit for AvalonBay. The move would help enhance its portfolio as well as boost its balance sheet with adequate liquidity. Also, management expects to continue its expansion spree with estimated acquisitions worth $300 million of in-service communities in the current year apart from the purchase of the Archstone portfolio. We believe that this portfolio repositioning activity will improve the internal growth metrics and enable the company to emerge stronger once the real estate markets fully recover. However, short-term revenue headwinds arising from acquisitions and a huge development pipeline, which will heighten operational risks, remain the matters of concern. AvalonBay currently has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold). \u00a0, 62689=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 62750=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors.
