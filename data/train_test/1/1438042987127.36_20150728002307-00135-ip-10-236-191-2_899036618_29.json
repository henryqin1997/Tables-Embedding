            "I am an online student but I would suggest set aside an hour or 2 everyday to focus only on schooling. Make sure you keep a calendar of all your classes and work that is due. Prioritize. Take away any interruptions like the phone or anything so you can focus wholehearted on schooling. Make sure you have all supplies you need and keep a very neat work area. Don't work yourself to death but I personally suggest to work on your schooling at least 2 hours everyday. I understand not everyone can do that but stay in there as much as you can without overwhelming yourself because you always want to keep your classes, assignments and work fresh in your memory. It will make it much easier to keep up your grades because you don't ever forget when you really have it in your mind.",

            "I am a 27 year old single mother of 2 struggling to get by and I was stuck on how I could better my life. I knew I wanted to give my children and I the best I was capable of but I didn't know how to go about doing it. Especially since I don't have a lot of moral support and then I realized its up to me. No one is going to do it for me. So I enrolled in school and I am 100 percent determined to finish and better my life. I am starting from scratch and literally a check on 185 dollars a month to live off of. I am positive though and I know when I set my mind to it I can do it and I look forward to my new life one day with my babies so if I can do this anyone out there, don't ever doubt yourself. Always believe in yourself because your the one that is responsible for the better of your own life. Plus its a very rewarding and positive experience to say wow, I am doing this... MYSELF! So good-luck to everyone in America who is striving and struggling but trying to do better in whatever way that might be.",
            "I am taking classes online, but I do suggest to not overwhelm yourself with schooling either. Once you've completed an assignment or something be proud of yourself for your accomplishments and celebrate even if it is set on the couch with a good cup of coffee and ice cream and watch and awesome movie.",

            "If your doing online like I am, take the time to work with everyone that is willing to help you. Take notes, prioritize, set aside a certain time, day, and couple hours that you can focus only on your school with no distractions. When working on the computer or doing your work with your school make sure you put away all the i pads, phones, tv's etc. anything that can distract you because the most important thing is to set a goal and finish it. Most of all take one day at a time, do not overwhelm yourself but be persistent and set goals and keep them!!!",
            "The staff here are so helpful in showing me the steps of attending online classes. The website with my classes are made very simple and easy to get in and out. My counselor and so much staff have been such an inspiration and definitely a part of my support group."
