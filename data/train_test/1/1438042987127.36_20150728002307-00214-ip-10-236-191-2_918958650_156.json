Also, there is V.E.I.S.H.E.A which is the largest student run celebration which is hosted in April every year including: music, parades, entertainment, student faculty tournaments and much more!, 261008=veishea, a week long celebration of the founding of iowa state university. starts in mid april. each day there are different events planned, and on saturday there is a parade, concerts, local food and much more. it is basically a mini state fair. campaniling, where you and your partner kiss under the campanile (big clock tower on campus) when the clock hits midnight., 845921=From dorms in Richardson court to the out of campus Maricopa being constructed for the fall of 2013 due to the high rates of returning students and incoming freshmans., 753386=If you are looking for a great college ministry check out The Salt Company. Over 1000 students and a great place to meet great friends and people who truly care. Plus its a campus organization too!, 150980=Dorms are pretty typical. Iowa State is a large campus with lots of housing,they are building a new dorm that should be done by 2017. You can go for traditional housing or suite style, lots of variety but apply early!:), 192522=I'm am loving the campus! I'm starting as a Freshman this August 2011. Though I haven't started, students there for summer classes were helpful and informative, as were the professors at orientation. I can't Wait to attend!, 881032=By the fall of 2014, Iowa State University will officially have the biggest Greek system in the United States. I live in a fraternity, and it is by far, the best decision I have made in my life., 938492=1. National Balloon Festival Indianola, IA summer 2. Des Moines Renaissance Faire 3. Amana Colonies October Fest fall, 270115=the campus is very safe! not only is there a cyclone taxi that runs until 6:00 in the morning and goes all through greek areas. also there are blue towers located strategically throughout campus with a button on them that immediately calls the isu police and/or ames police. i have never felt unsafe at isu as well., 151913=Make sure you apply early! The application opens up in July,make sure you accept your offer of admission and correctly put in data directly from transcript. Also housing fills up quick if you want to live in a specific dorm submit your housing contract ASAP. Like most likely if you submit before January you should be able to live in the place you want., 426988=Apply early for dorms, some were just built in 2004 and are AWESOME!, 147529=I'm not interested in joining greek life this year, maybe next. But I know for girls in June you will get an invitation to attend formal recruitment the week before school starts and you move in early! Great school for greek life if you want in. There's a group for everyone!:), 532851=Voed most interactive greek community in 2010, and 2011 this is due to the large number of participants as well as the many opportunities for paired events with the option to lead if you have the talents to do so.}",

Tips for prospective students The campus is gorgeous, and feels more like a state park than a college. Definitely go to a football game if you get a chance, but stay away from Welch Avenue afterward. Jimmy John's, Jeff's Pizza, and The Fighting Burrito are located a few feet from campus, have delicious food, good prices, make deliveries, and are all open until around 3 AM. Take your parents to Hickory Park when they visit, you'll be glad you did. First year roommate assignments are usually random, so be prepared. Cyride, the bus system, makes it easy to get anywhere in Ames. The guy to girl ratio is unfavorable for men, but every female in that count is hot enough to be a model.",
