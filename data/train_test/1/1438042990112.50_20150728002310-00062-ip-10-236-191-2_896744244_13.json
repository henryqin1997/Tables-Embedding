            "There is a lot of frisbee and random activities you can do with friends. There is also a group called CAB which is a group of people who plan events for the whole campus to participate in.",
            "The food is very repetitive and sometimes not very edible. Every once and a while there is a good meal it is rare.",
            "In the dorm there is a definite community between the people living in the dorms. It is a very fun environment to be in.",
            "The professors challenge you but not to the point where the assignment is impossible. They want to make sure you know the information and are willing to meet with you to help you be the best.",
            "The food is not always the greatest and the wireless tends to go out. However, the dorm life is great and the RAs really try to make everyone feel welcome. It is easy to get involved in different things if you are willing to try new things.",
            "It is an excellent university for those who are wanting a Christian environment to further their education. The teachers are interested in their students and furthering their education, not advancing their research. It creates for a great social environment with many people who genuinely care about you."

The sooner you finish everything, the sooner you can start talking to roommate prospects. I knew who my roommate was by the end of February. Try to visit, if you can't they have lots of videos on the website and pictures on flickr. Stay in touch with your admissions counselor and don't be afraid to ask questions, even the ones that seem stupid. I couldn't visit and they made me my own personal tour. Just ask lots of questions.}",

Also if you are from a church it is easy to find more students that have the same religion as you and they will want to talk to you about it. The professors will as well. Tips for prospective students Yes, its a very expensive school and you might have to take out a few loans but I say that it is definitely worth it. I have grown in every area of life and I know that I have learned what I need to know and more for my major. Am enjoying being here I know a lot of my friends enjoy being at a big college but I enjoy being at this one because I went to a smaller high",
