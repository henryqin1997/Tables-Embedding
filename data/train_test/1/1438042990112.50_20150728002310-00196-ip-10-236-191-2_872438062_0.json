    "textAfterTable": "13 Songs Album Review Some singer/songwriters are so accustomed to deep, intense introspection that when they try to be funny, their humor comes across as awkward and unnatural. But that's never a problem for Deirdre Flint, whose wild sense of humor serves her impressively well on debut album, The Shuffleboard Queens. Undeniably witty and even hysterically funny at times, the Philadelphia-based folk/pop/rock artist tackles subjects ranging from wanting to be a cheerleader in high school (\"Cheerleader\") to being in a relationship with someone you have little in common with (\"We Fit Right\"). Flint, who plays acoustic guitar on all of the songs, isn't afraid to have some laughs at her own expense \u2014 on \"The Boob Fairy,\" she jokingly laments not having large breasts. \"Fishlands\" is a hilarious parody of Bruce Springsteen, but the CD's funniest song of all may very well be the goofy \"I'm Single,\" which finds her portraying a woman who becomes deranged after returning to single life. At first, the character seems to be enjoying her newfound freedom and declares that she could care less about having a man in her life, but when the loneliness really kicks in, she loses it and ends up having conversations with an imaginary friend named Emily. \"I'm Single\" is unlikely to become a feminist anthem any time soon \u2014",
