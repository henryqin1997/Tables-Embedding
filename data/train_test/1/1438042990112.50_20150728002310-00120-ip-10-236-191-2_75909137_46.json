Writer: Users granted this role have both read and write access to the workspace. They can create new folders, upload files, schedule meetings, create tasks, participate in discussions and manage relationships. Reader: Users granted this role have read-only access to the workspace. They cannot add new content or edit existing content. There are three workspace level roles: Workspace Creator: Users granted this role can create workspaces. If the workspace creation policy is Restricted, then only users with the Workspace Creator role can create workspaces. If the workspace creation policy is Public, then any user can create workspaces. When Workspace Creators create workspaces, they are granted Workspace Administrator privileges for that workspace. Workspace Creators do not have Administrator privileges over workspaces which they did not create. Application Administrator: Users granted this role can manage the entire Oracle Workspaces application. Some functions include granting/revoking application level roles, setting application level configuration properties and template management. Application Administrators can also perform any operation in any workspace; they can proxy as workspace administrators for any workspace.",
