In Rhode Island in 1991, when the governor declared a state-wide bank holiday, all the state-chartered savings banks were closed down. Every single citizen with money in one of those banks was locked out., 57871=(800) 621-1048, 55255=(800) 228-1872, 18195=Most prominent on our August \u201cX\u201d List was Citigroup, America\u2019s second largest banking conglomerate with over $2 trillion in total assets. The bank was already suffering crushing losses in mortgages. But at mid-year, it still had close to $200 billion in other mortgages on its books, denoting the strong possibility of many more to come., 19718=They are often high risk. And they are huge. According to the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), on June 30, 2008, U.S. commercial banks held $182.1 trillion in notional value (face value) derivatives.1 And, according to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), which produced a tally six months earlier for the entire world, the global pile-up of derivatives, including institutions in the U.S., Europe and Asia, was more than three times larger \u2014 $596 trillion.2, 54200=(800) 345-2021, 35623=Most observers think not. \u201cIf deposits are insured,\u201d they ask, \u201cwhy would anyone want to pull them out?\u201d The reason: Most bank runs are not caused by insured depositors. They\u2019re caused by the exodus of large, uninsured institutions who are usually the first to run for cover at the earliest hint of trouble. That\u2019s the main reason Washington Mutual, America\u2019s largest savings and loan, lost over $16 billion in deposits in its final eight days in 2008. That\u2019s also a major reason Wachovia Bank was forced to agree to a shotgun merger soon thereafter., 28839=That\u2019s why the world\u2019s highest banking officials were so panicked when Lehman Brothers failed in the fall of 2008. As the IMF managing director himself admitted, the threat was not stemming from just one bank in trouble; it was from many; and those banks weren\u2019t lesser players; they were among the largest in the world. Which U.S. banks placed the biggest bets? Based on mid-year 2008 data, the OCC provided some answers:, 24351=On October 11, 2008, a single statement hit the international wire services that provides more specific clues:, 69828=1 OCC\u2019s Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives Activities, Second Quarter 2008, http://www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/release/2008-115a.pdf, page 1., 73738=\u00a9 2008 by Weiss Research, Inc. All rights reserved., 12348=Martin D. Weiss, Ph.D. | Monday, November 24, 2008 at 10:00 am, 23172=This is the question I have asked here in Money and Markets month after month. Almost everyone said it was far-fetched, that I was overstating the risk. Yet, each of the hypothetical events I cited in the above three questions have now taken place in 2008., 27600=Here\u2019s the key: For the most part, the global derivatives market has no brokerage, no exchange, and no equivalent enforcement mechanism. In fact, among the $181.2 trillion in derivative bets held by U.S. banks at mid-year 2008, only $8.2 trillion, or 4.5%, was regulated by an exchange. The balance \u2014 $173.9 trillion, or 95.5% \u2014 was bets placed directly between buyer and seller (called \u201cover the counter\u201d). And among the $596 trillion in global derivatives tracked by the BIS at year-end 2007, 100% were over the counter. No exchanges. No overarching enforcement mechanism., 17765=How will the events unfold? That\u2019s a massively complex question that demands an extremely cautious and thoughtful answer. That\u2019s why, this past August, we devoted a full hour to this question in our \u201cX\u201d List video, naming the most likely candidates for bankruptcy. So let me review its primary conclusions and then take this discussion to the next level.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Correction: In yesterday\u2019s edition, I incorrectly stated that Wachovia was bought by JPMorgan Chase. The failed bank purchased by JPMorgan Chase was Washington Mutual. The buyer of Wachovia is Wells Fargo. Martin Good luck and God bless! For my family and business money, we use the Weiss Treasury Only Money Market Fund. Plus we also use the fund that was founded by James Benham, a good friend of my father\u2019s. That\u2019s Capital Preservation Fund, which Jim sold to the American Century family of funds. Use either of these or your choice of the fund in the list below. Moreover, the Treasury-only money fund gives you the additional advantage of immediate availability of your money. You can have your funds wired to your local bank overnight. Or you can even write checks against it, much as you\u2019d write checks against any bank checking account. Meanwhile, for most of your personal or business, savings or checking, you don\u2019t need a bank, an S&L or any other financial institution. All you need is a money market fund that invests in short-term U.S. Treasury bills or equivalent. The Treasuries it buys enjoy the same U.S. government guarantee as Treasuries bought through any other venue. So deposit insurance is simply not an issue.",
