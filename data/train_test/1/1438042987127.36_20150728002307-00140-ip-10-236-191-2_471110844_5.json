    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While there have been shown and described several embodiments of the present invention, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appending claims. One goal of the VBUS service is to require minimal support from the network server. The only server requirement is providing each switch with a connection to all other switches in the network (domain), which in effect provides the multicast channel for flooding VLAN packets. In one embodiment, a VLAN status table is provided. This table allows an entire VLAN to be enable or disabled regardless of the number of user or switch ports assigned to the VLAN in the switch. Thus, it is possible to shut off a particular VLAN inside a particular switch without having to administer each individual switch port or end system. This verb set assigns (and removes) a switch port to (or from) a specific VLAN. The switches provide managed objects accessible by the MIB which are all accessed with standard SNMP get, get next, and set messages. (map-port, unmap-port) SFPS VLAN-ID! inPort! This verb set assigns (and removes) a user MAC address and switch port to (or from) a specific VLAN. (map, unmap) SFPS VLAN-ID! inPort! userMAC! The application interface may be provided with an",
