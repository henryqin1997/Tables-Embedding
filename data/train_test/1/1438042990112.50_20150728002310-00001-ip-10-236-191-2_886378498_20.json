            "Get an advisor and ask every question you have. Then ask general questions to try to pick up on anything you missed. Finally, when you're all out of questions ask a little more incase. I know I could have made things a bit easier on myself if I'd bothered to ask the right questions.",
            "I like it there. It's not perfect but no college is. They're very clear about what you have to do to get your degree."

I was involved in the Moore, Oklahoma tornado in 2013. With that said, it was a devastation in Moore that everything was hit, including all houses within a mile of my house. Altogether, during the time I was cleaning up and transitioning into a new home and rebuilding my city and home- Iowa Western professors and other employees at IWCC were flexible with me and helped me complete my classes in a orderly manor. No, they did not give me special treatment- but they did give me forgiveness. When the tornado happened they were truly understandable and gave me an extent on a the assignments that were due for that week and the next week. They are truly encouraging and did nothing but encourage me to try my best and they easily tested my knowledge.}",
