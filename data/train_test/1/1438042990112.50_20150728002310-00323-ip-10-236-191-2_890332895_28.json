            "The town of Whitewater itself is very safe, rarely anything happens around here crime-wise. Granted, I still don't recommend walking around downtown at 1 in the morning by yourself; you still need to exercise common sense. Luckily, the main paths on campus are always well lit and every couple of yards they have a emergency thing you can press if anything goes down. The University Police also offers escorts if you're feeling nervous, just call their hotline and it's all good.",
            "Lots of Greek stuff, even though I'm not in it, they've got one for everyone too...music ones, guy ones, girl ones, ones for African-Americans, honors ones...the list goes on and on.",
            "Sooo many clubs!! Black Student Union, Christian Clubs, Knitting Club, Optimist Club, Habitat for Humanity, DECA, Intramurals, Club and Varsity Sports, and everything in between. And I mean EVERYTHING.",
            "Anyone who wants to make friends and expand your horizons, socially, emotionally, academically...etc. So pretty much everyone.",
            "Plan-it-purple is a rite of passage for every new freshman, and it's pretty fun when you get to run through the football field and you're basically running through this huge tunnel of people who are all giving you high fives. It's pretty sweet! The big spirit ralley is good times too, and you get to literally get to paint the road purple with all your fellow freshman.",
            "Whitewater undoubtedly offers the best education around here for the best price. College is never cheap, but it's the most moderately priced UW school; and keep in mind the 100's of student orgs, fantastic gym facility, and excellent atmosphere, its well worth every penny.",
            "Whitewater is known to have a good time, and this is true; but it doesn't always mean there's alcohol involved. Trust me when I say that you can make friends there without having to puke your guts out. The RA's (resident assistants) and complex directors are always setting up free stuff for the residents, and if you're not into that, there's always stuff to do at the University Center, from bowling to pool to videogames. They have comedians and bands come there a lot too, every week there's always someone new there. They show movies at the UC for just $1, they show movies that are just about to go to DVD and I'd highly recommend you going to one, I saw a lot of great movies there.",
            "Depending on which side of campus you're on, (in this case the East side) you can go to Esker Dining Hall (a traditional all-you-can-eat experience) or Prairie Street Market, which has fresh made-to-order subs and burgers too. On the west side is Drumlin, which isn't all you-can-eat, but is going to be remodeled starting this fall...and I've heard it's going to be a lot better than it used to be. At the UC they have a coffee shop/bakery and smoothie place, they have Uno Due Go which has burgers, pizza, and stuff like that. The Commons area also serves breakfast and lunch. (I think they have a sub place up there too.) Around campus they have tons of places, mostly fast food chains like Culvers, Pizza Hut, and Mcdonalds...the usual campus hotspots. They also have some great Mexican and Asian food too (that aren't chains.) Downtown they have some pretty good local spots like Rosa's Pizza and Jessica's Family Restaurant. Their food is great, but best of all their prices are adjusted for a college students' tight budget.",
            "The first thing I would recommend is if you know what program you want to go into before you start classes, go into a learning community. It really eases the transition from high school to college; you meet people who are into the same things as you are, it's a great launching pad for meeting other people. Even if you don't decide to be in one of those, just keep your door open that first week; it literally opens up doors of opportunity (sorry for the pun) for you and potential friends you may meet on your floor/building.",
            "Completely depends on the professor and how serious you are about your studies; it's amazing how different a class can be when the teacher is different. You can either take classes with a teacher who passes everyone, or you can take one with a teacher that you'll actually learn from. I got a mix of both, and both kinds really helped me along my academic path.",
            "It sounds lame, but GET INVOLVED!! I was a bit of a shut-in my first semester, but after I got involved with my student org (Campus Crusade for Christ) I met so many new friends, and got a chance to tighten bonds with friends I had already known before. Want the best college experience possible? It's simple really; get as much scholarship and grant money as possible, then get involved with something, it beats staying in your dorm; I can tell you that from experience.",
            "Whitewater is known for its phenomenal Business and Education programs, but the truth is, it's all around an excellent college for any Major, from Music and Theater to Nursing and Video Game Design. It's just the right size, located in a great community, and it'll be guaranteed that as soon as you're done with your freshman year, you'll want to keep coming back."

It is all you can eat buffet, however, severely over or under cooked food, particularly chicken, is a daily occurrence. Food in the University Center is very good, however, it is expensive. Drumlin Hall and P-Street Cafe have similar food which is OK but selection is either a burger or sub, everyday. Drumlin Hall is closed for the 2012-2013 school year. Only eat at Esker Hall on their occasional steak and shrimp nights as it is cooked right., 208029=UW-Whitewater is in the process of re-opening one of the main dining halls; the tenative date of opening is February 28th. The quality of the other dining halls on campus is good. We have a lot of options that range from pasta to pizza! We have a couple well known restaurants on campus such as Unos and Erberts & Gerberts. We also have a few sandwich shops and a buffet as well., 312411=Dorm food is nice because it's easy to not have to try to figure out dinner on your own, but it can be a little gross sometimes. Drumlin was just renovated in 2013, so it's pretty nice and tastes okay from what I've had. Esker is low-quality food, but you get a lot of it. Erbs and Gerbs is always busy and frequently runs out of ingredients. P-Street is pretty good depending on what you get. The UC has a lot of good food but doesn't cover it in the meal plans for the most part.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Bang for the buck Whitewater is one of the cheapest all around university schools in Wisconsin. You get the most for your money and it is very well spent. The meal plans are one of the cheapest and you get so many choices to choose from. The tuition is one of the lowest as well. Whitewater provides so many opportunities for the students like complex parties, comedians, or live bands which are all under $5 if not free. Am enjoying being here I thoroughly enjoy being here. My fellow peers are always around for help with my homework or just to be there as a friend. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. I've always found something to do with my time, whether it be bowling, pool, air hockey, or just hanging out with my friends. There's no place I'd rather be. Am learning a lot At Whitewater, I have learned many things in each of my classes that I truly believe I can actually carry with me for the rest of my life. The classes I've taken for my major have helped me to learn what I need to learn in order to be",
