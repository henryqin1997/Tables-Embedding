I noticed bad signals with them, which was frustrating. One day, my phone went flying and shattered the screen. I was told yes, my warranty that I had paid for three months would cover the damage. I called the warranty, gave them my info. The guy said. .. your not on here, are you sure you have a mobilicity phone. Well, I bought it from a mobilicity kiosk so yes, I am sure! I went to the kiosk and explained. The guy said the warranty does not cover my phone. My phone is a third party phone. Still confused on what he was saying because I bought it from them. I spoke to the manager and he called the center. He repeated what they said, my phone is a third party phone. Not a mobilicity phone. Therefore my warranty does not cover anything. The manager told me that mobilcity could not keep up with production of the samsung galaxy s3\u2019s and was told to purchase elsewhere.. which was tmobile. Any s3s purchased around January 2013 until April 2013 or however long. Are third party phones that are not locked or covered by their company. I had to fight to get my money back for my warranty. A lady said I did not qualify, she hung up on me. I talked to man who did refund my money. I will never go to mobilicity again for services, nor recommend them. I\u2019m currently with wind and have been with them for six months. I love it, and can\u2019t wait to get a new phone to continue with wind!, 12843=Both carriers use the AWS 1700 MHz spectrum, which doesn\u2019t offer as much bandwidth/penetration as other spectrums. However, there are tons of Android phones you can buy that use this spectrum (for instance, T Mobile branded phones). Mobilicity has also just introduced 4G coverage as well, for an extra $20/mo.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "In Canada, it\u2019s very hard to get away from the Big Three if you want decent wireless service at a price that won\u2019t run in to the hundreds of dollars per month. The only real options, especially if you\u2019re bringing your own phone, are WIND and Mobilicity (Fido is also cheap, but owned by Rogers Telecommunications). The two independent carriers in Alberta are WIND Mobile and Mobilicity. Here\u2019s a first hand comparison of both carriers from a consumer\u2019s point of view. Both carriers were evaluated using special deals for unlimited talk time, free Canada wide calling, unlimited texts to the US & Canada, and unlimited data at $32/mo each after taxes & fees. \u2014 3 Comments \u2193 Tyler.Style by December 8, 2012 Posted on Review: WIND Mobile vs Mobilicity in Alberta Contact Us About Us Testimonials Tips, Tricks and How-Tos Linux Support Service Packages Our Services Home",

Overall, the winner is Mobilicity. WIND has better coverage is good, but what use is it if you can\u2019t understand the caller or can\u2019t keep the call from dropping? Go with Mobilicity if you want a budget plan without contract lock-in and OK service and coverage.\u00a0 Follow Email link \u2039 Tablet Review: MSI WindPad 110W with Windows 7 Tip: Hide \u201cLinkedIn Today\u201d Spam on LinkedIn Home \u203a",
