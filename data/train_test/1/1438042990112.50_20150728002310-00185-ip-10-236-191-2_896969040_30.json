    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I came into SAIC knowing very little about the modern art world. I was afraid of being surrounded by snobs who knew everything. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sure, the people who inhabit this small but renowned school have a fairly extensive knowledge of art, but they are happy to share and educate as long as the student is willing to learn. My eyes were opened to the kind of things considered art in today's world. The knowledge I have gained in only my first year will inform all other projects that I choose to create.
