However, in compared to her other self, the alternate Tsunade wears glasses and is flat-chested. During her time in Konoha, the alternate Sakura nearly gets herself killed when pointing out Tsunade's busty appearance. Naruto 6: Road to Ninja Tsunade states that Naruto is wanted for attempting to assassinate the leader of Kumogakure, the Raikage, and killing j\u014dnin from Kirigakure and Iwagakure to Team Kakashi placed him under arrest and taken to H\u014dzukij\u014d, a criminal containment facility, also known as the \"Blood Prison\", in Kusagakure. She and all his friends have gathered there. Tsunade reveals that it was Naruto's mission to destroy the box and that no one believed that Naruto really committed any of the crimes. Naruto 5: Blood Prison Tsunade was reported by Kakashi about the mission, while worrying that the next ninja targeted will be him. Tsunade seems to not care so much, telling Kakashi to relax. At the hospital, Kakashi gives Naruto his bells, which they used for their first drill together, and tells him to fix them because he crushed them. Tsunade sent Konoha",
    "textAfterTable": "Creation and Conception Tsunade's name is taken from the character of the same name from \"The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya\" (\u81ea\u6765\u4e5f\u8c6a\u5091\u7269\u8a9e, Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari). The Tsunade in that story is vastly different in terms of personality, along with the fact that unlike her manga counterpart the original Tsunade was married to Jiraiya, however both were known to greatly excel in slug magic. Trivia \"Tsunade\" (\u7db1\u624b) means \"mooring rope\", which is not dissimilar to her brothers name, Nawaki, which means \"rope tree\". A similar word \"tsundere\" (\u30c4\u30f3\u30c7\u30ec), could also be a play on Tsunade's personality. Tsunade shares the same blood type with her former team-mates, Jiraiya and Orochimaru. Tsunade was the first female Hokage, as well as the first female Kage, that appeared in the series. Tsunade is first mentioned when Might Guy questions Rock Lee, Neji, and Tenten about their goals as genin. Tenten says that she wants to become a great kunoichi and follow the footsteps of the legendary Tsunade. According to the databook(s): Tsunade's hobby is gambling. Tsunade wishes to fight Naruto Uzumaki. Tsunade's favourite foods are chicken breast and sake, while her least favourite food is liver sashimi. Tsunade has completed 1,256 official missions in total: 40 D-rank,",
