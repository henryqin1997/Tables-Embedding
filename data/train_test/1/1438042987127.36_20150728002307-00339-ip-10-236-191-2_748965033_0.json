The school\u2019s award-winning band will be among the nation\u2019s elite when it goes to Washington, D.C., for the annual National Independence Day Parade. The AJ band earned its trip to the nation\u2019s capital after its division-winning performance in the Hartsville High Tournament of Bands last fall., 30527=After more than four years of waiting, the excitement was palpable as Lancaster County officials cut the ribbon April 24 to officially open Walnut Creek Park. The event, originally slated for last October, but delayed due to legal issues, drew local officials and residents, all eager to see the new 60-acre, $7 million county park complex in Indian Land., 29240=The 2013 Celebration of Excellence, the annual Lancaster County School District\u2019s salute to the best in education and service, included its annual induction of hall of fame members. Four deserving individuals, who made an impact in the classroom and beyond, took center stage on Monday, April 29, at the Lancaster Golf Club\u2019s Fairway Room. The latest inductees included Bennett Gunter, C.C. Hanson, Ann Hough and Floyd White., 31767=When the 2012-13 school year ends at Indian Land High School, it will mark the end of an era. For the last 20 years, well over the span of a school career for a student from kindergarten to graduation, Tamara Jacobus has been teaching and coaching at the Lancaster County Class AA high school. When the ILHS doors close at the end of the month, Jacobus will be leaving for the final time., 22460=The bowling lanes at the Kershaw Recreation Center at Stevens Park are taking on a new life. Thanks to a major renovation project, the lanes sport a more pleasing, modern look. Back in February, Kershaw Town Council voted to allocate $118,330 from the town\u2019s reserve fund for the bowling alley\u2019s major improvements. Town officials have considered ways to increase attendance at Stevens Park and use of its facilities, and the bowling alley has been a major part of those discussions., 25195=On May 20, we were reminded that natural disasters of all kinds can bring devastation on a massive scale. In just a few seconds, the lives of Moore, Okla., residents were changed by an EF5 tornado that destroyed entire buildings while injuring or killing residents as they took shelter. We can\u2019t prevent natural disasters, but we can prepare for them. By being ready and knowing what to do in a disaster, we can minimize risk, reduce the time it takes to recover and most importantly, prevent the loss of life., 23842=Richard Band devoted 35 years to the Lancaster County Library and it\u2019s likely his legacy will be felt for years to come. Band, 64, retired May 31 after spending nearly half of his life improving and expanding the Lancaster County Library system. Band\u2019s impact is obvious. \u201cWhen I came, we had no branches and were only open one night a week,\u201d Band said. \u201cWe had a big old card catalog in the middle of the room with 40,000 cards that took up all the room. There wasn\u2019t a lot of technology.\u201d, 26540=Take a good look at the Graduation 2013 special section. It\u2019s full of the graduates from all four county high schools. Today, about 787 Lancaster County students will march across four graduation stages to receive their high school diplomas. Later, they\u2019ll flip the tassels on their mortarboards as they celebrate their graduation with the friends, family, teachers and administrators who helped them along the way. \u00a0}",
