He backed Nile on his song \"One Guitar,\" then made it through Gary U.S. Bonds' \"This Little Girl is Mine\" with LaBamba, Southside Johnny, and Bon Jovi guitarist Bobby Bandiera. He even played \"From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),\" \"Because the Night\" and \"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\", 6160=If your first thought upon reading this was it's impossible it took so long for the honor, you're not alone. Many thought the band was included when Springsteen was enshrined back in 1999, but it was not to be. The Boss went in as a solo performer despite the fact that nearly all of his gigs since 1972 have come with the E-Street Band backing him on stage., 2556=Springsteen's true breakthrough came with the release of 'Born to Run' on August 25, 1975. The album reached No. 3 on the Billboard 200, with five singles finding heavy rotation on many rock stations around the country. The moderate success allowed Springsteen to embark on his first national tour, bringing with it a wave of publicity and establishing him as a dynamic rock and roll personality., 6383=Fifteen years after Bruce Springsteen became a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the E-Street Band has finally joined him. The band was inducted during ceremonies in New York on Thursday, April 10., 3988=As the Wrecking Ball swings on, there are dates scheduled all the way into September 2013. There are stops planned in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Italy, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Ireland, Wales and Brazil. That final date will take Springsteen and the E Street Band to the Rock in Rio festival on September 15 and will mark Springsteen's first appearance in that country in 25 years., 7128=No one knows for sure when or if Springsteen will make any 2015 touring plans known \u2013 including members of his own E Street Band. Nils Lofgren recently gave an interview stating he had no idea when 'The Boss' would be back on the road., 6874=In all, Springsteen played more than 30 dates with the E Street Band early in 2014. Beyond the Light of Day Festival, he also appeared at November's Concert for Valor and at December's World AIDS Day concert when he was filling in for Bono., 4932=Bruce and the band are currently in the middle of that aforementioned 34-date tour, with 15 dates in the U.S., including a performance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival in May., 6615=Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band's Tower Theater show from 1975 is the latest archival offering from the LiveBruceSpringsteen.net download portal., 857=Never outspoken and always passionate, Springsteen's 17th album, \"Wrecking Ball\" was released March 5 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. In support of the project he just wrapped an 11-week trip through Europe, performing some of his longest sets ever. Bruce and the band will also play an additional 16 dates in the U.S. and Canada for the 'Wrecking Ball' World Tour, beginning October 19 in Ottawa, Ontario and continuing through December 6 in Glendale, Arizona., 3577=The continued success comes just months after Springsteen was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year on February 8, 2013 at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The award came in recognition of Springsteen's creative accomplishments, as well as his charitable work and philanthropic efforts.}",

Bruce and the band will also play an additional 16 dates in the U.S. and Canada for the 'Wrecking Ball' World Tour, beginning October 19 in Ottawa, Ontario and continuing through December 6 in Glendale, Arizona. Controversy reared its head again when Springsteen chose to address the 9/11 attacks on \"The Rising\" (2002). As his first album of new material in seven years, it was hailed by critics and fans alike as a return to prominence, moving 520,000 copies in its first week. But behind a mix of songs about loss and confusion, hope and faith, fear and longing was an artist who would eventually endorse a presidential candidate, then use a Grammy appearance as a platform to reference the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. All things considered, Springsteen is probably best known for his album 'Born in the U.S.A.' (1984). The record sold 15 million copies in the United States, saw seven singles soar into the Top 10 and allowed Springsteen and his E Street Band to ascend to an unrivaled height of popularity. The title track, a commentary on the treatment of Vietnam",
