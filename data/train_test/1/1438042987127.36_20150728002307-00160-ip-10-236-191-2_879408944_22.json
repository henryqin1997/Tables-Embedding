            "In the Broadway campus there is no lunch room, only vender maching and tables in the hallway with a microwave oven.",
            "City college has a main campus on 138 street in Harlem. That campus is bigger and has more students. I don't live in dorm,",
            "In City College/ CWE the Professors are great. You will label your favorite Professor. You will learn most of the Professors there are Doctors. In my Law and Lit class i wanted to change that class because that Professor was talking a lot. I went to my advisor to and asked to change class, but he talked me out of my decision and it was one of the best things that happened to me. I learned so much Law and Literature , it became very interesting. I thanked my advisor for convincing me in staying put. There is a challenge in learning and it's worth it. You just have to be focus and be ready to learn. When the semester is over, you will have a great feeling, you won't feel like it was a waste of time.",
            "For prospective students are students who wants to continue they education or start off fresh at City college is fantastic idea. City college is an accredited school and is willing to take credits from your previous accredited college. When I first started, i transferred 40 credits from my previous college, which was wonderful. However, city college/ CWE campus is on Broadway. They only offer Liberal Arts degree with a concentration in Human Services, communication , business act...and it also offers New York teachers degree in early childhood education. This school is about completing what you started. Everyone is serious in cwe and that's what i love about it. Most students that goes to cwe are parents and employees. It's not a fashion show or who has a crush on who. We only attend there for one thing.",
            "I attend CWE , center for workers educations in City college and i like it. CWE is for working adults who wants to continue their education. All students are adults and we all there for the same purpose."

It isn't particularly difficult to get in to the school as long as you complete the application correctly and have fulfilled all of the applicant requirements. It's also a very affordable university, about $2000 per semester for in-state, $8000 for out of state, and there are plenty of Honors programs and scholarships to be had!, 132368=The campus is in Harlem, which isn't that great of a neighborhood. I'm usually always on campus, and I've never had a problem with safety. My walk from the train station to the campus is about 5 minutes long. I've never felt threatened along the way and my latest class ends at 7:45 PM. I actually walk past an elementary school so there usually isn't any funny business going on. For late hours, however, I know that there is a public safety number to call. Apparently a patrol officer will escort you to the train station, or wherever you need to be that is within a reasonable proximity to the campus. The number is located on our ID cards., 347745=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73695=From the beginning of Fall 2011 semester till now, I have learned about many aspects about my major. Advisers and professors always aid in choosing the right classes for my major. And my fellow classmates and friends from previous years have also guided me on the campus about the questions I may have., 281212=People come to CCNY (and CUNYS in general) because of it's low tuition cost. CCNY is about $2500-$3000 a semester (about $5000 a year) and it is ranked as one of Princeton Review's and US news best colleges. CCNY is a good school, for very cheap.}",
