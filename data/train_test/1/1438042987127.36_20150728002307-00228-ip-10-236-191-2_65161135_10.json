            "WOW!! I didn't get around to planting the 50 Pastel Mixture corms (only $20) until well into July, probably 2 months later than ideal. We had stunning late summer blooms that blossomed in stages in glorious colors right up until the end of October! Some of the blooms even tolerated several nights of frosts. We've never grown gladiolus before & were delighted with our results. Next year, we plan to plant some early & then another batch in mid-summer just to see if we can replicate our results. Highly recommended!",
            "I ordered about 40-50 glads at the very end of their selling season last year. My fault--I had not gotten around to it. They very kindly took my order and the corms arrived quickly. The corms were large and firm and were very ready to start growing! And when they flowered a little late--my fault for ordering them so late---they were no less beautiful. Where I live, glads planted with a warm wall reflecting heat back on them often winter over. This has been the case for a number of the corms I planted last year, too. I just don't have the time to take them up & preserve them over the winter, so I treat them as annuals that might be perennials if things go well. The Noweta glads I put in the warmer spots have all come up this spring, too.",
            "I sent an E-mail requesting a catalog and also asked a question about their glads. I never heard back from them on the question, but did receive a beautiful color catalog in the mail in just a few days. The catalog answered the question I had asked, so I guess they thought that was enough. These people apparently aren't overly chatty, as they also don't list a phone number. But I took a chance and sent them a Money Order (they don't take credit cards) and my order arrived exactly when I requested with the correct bulbs (large and healthy corms) and even extra bonus corms. Good quality product, nice bonus and perfect delivery. I will certainly order from them again.",
            "I ordered 3 different named varieties of glad bulbs from Noweta Gardens, Inc. When I received the order the bulbs had arrived in fine condition, even though the bulbs were not placed in packing material (I would recommend that the company use some sort of packing material, even crumpled newspaper). When I opened the box not only did I find my complete order, but also found that the company included an extra package of one of the varities, PLUS another package of mystery glad bulbs, all for free. What great customer service! I just have to find the room for them in my garden (now that's a happy dilemma)! The bulbs are large, and the varieties will be extremely colorful. I will definitely order from Noweta again, and recommend them to all family and friends.",
            "This company does not take credit cards or phone orders so I was a bit worried about sending a check, but I'm so glad I did. This is a great company. I've ordered from them for the past three years. The bulbs are large top quality bulbs, professionally packaged and shipped for arrival within a couple of days of the date that you designate as the \"arrival date\" on the order form. Oh, and they have added a surprise package of 10 bulbs in each of my orders. And although they don't have a phone number listed on the catalog, they've always responded to my e-mails (I've tried to find out the \"surprise\" variety twice). If you love glads, give this company a try, you won't be disappointed."
