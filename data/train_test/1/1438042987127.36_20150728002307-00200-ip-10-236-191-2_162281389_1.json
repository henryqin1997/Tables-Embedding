(and at what position)2) who would be that STARTER?, 89584=Bryce Harper clearly is killing the ball on the road. Not sure why he doesn't do as well in Nats Park. His road splits are .313/.373/.525/.898 Yesterday was a good sign for Bryce with 2 hits including that hustle double.Bryce hits for more power in day games but his BA is almost identical between day and night games .283 vs .287This is what I found interesting about Bryce. He is \"Mr. Sunday\" and this isn't a small sample size as he has played about 9 weeks now and 9 Sundays and has started 8 games as he sat on June 10th and had that memorable pinch-hit walk and scored the winning run from 1st on Bernadina's double.Every Sunday he has started he has 2 hits except that 1st Sunday in LA where he went 1 for 3 with a walk.His Sunday Batting Average is exactly .500 and his OBP is .583Most Sunday games have been day games and he isn't hitting better in day games overall. Whatever Bryce is doing on Sunday and on road games he needs to try to replicate to all other days of the week and games at Nats Park., 112699=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern. You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 19181=I would still like to know the overall team avg, runs per game, hits, rbi, etc.. now compared to the 2007-2009 teams. My theory is that this club statistically may be the worst since 2005. This also proves winning teams all have great pitching. with that said this team may make post season, but will be out quickly if they don't get some bats. I think those bats are in their farm system and that is a good sign., 97305=If you are going to spend money on a high price free agent or make a blockbuster trade, why not do this in early 2013 when we will know exactly what holes are left to fill? Because you never know what tomorrow brings. There is no \"supposed to win\" year. The year you win is the year you win. If anyone could control it, it would be the Yankees, and they can't. You take your chances when they come, because they don't come often., 49051=Rogieshan, I agree with SJM in thinking Youkilis is not the answer. I'm asking about a real heavy duty bat\u2013like a Victorino but not necessarily him at his age and batting .256 or thereabouts\u2013and there may not be one available who fits our mold from any of the teams looking to deal or dump come deadline time. Dempster might be a pitcher to go after. I'm guessing the bidding will be too high for Hamels and Garza.For some reason I believe Det will come around consistency-wise and be a good #5 who will b/c a good #4 come mid-September. We could limp in with Wang or Stammen at #5 if we don't trade. Drew back will help the BP a lot and maybe a guy like Kimball will actually make it back whole. Or Henry for the 6th or 7th inning.But how do you keep Moore in the game when Werth is back? How often can you rotate him with LaRoche? And I imagine Werth comes back in right field moving Morse to left and if Morse isn't hitting in left\u2013the only reason to rotate Moore there\u2013then we are probably sunk anyway IMO. So do we start rotating Moore in right to ease Werth back in\u2013making him learn still another position? And speaking of LF\u2013much the same applies to Lombo unless he is holding down the fort with DeRosa at 3B in case of a Zim surgery. Or do Moore and Lombo ride the bench more than ever in order to PH? B/c I don't think trading LaRoche is the way to go. In fact I'd pick up Adam's option for 2013 and try to resign Edwin Jackson for another 2-3 years. Given some luck I think we could steal a WS with what we have, but it would require a move or two to strategically better those odds\u2013but how is a complicated answer. Rizzo will have to make some tough (non-)decisions., 125194=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 10903=Derek Norris will be interviewed on MLB Network right before 7:15 EST, 87893=The east division is ours to lose.Yes, we should be happy that it's a late June and the team is sitting in first place. But, it's still a shame given the way the pitching staff has performed to date that we're not running away from the pack by a wide margin. And even though the team looks poised to reach post-season, I'd hate to see it done solely on the back of the arms that will be minus its ace Strasburg come playoff time. I don't know if Eckstein is the main reason for the anemic offense, since he appears to have full support of Davey Johnson and the players, and looks to be only doing exactly what he was assigned to do, that is, faithfully and meticulously preaching the manager's own \"selective aggressive\" hitting philosophy.One of Rizzo's biggest tasks in the off-season was to upgrade the bench. Has he? I know Lombardozzi is a key piece of the puzzle, and Chad Tracy was proving his value before he got hurt. But really, how can the GM defend what DeRosa, Nady, Ankiel and Bernadina have delivered thus far?, 51372=I would still like to know the overall team avg, runs per game, hits, rbi, etc.. now compared to the 2007-2009 teams. Dunn and Willigham weren't as good as you think.2012 0.311 wOBA -25.1 bRAA2011 0.312 wOBA -40.1 bRAA2010 0.318 wOBA -31.8 bRAA2009 0.333 wOBA 8.1 bRAAWhat this should tell you is that Dunn, Willingham, and Werth weren't and aren't much of an improvement. The bRAA (and yes the R stands for runs) is best when its a big positive number. A lot was lost when Nick Johnson was traded hitting wise and Zim had a great year in 2009 as did Dunn. The 2012 vs 2011 bRAA should also indicate that Harper is far better than that numbskull Dave Nicols thinks he is. But then Dave is a pretty dim bulb where Nats bloggers are concerned. Yes Dave he is holding the Nats up right now offensively. Yes, Davey, Harper should be an All Star., 72844=alexva==> doesn't sound like Zim's going to have the surgery during the season. He said he's going to have sporadic shots (next one after the ASG) and play through it. That could cause bone chips which they will clean up in postseason surgery, if needed.Somewhere there was an estimate of 4-6 weeks recovery time (plus rehab) from that type of shoulder surgery and he could be back mid-August. I dunno. Seems optimistic to me, and even with the optimism, that's a lot of games to miss. I guess RZ is saying, I'll play the full season at 80%, rather than miss 50 games and hope for 100%., 21779=I don't see why Ryan Z. just wont do this surgery that will have his shoulder right. The estimate is 4 to 6 weeks. If he were to have the surgery now, 6 weeks from now would be the first week of August. If you figure two weeks for rehab, he would still have half of August and all of September to help the team. I'd rather have him at 100% than 50%\u2026.but I digress. Maybe these cortisone shots will do the trick, but I'd rather he just do the surgery now and be fully ready for the stretch run. Anyhow, lets take 3 out of 4 from the Rockies, and as usual, GYFNG!!!!, 96114=To add to sjm 308's point, I would not add any free agent unless there is a devastating injury of some sorts. I think you use 2012 as a stepping stone in that, yes, we can make post season but not at all costs, let us remember that Strass will be shut down so 2012 really was never suppose to be the year we go to a World Series. In other words, if you are going to spend money on a high price free agent or make a blockbuster trade, why not do this in early 2013 when we will know exactly what holes are left to fill?}",
