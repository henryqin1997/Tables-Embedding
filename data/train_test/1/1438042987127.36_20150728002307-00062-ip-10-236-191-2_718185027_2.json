Generally, for large areas, the deviation from the estimated sample size was found to be quite small. Biases may have arisen, however, when the enumerator failed to follow his listing and sampling instructions exactly. A 1-percent sample was used for the data in table 17. The 1-percent sample and a 4-percent sample were used for the data in table 18. These samples represent, respectively, those households in the 5-percent and 20-percent housing samples that fell in the 5-percent population sample. The 1960 statistics in tables 1 to 16 and 19 to 28 of this report are based on a subsample of one-fifth of the original 25-percent sample schedules. The 5-percent sample was selected on the computer, using a stratified systematic Sample Design. The strata were made up as follows: For",
    "textAfterTable": "The sample weighting areas -were defined as those areas within a State consisting of central cities of Urbanized Areas, the remaining portion of urbanized areas not in central cities, urban places not in Urbanized Areas, or rural areas. 3 For each of the 44 groups, the ratio of the complete count to the sample count of the population in the group was determined. Each specific sample person in the group was assigned an integral weight so that the sum of the weights would equal the complete count for the group. For example, if the ratio for a group was 20.1, one-tenth of the persons (selected at random) within the group were assigned a weight of 21, and the remaining nine-tenths a weight of 20. The use of such a combination of integral weights rather than a single fractional weight was adopted to avoid the complications involved in rounding in the final tables. (The weights for the 1-percent and the 4-percent samples were produced by inflating weights from the 5-percent sample by uniform factors of 5 and 1.25, respectively.) In order to increase the reliability, where there were fewer than 275 persons in the complete count in a group, or where the resulting 5-percent sample weight was over 80, groups were combined in a specific order to satisfy both of these two conditions. These ratio estimates reduce the component of sampling error arising from the variation In the",
