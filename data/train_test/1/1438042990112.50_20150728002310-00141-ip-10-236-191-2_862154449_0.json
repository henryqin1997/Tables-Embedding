    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 Speed 13, Glide 5, Turn -4, Fade 2 The Innova Proto Star Stamped Vulcan is an understable distance driver that was designed with the less powerful disc golf players in mind. The Vulcan flies similarly to the Katana with less low speed fade. (The Katana is less understable or more stable than the Vulcan.) The lower weights are great for longer shots. It is one of Innova's lightest distance drivers in Star plastic. The Vulcan makes a great first speed 13 driver for beginners. For skilled players, it's a great long turnover driver. It makes a great long range roller too. The Vulcan is high speed with a bunch of turn! Beginner friendly. 21.2 cm diameter.

The Vulcan is great for a less powerful thrower like myself.\" - Alan Beaver \u00a0 If you are looking for a disc with more Glide, try the Kite more Turn, try the Mamba more Fade, try the Katana \u00a0 Other Speed 13 discs include the Ape, Boss, Dominator, Groove and Katana.
