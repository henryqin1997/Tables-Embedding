            "The university takes the safety of its students seriously. There are blue polls all around campus; whenever you're in an emergency, you run to one and push a button, immediately help is on it's way. There are patrols and security around the campus as well and whenever you have a question, you can easily find a person on campus or in the security office in the main student union.",
            "Minnesota State University, Mankato has a lot of events that you can attend. But if it's outside campus activities you're talking about, how about shopping at the River Hills Mall? Or maybe attending one of the many art displays in the city. In the winter time, Mankato puts on a beautiful lights show in Sibley Park. If these don't sound exciting, there are so much more you can do around the city.",
            "Dorms are connected to the main dining hall which makes it easier to get food. There are many varieties in the dining hall. Every day there is a different hot dish, main dish, etc. But if you're not feeling the dining hall, there are many other food courts around campus that you can go to.",
            "I love the dorm life. There are many things that I do with my floor. Floor gatherings and outings are what connects everyone together. We go out to events around campus, and by doing so, we learn more about each other and create friendships.",
            "It's not too hard but it's not too easy as well. There are some classes that will have you working night and day to understand and others where you're able to understand it within minutes and move on. But I guess, it all also depends on your professor.",
            "Minnesota State University, Mankato has many extracurricular activities. Joining some, or even one, will help you enjoy your time on campus even more. There are events throughout the campus that you can attend which will help get to know the campus life. On an academic note, if you ever need help, there are many people, teachers and tutors, who will take time out of their day to help you; you just need to make an effort to ask for it.",
            "This university has a great campus which is neither too big nor too small. Its educators are well knowledge and go out of their way to help students understand a point. There are also many events and activities on or around campus that will never bore you."

Well I didn't need to worry about that on campus as the campus is really lit up at night and walking to my vehicle I always saw at least 1 or 2 security people checking out campus, so that was always a great feeling knowing that someone was out there keeping it safe., 356061=MNSU is a great school. I've been to the campus & its great.The students are relaxed & so nice. The faculty are willing to help with anything you need. Can't wait to start school Spring 2014.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students This school is great for students who like to do many activities and have many resources available to them. If you are a people person, this is the school for you. The school is about middle size, which is good because there are enough people where you can meet new people even towards the end of each semester or year. Coming here you might not expect a lot, but leaving you will leave with a book full of memories. Tips for prospective students The one thing you need to focus on is time management because there are tons of things to do and a lot of free time to do your class work. School comes first. So take care of it first, finish your class work then go out after. Do not think that you will never have the opportunity to do something again, because chances are you will. So never feel rushed, take your time and take care of what you have to do. There are so many resources available, which means you have to go out there and look for them. Once you have found them, use them wisely, they help you much more than you think. Bang for the buck The great thing about coming to Mankato is that many students get a",
