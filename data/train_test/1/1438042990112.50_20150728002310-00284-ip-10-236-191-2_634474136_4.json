Where do all those well-heeled donors live? For most candidates, the richest source of large individual contributions will be the most populous metro areas within their state or district. Many incumbents also draw significant sums from the nation's capital. Senators and other high-profile incumbents may draw from the Big Three sources of campaign cash nationally: New York City, Washington, DC and Los Angeles. METHODOLOGY: The numbers on this page are calculated from contributions of more than $200 from individuals, as reported to the Federal Election Commission. PAC dollars are not included.
