    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Another embodiment could employ an analog type indicating instrument immediately at the output of the amplifier circuit 14, thereby replacing the comparator 15, potentiometer 16, amplifier 18 and the signalling lamp 13. However, in such a case the indications supplied by such an instrument would be monitored at regular intervals. For instance, as shown in FIGS. 4 to 8 the measurement means or detector 24 could be suitably built by means of a magnetic Reed switch in which case it could be mounted on a cross member or cantilever whose position in relation to magnet 42 could be axially adjusted in an accurate and precise way. The transducer 24 and magnet 42 could also be replaced by a differential transformer, or by a potentiometer type of transducer, or yet again by an opto electronic type of position transducer which could comprise, for example, an optical reflection device in order to obtain embodiments equivalent to those described above. Finally, it is clear that various variants and modifications may be made to the apparatus described above, without thereby departing from the scope of the present invention. The above mentioned known problems, due to an imperfect seal of the junctions between the reservoir and the line in the prior art pump, no longer subsist, nor do the difficulties (haemolysis etc. . . . ) due to the turbulent blood flow. Finally, it is obvious that since the line no",
