    "textBeforeTable": "From June 16-20, 2014, we tested a list of 1,358 URLs remotely through eight name servers that correspond to the following ISPs: Results We performed a lookup of a list we compiled of 1,358 URLs to identify suspicious DNS results. We also did GET requests for the URLs on this list on the publicly accessible proxies we found in Iraq. This list contains content ranging from international news sites, social media platforms, and content specific to Iraq\u2019s domestic political, social and cultural context. A full list of URLs tested can be found in the Data section. Early reports from Iraq suggested that blocking was performed on some ISPs through DNS tampering. DNS converts domain names (such as \u201ccitizenlab.org\u201d) to an IP address (74.208.36.253). If the information in DNS records is tampered with, domain names can resolve to an incorrect IP address, which can lead visitors to a blockpage. In some cases, it is possible to perform lookups of the DNS records used by Iraq-based ISPs remotely, without being connected to that ISP directly. After performing these DNS lookups, we are able to compare the results for a given domain name with what we would expect to see to identify aberrations. We used two methods to determine if and how filtering is being applied in Iraq. The first method performs remote lookups of DNS records to identify suspicious results which could be indicative of filtering. The second method undertakes remote testing of website accessibility through proxies. We wrote a script",
