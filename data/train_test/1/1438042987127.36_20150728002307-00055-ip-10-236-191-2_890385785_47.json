We also have a popular business school and a fantastic English program. (English students will have great internship opportunities at SPU!) If you don't mind rain, it's a great place for you; if you like getting involved in community service and charity, there are tons of opportunities for that at SPU as well. And if you like books or music, Seattle has a great artsy scene that you'll really enjoy. Tips for prospective students Apply for as many scholarships as you can--it will pay off. Also make sure you apply for University Scholars if you are any good at writing, or if you're just interested in getting better at writing. You'll do a lot of essays but it's worth it to have all the school's best professors inviting you to their office whenever you",
