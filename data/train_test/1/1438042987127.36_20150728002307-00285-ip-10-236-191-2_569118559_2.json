However, the complexity of this matter has limited the application of GC-O whose first application dates back to 1964. The many factors linked with chromatographic parameters as well as the variables related to human perception and panel assessment represent a challenge for researchers. The goal is to find the best use of these components in order to improve both the practical experimental use of GC-O and the quality of the data obtained.}",
