Huggins became the first player from the University of Cincinnati to make the majors., 2799=Huggins was already playing minor league ball during college, and was with St. Paul for several years. He came to the majors in 1904 when he was 26 years old, spending his first six seasons with the Cincinnati Reds and his last seven with the St. Louis Cardinals, some as player-manager., 4435=He was also a lawyer. Due to illness, he stepped down as skipper of the New York Yankees on September 20, 1929. Five days later, he died of a rare skin infection at age 51. After his death, it was revealed that he had been a part-owner of the minor league St. Paul Saints while managing the Yankees, with his close friend, former Cardinals and Yankees scout Bob Connery being the principal owner. It is notable because the Yankees used the Saints as a quasi-farm team during those years, and that Huggings would personally benefit whenever the Yanks bought a player from St. Paul., 5356=His first Baseball Card appearance was in the 1906 WG-3 Fan Craze set., 3836=Huggins never won a pennant as manager of the Cardinals, but he won six with the Yankees, including the one with the famous 1927 team, considered by many to have been the best team of all time. His teams won the World Series in 1923, 1927 and 1928.}",
