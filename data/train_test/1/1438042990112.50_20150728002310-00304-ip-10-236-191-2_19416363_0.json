S\u00e9bastien Loeb -- following a decade of domination during which he won nine world titles (10, if you count his 2001 Junior WRC title) -- decided finally to walk away from full-time rallying., 5961=December 26, 2012, 5383=Sebastien Loeb won his ninth world title in 2012. He also decided to take a break from full-time rallying. Photo by LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC, 3842=However, at the start of the season, everything seemed like business as usual, with yet another Loeb victory in Monte Carlo. After that, the year didn\u2019t quite go according to plan for him, or at least not completely. In Sweden, he could only manage sixth as Ford\u2019s Jari-Matti Latvala won. Loeb won the next round, which was held in Mexico, but then came the low point in Portugal: He crashed on the first day after mishearing a pace note. On the other hand, his new Citro\u00ebn teammate, Mikko Hirvonen, went on to win the event, and the Finn would have taken the championship lead, too. But surprisingly, post-race inspectors deemed Hirvonen\u2019s car illegal on two counts\u2014a non-homologated clutch and an oversize turbo part, which Citro\u00ebn insisted provided absolutely zero performance gains\u2014and disqualified him. The result was the first win for a privateer entry, Mads \u00d8stberg, since 1993, while Hirvonen would have to wait until Rally Sardinia at the end of the year for his first Citro\u00ebn win.}",
