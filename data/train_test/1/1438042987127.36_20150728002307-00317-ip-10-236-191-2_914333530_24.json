            "Thiel is a great college at the great price. It is affordable and if you can't get it all covered they help you to get it covered to continue your education. Thiel cares about your education not about getting your money.",
            "The food isn't too bad, I don't really eat on campus due to being a commuter.",
            "I do not currently live in a dorm on campus because I live close enough to commute.",
            "Any problems you come in contact with when being a Thiel, the professors help you out in any way possible. Utilize there office hours and ask questions. That is what they are there for and they will love you for asking to repeat or to go in depth a little more. Just don't get frustrated with the small things. If you start to have problems tell them and they can steer you in the right way. Thiel even offers tutors for classes to get help so you pass.",
            "I would just want students to make sure they want to go into to the field they want. Do a job shadow to make sure that career is what you want to do. Thiel is a great college and works good with taking classes for a later career like Pharmacy, Medical or any other professional field.",
            "Thiel is a very good college, the professors are great and help you out with problems you may face in class. The college is smaller so you get to know a lot of people plus the classes are smaller which help with the professors getting to know you. The advisors are pretty good too, they are make sure you go into the classes you need and make sure you are on the right track."

Each dorm has a printer, TV, vending machine, and wifi in the lobby's. The dorms are double occupancy, and are decent sized - bigger than some other campuses. Most dorm rooms come with a closet or wardrobe, dresser, bed, desk, and desk chair as well as blackout blinds on the windows. None of the buildings have air conditioning, but if you need one you can get a doctors note for one, usually for those with asthma. Beds aren't that comfortable, bring a mattress pad. The freshman dorms are all located surrounding the freshman quad and up campus located close to classrooms and dining services. Upperclassmen live across the street down campus. Up campus is completely alcohol free, zero tolerance. Down campus you can apply for 21+ status in your room to have it. The bathrooms aren't bad either. The freshman dorms Hodge, Florence West, and Sawhill have undergone some renovations of varying degrees. Hodge is completely rennovated and $800 more expensive. Flo West got new furniture for fall of 2013. Sawhill's bathrooms were updated and new lighting put in the hallways making them bright and nice to navigate. Upperclassmen dorms are Bane and Stewart. Upperclassmen also have the options to move into 5 person townhouses, or apartments, though these are quickly filled by super seniors then seniors, and very rarely reach sophomores., 62829=Thiel is an amazing school for many reasons. The student to teacher ratio is 13:1, so the teachers really get to know you here. Also, there are many study groups, and people who want you to succeed; therefore, asking for help is never a bad thing.}",

Thiel is a great school for students who are willing to work hard for the grades they earn. Tips for prospective students Set your goals high and make sure to go to your professors' office hours whenever you can. Getting extra help will make the learning experience better for you and the teacher because they will see that you're making the extra effort to come meet with them after class. Plus, it definitely bumps up your grades! Bang for the buck The school is very expensive, but the education that I've received from Thiel makes it worth it. The professors are great, and so are most of the students. The overall environment is good. The library is an excellent source for academic help, and every professor has flexible office hours.
