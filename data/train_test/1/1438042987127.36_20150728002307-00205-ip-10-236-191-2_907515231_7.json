            "There is a lot of campus security, and as for the other students everyone looks out for each other. i love UGF because it is like we are a big family.",
            "I am the head of a firm in the Man Club. there are over 20 clubs at this school. there is a lot of variety and the school offers many different things to do.",
            "Athletes, scholars, biology majors.",
            "the school can be kind of expansive your freshman year, but after that it gets cheaper each year for you. in the end i will end up graduating with less than $20,000 in student loans, however i still have to pay $1,200 out of pocket each year which makes it tough.",
            "Well, right now i play chess with my friend matt, i snowboard, play xbox, and i am on the wrestling team so i have a lot to do most of the time.",
            "The cafe was recently remodeld, it is a great place to eat, the food is good, and there is a giant tv to watch on Sunday's. My personal favorite is the breakfast sandwich.",
            "The dorm life was and is awesome. it is so great having so many of your friends so close, because you will never get bored and you will never run out of people to help you on homework.",
            "Sometimes school can be stressful, specially around finals time, but if you show up to class and at least attempt to do your homework your teachers will try to help you and give you some slack when it comes to tests, quizzes, homework, and extra credit.",
            "For prospective students i would suggest having a job to pay for play money and also to pay for books. i would also suggest get some help from the academic center, if you have one, on taking notes and how to further better yourself in your chosen feild. thirdly, have all your school passwords and logins written down, including your financial aid.",
            "The University of Great Falls, Montana, has great science, education, psychology, and criminal justice programs. This school is also very small, capping class sizes at 20 people, yet it still has very many successful clubs and sports programs. Even though this school is so small, it is still A.P.A. certified, so i would give it a 5 out of 5 stars."

We have about 1200 students enrolled and we have students from all over; including Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Ireland, and many more. This school is amazing and I encourage many students to apply to become part of our community and family., 12015=In the winter, always bring layers of clothing. A lot of the buildings don't have adequate insulation and can be freezing at times in the winter. The first day of the spring semester in January, it was -53 with windchill, and my face nearly froze off outside and inside was almost as bad.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck The change from high school to college is very noticeable. The faculty at the school are really willing to help when ever needed. The small classes and close knit community make it a great environment to learn and have fun in! Am enjoying being here I love going to UGF. It being a small school you really get a chance to meet everyone on campus. The school hosts tons of fun events and there is always something going on. Am learning a lot The academic courses available at the University of Great Falls are outstanding. I have learned more in the first semester of school then in all four years of high school.
