For example, in accordance with the present invention, the morpheme analysis results of documents may be stored in the index with a smaller capacity without modification so as to enable faster access from any arbitrary words to the index and the intended retrieval search. As have been described above, in accordance with the present invention, full text retrieval search with the relationship between words taken into consideration may be performed, without storing the full text of documents, by using only the index of relatively smaller capacity, on the documents not only in Indo-European languages but also in such a language as Japanese, which does not clearly articulate breakpoints between words, as well as the full text of documents resulting from the retrieval search may be output. In accordance with the present embodiment, the target documents are narrowed prior to the retrieval search using indexes, allowing reducing the load of relatively time-consuming index search to yield totally faster retrieval search. The document retrieval part 2 then uses the indexes 1 a through 1 d corresponding to the candidate documents in the inter-document indexing part 10 to output one or more documents satisfying the sequence of words specified in the retrieval search criteria from",
