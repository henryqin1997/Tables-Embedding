            "Coming from a little town in New England, San Francisco has a lot more to offer in activities than any other place I know. There's literally always something to do for every type of person. You can go clubbing, to comedy clubs, eat at amazing restaurants and cafes, go to the beach, hiking, and lots of shopping.",
            "For the price you pay at this school, it leaves a lot to be desired about the quality of the food, and service. The cafe staff are pretty slow at serving you over priced under cooked meals.",
            "I have a gorgeous view of the bay, and Golden Gate Bridge. My dorm-mates are respectable, fun, and courteous. The resident directors are always there if you need help, and look out for your best intentions.",
            "This school will definitely challenge your current values and ideas. With a lot of homework. But the teachers here are motivated to help you succeed.",
            "A wonderful school that encourages the students to change the world from here. This school has a beautiful campus that overlooks the city of San Francisco. The teachers and staff here truly care about your well-being, and career interests."

Even when returning from a class last semester at 10:30-10:45 pm, where I had to walk across the main plaza of campus, I felt safe. When incidents are reported, the school automatically emails everyone, informing them to watch out so something similar does not happen to them., 249000=Being in San Francisco, there is always something going on. On Sunny days I will picnic in Golden Gate park, window shop in the Marina, or maybe participate in a Free Tibet March. On days when the weather is not so nice, I visit museums or find a new coffee shop., 382230=On-campus dining is expensive. The meal plan is a little over $2000 a semester and some people still run out of money before the semester is over. They choices they have in the dining halls are good, but can get a little repetitive. However, the off-campus dining is amazing. Everything you can think of is within a few blocks, whether you want sushi, burgers, pizza, pho, or anything you crave, it's probably within walking distance of the campus., 45089=Spring 2012 is my third semester at the University of San Francisco and I highly recommend this University to nursing majors. The professors are very helpful and intuitive to each student and present the subjects well., 51950=USF offers students a decent cafeteria with many options. On the average day, you can have waffles for breakfast, pizza for lunch, and Kung Pow chicken for dinner. USF has the main cafeteria in the University Center (which is at the center of the university; you guessed it!), one under the main Caf typically called the Under Caf and one smaller one on the secondary campus. The main Caf has the best options for students as it is the largest. Sometimes, however, students find that they school provided meals could be improved and that it way too expensive. USF gives each student $2000 worth of pure food money and sometimes, students find themselves running out of it a month before the semester ends. Each meal averages to about $10. Simple math will tell us that that is not enough for a semester. However, with budgeting and careful spending, the USF meal plan money should last you through the semester. Sometimes, it is to be noted that the cafeteria sometimes seems to close too early. But, with planning, that should not be an issue for those of you who are savvy at staying fed. Rating: Three out of five. While the food is expensive and the Cafeteria may have odd hours, the food is decently good, convenient, and well portioned. All in all: Spend smart, stay fed.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students If you are the type of student who enjoys the cold climate and reaching out to the community through events and activities, then USF is the campus to consider applying to. Tips for prospective students As an interested student as well, I recommend going to as many meetings as possible. I recommend talking to as many students that attend USF to get there prospective and tour around the campus to become familiar with the route. Bang for the buck USF offers a variety of scholarships offered at different values. One of the scholarships I am interested in is there music scholarship. I was told to wait for my letter or acceptance (or rejection) *hopefully, I get in* and what you do is mail in a package that has a CD of a recording of your voice singing at least 4 different language songs. You also need to include a head shot, so the staff can connect the voice to the face. Another thing you include is a letter of reference, en essay of how passionate you are for the arts and music, and lastely an arts resume-so the staff knows what type of a performer they will be working with. Will enjoy being here",
