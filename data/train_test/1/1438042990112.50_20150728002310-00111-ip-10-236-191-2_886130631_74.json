            "Kean has a good mix of cultures but I do not think the campus is full of friendly and outgoing people because they are hard to find. But, the professors I have gotten have been very good with the exception of one. The campus itself is very beautiful and nice."

Everyday Fall 2011 Semester workers were out there building & creating new scenery. Cutting the grass, trimming the edges, etc. But when it came to maintaining the residence halls they slacked. The heat had been broken, which took them weeks to fix and the washing machines in Whiteman Hall had been out of order for a week on end. It was just very inconvenient., 184523=I am a transfer student and will be attending Kean University Fall 2012., 311654=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 188449=A lot of fun! Not many people dorm, only like 1000, but there has been a great request lately. A great college experience!}",

What to do for fun There's night clubs surrounding us, yes you will have to call a taxi or have a car but it is worth it. We also have an Applebees up the street and if you travel a little bit further we have a plethora of restaurants. We also have Jersey Gardens which we have a shuttle that takes us there and back. We have a pool, tennis court, basketball court, football field, gymnastics rooms and dance rooms. Food and Dining Unfortunately, the food has its highs and lows. The cafeteria that every freshman has to get swipes for is",
