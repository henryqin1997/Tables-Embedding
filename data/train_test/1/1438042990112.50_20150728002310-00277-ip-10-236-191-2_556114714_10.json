            "Quote from LilyNanami Try Goong if you don't like manhwas If people don't like manhwa, I sincerely doubt that Goong will make them change their mind. I normally don't have anything against manhwa, but I hate Goong with passion (sorry if this offends anyone); male leads like that just need to be killed. So, unless you love seeing the main girl being treated like crap, my guess is you won't enjoy it. For a good manhwa (not including webcomics) I would recommend Song of the Doll. ________________",

            "Quote I recommend Elfen Lied and maybe Detective Conan? I guess it's more gore, but it might introduce you to that kind of manga before you try Berserk. Thanks, I'm sorry but I already know these, and I don't like any of them. Quote It pains me when people say that they dislike shounen-ai Here, try Seven Days. I enjoyed it a lot. I'll look into it.

            "I agree with many others on the NTR. Why would anyone enjoy a series that encourage them to rage, lol. Other genres I don't really care for (I don't hate them, just don't enjoy them) are: Shoujo - I know they are geared toward female readers, but I enjoy romance series. I really do. However, I never understand the art styles of soujo series. No offense, but to me, they are just too much for me to bear. Though I was interested by \"Bride of the Watergod\" for awhile... Shoujo-ai/Yuri and Shounen-ai/Yaoi - Not homophobic... just me, being a heterosexual male, prefer no sausages and sausages interaction in a romantic manner. Same deal for female on female, but I can't think of something to metaphorically reference that to, lol.",

Romance between cool handsome guy and weak boy (sorry, no offense for the fans), not only that but also the other series I've already read (mostly one-shot) Instead, I'm okay with yuri, since there are such a good series like, mariasama ga miteru, kanazuki no miiko and strawberry panic.

Romance between cool handsome guy and weak boy (sorry, no offense for the fans), ... Yeah, well I'm not into BL either, but if you watch something like that, those are major leagues as I know. As someone said here, almost every yaoi is like Shinjo Mayu's works. And that's the greatest problem, the way BL is depicted is completely wrong: not every couple in this world is a super-strong seme and the other one a delicate-wimp uke; there's no development at all; and, in most of the cases, there's coercion. I haven't read them, but from comments here and around the web, that's what I think. Shounen-ai is supposed to be mild, but if you don't like it, there's no turning back. Out of curiosity, once I read The Visitor, and it wasn't that bad. It was mostly because there was a Shinigami (with no gender) and the story had sense, even I felt bad for the guys in it, their stories T.T. I won't spoil, so if you wanna get further into BL, maybe you wanna pick that one.",

            "I'm a straight guy, and there are some shonen-ai manga that I think are genuinely great such as Hagio Moto's works. Of course, there's little in the way of physical contact, except for A Cruel God Reigns which is great but is hard to stomach due to all the abuse and emotional trauma. I also love some shojo that have a lot of BL subtext but aren't really BL such as Banana Fish and Moon Child. Last edited by Roughan at 6:42 pm, Jun 6 ________________",

            "-I will never get into Shotacon and Lolicon genres. I find both genres rather repulsive. -I avoid Sports, Slice of Life, and Historical genres because I usually find them to be boring. -I'm straight and prefer to read about straight chracters, so I tend to avoid Yaoi, Yuri, Shoujo Ai, and Shounen Ai. -I also avoid Shoujo and Josei because the genres are more geared towards women and they tend to bore me."
