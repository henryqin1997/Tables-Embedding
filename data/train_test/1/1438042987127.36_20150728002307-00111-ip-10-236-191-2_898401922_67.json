            "There are blue lamp posts where you can contact security or the police if there's an emergency, and you can always call campus security if you need to walk somewhere at night and are feeling unsafe.",
            "Greek Life is pretty strong at Kent, but by no means do you have to be a part of the Greek community to have a social life. It is a great way to make friends and make the campus smaller, however.",
            "There are over 200, from knitting to larping. My favorite on-campus club: The Evil Genuises. You'll have to enroll at Kent to find out who they are.",
            "LGBTQ! Kent has a very active PRIDE organization that celebrates the LGBTQ community.",
            "You can't graduate from Kent State without painting the rock on the front of campus!",
            "One of the more affordable universities in Ohio, but after this year, students will be charged over $400 if they want to take over 17 credit hours, and next year the charge will be applied for students who want to take over 16 credit hours.",
            "If you go to Kent State, you won't find yourself asking this question. There's always something going on. USG sponsors comedians and concerts every semester and there's always a new, free movie playing at the KIVA every week.",
            "There are a ton of options on campus for food and dining. A favorite is Rosie's, the 24 hour diner located in Tri Towers. Make sure you also explore downtown for other dining, Ray's and Pufferbelly's are some favorites.",
            "Again, this will all depend on the residence hall that you choose to live in. Overall, if you live in a freshman dorm, most people are friendly and social. RA's and Hall Councils will also sponsor programs in your residence halls so that you can meet people, and most of the time, eat free food!",
            "This will all depend on your course load, major, and professor. Ratemyprofessor.com is a great tool to use before you schedule classes to get an idea about how difficult your classes will be. If you're having trouble, don't hesitate to go to an SI session, or utilize the Academic Success Center or Writing Commons on the fourth floor of the library.",
            "Join a student organization! It's the easiest way to get to know people, and find people who share the same interests as you. If you had a tight-knit group of friends in high school, and are looking for a similar group of friends in college, I strongly encourage you to go Greek! On the same token, make sure you take academics seriously. Many freshman have a hard time adjusting to the academic demands of college, but there are resources in place to help you succeed, so don't be afraid to ask for help.",
            "You can make a big school small, but you can't make a small school big. At Kent State, the second largest university in Ohio, you have the choice of over 200 majors, but also the opportunity to join over 200 student organizations. No matter who you are, there's a place for you at Kent State, and if you get involved and engaged, it will start to feel like home."

After May 4, safety is a top priority., 852539=Kent State University has something called black squirrels and the black squirrel festival. In February 1961, Lary Woodell brought a pair of 2 black squirrels to Kent from Canada. You won't find black squirrels anywhere else. The black squirrel is now known as the unofficial mascot of Kent State., 204422=Black squirrels basically run the campus, ever since a few were brought here in 1961 and heavily populated the area. The Black Squirrel is now our unofficial mascot., 790965=Be prepared for a hectic Halloween and a solemn May 4th., 860489=The May Fourth Memorial is great for a walk!, 583297=Every year in October there is the Black Squirrel Festival to celebrate Kent, Ohio's unique population of black squirrels. There is live music and many booths promoting different clubs and selling interesting items., 986622=If you are unaware, Kent state was the victim of a tragedy where the military opened fire on students protesting on May 4th, 1970, which some say ultimately led to the downfall of the Nixon administration and Watergate. There is a memorial and visitor center located at the scene of the incident on campus for anyone to visit, and each year on May 4th, they have a ceremony to honor those who died., 820637=There is a tradition of remembering the May 4th tragedy that happened on campus in 1970. There are also some beautiful landscapes through out campus. The sports teams also have a tradition with Akron University that is called the Wagon wheel Challenge. The two universities compete in all different sports with one another to get the most points and whoever wins gets the wagon wheel., 936529=The walls here at Kent State are way too thin and I can here every single thing my neighbors whisper. It tends to get very out of hand sometimes when I am trying to study, and the campus is too big to just get up and walking to the library at 10 o'clock at night., 299590=There is one location on campus that put Kent State on the map and a historical land mark. The May 4th memorial. In 1970, there was a protest at the now called May 4th park, where the U.S. shot at students. Four people ended up being killed. There are spots at the May 4th parking lot where they had died. Also every May 4th the parking lot is closed in remembrance of the tragedy., 930926=Black squirrels galore! Also in remembrance for those who lost their lives in the Kent State Shooting, we have a time of silence, no class on that day. It usually falls the week before or during finals (May 4th). There is a lot to learn about that day and it is nice to be able to learn about it., 903630=The campus is huge, bring good shoes. If you wait for the bus in December, you might get frostbite. The library has everything, I live here most of the time., 571210=The May 4th Memorial is a big deal on campus, it is a very respected piece of the campus. We cherish our history and hold it close to our hearts., 631574=There are a few traditions/events which happen in the month of May to reflect on the tragedy which happened with the National Guard shooting at Kent State on May 4th 1970., 880208=There is the black squirrel festival and there is a memorial for the four people that was shot and killed in 1970 by the Natitional guard, 333977=My favorite spot on campus is the May 4th memorial next to Taylor Hall, my friends and I spend a lot of time there at night sitting and talking., 515395=The May 4th memorial that commemorates the Kent State shooting, 892671=May 4th memorial activities to honor those lost during the tragic incident., 327394=Perhaps most infamously known for the May Fourth shootings, KSU holds a memorial service every year on that day to remember that catastrophic event, with guest speakers, a candlelit ceremony, and a day of remembrance to honor those who were lost., 994425=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 251742=In previous years Kent State University tried to sweep the events of May 4th 1970 under wraps. The Kent State Shootings are a grim legacy, though in the past ten years or so Kent has been properly respecting the lives lost on that day., 362177=There is college fest that we have and May 4 is a big day at Kent State as well., 287379=May 4th memorial, great trees., 3890=Tuition fees are reasonable. But room and board is EXPENSIVE, and fees are suppose to rise for Fall 2011 Semester. If you can, find an apartment or you could even rent out a room. But I do suggest that Freshman live in dorms, it gives you a chance to make friends and who knows they might even become your roommate.}",
