            "It is not a partying school but here you can find different alternatives to fun although you can decide to do other things when you are not on campus. Anyways you're in California there's bound to be something exciting to do!",
            "I haven't had it yet but I'm sure its bound to taste great lol",
            "I've seen some pictures and I've been told that people are really helpful around there so we'll see...",
            "It is an academically rigorous school however it's not insanely intense and going overboard with the work load like some colleges do. The only reason it doesn't have a five star is because I haven't experienced it first hand.",
            "Don't be intimidated to apply to a school of this calibre. Although it can be on the expensive side they are usually generous with financial aid and their atmosphere is like no other.",
            "Pepperdine is an all-round special place. They have a balance of great academics, sports, faith and service, not to mention their campus is also gorgeous! I really hope I get to commit to them!"

If you're willing to hike, there are also cafeterias at the Drescher graduate campus and the School of Law. Food at the regular Seaver cafeteria is decent but has gotten rather dull due to lack of variety. Students living in residence halls have to purchase a meal plan. Girls usually get by with the minimum B-plan ($1500 equivalent) while guys eat more and end up upgrading to C-plan ($2000) or higher, though one can feasibly get a solid three meals a day by supplementing the B-plan with cereal or other groceries from Ralphs (about a mile away, and campus transportation gives free shuttle rides there)., 168966=The classes are pretty demanding, but you learn so much in the little time you are here per semester. Each semester is about 3 and a half months- that's right, you get out in April your second semester!, 238584=Pepperdine University is a private institution that was founded in 1937. It has a total undergraduate enrollment of 3,474, its setting is suburban, and the campus size is 830 acres. It utilizes a semester-based academic calendar. Pepperdine University's ranking in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is National Universities, 54., 237536=The student-faculty ratio at Pepperdine University is 13:1, and the school has 67.7 percent of its classes with fewer than 20 students. The most popular majors at Pepperdine University include: Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services; Communication, Journalism, and Related Programs; Social Sciences; Multi/Interdisciplinary Studies; and Psychology. The average freshman retention rate, an indicator of student satisfaction, is 90.2 percent., 349490=I toured Pepperdine last October and I was awestruck. The whole campus was amazing including the academics, campus life, and yes, the view was awesome too. I was completely amazed with Pepperdine., 44674=This has drastically increased since my freshman year 3 years ago. Today, Pepperdine has several dining options, including Jamba Juice, LaBrea Bakery, the Waves Caf\u00e9, and the HAWC student center, as well as coffee carts and small, airport-style take-out options. The quality of food has increased exponentially, as well as the variety of healthy, vegetarian and vegan options. Meal plans are organized on a point system; Freshman must have no less than the 1,100 point meal plan. 1 point = 1 dollar, and all points are loaded onto each student's ID card. Points roll over from Fall to Spring, but expire at the end of each Spring semester. The price of food is not unreasonable, but some food takes upwards of 20 minutes to prepare, worse during the busy hours. Further, the Caf closes at 8:30, so for late-night food, students go to the HAWC, which stays open until 2:00am. LaBrea is only open for breakfast and lunch, and Jamba Juice closes around 8.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The people here are amazing! Everyone is incredibly gracious and open to forming meaningful and lasting relationships. Never did I imagine finding so many best friends who comfort, encourage, and accept me the way Pepperdine students have. The campus is the perfect environment to learn and experience the person you were meant to become while being surrounded by motivating people. Am learning a lot Pepperdine definitely has some amazing teachers who are willing to go the extra mile for their students. If you put forth the effort, they will certainly reciprocate and work just as hard to make your time in class well spent. My best professor so far was the one who intimidated me from the first day. But I quickly learned that once I proved I was willing to do whatever it takes to succeed and better myself, he guided me with some of the most valuable advice I have ever received.
