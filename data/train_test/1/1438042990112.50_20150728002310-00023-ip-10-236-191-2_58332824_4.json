Shipping was a bit pricey - I wanted the trees here (cross-country) quickly, to limit any potential shipping damage; their service was prompt indeed. They were very swift in responding to my lone question. And both trees have done quite well. A bit too early for them to bear any fruit, but the calamondin was quite lush when it arrived and has continued to do well. The yuzu looked - at first - a bit over-pruned, but as soon as autumn temperatures hit here, it responded with a big burst of very vigorous growth, and is looking like a very happy plant indeed. So overall I am quite happy with both. I am fast approaching the limit of what I can accomodate in my apartment, but I am planning to order another couple plants from them in the near future.",

They even told me to buy locally first, but I wanted to know that I was getting exactly what I wanted. I was disappointed in the size of the trees for almost $40 a piece. Later I looked at lowes and their trees were 2 times the size for half as much, same variety. I was very happy with the condition of the trees, they even held up a couple of days bare root until I could plant them. I talked to the owner when I called with a question on the weekend and they were very nice people. So while I would never give them a negative, I wouldn't go positive based on the size of the trees that I received. Neutral seemed to fit as I just wanted this to inform others that the 2 year trees are not very big. With all that said I'd order from them again if I really needed to buy a rare variety as they have many, they did provide viable trees, and the customer service was excellent. So don't let me scare you off, but remember 2 year trees aren't very big (12-20inches).",

This was actually problematic for me, as the first time this happened no one was around to receive the trees and they were stolen out of my urban apartment mailroom. Four Winds replaced them. If you've got shrinkage issues with your mail, be sure to watch for the trees a day early and don't rely on the delivery date.",

Two years ago, bought (all dwarf) from Four Winds Growers: 2 Seville Orange, Bergamot Orange, Nagami Kumquat, Meiwa Kumquat, Limequat, Calamondin, Improved Meyers Lemon, Kaffir Lime, Mexican (Key) Lime, and Bearrs Lime. All arrived promptly and in excellent condition, some in fruit. All have grown and fruited in containers, in South facing solar room in winter (to upper 30s) and outdoors in summer (low 90s). Hand pollinated flowers with Q-tip during early spring bloom. Buzz buzz. Fruit quality is wonderful. I use the fruit to make marmalade, and the leaves of the Kaffir lime for Thai cooking. Their Meyers lemon is far more delicious and exotic tasting than store-bought Meyers lemon. The Bergamot marmalade is beyond description, it is so perfumed and spicy. The kumquats are huge and very juicy. I have two other Nagami kumquats from a local nursery that I have used for marmalade for 10 years and they are still about 3-4 feet tall with minimal pruning. So far I have kept the Four Winds trees wacked back to less than four feet tall, and they are growing nicely bushy. The oranges may eventually want to be a bit larger.

Considering how much better (and bigger) these trees look than the ones I've owned for several years, I only hope I can keep them looking great!

And so it came to me in a dream (not really) that I had to have a lemon tree even though I live in the wintry Northeast. Actually, I had seen one for sale in a catalog, and thus began my quest. There are a lot of growers online who sell trees but many, in small print, said the ones pictured are not what one will receive. I decided on Four Winds growers based on all the info on the site, strictly regarding dwarf citrus, but also because of all the actual photos of their trees. I wasn't stymied by the price because the catalog trees were way more money (and of course look gorgeous with lemons all over them in the photo. I'm pretty sure for $99 one gets a stick in a clay pot). I ordered and received my 2-3 year old tree exactly as expected - it seems healthy and was in full flower bud mode (alas, no lemons like one lucky responder). I am following the instructions for potting/light/water/humidity and my tree is thriving. I look at it everyday and tend to it fervently....almost obsessively. I CANNOT wait for the purple buds to bloom. The only problem I had was finding a sawdust based potting soil that is recommended. There is no such thing around here, apparently, but went with an organic sealife potting mix from the Pacific Northwest that my local greenhouse carries. Believe me when I tell you I angsted over this for a while. Hopefully, it'll be just fine. Thanks Four Winds!",

All arrived in excellent condition - the kumquat tree even had some fruit. I failed miserably at maintaining them, but I got some helpful suggestions when I emailed the company. I feel they went above and beyond in terms of customer service., 31647=I ordered a 2-3 year old dwarf Meyers Lemon tree from Four Winds in February at the recommendation of several people from a garden website. I'm not a complete citrus novice but I will admit that this was my first mail order experience and I didn't have very high expectations. The tree was promptly shipped to me and arrived within 10 days of my order (sooner than I had expected) which was a plesant suprise. When I opened the shipping box I found that the tree had been wonderfully packaged and looked healthier then I ever could have imagined, there were even 6 fully ripe lemons still attached to the tree. I am more than happy to report that the tree is still looking beautiful and thriving in it's container our on my patio. It is obvious to me that this company truly cares about the customer and the quality trees it sells. I have heard nightmare stories about ordering trees offline and must unfortunatly report that since ordering from Four Winds I too have learned my lesson and will NEVER order trees from less expensive, less reputable nurseries ever again!! Four Winds is top notch and I look foreward to doing business with them again., 5138=I ordered seven dwarf citrus trees in April. They all arrived well packed and in good shaped. Shipping was expensive but all plants were as advertised and in great shape. I'd definitely order from them again., 16910=WOW, what incredible dwarf citrus trees. I ordered four 2-3 year trees: Moro blood orange, Varigated Lemon, Owari Satsuma Mandarin, and Improved Meyer. ALL of the trees are tall, beautiful, full trees with extremely healthy leaves. The trees were so tall and full that the top stems of two of them snapped (not a problem, only lost a few leaves). These trees are NOT the tiny little trees you receive from so many \"Big\" nurseries that send you catalogs in the mail. What you see online is actually what you get (or better!). Considering how much better (and bigger) these trees look than the ones I've owned for several years, I only hope I can keep them looking great! The cost was $36 each because I ordered 4, and shipping was $14 each. This is a GREAT PRICE because two years ago I received a lemon tree from one of those \"fancy\" catalogs (I think it was Wm-Sonoma) that was smaller and not nearly as pretty... and currently retails in their catalog for apx. $65 PLUS shipping! Regarding shipping: I live in Atlanta, GA. I ordered the trees on May 20 (Sat.), Four Winds, in Sacramento, CA, shipped them Monday the 22nd, and I received the trees Wednesday the 24th! I cannot say enough nice things about these trees. I am blown away by the health and size of the trees. BUY! You won't regret it!, 22014=Having the winter blues, I caught the citrus bug. So I searched all over the web and landed at Four Winds. The web site was really helpful in making my choice the Cara Cara Navel. I live in NY and we had a very mild patch in Jan. so I went for it. It arrived a week! Trying to slip it in between cold fronts was amazing on their part. E-mails, every step of the way. Its a healthy lush dark green tree pruned perfectly. 2-3 years old 2.5' h & w. Straight trunk with clean neat graft, well established bareroot securly packed in clean moist cedar chips. I give this purchase 5 stars... 1. Very easy website to order from. 2. Very healthy tree, 3. arrived in winter unscathed in a week! 4. Communication through emails. 5. Great price tree/shipping... Hope this helps, Mantis212, 34898=[ Home | About | Advertise | Media Kit | Mission | Featured Companies | Submit an Article | Terms of Use | Tour | Rules | Privacy Policy | Cookie Policy | Contact Us ] Back to the top Copyright \u00a9 2000-2015 Dave's Garden, an Internet Brands company.
