(Monday August 3 2015), 17541=Date:Tuesday April 1 2008, 11046=Le Fondre Close To Bluebirds Exit (Monday August 3 2015), 21669=Cardiff City striker Steve Thompson will be given another start tonight for the Bluebirds with the big forward desperately in need of a big game. Thompson was criticised for a lack of goals last season culminating in Cardiff's dismal slide in the latter part of the season. Although his partnership with Chopra was formidable, Thommo himself did not contribute enough and was transfer listed. A move to Preston North End was scuppered by a bizarre holiday mishap (For details see here )and Thompson remained a Bluebird. Injury and fitness problems have hampered City's strikers this season and with Robbie Fowler sidelined, Thompson has been on the fringes all season. As Cardiff City mounted a revival in December, Thompson was instrumental with 3 goals in 4 games including a spectacular winner against Blackpool. However, Thompson was then send off for a reckless challenge on Adriano Basso as City lost narrowly to Bristol City. Thomspon had revealed his 'frosty' relationship with manager Dave Jones, although Jones and Ridsdale later denied any problems. Thompson revealed every goal he scored was to prove a point to his boss. The 3 match ban saw Thompson lose his place to Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, now meaner and more effective than previously. Thompson was used as a subsititute and got few chances. The tables have now turned, with Hasselbaink picking up a 3 match ban. Thompson has been given an extended run in the side, but has yet to impress. The goals appear to have dried up, and despite a useful assist against Southampton and a number of half-chances - Thompson is simply not dangerous enough. He works tremendously hard, wins headers and gets involved but Thommo is not offering enough and rarely threatens the goal. With Whittingham, Ledley and Parry - we should be scoring more headed goals from open play but it's simply not happening. Tonight is the final match of Jimmy's suspension. Barring a Thompson hat-trick - I expect Hasselbaink to start at Wembley but Thompson seems almost certain to leave Ninian Park in the summer unless he can discover some form - and quickly., 10262=Mixed Eleven Draw At Cheltenham (Thursday July 30 2015), 9871=Cotterill Not On Slade's List (Tuesday July 28 2015), 10659=Maybe Jones Isn't A 'Big Part' Of Cardiff's Plans!
