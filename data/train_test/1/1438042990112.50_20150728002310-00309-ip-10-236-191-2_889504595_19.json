            "There is a lot to do at the beginning of school and lots of activities through out the year.",
            "I have seen a lot athletes come to the school and also I see a lot of international students come to the school to get their education.",
            "I think everyone who is given the chance to come to Texas Wesleyan, should really take the chance to see all the activities the campus has and talk to current students and experience the college life at Texas Wesleyan. They are also good at giving out scholarships.",
            "For fun students can join in sports, attend the school activities and socialize with new people in the lobby.",
            "The food in the cafe is not all too good but you have the option to go eat in the sub which is really good.",
            "Living in the dorms is one of the best choice I made, because you get to make new friends and you hear more about the student activities.",
            "In class, it easy for the professor to help students individually and easier for a student to understand the lecture.",
            "If coming to Texas Wesleyan, I think everyone should participate in all of the campus activities.",
            "Texas Wesleyan is small and the athletics program is amazing. Choosing to come to Texas Wesleyan has been the best choice for me, because it is easy for me to find my classes and I am to have one on one time with my professors. I everyone who has a chance should come visit Texas Wesleyan and experience how the small college environment."
