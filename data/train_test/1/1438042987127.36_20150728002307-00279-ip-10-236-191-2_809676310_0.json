Beta-amyloid peptides are lipophilic metal chelators with metal-reducing activity. Binds transient metals such as copper, zinc and iron. Rat and mouse beta-amyloid peptides bind only weakly transient metals and have little reducing activity due to substitutions of transient metal chelating residues. Beta-APP42 may activate mononuclear phagocytes in the brain and elicits inflammatory responses. Promotes both tau aggregation and TPK II-mediated phosphorylation. Also bind GPC1 in lipid rafts (By similarity).By similarity Functions as a cell surface receptor and performs physiological functions on the surface of neurons relevant to neurite growth, neuronal adhesion and axonogenesis. Involved in cell mobility and transcription regulation through protein-protein interactions (By similarity). Can promote transcription activation through binding to APBB1-KAT5 and inhibit Notch signaling through interaction with Numb (By similarity). Couples to apoptosis-inducing pathways such as those mediated by G(O) and JIP. Inhibits G(o)",
