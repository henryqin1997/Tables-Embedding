            "It's a fairly safe campus. And you can call campus safety 24/7. If you have to park far away at night, they'll even come get you and take you to your dorm/apartment.",
            "Greek Clubs here are service based, and have some of the strongest communities here on campus.",
            "There are many greek clubs, and they each host an event for the whole campus, so there's always something for friday nights. The Student Leadership Committee plans TONS of fun events. Our sports teams have national recognition. Our choirs and theater are open to non-majors, and our choirs are nationally renowned: performing at the January 2013 Presidential Inauguration.",
            "-You want to be well prepared when you graduate. -You care about your relationship with God. -You want a private school that won't put you in 100,000 of debt. -You like serving and being involved in the community. -You want a gorgeous campus. -You want a dry campus. -You want to be surrounded by friendly, fun, and spontaneous students.",
            "There are lots of fountains, take the time to avoid campus safety and go swimming in them! Also, we have Dorm Wars each year. From freshmen to Seniors, it is the most outstanding event of the year. Also, everyone here is obsessed with the Campus President: Paul Conn",
            "For a private institution, this is as good of a deal as you will find. It's literally half the price of any other private school I looked at. It was also cheaper than a fair number of state schools. And they do everything with excellence, so your money goes a long way.",
            "Hamilton Place mall is close, Chattanooga is fairly close and there is TONS to do there. Cleveland has a cute downtown area and many restaurants and stores. The Ocoee River, many mountains, good hiking, white water rating, camping, and many other outdoor activities are very close. The weather here is ideal for outdoor activities most months.",
            "The cafeteria is better than most other colleges I visited. But we also have on-campus restaurants you can go to: Subway, Chick-fil-a, Dunk'n Donuts, and Einstein's Bagels.",
            "The freshmen and sophomore dorms are some of the most incredible communities you will find on campus. And the upperclassman on-campus apartments and townhouses are VERY nice.",
            "Different programs vary. But the professors here are very good at pushing their students to excellence without being unreasonable.",
            "The strongest departments are: music, psychology, business (and we have a chinese program), history, teaching, and the school of religion. But all of our majors/department are excellent. Try many things, and get involved on campus! We have so much: intramurals, greek clubs (service based), rugby, service organizations, student leadership committee, academic clubs, incredible music groups, nationally renowned sports teams, and much more!",
            "Lee University has an atmosphere of friendliness and joy. Everything here is done with excellence; from the faculty, to chapels, to campus maintenance, to the students in various academic apartments. This college is very affordable and equips students exceptionally well for who that will be and what they will do in the future."

They are changing companies for the cafeteria in 2012, so the food options in there should be really good, 195319=There are many greek clubs, and they each host an event for the whole campus, so there's always something for friday nights. The Student Leadership Committee plans TONS of fun events. Our sports teams have national recognition. Our choirs and theater are open to non-majors, and our choirs are nationally renowned: performing at the January 2013 Presidential Inauguration., 21503=Every Tuesday and Thursday you are required to attend Chapel at 10:40 am. Seeing as it's a Christ-Centered University, it's not too odd, but if you aren't used to the Pentecostal church, it may be a little different., 31328=Freshmen: Girls go for Sharp/Davis hall (Its the nicest freshman girls dorm) Guys go for Bowdle/O' Bannon You have a curfew; 12am on weekdays and 1am on weekends. (It's not a big deal, I promise) You are required to go to chapels, but only 70% a month. (Everyone is there so it's like a big hang out and not like a church service.) Freshmen won't be able to have cars so make friends with upper classmen. Come to LEE DAY! It's the best way for prospective students to see everything happening at Lee in one weekend. It's usually the first weekend in April. Whatever your expectation are, they will be blown away by how amazing this place is., 336841=Go to Lee Day. Meet advisors and current students to get a feel for what to expect come August., 116339=There is a strong rapport among the dorms on campus, including dorm rivalries. The rivalries culminate in an annual competition titled, Dorm Wars in February., 361665=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 66243=Lee is pretty darn cheap, considering it's a private school. As of Spring 2015, it's $6,840 a semester. ($570/credit). The maximum credit load before having to pay extra is 16 hours and you need 120 hours to graduate. It actually ended up being cheaper for me than going to one of the in-state public universities. Lee gives a lot of good scholarships, both for sports and academics. The quality of education is also very good, in my opinion. Going to ratemyprofessors.com will help you choose teachers that teach well but aren't hard and it will allow to avoid any teacher that may not be a good teacher. The housing a meal plans are overpriced, but that pretty much happens at every school. I really have learned a lot in my major courses and feel like it was worth it to come here. It's nice because it's not too small, yet it's not too big. When walking around campus, it is not unusual to see a lot of people you don't know but it's also not unusual to see a good amount of people that you do know., 133999=Lee University has many fun traditions, I will just name a few of my favorites: Dorm Wars, Chapel and Convocation Week. Dorm wars takes place every February, and it is an exciting time when each dorm competes in a huge game in the basket ball arena. It's a night that the dorms, and participants prepare for weeks ahead of time! Chapel takes place twice a week, every Tuesday and Thursday morning from 10:40am to 11:30am. It's a 50 minute church service, and it's wonderful to take a break from the school day and focus on the Lord. And lastly, Convocation Week takes place once every semester where motivational speakers come to Lee University's chapel and speak- there is a different speaker each night for a week. During that week professor's are required not to give any tests or projects, so that we can focus on God for the week and learn something from the speakers., 115131=The Ocoee River is located approximately 20 miles from the campus, which provides river rafting for the area. The river was used in 1996 USA Olympics. Lee University is also located only 20 miles from Chattanooga, Tn which is home to many events for all ages and groups. Chattanooga has a beautiful downtown area with an aquarium and many places to eat. It is one of the students favorite places to go off campus.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I can honestly say that I have learned a lot while being here. The professors are, for the most part, very friendly, Christian people who would do anything to help their students learn. I find that if my professors are in their office, I can just walk in and ask for help no matter the time. These professors are also extremely qualified for their jobs; they really are experts in their fields. For the most part, the classes capture my interest. I find that I actually do learn in these classes and do not simply memorize the information for the test. I still can recall a lot of the things I learned during my first semester at Lee.
