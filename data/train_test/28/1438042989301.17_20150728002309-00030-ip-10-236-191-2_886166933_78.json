            "Just like any college there are definitely parties and kick backs but not only that ASuop is an on campus organization that plans events and activities to allow the students to kick back meet new people and have a lot of fun.",
            "Bon Appetite proudly serves the campus and provides a variety of different cuisines that keep in mind to provide delicious yet healthy food for the busy students.",
            "University of the Pacific allows the student to choose their living area right off the bat as a freshman, from the quads to the freshman only residence hall to the campus apartments, there are plenty of ways to find a place that makes you feel right at home.",
            "The 18:1 faculty to student ratio allows the student to be ore engaged in the course because the student understands the professor on a deeper level and is not afraid to ask for help or further tips.",
            "Keep your mind open; don't stay stuck on the fact that the campus is in Stockton, CA which may not be the best city in the world but the campus is the heart of the city. Every city has its bad areas but don't allow that to justify your feelings toward such a beautiful university.",
            "University of the Pacific is not just an institution but a close knit environment that provides thousands of opportunities for their students. From the amazing professors who listen to the students needs to the friendly students and staff who walk around campus with such big smiles who are proud to call themselves a Pacific Tiger. This campus is truly a home away from home."

Tips for prospective students For future students, I encourage you to choose this school for many reasons. This school has been voted to have a beautiful campus. The personnel at UOP are very friendly and very helpful if any questions arise. UOP also provides a large variety of majors for any incoming student and it would be great to have enthusiastic students on campus. Bang for the buck Of course, the cost at UOP would be a little pricey because of being a private school but you do get your money's worth here on this campus. Again, with the class sizes you have a better chance of retaining the information for the prices that you are paying. UOP",
