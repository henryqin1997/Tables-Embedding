            "Campus safety does a good job protecting us. They have a texting service that alerts us of any emergency. They are very strict about parking violations and will ticket your car if left where it shouldn't be for even a few minutes. The are like hawks!",
            "UF has a large Greek life that is very involved with the community. If you want to be Greek that's great, if it's not for you then you ignore it and go about your life. It doesn't affect you.",
            "Last I heard, UF has more organizations than any other university in Florida. There is a club/group for just about everything and if there isn't a club for what you want you can make your own!",
            "UF caters to both types of students. Students looking for that large university and those seeking a small university. It all depends what you involve yourself with. You can find yourself involved in a program that greatly diminishes the size of the university and you feel as if you have a new little family.",
            "The Great Undie Dash is something I look forward to each semester. Participants meet at the potato in Turlington, strip down to their undergarments and run a path around campus. Their clothes are donated to a shelter.",
            "I feel UF is a great bang for your buck! (If you pay in-state tuition)",
            "There are always sporting events to attend and the only one that costs money is football. Go cheer on your team! There is also a pretty good nightlife between Midtown and Downtown.",
            "I don't eat in the dinning halls, they are ehhh, but the chain vendors like Subway and Papa Johns are always satisfying.",
            "Ehh, good for the freshman but after that move off and get an apartment with friends!",
            "UF is challenging depending on the major, I feel. I am a math major and it is challenging, but my roommates had other majors and they were able to sleep all day and never do work or study.",
            "Stay on top of dates and deadlines. Take classes based on reviews of the professors, not based on the description of the course. What should be an easy course can be horrible depending on the professor.",
            "UF has an outstanding amount of school spirit which is very important to me. UF prides itself on academics and challenges its students. UF is a great experience for anyone wanting to pursue college after high school!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors. Aim for an SAT and ACT score within their middle 50% (somewhere between a 1900 and 2100 for the SAT and 27-31 for the ACT) or better, and make sure to take many rigorous classes in high school. Also, show a passion for attending UF in your essays or elsewhere on your application., 582346=i guess we're safe... there's blue emergency lights scattered around the campus, a separate police dept for uf, and scan-card dorms, but rapings and suspects with guns have been reported to the students via email and text just in fall 2011. oh and some shots fired... but i haven't seen anything, which is good. just make smart choices. the person who got raped, got in the car for a ride to campus with an elderly male she didn't know., 613241=there is so much to do at the university of florida! in the reitz union there is a game room with a bowling alley which is always a lot of fun. uf also has gator nights every friday night, where students can go to the reitz union for free and partake in a bunch of activities including midnight breakfast. they also show movies in the reitz union on fridays. there are also about 1000 clubs at uf as well as multiple sororities and fraternities. lastly the gator nation is very big on football. there's nothing like being in the swamp cheering on the gators with your gator family., 911913=There are numerous blue light emergency posts everywhere on campus, and guarantee police assistance within 60 seconds of when the button was pushed. A free snap transportation service is provided, which gives students a ride anywhere on campus after 3:00 AM., 49808=UF is one of the top 50 universities in the US and a great education for a tuition of about $4000 a year and housing is about $2000 for each semester is an amazing deal. If you received Bright Futures you really only have to pay for housing (and of course books and food.) UF also has many research opportunities with top-rated professors available for undergraduates., 48916=Apply as early as possible, way before the November 1st deadline. The earlier you apply, the earlier you can apply for housing (if you are planning on living on campus.) I find that living on campus is really convenient, where you can literally wake up ten minutes before your class and still make it. Off campus has it's perks but it costs about the same as on campus housing and you have to take the bus (which are often times always late.) I suggest living on campus for at least your first year. Also, UF seems to emphasize this quite a lot but GET INVOLVED! Try something new! Get new experiences!, 820345=There are over 1000 student organizations, if we don't have the one you are looking for it is extremely easy to create one yourself., 611633=the university of florida has about 1000 clubs with everything from a quidditch team to clubs for intramural sports., 939581=Dorms are not my thing. I stayed in them and sharing a bathroom with many girls is not what I enjoy. A plus for dorms is that you can meet a lot of people and you are right on campus so classes will be closer, as long as your 7:30 class isn't on the opposite side of campus, you will be able to enjoy every second of sleep., 502966=The campus is gorgeous (besides the weather in August and September, but that's horrible everywhere in Florida)! For being such a large university, it's really easy to get involved in organizations., 322695=The French Fries is a favorite sculpture near the Marston Science Library done by artist John Henry that was placed on campus in February 1989. Though the actual name of the piece is Alachua, named for the county which the city of Gainesville calls home, it still remains a notorious landmark often referred to when giving directions to campus visitors and Freshman. Another popular sculpture around campus, The Potato, is located near Turlington Hall and serves as a popular meeting point. Krishna Lunch, a full vegetarian meal, is served daily in the Plaza of the Americas for dirt cheap, and it is delicious!, 246201=Home to almost 1000 campus organizations, UF offers something for every student that attends. From greek life to skydiving to intramurals, almost anything you can think of will probably exist at the University., 172699=Like I previously mentioned, there are almost 1000 clubs and just about anything you can think of. There are tons of intramural sports and workout facilities all over campus!}",
