    "textBeforeTable": "Speed 10, Glide 5, Turn -2, Fade 2 About Color and Availability - Pictured above are some available DX colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. DX discs are affordably priced and provide an excellent grip in all types of weather conditions. Over time, DX discs will take on new and varied flight characteristics that stem from their use. They start out more overstable, but with use will match the flight ratings. With continued use, they'll eventually become more understable than the ratings. The era of the wide rimmed disc golf drivers was issued in by the Beast. It was an instant classic when released, giving players more distance while using less power. The Innova DX Beast is a maximum distance driver that is straight. It glides long to a predictable finish. Its high glide, high speed, and high speed turn all combine to give big distance. This disc golf disc is suitable for beginners and pros alike. The Beast is a great choice for maximum distance, a turnover driver, tailwind drives, rollers and beginner players looking for more distance from a driver. It's sure to increase distance for beginners and pros alike.",
    "textAfterTable": "\"The Beast has quickly become a favorite of mine. MY USE RANGE: 280-400ft. Very versatile disc...Flick or RHBH! My main use for it is the big \"S\" turn shot to usually dodge trees up the middle. This thing dodges trees like nothin! Glides well & is VERY accurate!\" - Eric Friedman If you are looking for a disc that has more Fade, try the Orc more Turn, try the Monarch more Glide, try the Kite Other Speed 10 discs include the Monster, Orc, SL, Starfire and Monarch Write a review Rating: Bad \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Good Your Name: Your Review: Note: HTML is not translated!
