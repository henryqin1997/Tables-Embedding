            "if you need anything, anything at all, call public safety. while not always punctual, they do keep us safe and happy.",
            "there's something for everyone...really! music clubs, cooking clubs, social work clubs, even religious clubs. there's even a club that puts on rocky horror picture show every year, which i've heard is...interesting.",
            "arts (music, theater, dance, and especially film) students will love this place. it is also widely acclaimed for the business program.",
            "go to the beckman hall terrace, up on the third floor. it has a great view of the piazza.",
            "it's a little pricey, but the school gives out more money than the normal person can imagine for scholarships. it's well worth applying even if you think you won't be able to afford it. you'll be surprised.",
            "go to concerts and plays! play in the fountains! go to disneyland!!! there really are boundless opportunities. events around campus are sent out every week in an email newsletter, so you have no excuse to be bored.",
            "beware of cafeteria food! it's usually good...except on weekends and during interterm. there is a huge variety of food in the caf; every night there's something asian, italian, greek, and of course there are pizza and burgers and soup too. on-campus we have jazzman's cyber cafe, which has coffee easily comparable to starbuck's or peet's. we also have jamba juice, einstein bros. bagels, world of wings, and a little snack shop in the library for all those late-night studiers.",
            "our resident advisers (ras) work so hard to keep the resident students busy! there is always something to do. however, the walls are very thin and people like to go screaming down the hallways at night. oh, and sometimes the henley lobby smells like moldy bread and yogurt, but that's incidental. the basement is awesome though. there are pool tables and a gym and music practice rooms right downstairs from your room. it's pretty neat, actually.",
            "the first year is just like high school, but with a more relaxed schedule. it does get harder and you will have to study, but the work is surprisingly rewarding. the professors are there to help you!",
            "chapman is not intimidating in the least, except for maybe the arts programs, which are fantastic but rigorous. if you are an arts student, make sure you are well-prepared for your audition/interview and have double-checked your portfolio. also, interviews are not necessary but i highly recommend having one to get your foot in the door.",
            "if you want a beautiful campus, great small-town community feel just minutes away from some of the greatest los angeles area landmarks (including disneyland!), plus a strong academic community, this is the school for you. it has a fantastic variety of on-campus eateries, a four-story library, and a giant stone fountain in the middle of campus. plus, you can't beat this weather!"

Chapman is so close to the beach and not a far drive from la or the surrounding areas. Disneyland is within ten minutes, which makes it easy to hop in the car and take a trip to Disneyland for a few hours to reduce stress and have a great time with your friends. The weather is phenomenally! I would never have expected to be outside tanning in December while studying for finals. Chapman is all I could have asked for and more., 175159=As mentioned, Interterm in January is essentially free, as in no additional cost to live and eat on campus and take up to 3 additional credit credits. Also, Chapman will waive tuition on a study-abroad program once during your time there. I just got back from a month in Perugia, Italy, didn't have to pay the $1960 tuition, and Dodge College also subsidized a $1700 portion of the travel expenses!, 39720=If you like to learning directly from the experts is what you want then you will love Chapman. Chapman's classes are taught by world renowned professors including Nobel Prize winner Dr. Vernon L. Smith, winner of the Wolff Prize Yakir Aharonov and the famous political scientist Dr. Lori Cox Hans who taught my freshman class. Be the envy of your friends by learning from the best., 142032=For me, I'm only taking about $2000 out in loans to pay for tuition, while the rest is covered in financial aid and there is nothing more I could ask for. For a $60 student activities fee, so many events and clubs are available for students to participate in., 159448=The food is decently tasty, but not always terribly healthy. I suspect this has changed since I graduated in May of 2010., 34002=Chapman is costly, but hunt for scholarships (especially through Cappex!) and find as much financial aid as you can. For the cost though, you do get a quality education and experiences such as lectures with famous scholars, resources that are free, and you have a classroom ratio of 20:1. You also can get involved with so much throughout the year that will really help you succeed at Chapman such as clubs, sororities, fraternities, academic involvement, study abroad and so much more!, 178470=Chapman's Dodge College, its training and equipment rivals USC, UCLA and just about any other film school. The small class size is a major plus, as I want my professors to know me by name. Being able to take a course for free during Interterm in January is also great.}",
