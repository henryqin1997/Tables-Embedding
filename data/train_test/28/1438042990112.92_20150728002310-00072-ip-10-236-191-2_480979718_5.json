This embodiment should not be seen as a limitation of the scope of the present invention; the scope of such being ascertained by the following claims. It should be noted a number of modifications can be made to the process of present invention. For example, the purge and recycle loops of the present invention can still include the water wash/distillation systems that have been traditionally used for recovering ammonia from the recycle and/or purge streams. Non-permeate purge stream 34 which is further enriched in the inerts is withdrawn from the high pressure side of membrane separator M2. Since non-permeate stream 34 will also contain significant quantities of hydrogen, this stream can be advantageously processed for hydrogen recovery. For example, a hydrogen-selective membrane can be utilized to recover the hydrogen from this stream. Finally, permeate purge stream 32 is withdrawn from the low pressure side of membrane separator M2 and recycled to feed stream 10 prior to compressor C1. Gaseous purge stream 30 is introduced into membrane separator M2 which also comprises a high pressure side separated from a low pressure side by a semi-permeable membrane which is selective for the permeation of ammonia. Gaseous purge stream 30 is more specifically introduced into the high pressure side of membrane separator M2. A portion of feed stream 10 is introduced into the low pressure",
