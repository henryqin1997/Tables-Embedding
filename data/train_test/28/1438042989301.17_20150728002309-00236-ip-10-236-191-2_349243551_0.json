The 20-year-old right-back is expected to make his debut today at Coventry, he has been brought in on a 28 day loan initially, but it is expected he will stay until the end of the current season. Millen had already failed to land the player in January, but now the Hammers have had a change of mind. Millen said: 'We've been aware of Jordan for some time and he is a player we looked at in January. He is a right-back who can play centre-half, is a good athlete and has been close to the first-team squad at West Ham for a while now. 'The injury to Louis Carey left us short and Jordan will be a good addition to the squad. He trained with the rest of the squad on Thursday and will be in the squad at Coventry. 'He's played a lot of games for West Ham reserves as captain this season, was involved in a game against Arsenal on Tuesday night, and is match- fit. You need to be match-fit in the Championship, or you will be found out.', 12252=Joe Bryan Signs Contract Extension.
