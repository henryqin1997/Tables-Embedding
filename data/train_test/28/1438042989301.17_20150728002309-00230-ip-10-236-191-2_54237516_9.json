You\u2019re last 1.1 was in 6:31, so way faster than sub 20 pace. Looks like we\u2019re about the same age. I\u2019ll be 30 in 5 months. It\u2019s good and back. For 5k/10k it\u2019s easier.

My wife wants to hit one this fall (October 20 in Seaside, CA). I'll happily go along, as it is all good for overall fitness, but I'm not nearly as good in the water, so it's going to take me a lot of work to be good enough for an open water event.

I ate eggplant parmesan for dinner (probably not a great choice, but what wifey makes, Bugaha eats) and then played with the kids put them down, and then me and Mrs. Bugaha watched a movie (Oblivion, if you must know, which was a sci-fi thriller/scientology documentary). During the climactic Independence Day rip-off scene, I dressed and affixed my chip and race bib.\u00a0 At 11:15 I headed downtown.\u00a0 I parked like a mile and a half away to jog to the start for the warmup, passed a lot of bars on the way, and was taunted by drunk bar goers a lot. It was in the low 80s and pretty humid for a midnight in September, so I got a good sweat going., 16982=Long run on Saturday went fairly well. 18 miles @ 8:27.\u00a0 I met my friend along our route and finished up at the pool where we got in a little refreshing soak and recovery to the legs while sippin on a choco milk.\u00a0 As most of you may know,\u00a0 I am in the middle of marathon training.\u00a0 I knew this one was going to be tough run and it was but I got through it.

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{216290=Philly, 3 X 2400 sounds tough at those paces. Good luck, I know you will nail it!, 178390=Me - So after doing 4 easy miles @ 8:45 pace on Saturday, I had my 16 miler today. I have to say that it went as well as I could have hoped. The temp was in the low 60's and low humidity, and it was a perfect day to run. It wasn't anything crazy, but my splits were 9:12, 9:06, 9:27, 9:18, 9:11, 9:10, 9:11, 9:04, 8:59, 8:54, 9:02, 9:07, 8:49, 8:47, 8:43, 8:38. Average pace was 9:02. I didn't even feel sort of fatigued until 10 miles in, and could feel it a little more at 14 miles in. Even having done 16 miles, I felt like I could have ran 2-3 more miles if I had to. With that being my longest run to date, I'm pleased with how it went. I was actually trying to go slower than that, since my LR pace should be slower than my GMP (currently 9:09), but anything slower than 9:15 and I go out of my mind. I wonder if my GMP is actually slower than what it should be, but then again, I want to make sure I don't go out too fast. Every LR tells me more about what I can manage though, and I'll have to use the experience of all of them to figure out what I want to do for my 1st marathon in November., 78423=Regarding my 5K tomorrow... I've decided not to run it.\u00a0 I'd rather focus and continue my training for the marathon.\u00a0 If I did the 5k, I'd miss a much needed long run that I feel is crutial towards conditioning me for the 26.2 miles come\u00a0late Oct. Not only that, but honestly, lately I just haven't felt like running fast. Even on my easy runs, I'm just sloggin through them with no pep in my step and have no desire to pick up the pace. I hope this is just a phase I'm going through but I'm not the runner I was 6 months to 1 year ago. Rarely do I kick out a run now that's sub 8 min for the average. That's not like me to at least get in one run a week that's say..... 5-6 miles @ 7:48 or 7:58, something like that.But lately all my runs have been coming in the 8:2x - 8:3xish paces overall.\u00a0 Perhaps after my marathon in late October, I'll find a late fall 5k around Nov or early Dec and see what I do., 114463=Me, I was going to do some 800s this morning, but the wind kicked up, time was tight with my daughters soccer game and I decided to put it off until tomorrow. BUT, I did go run 5 miles in this beautiful weather and BAM, the old me is coming back. 5 miles @ 7:32 pace felt awesome., 242714=Avg: 9:29.3 (6:19.5 pace), 53689=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Me, Yesterday put down 8 @ an 8:07 pace. Today was a mixed bag of 6 miles. Started out with a warm up of 8:42 then the next five were aggresive hill sprints,strides,fartlek, flat road sprints, recovery paces,even threw in some flying 30s( afterall they made a Bug fly fast) it turned out to be a pretty tough workout. Last day for humidity for a while thank goodness!, 231868=Troy - Thanks on my LR! I'm doing my 1st marathon in Philly on Nov. 17th. Good luck on that 22 miler, that'll be rough for sure. I have an 18 miler in a week and a half and will top at 21 miles next month. Really solid 6 miles this morning as well!, 13852=04:55 AM Wednesday, September 11, 2013 (Easy), 78063=Had yesterday off from work cause I had to take my daughter to a dr appt. But before that, I got out early and ran 8 easy miles @ 8:29.\u00a0 I'm taking today off to help get me ready for my longest long run in awhile... we have 20 on the schedule tomorrow with two buddies. I hope I can walk afterwards!, 209504=Ran the first mile in about 7:58. \u00a0The second in about 7:51..., 242674=9:25.4 (6:16.9), 216550=Well my back to back solid 5 miler and 10 mile long run/800 sesh this weekend kind of took the air out of the tires of this OF. Yesterday, I damn near crawled 6 miles at, get this, 8:51 pace! Holy $hi+, that's slow for me. VERY humid and over 70 but REALLY?, 32052=Thur: 5 miles @ 8:21, 71504=Current PR's: 5k - 19:56 (6/21/14); HM - 1:34:33 (4/26/15); FM - 4:08:17 (11/23/14), 76774=OF, my marathon is Oct 26. Hope the self-PT continues to work!\u00a0, 251350=Me:\u00a0 I finished last week at 43 miles, including an 11 mile long run, which isn\u2019t that long compared to many of you. This week I\u2019ve had two runs of 8 miles each. Monday was recovery and yesterday was what I will call a progression tempo. I think my training plan uses this type of progression as sort of a tempo run.\u00a0 It was supposed to be 60-70 minutes of progression with the last 5 at under 5k pace.\u00a0 My splits ended up being 8:10, 7:36, 7:23, 7:06, 6:47, 6:41, and then the last 0.75 at 6:10.\u00a0 Then did 1.25 miles of cool down. This was a very hard run for me, and that last .75 was just about all I had.\u00a0 Today is a recovery run, Thursday is 3 sets of 3x400.\u00a0, 169956=Sun - 2.35mi @ 9:11, 169836=Thu - 8mi @ 8:30, 21855=Jenkins- thanks. No worries. I\u2019ve moved on, just one of those days where it won\u2019t happen. I\u2019ll just need to take advantage of dec-mar here when the weather is prime for racing. Don\u2019t worry about the slow miles as long as you\u2019re getting them in. my wed/fri runs are usually around 8:30-9min pace, sometimes over 9. That mileage base will be key once you put the speed back in. keep it up!, 224264=66\u00b0, 63\u00b0DP, 87%HUM, mild, clear, legs felt good Run Duration = 48:08,\u00a0 Run Length = 9.7 Kms or 6.0 Miles Average Run Pace = 04:58 per Km or 08:00 per Mile, Age grade =\u00a0 65.8 %, 284891=05:23 AM Thursday, September 19, 2013\u00a0 (Easy) Run Duration = 43:12,\u00a0 Run Length = 8.2 Kms or 5.10 Miles Average Run Pace = 05:15 per Km or 08:28 per Mile, Age grade =\u00a0 61.8 %, 232787=mjm - I actually had shin splint pain in August and not ITBS, but good information nonetheless. Ever since I got over the shin pain I've been doing preventive stretches and exercises and icing them from time to time. *Knock on wood*, I haven't felt any shin pain for the past 3 weeks. I also can't take credit for the DM run, that was Philly's run I was talking about. Anything over 5 miles and I go crazy on that thing lol. Really nice 8 miles from you as well! That's a solid pace and glad you are doing a lot better!, 97693=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Me, Yes! it was 60 degrees with low humidity. Nice! My legs were feeling a little achy but got 8 in @ an 8:05 pace. Looking for 5 slow tomorrow with an 11 or 12 LR on Sunday., 242634=9:27.9 (6:18.6), 79653=05:32 AM Thursday, September 12, 2013 (easy) Run Duration = 68:04,\u00a0 Run Length = 12.9 Kms or 8.0 Miles Average Run Pace = 05:16 per Km or 08:29 per Mile, Age grade =\u00a0 63.5 %, 260198=7 miles, easy 8:09 pace today. Nice and cool and dry. Huge diff!, 161919=RUN SUMMARY\u00a0 9/14/2013\u00a0 @ 4:45AM (LongRun_2 friends_easy_), 209861=Overall, I averaged about 7:55, with a total distance of 8.65 miles. \u00a0I kept it nice and even and felt strong and relaxed, in the zone. \u00a0In control, and pushing it some, but I knew where the limit was and stayed comfortably back from it. \u00a0I haven't felt that way in a run since June. \u00a0It sure is a nice feeling., 224101=04:58AM Tuesday, September 17, 2013\u00a0 (Gen Aerobic), 169795=Wed - 6mi @ 8:47, 152936=Me, tried something different. NIce cool morning, 59 degrees, a little humid but tons better than normal. Went to McAlpine and warmed up a mile, then did 4X800 on the gravel with 400 rest, or about 3 minutes each, 3:08 on the first 2, 3:12 on the second 2. Then I took it easy for a mile at 9+ minute pace and ramped up the progression to finish the last mile at 7:44 pace, last 400 at 7:24 for a total of 10 miles., 265860=Mvallone, I spoke too soon about this weekends LR. This week's LR will be a cutback run of 17 miles instead of 22.\u00a0 I wish you the best on your marathon in November. That is a fantastic progression run. Nice splits!, 120553=Then, down to 8:15 for about 3 miles., 223562=Me, Got out early and had a myself a good run this a.m.\u00a0 6 mi @ 8 flat. First 4 miles @ progression pace, 5th mile had the two roller coaster type hills, although somewhat short,\u00a0 and finished fast with a 7:09 6th mile. I was beginning to wonder if I was ever going to see some low7's again on an easy run. I saw them this morning. Thankyou.\u00a0 Gym after work for some very light weights and stretching., 280321=David, nice run despite the knee. Hopefully nothing major, continue to monitor and may wanna go a bit lighter on the next run.\u00a0\u00a0You may recall my knee issue back in June and I just ran very very easy for about 3 weeks and it went away on it's own., 22298=Bug- no I didn\u2019t use the glass. It\u2019s a pilsner glass and as a beer snob, I will only drink pilsners in it, but I didn\u2019t have any at home. No races on the schedule. I\u2019ll be on vacation starting in a week for 10 days. Then I\u2019ve got 6 weeks before my goal half (if the weather sucks, I\u2019ll give it a shot, but will end up signing up for another half). After that, then I\u2019ll look into some 5 and 10Ks. Now on to you, CONGRATS! That time is stellar and definitely would\u2019ve been sub 19:30. You\u2019re pace was about a 19:20, so taking in extra fatigue, I\u2019d say right around 19:23! What a finishing last mile! Haha, you always run by the most interesting people!, 31985=Wed: 5 miles @ 8:19 plus full body lift PM, 120474=Then, picked it up to about 8:45 for the next 4 miles., 209596=By this time I was feeling pretty good, and I knew that the total distance was somewhere around 8 miles, so I figured I'd target sub-8:00 the whole way and see if I could keep it up after doing a swim workout., 216863=Like Troy shared, maybe the speed is leaving me too. Given the base and the intervals/tempos I did in July and August, I wouldn't have expected the 800s to be at the pace I ran them....would have expected right at 3:00 give or take a sec. I don't know guys, when it cools we'll see for sure, but I do know that recovery is taking longer. I'm okay with that as long as I can still go fast every once in a while., 169912=Sat - 20.1mi @ 9:13, 242594=9:34.6 (6:23.1), 23845=Me- didn\u2019t run after the eagles game Monday, got caught up in the 2nd game. Did the 4x1600m with 400m jog recovery (about 2-2:15)\u00a0yesterday. Goal 10k pace. The legs were a bit sore, so I started with a goal of 6:30 pace. Went by feel the first 2 laps then checked the watch and saw it was 3:10 at 800m, so slowed down and finished at 6:27. The rest were similar effort. 6:26, 2:24, 6:22. Avg: 6:25. Again, intervals felt relatively easy. The temp was cooler at 86, but we\u2019ve been just swamped in high humidity. It was 100% overnight and 90% during the run, which was at 6:30pm.\u00a0Easy recovery day on the dreadmill today, 8-ish miles likely. Not sure about tempo tomorrow, we\u2019ll see how the legs feel today., 242366=Yesterday did 3x2400m repeats. Weather wasn\u2019t too bad.. 84 degrees and 88% humidity, felt like 94. Prime temperature for this time of year. Goal pace was 9:30 per (6:20/mi), 310573=7:30, 89120=Me- Wednesday I did 8 recovery pace outside around 8:20 pace. Yesterday I decided to attempt the tempo but gave myself clearance to cut it short if the juice wasn\u2019t there. Goal was 5 miles around 6:52 pace (1:30 HM), even though 2 weeks ago I hit 5 @ 6:43 pace. Legs were tired from the start so I knew I\u2019d cut it short. Did only 4 miles at 6:50.6 pace average within a 9 mile run. Good news is that it\u2019s been cooler! Only 97, no more triple digits it seems!\u00a0 Woohoo! Considering the 10k Sunday, and 4x1600 Tuesday, I\u2019m fine with the tempo. Easy 6 today and a LR on the DM possibly tomorrow after work., 232414=David - Thanks! I can't believe my marathon is only 2 months away, crazy stuff. Good for you taking off 3 weeks for vacation! I think that 5k race is just the right amount of time before your half. Sub-20 is there for the taking, and I think sub-1:35 in the half would be a great accomplishment. Wishing you the best!, 44776=Troy:\u00a0 That is a brutal and fast 18 miler!\u00a0 Great follow up with the pool and chocolate milk.\u00a0 I\u2019ll mention something that my PT told me after my marathon (she is a 2:40 marathoner herself, yes, not a type, 2:40). She said I ran way too fast in my long runs.\u00a0 I\u2019m not saying that 8:27 is too fast, but if I did it again, I would always err on the slow side. It\u2019s good you have a buddy though.\u00a0 The hardest part on the LR\u2019s for me was always the boredom.\u00a0 If I was on my own, I would have to play little games, such as \u201cIt\u2019s way too dark out here, and, holy crap was that a coyote?!\u201d\u00a0 Fun times., 134668=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Me, Ran 5.1 yesterday @ an 8:34 comfy pace. So this morning in the 48 degree weather (nice) did 12.3 @ an 8:23 pace. Didn't push very hard just some extra effort on the hills as always. Got in 47 for the week. May cut back a tad next week., 199977=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MV, Awesome 16 dude! Nice progression with it also. Very nice weekly mileage too. Feeling like you could have done more says to me that you're progressing well.That marathon will be here before you know it. Keep up the great work. I'm going to be on vacation for 3 weeks in October so I have a 5k I will be running in Panama City Beach on the Oct. 12 and then Oct.27th I have my main goal race (HM) back in Louisville. Hoping to crack that 20 mark down at the beach and am shooting for 1:35 in the half., 38066=Masters Runner - Age 57 - Sprinting past the Grim Reaper PRS:\u00a0200m: 0:29.1 (06/14) | 400m: 1:07.6 (01/14)\u00a0800m: 3:03 (10/13) | 1500m:\u00a0 6:16 (6/15)\u00a0| Mile:\u00a0 6:35 (8/14)\u00a05K: - 23:13 (06/15), 281404=05:12 PM Wednesday, September 18, 2013 (Speed_3x1k) Park 79\u00b0, 46%hum, DP 57\u00b0, fairly dry, ptly cldy,\u00a0mild, legs felt good Run Duration = 43:34,\u00a0 Run Length = 8.5 Kms or 5.25 Miles Average Run Pace = 05:08 per Km or 08:17 per Mile, Age grade =\u00a0 63.3 %, 161230=This morning I needed a few more miles to break 40, so I got out and did a shake out jog of 2.35 miles @ 9:11.\u00a0 Total this week was 41.7 miles.\u00a0 This is my 4th week in a row @ 40+. I sure would like to hit the 50 mark soon, but I'm just not putting in the effort/runs to get there.\u00a0, 284264=This morning I ran 5.10 easy miles @ 8:28. The humidity was up @ 95% but overall a very cool morning @ 57\u00b0. Gym later on this afternoon for some light weights and core., 114138=David, an Achy Breaky 8 @ 8:05 is rock solid, hope you enjoyed the better weather. have a great long run!, 120615=Finally, finished up with three miles in the 7:50 range., 193435=tomorrow will be interesting, it calls for 3x2400m @ around 10k pace. so i'll shoot for 6:20 pace (9:30 per). i did 2x2400m at the start of the training around 9 or 10 weeks ago and did them in 9:30 (6:20)\u00a0and 9:36 (6:24)\u00a0in 100+ heat. it didn't feel too bad, but we'll see how much harder it is with a 3rd in there and trying to run them all the same pace., 67334=Philly - Great race by you considering the conditions. I think we all know here that with better weather, you can definitely obtain sub-40. Excellent job by you regardless. Awesome intervals as well, and it's a great sign that a 6:25 pace felt easy. You have great races coming your way., 113861=Bug, you blazed up that tempo like Johnny Hopkins and Sloan Kettering! Stay classy over there in Bugaha. I will wager anyone on here you will be sub 19 by the end of November when it cools off. Keep up the great training., 13514=Got out early this morning and ran 6 mi easy @ 8:45. Still a bit muggy here, like David, we're expecting some cooler temps and lower humidity by week's end., 120383=I started out with two slow miles, in the 9:45 realm with my wife., 160663=One of my friends met me at my pool and we took off together where we met another friend of ours about 4 miles in. Total run was 20.1 miles @ 9:13 clip.\u00a0 We didn't run this one nearly as fast as last week's (18 miler) which I think helped my legs some. Our other friend is slower than we, so that forced me and my other buddy to slow it down for him which helped us I think. The slower miles @10min+\u00a0 were either hilly miles or circling back to our slower friend and bringing him in from time to time., 169752=Tue - 5.3mi @ 8:13, 274321=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Me, Took an extra day off as i had somewhat of a right knee issue. Don't really know if it is runners knee coupled with a little shin splint but decided to lay off for an extra day. Went out today and did 6 miles. Have some discomfort in the knee but feel I may be able to run through it.I'll be paying close attention to what it is doing. My avg. pace for the 6 was 7:30. Did the first 5 progressively with mile 6 as a warm down. The garmin site is down for maintenance at this time so I cant copy my splits. I did run mile 5 at 6:46 without much todo with the knee so this is why I feel I may be able to run through it., 233700=Me - So yesterday I had a complete rest day after my 16 mile run, and I have to say that I was surprised that my legs felt totally fine after such a long run. Tonight I didn't get to run until 10:30ish, and had 7 miles to knock out. When I walked outside it felt like it was at least October with the temp right around 50 degrees(!!) and it felt great! I started my run and after I ran the first mile in 8:47, my legs felt strong, so I decided to pick up the pace. My splits after that were 8:15, 7:47, 7:39, 7:29, 7:25, 7:09. Still felt strong after the 7 miles, so did another 1/2 mile in 3:32 (7:04 pace) and finished 7.5 miles at 58:06. Average pace was 7:44., 31940=Tues: 7 miles @ 8:16, 46533=Today was a 4 mile tempo with 2 mile warm up and 1 mile warm down (for math purposes, that\u2019s somewhere between 3 and 8 miles total). My paces for the tempo were 6:41, 6:39, 6:39, and 6:09.\u00a0 I stuck to a comfortably hard pace and was pleased with how it ended up (I sort of let loose on the last one).\u00a0 There were a couple mitigating factors that I should confess. One is that there were at least 4 stops for traffic lights. Next, it was a lot cooler and there was a breeze that was so sweet that I got Type 2 diabetes just from running in it. I suspect that when it cools down for all of us, we\u2019re going to see some awesome things.\u00a0 Hope all is well!, 13939=Mild,clear, 68\u00b0, 64\u00b0DP, 87%H, legs felt ok Run Duration = 52:37,\u00a0 Run Length = 9.7 Kms or 6.0 Miles Average Run Pace = 05:26 per Km or 08:45 per Mile, Age grade =\u00a0 60.2 %, 127524=me- actually ended up doing 15 on the DM @7:58 pace. watched star trek: into darkness and luckily it was over 2 hrs and pretty much constant action. my run was easy and actually zoomed by pretty quickly. hopefully when i come back from vacation, my LR will be outside though. finished the week at 45. rest day today (besides working)., 248809=Philly:\u00a0 Here is the difference between you and me:\u00a0 I watched Star Trek on my couch while me and my pregnant wife downed crunch berries and frozen yogurt; you watched it while running 15 effing miles on a treadmill! Handshake to you brother. That is impressive.\u00a0 Very sorry to hear about the glass. I think you need to save that story for your memoirs though.\u00a0 Your medal from Rio 2016 won\u2019t break that easy. Great run on the 2400s and excellent progression. The heat you ran that in is crazy. Have a great vacay., 70097=So after my 5k I took Monday off, and then Tuesday did an easy 7 miles late night @ 8:49 pace. Going into the run my calves still felt sore from the 5k (guess that's what happens when you haven't done any speed work for a while) so wanted to make sure I didn't push it too much. On Wednesday I did my normal 6.53 run with my LRS, but it was probably the hardest one I've done with them. Not only did I get almost no sleep the night before, but I ate horribly due to an office party we had as well as the weather being 90 degrees an humid. Still ended up knocking it out @ an 8:46 pace. Tonight I did a faster 5 miles @ 7:57 pace, though it was about 85% humidity, so it felt tougher than it probably should have.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "View Splits 8 \u00a0 Take care all \u00a0 Me, Well we're fighting the high humidity here again but just for a few more days. By Friday the nasty stuff is supposed to blow out and we should be enjoying some cooler temps. Ran 7.5 this morning @ a 7:57 pace. Good and soaked by the end! \u00a0 Troy, Thanks, That was quite the LR you had youself.Good pacing and a strong finish also. Though the 15 I did was my longest, it was quite taxing on the legs. Great follow up with the progression run.Way to stick that mile 5! Good job on the weekly total again. All those miles pay off somewhere down the line. \u00a0 MJM, Well run 8 miler! Best wishes to you on your endeavor in the triatholon quest. I had a friend that just completed his 3rd ironman race. Quite an accomplishment. A huge undertaking and a whole lot of commitment go into such training.
