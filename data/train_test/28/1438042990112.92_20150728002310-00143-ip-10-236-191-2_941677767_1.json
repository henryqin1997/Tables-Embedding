The tally includes sheriff\u0092s offices and police departments., 38740=Assistant State Attorney John Parker, who handles all extradition requests in Santa Rosa County, confirmed as much. He said the cost was too high and the charges would probably have only led to probation. Even if Bennett was locked up in 2009, he would have been out well before the Renegade Mountain murders, he said., 32933=Bennett was one of those cases in which police and prosecutors decided it wasn\u0092t worth pursuing him beyond Florida\u0092s neighboring states.

The tally includes sheriff\u0092s offices and police departments., 37822=But every time, the answer was the same: Tennessee was too far away. Authorities there last heard from Bennett in March of 2013 shortly after he was released from a Tennessee prison. He called to ask whether there was any way to \u0093take care of this (Florida charge) without being arrested,\u0094 according to a police report. When the officer said no, he hung up., 37306=Within months of putting his name into the FBI\u0092s database in 2009, authorities were fielding calls from Tennessee police telling them that their fugitive had been found, records show. In all, authorities had at least six chances to come pick him up between 2009 and September 2013. He wasn\u0092t hard to find \u0097 he was in a Tennessee prison from March 2010 to March 2013. Police records show Florida authorities knew exactly where he was and considered whether to extradite him on multiple occasions., 32138=That\u0092s according to data obtained by USA TODAY from the National Crime Information Center\u0092s Wanted Person File. An analysis of more than 1 million active NCIC records as of May 29 shows that authorities were unwilling to spend the time or money to pick up 186,873 fugitives from another state, a process known as extradition. In Philadelphia, for example, even violent fugitives only had to hop three bus stops to Camden, N.J., to escape justice. Some in Middle Tennessee only have to drive 40 miles north to Kentucky to escape charges here., 37043=Bennett was wanted on one such crime \u0097 felony larceny. Authorities in Santa Rosa County, Fla., accused him of clearing out more than $1,000 from his girlfriend\u0092s bank account in 2008. But he moved to Tennessee before deputies could catch him., 31264=Instead, Bennett was left to go about his life on Renegade Mountain in East Tennessee. And on Sept. 12, 2013, police say, he shot and killed Rikki Jacobsen, 22; her nephew, Dominic Davis, 17; and their friends Steven Presley, 17, and John Lajeunesse, 16., 39626=The number of statewide cases as of May 29 in which authorities were unwilling to pick up suspects who were stopped or arrested across state lines.
