            "Students looking to go here should apply in advance, as the testing services can be kind of a pain...they take security very serious here. Also when you are signing up for your classes, make sure you pick them all out prior to enrollment starting. When classes open up, they fill fast!",
            "Johnson County Community College is a school where you feel welcome, desired, and wanted. It is a great feeling when the teachers stop to help you with a subject you are struggling with, such as calculus. The class sizes are small enough so that you get noticed!"

My average per semester with books and tuition has been below $1800 and that's with the max amount of hours that can be taken. By going to JCCC for my first two years, I have saved has been about $20,000 compared to going to a four year university for my first two years for the same classes., 290289=JCCC's tuition for the Spring of 2015 for a Johnson County resident is $1,056. You cannot beat that price, especially with the quality of the school., 15855=1) Enrollment-Decide what classes you want to take before enrollment starts. General Education classes with good teachers and convinient time slots fill up early. So have the class numbers ready at 7:59 AM and call the school and try enrolling online at 8:00 AM. You may be on hold for a long time or your call won't go through but stay persistant. You will get the classes you want, at the time you want, and with who you want if you keep trying. 2) Get involved! Take advantage of the center for student involvement and get involved at the school. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. You will make friends. There is nothing to lose! 3) Utilize the resource centers- The math resource center has tutors for free, same with the science resource center and the writing center. All three have tools to help you succeed. 4) Apply for the general scholarship- it is a pain free, 5 minute application. You answer basic questions about race, GPA, income, etc. The school doesn't take extra strides to advertise the application so many students don't know about it. So your chances of receiving a scholarship are increased., 295490=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Johnson County Community College is great for someone who is still deciding on a certain major or who wants to learn as much as they can about the subjects they love before they decide. This college is also great for working parents or people who are continuing their education and would like a school with a flexible schedule. The campus is not extremely big either so anyone who may have a handicap will also flourish here as well. Basically, this school is geared toward anyone with a will to learn and plan for their future! Tips for prospective students Just make sure that you know what classes you would like to take before you enroll. The general studies classes generally tend to fill up on the first day of enrollment so be an early bird! You can also call and make an appointment with any of the counselors who will help you if you need advice! (I'm basically best friends with many of the counselors here). Do not be afraid to sign up for a couple of summer classes as well if you need some extra classes for another school or anything like that! Bang for the buck Hands down this school is very cost effective and is not expensive. especially compared to other schools that",
