    "textAfterTable": "12 Songs Album Review Commercially, a change of direction can be risky business for an artist \u2014 even if the change is not a radical one. In Diana Reyes' case, the change wasn't dramatic; she started out in one area of regional Mexican music (norte\u00f1o) and switched to another (duranguense). It wasn't like she gave up norte\u00f1o in order to reinvent herself as a goth-rock, industrial, or death metal artist. Nonetheless, even a minor change of direction is still a change of direction. But thanks to very effective marketing, Reyes' switch to duranguense has paid off commercially for the spirited Mexican vocalist. Reyes continues in a duranguense direction on 2008's Insatisfecha (\"Unsatisfied\"), which has a fair amount of Latin pop appeal but overall, has a stronger ranchera factor than 2005's La Reina del Pasito Duranguense (an album that did a great deal to make Reyes a major name in duranguense). When Reyes made the transition from norte\u00f1o to duranguense, her work became more pop-minded and less traditionally ranchera. But Insatisfecha does a fine job of balancing Latin pop and ranchera considerations, always maintaining a duranguense orientation \u2014 and regardless of whether a particular track is more Latin pop or more ranchera, Reyes' originality is a major asset. Reyes may not have the wildly eclectic outlook of los Hor\u00f3scopos de Durango,",
