            "Trust fund babies! Just kidding! Though, as I mentioned earlier, it is crazy expensive. It's good for students who don't mind taking out loans for their education. It's also good for someone who wants to explore different fields. Manhattanville allows students to take a broad range of classes so if you go into college not knowing what to do, you will be able to figure it out between classes and good advising.",
            "Enjoy your time there. Take advantage of the free tutoring and all of the other free events they offer at Manhattanville. Also, the advisors here are really supportive and know their stuff. I also recommend that all students get a campus job and are become familiar with the career development office. Bring a fridge for your dorm and bring a lot of frozen food because the food there isn't very good.",
            "Manhattanville is extremely expensive for a not for profit school. They do give a nice enough amount of grants but they never meet the amount of aid you need. They give you financial aid in the form of student loans and when you max out you are basically forced into either asking your parents to take out loans for you or to take a payment plan. The office of financial aid and student accounts are incompetent and archaic. They never pick up their phone and if you really need something done, you are going to have to do it yourself. That is the reason I left the school.",
            "I didn't enjoy Manhattanville. Outside of the music department I found there was little campus life. Events would mostly be empty except for the parties the college held. There just seems to be so much apathy and indifference in the school among the students. I also left because even in the music department, there aren't many opportunities for performing other than a small chance in the school musical and a lot of informal reviews.",
            "I learned so much from going to Manhattanville. The academic programs here are average; however, the music department is wonderful. Although the music program itself may be average the professors here are outstanding. The classes are small to begin with but being a music major, I was in even smaller classes. The professors there are awesome; however, there are always a few who ruin it for everyone, but I only ran into two or three after attending two years at the school."

Also, while in school, have your parents make payments on time in order to remain in school. You will not be able to dorm if payments are not made on time. For the year 2013, my parents and I have agreed that I commute because they could not afford a bill that was due a month ago since my mother has been unemployed since July 2012. My father has always filed taxes under my name as Head of Household and my mother's tax information has been recently added to my FAFSA, so I received a new financial aid award letter. Moreover, not only will you unable to dorm, you will be unable to access your grades, which are only available on the school website, or register for courses the following semester. Since a bill has not been paid in a month, I have a hold on my student account. In addition, if you were awarded as a Duchesne scholar, you must at least complete thirty hours of community service or your scholarship will be delayed and put you in more serious debt. Finally, it is very important that you at least know what you are going to study or have an interest of what you would like to study. You do not plan your major/minor until your sophomore year, so you have time to think. During my first semester, I realized that many students dropped out of classes that they did not need to take in a very short amount of time. I recommend that you take courses that you feel will benefit the career you want to pursue. It is okay to explore different areas because that is what college is about, but it is best to take certain courses that you feel will help you in the future., 109253=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 83096=For the first semester, I took three writing classes, which were First Year Seminar Writing, Creative Writing, and African-American Studies. I had a pretty tough professor for African-American Studies who gave me a lot of criticisms for my essays, but it taught me how to make my essays more argumentative, precise, and comprehensible. Many students had to revise their thesis statement before the professor approved it. In First Year Seminar and Creative Writing, I learned how to improve my grammar, punctuation, and make my responses briefer. Creative Writing and African-American Studies were classes that I was interested in and First Year Seminar is a required course. My point is although First Year Seminar and Creative Writing were courses of interest, they helped me become a better writer. I chose to major in Communications because my parents explained that writing was not going to help me earn enough money. Communications can help me in the Journalism field by not only writing papers, but be seen on television or be heard on the radio. I chose to take Journalism the year of 2013 as well., 60303=Mville begins its celebration in October. We celebrate together the 200 nights before our seniors graduate. We come together as an institution to celebrate our unity and our success through dance, theater, our legendary Halloween Festival, and of course the Haunting of Reed Castle!, 104336=Almost everyone recieves financial aid. The Duchesne Scholarship gives you $2000 to be involved in community service work. There are plenty of on campus jobs as well.}",

Tips for prospective students It is a very good campus with very good people. Also the activities and clubs, and volunteer activities are fun. The dorms in the campus look good, but the space can be limited sometimes, depending who you are rooming with. Bang for the buck This is a very expensive school to get into. I had to apply for a lot of loans, which I should stop doing because it is going to affect me in the future if i do not make the right amount of money. The food is good once in the blue moon, but when you have it again, it gets boring. The dorms",
