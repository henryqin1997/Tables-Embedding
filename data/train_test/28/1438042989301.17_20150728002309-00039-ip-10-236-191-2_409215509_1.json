However, the higher your attack speed the more actual damage tics the WW does. Each tic procs your LoH and has a chance to proc CM. The general idea is there are breakpoints in your attacks per second (APS) when the number of tics per WW increases. Again, though the number of tics increases, the total damage done per cast remains the same. This is the main skill for the CMWW build. It does a decent amount of dps but the main purpose is to proc CM to reduce the CD on FN, DS, and EB. Some people use other runes like Mistral Breeze but I recommend only using WW. Energy Twister \u2013 Wicked Wind Unleashed \u2013 This is also rarely used and often overlooked in favor of CR. This is the best rune to use when first starting out when you may be at low gear levels (low crit, IAS, and/or APoC). Time Bomb \u2013 This is a lesser used rune, but it is the highest dps rune for long fights (such as Ubers). Chain Reaction (CR) \u2013 This is the most popular",
    "textAfterTable": "Belt: same as shoulders Legs: same as shoulders or Blackthorn pants if you can afford it (aim for Armor, all resist, and/or physical resist in some combination, depending on budget) Bracers: 3-4.5% crit depending on budget, high int, all resist, and armor if you can afford it Gloves: 8%+crit, high int, resist, armor, and maybe vit if you can afford Amulet: same as gloves Rings: same as bracers Boots: same as shoulders, movement speed optional, honorable mention to Zuni boots if using an all physical weapon. Weapon: Sword/Wand/Dagger with IAS, preferably all physical damage, socket or crit damage optional, Int/Vit optional OH: Triumvirate with APoC, as high average damage as is reasonable for the budget. I\u2019d shoot for 9-10 APoC. Obviously higher stats are better, and I recommend using 3 APoC items until your APS gets over 2.5, but the build still works with 17 APoC. The defensive stats can definitely be higher, especially if you want to run higher MP. In my opinion, defensive stats are the most important stats to the build. The better those stats the easier it becomes to run Ubers and the higher MP you can push. DPS might make farming higher MP less efficient but you can make up for some of that by using a high dps version of the spec. In general, I prefer to have DPS the limiting factor",
