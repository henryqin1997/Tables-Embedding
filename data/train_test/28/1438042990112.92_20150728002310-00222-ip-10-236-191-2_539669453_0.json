    "textAfterTable": "Further Details The Breville Juice Fountain Plus and the Hurom Slow Juicer are two popular names in the juicing industry. Breville has a proven track record of creating quality products, while the makers of the Hurom Slow Juicer have promised to change the way people juice. Which product is right for you? Centrifugal vs. Masticating The Breville Juice Fountain Plus is a centrifugal juicer. This means that the machine juices fruits and vegetables by tearing it with blades, then spinning the juice to the edges of the machine. Filters between the blades and the edges of the juice pitcher separate the pulp from the juice. Centrifugal juicers work very quickly. A liter of juice can be produced in less than five minutes. Because these juicers use a spinning motion to separate juice and pulp, the juice becomes slightly oxidized. The Hurom Slow Juicer is a masticating juicer. Masticating juicers use an auger to separate the pulp and juice. Most masticating juicers use a twin gear system. Traditionally, this system tends to be much slower than using a centrifugal system. However, the Hurom Slow Juicer uses new technology, which allows this juicer to work just as fast as centrifugal juicers. Because this juicer uses a masticating approach, the juice has no oxidation.Both juicers work well for people strapped for time. If you are concerned about oxidation",
