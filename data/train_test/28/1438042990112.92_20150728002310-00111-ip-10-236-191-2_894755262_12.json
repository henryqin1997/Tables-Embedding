            "Leeward would be great for easy-going new college students. It'll be like a little stepping stone to get you ready for better colleges.",
            "Some classes were worth it while others definitely were not. I strongly advise students to always check ratemyprofessors.com to get an idea of the professor before they pay for their class.",
            "There's a lot of students to interact with in front of the library. Everyone's nice. Often, there are students playing soccer or volleyball in the field. There are a handful of events as well, including Free Food Day.",
            "The food is pretty good. The culinary arts students sometimes prepare some really tasty desserts and other fancy dishes that are sold in the cafe. They recently installed a Subways and they're also putting in a coffee shop in the library. There's a very expensive 5-star restaurant on campus as well.",
            "I have not lived in a LCC dorm. Though, I can tell you that living in Hawai'i is no joke - it's very expensive. Paying for college is A LOT of money, but added to the cost of living in Hawai'i.. it's ridiculous.",
            "The classes are easy, but it depends on the teachers. Some classes are not very good because some teachers don't care much or teach a lot.",
            "Leeward Community College would be a good college to help ease you into college life.",
            "At Leeward, a lot of the teachers are very laid-back. There aren't a lot of available classes. It's very easy-going and simple."

I started this process late in July, so had to wait until after the semester started to get any financial aid. Then go online to the Leeward website and figure out what major and classes you want to take. I'll say it again..start early!, 213401=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 206390=The food is good, but expensive, plus they only except cash. Except for Subway, (They have a Subway there obviously) But our school throws many events, and at these events there is always great food. For our Halooween party this past wednesday on 10/29/2014 We had cupcake trucks and local food trucks. I ate Pastele Stew with Gandule Rice, along with Red Velvet Malasada Cheesecake Bites. and it was only 15.00 dollars for the both of tjem. it was very delicious., 112250=Student ID is free and qualifies you for student discounts at the movie theaters and on the bus. Parking on campus is always hard to find, but if you're lucky you'll find street parking. Price per unit here is $101 for Hawaii residents (2012 price). $1212 for 12 units. I bought my books at amazon.com for around $200 total.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Campus Safety security always seems to pop up at inconvenient times... Clubs and Activities lots of cool stuff to do! Great for these types of students laid back, easygoing, shy people that need to ease out of their shell, and any ethnicity... this is hawaii, we get all sorts! Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus the arts and music building is a great place to hang out, really relaxed and there's always somebody playing music/guitar/piano/saxophone/whatever! Bang for the buck great learning and networking opportunity, and cheap too! What to do for fun lots of small events and student life activities. some nice spots to practice parkour as well if you're into it. Food and Dining subway on campus, the cafeteria's not that great though. Dorm Life no dorms here! Academic Rigor really easy and laid",
