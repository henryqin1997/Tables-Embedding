As this invention demonstrates, effective levels of hydrolytic stability require the presence of a select level of electron withdrawing chemical effect in conjunction with (and in addition to) traditional chemical steric hindrance factors., 44698=As the literature indicates, any series of reactions which produce the intermediate: ##STR1## will lead to moderate to strong chemiluminescence.

No. 418,956, filed Oct. 10, 1989, now abandoned., 53007=The functional electron withdrawing or electron donating characteristics of a group in an organic compound is conventionally measured relative to hydrogen. This relative ranking accepts that all groups on a molecule will provide some electron withdrawing effect, and distinquishes them by the nature of impact the group has on the molecule's performance. An electron withdrawing functional group, characterized by a positive number, will draw electrons to itself more than hydrogen would if it occupied the same position in the molecule. The opposite occurs with an \"electron donating group,\" a lesser electron withdrawing group which chemical convention characterizes by a negative number. Sigma para values (\u03c3p) are the relative measurement of electron withdrawing or electron donating qualities of a functional group in the para position on benzoic acid. See March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Edition, Publ. by John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y. (1985) at pp. 242-250 and 617-8. Tables of \u03c3p values for various groups can be found in Hansch et al., J. Med. Chem. 16(11):1209-1213 (1973) and Hansch and Leo, \"Substituent Constants for Correlation Analysis in Chemistry and Biology,\" Ch, 6, pp. 49-52 (John Wiley & Sons, New York 1979). The \u03c3p values reported in the Hansch articles are relied on herein in characterizing relative values for groups both in the meta and para position., 128333=This compound was converted to 2,6-dimethyl-4-nitrophenyl-2-[2-(2,6-dimethylphenylcarbamoyl) ethyl]acridine-9-carboxylate ##STR36## by Brewster's method with over 70% yield.

A solution of sodium cyanoborohydride (190 mg) in acetonitrile (5 ml) was added dropwise to the acridinium solution. This results in the bleaching of the yellow color of the solution. Stirring was continued for 15 minutes. Acetonitrile (100 ml) was added and the solvents were removed in a rotary evaporator. The residue as a suspension in water is extracted with ethylacetate.

Hydrolysis is more pronounced under acid or basic conditions. It is also recognized in chemistry that certain levels of hydrolysis can be inhibited by the inclusion of properly positioned bulky groups that chemically sterically hinder those linkages, see Nishioka, et al., J. Org. Chem., vol. 40, no. 17, pp. 2520-2525 (1975), Fujita et al., \"The Analysis of the Ortho Effect,\" Progress in Physical Organic Chemistry, 8, pp. 49-89 (1976), Morrison and Boyd, Organic Chemistry, 5th Ed., pp. 842-843 (1987) and March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed., page 240 (1985). According to March:, 118639=In the reaction, 4-Bromopropionic acid (5 g) was mixed with formanilide (2.25 g), anhydrous K2 CO3 and copper bronze (150 mg) in nitrobenzene (17 ml). The mixture was refluxed for 48 hours and the nitrobenzene then removed under vacuum. The resulting brown oil was reflexed in a mixture of acetic acid and conc. HCI (1:1). Extraction into ether, and evaporation of the dried ether solution gave a dark green oil which solidified on standing.

The mixture was evaporated to dryness and carbon disulfide (12 ml) was added. Aluminum chloride (2.88 g) was added in portions, with stirring, and the reaction refluxed for one hour. After removing the solvent, water was added and the product extracted into ether. A red oil was obtained which solidified on standing. (1.3 g, 76%). ir 1734,1677 cm-1 (CO) nmr (ppm). The spectra clearly showed the presence, in almost equal amounts, of two isomers. There is no need to separate them, as they both give the same product in the next stage.

The mixture was cooled in a CCl4 /dry ice bath under nitrogen. Isobutylchloroformate (35 \u03bcl) was added, the mixture was stirred for 3 minutes and N-hydroxysuccinimide (35 mg) dissolved in acetonitrile (2 ml) was added. After stirring at -20\ufffd C. for 15 minutes the CCl4 /dry ice bath was removed and the reaction allowed to warm up to room temperature. After 2 hours the solvents were evaporated and the residue extracted into ethyl acetate. The insoluble N-methylmorpholine hydrochloride salt was removed by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated and hexane (20 ml) was added. Cooling results in crystallization of (2,6-dimethyl-4-nitro)phenyl-3-(3-succinimidyloxy-carbonyl) propyloxy-9,10-dihydro-N-methyl-acridan-9-carboxylate.

Present embodiments, therefore, are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. TSH assays were carried out using the reagents from a LumaTag\u2122 TSH kit and substituting the above labeled TSH antibody reagent, comparable results were obtained to that obtained using instead a labeled TSH where the label is the compound of the formula: ##STR42## Anti-TSH antibody was labelled with the compound ##STR40## according to the method that is described previously for ##STR41## In the reaction, 250 \u03bcg (24.7 \u03bcl) of Anti-TSH antibody and 2\ufffd12 excess moles of the compound were added in 15 minute intervals. At the end the addition, and after purification, the labeled antibody was diluted to 6.25 ml. with the diluent buffer solution and used as stock solution. 100 ml of labeled antibody (stock solution) was diluted with 0.6 ml. of antibody diluent.
