It is understood that the invention could also be used with other payload intensity modulation techniques. For example, external modulation could alternatively be used. In this particular case, the payload modulation would introduce much less frequency variations in the optical channel signal produced and the optical channel signal would operate at a single payload carrier modulation frequency such as, for example, fopt1 or fopt2 around which the frequency shift \ufffd\u0394f/2 caused by the direct overhead modulation would be induced. It is to be understood that even in the absence of any substancial frequency variations caused by the payload modulation, the frequency shift \ufffd\u0394f/2 caused by the overhead signal can still be optically discriminated by the AMZI in accordance with the principles recited therein. As such, the AMZI would be designed as described above such that the overhead frequency deviation \ufffd\u0394f/2 can lie completely within a half FSR period centered around the payload carrier modulation frequency. The AMZI would also be designed such that the payload carrier modulation frequency is maintained on a quadrature point to position the frequency shift \ufffd\u0394f/2 within a high slope region of the AMZI output transfer functions and provide high gain discrimination of",
