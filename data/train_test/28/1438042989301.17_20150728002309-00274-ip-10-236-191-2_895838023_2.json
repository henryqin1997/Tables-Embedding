Entitled \u201cShut Up and Hold On\u201d, the tour will kick off on May 25 at\u2026, 7948=We know what would put the 'happy' in Happy Hour, and that's \"Drinks After Work\" with Toby Keith. The superstar's current single will also be the title to his newest album, he announced September 5., 8699=So how does Keith celebrate being the highest paid artist in country music? He continues to plug away by rolling city to city on his 2014 Shut Up & Hold On Tour. The trek, which takes its name from Keith's \"Shut Up & Hold On\" single, continues through the summer and is set to wrap in Philadelphia, PA on September 27th., 7722=All summer long Keith has been hinting that the song title might wind up as the album title \"because it's a big song.\" And that it will stand as the namesake to his 17th (!!) studio album just proves how big. The album, set for release on October 29, will include 10 songs. A deluxe edition with three bonus tracks is also in the works, including a version of \"Margaritaville\" that features Sammy Hagar, and the song \"Chuckie's Gone,\" a tribute to Keith's late bandleader and bass player Chuck Goff, who was killed in a car accident earlier this year., 5017=Then came September 11, 2011 \u2013 a day that not only changed America, but was the catalyst for a song that made Toby Keith a superstar. His wrote and recorded \"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue\" (also known as \"The Angry American\") in late 2011, and the song became both a rallying cry and a highly charged political statement as it ascended the charts. It sparked a considerable amount of publicity when Keith refused to appear on a nationally televised concert after being asked to soften the lyrics. He then had a very public feud with the Dixie Chicks over both the song and comments they made about then-President George W. Bush., 6122=Keith is currently crisscrossing the country on his \"Hammer Down Tour,\" which will take a break from its North American run in late October. One date \u2013 March 22 in Melbourne, Florida \u2013 is already on his schedule for 2014., 3650=What can be said about this controversial, incendiary, emotional, patriotic and proud Country Singer/Songwriter that hasn't already? Not much as his long list of awards (5 American Music Awards, 7 Academy of Country Music Awards) and Accolades (CMA Male Vocalist of the Year 2001, Billboards Country Artist of the Decade), # 1 Selling Singles, numerous television appearances (Comedy Central, Politically Incorrect) and passionate political beliefs not to mention (and he won't) his selfless work entertaining American troops around the World. These all reveal Toby Keith to be an American artist of unique integrity and powerful vision. Toby Keith is a one-of-a-kind Country visionary who is leaving giant \"bootprints\" wherever he strides and doing it his way. Get Toby Keith tickets to watch the action live., 5427=Always considered a dependable, workmanlike performer, Keith cranked out songs like \"A Little Less Talk and a Lot More Action,\" \"Wish I Didn't Know Now\" and \"Blue Moon.\" Then came \"Dream Walkin,\" \"I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying\" and \"How Do You Like Me Now?,\" which was the Number One country song of 2000 according to Billboard., 8343=The Academy of Country Music recently announced that Keith will be honored at the upcoming ACM Honors Awards show at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium on September 8. The other honorees are Dean Dillon, Kris Kristofferson, Carrie Underwood, Ronnie Milsap, Jack Clemant, Buck Owens, Bob Beckham, and Rascal Flatts., 4338=Keith has continued his steady pace ever since, and has weathered industry criticism and a split with his record label in the process. His rash of number one songs (\"As Good as I Once Was,\" \"She Never Cried in Front of Me\" and \"God Love Her\") has been peppered with other patriotic anthems like \"American Soldier\" and \"Made in America.\" In the fall of 2012 he released the album \"Hope on the Rocks,\" which was preceded by the single \"I Like Girls That Drink Beer.\" His latest tour, \"Live in Overdrive,\" opened January 19 and runs through early September.}",
