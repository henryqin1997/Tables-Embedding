    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. According to this invention, an alkali-soluble thermoplastic resin layer is formed between the temporary support and the photosensitive resin layer and separating layer being transferred onto a substrate. These layers can be transferred onto a substrate having an uneven surface without forming residual bubbles. The occurrence of stains caused by oozing of the thermoplastic resin layer while laminating can be prevented. Further, a monochromatic and multicolor pattern having an excellent quality and multicolor images can be formed by a simple method.
