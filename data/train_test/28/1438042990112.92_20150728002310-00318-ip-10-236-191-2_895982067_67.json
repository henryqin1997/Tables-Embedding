            "I have a $875 meal plan. So I could by the whole campus food, if I wanted too. Just joking. But that's a lot of money for food and unfortunately I couldn't get anything cheaper because that was the lowest meal plan available. They have great on campus restaurants I can eat from, so I love. They have Moes, Chick-fil- A, Nathans, Starbucks. I don't have to just eat in the cafeteria with this meal plan. It's awesome.",

I have had the pleasure of visiting the campus and it is very pretty. The dorms are nice and they have a lot for you to do on campus. The campus itself is easy to get around and is convenient for those like me, who don't have a car. So far, the faculty that I came in contact with are very friendly and helpful. I am satisfied with VSU so far and I look forward to attending., 226831=Relay for Life, March of Dimes, Car washes, Community service and soooo much more., 231751=YOU GO TO SCHOOL 5:30 TO 10:15 AND YOU GET YOUR CLASSES DONE IN 8 WEEKS. ITS A GREAT WAY TO GET AHEAD!!, 563444=I love the campus! Really small city though, not much to do. Weather is okay, it can get real hot in august/september.. I mean REAL hot., 336934=A big tradition here at Valdosta State is Breast Cancer Awareness, as well as No-Shave November. Join in on the many activities and become a part of a wonderful community., 437968=Wild Adventures is a theme park that is located about 15 minutes from campus. We even get to go one day during Homecoming week in October., 93016=We call November No shave November you can infer from that what you can, 257019=I don' t know much about the dining halls, but the food in the student union is great! Currently there is Nathan's and Starbucks to choose from, but we're suppose to be getting a Chick Fil A come August of 2012., 551269=There are a variety of food options. The dining halls, however, seem very repetitive. It always the same things in different forms everyday. Also, not too many healthy options except for the salad bar and fruits. Though, in January 2014, there will be renovations done in the hall to include more healthy eating options that seems promising.}",

If you really want to have the best possible college experience, manage your time wisely. Bang for the buck Valdosta State University is the total package. Finding one's way around campus is easy - most everything one needs is within walking distance. VSU's shuttle buses are also very convenient (the new ones have air conditioning!). There are also a number of choices when it comes to dining. VSU's meal plans will keep money in one's pocket. Not down for cafeteria food? VSU offers a number of retail dining centers including Chic-Fil-A, Quizno's, and Salsa Rico. Am enjoying being here Valdosta State was my first and only choice for college.
