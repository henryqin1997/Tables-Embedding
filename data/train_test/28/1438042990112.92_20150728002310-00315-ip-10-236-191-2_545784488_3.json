Click here for information about accessing landsmanshaften records at YIVO. contributed by Jerry Seligsohn This society is based on the Belarus town of Korelichi, 101 Km. SW of Minsk. Organized in 1904 it assumed the duties of a burial society as well as providing for loans to its members. It owned plots in Beth Moses and Mount Judah. The records deal with the dissolution of the society, maps of the graves of the deceased, ledgers dealing with financial records, dues payments, membership, loan funds and savings. Minutes books deal with meeting notes and financial matters. The stubs in a cemetery receipt book recorded burials. Please do not hold me to absolute correctness in the spelling of names as the names were inscribed by hand and often required some guesswork\u00a0 (Korelichi, Novogrudok uezd, Minsk gubernia, Latitude: 53\u00ba34' Longitude: 26\u00ba08') Korelitzer Society Belarus\u00a0SIG\u00a0 All\u00a0Belarus\u00a0Database\u00a0 Belarus Static Index\u00a0 Grodno\u00a0 Minsk\u00a0 Mogilev\u00a0 Vilna\u00a0 Vitebsk\u00a0 Belarus\u00a0Resources\u00a0",
