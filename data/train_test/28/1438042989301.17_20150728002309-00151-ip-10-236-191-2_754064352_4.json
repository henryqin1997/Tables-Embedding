The peak of membership was probably in 1915 when the IOOF had 3.4 million active members.[21], 22788=While several unofficial lodges had existed in New York City before, because of the charter relationship, American Odd Fellowship is regarded as being founded in Baltimore at the Seven Stars Tavern[13] on April 26, 1819, by Thomas Wildey and some associates,[1] who assembled in response to a newspaper advertisement. The following year, the lodge affiliated with the Manchester Unity and was granted the authority to institute new lodges., 26517=From 1860 to 1910/1920, also known as the \"Golden Age of Fraternalism\" in America,[4][12] the Odd Fellows became the largest of the fraternal organizations.[12] By 1889, the IOOF had lodges in every American state.[19][20], 21784=In 1789, the two factions formed a partial amalgamation as the \"Union Order\", (now known as the Grand United Order of Oddfellows Friendly Society (GUOOFS)),[11] abandoning all political and religious disputes and committing itself to promoting the harmony and welfare of its members. Then, as now, the Oddfellows has no religious or political affiliations and accept members from all walks of life regardless of sex, color or belief. In 1813, various lodges of the Union Order organized the \"Manchester Unity of Oddfellows\" which chartered the Odd Fellows in North America in 1819.[12], 24881=On September 20, 1851, IOOF became the first national fraternity to accept both men and women when it formed the Daughters of Rebekah. Schuyler Colfax, (Vice President of the United States (1869-1873) under President Ulysses S. Grant), was the force behind the movement. Though the term sorority was not yet coined in this year, it may be considered that the Rebekah is the first and oldest sorority in the world.[15][12] Both the Odd Fellows and Rebekahs have higher branches known as Encampments and Patriarchs Militant.[16][17], 25964=The American Civil War (1861-1865) shattered the IOOF in America; membership decreased and many lodges were unable to continue their work, especially in the southern States.[18] After the Civil War, with the beginning of industrialization, the deteriorating social circumstances brought large numbers of people to the IOOF and the lodges rallied., 60670=The American Grand United Order of Odd Fellows[14] is a fraternal organization founded in 1843 for black members.[30] Created at a time when the IOOF was primarily a white-only organization, the GUOOF obtained its charter directly from the Manchester Unity in Great Britain and the American IOOF organization had no control over it. Although still in existence, membership in the US has declined, due to the mainstream IOOF no longer being segregated and the decline in fraternal membership in general., 23634=In 1842, after an elementary dispute on whether the American lodges were to be involved in decision-making procedures, the American Lodges separated from the English Order and in 1843 changed their name to the Independent Order of Odd Fellows.[12] In the following years, lodges were instituted all over the country, first in the east and later in the west. Also in 1842, the English Odd Fellow Grand Lodges issued a warrant to an African American sailor named Peter Ogden from New York City; unlike Wildey and the IOOF, Ogden and the African American Odd Fellows lodges never separated from the English order, and they remain part of the Grand United Order of Odd Fellows (GUOOF),[14] still headquartered in Philadelphia.[12], 21184=In 1688 England, when the Catholic King James II was deposed in favor of the Dutch Protestant William of Orange, the organization split into two factions, the \"Patriotic Order of Odd fellows\" (based in the south of England and supporting William) and the \"Ancient Order of Odd fellows\" (based in the north and favoring the Stuarts). The \"Patriotic Order\" was followed by successors during a period of merger and re-organization by the \"Union of United Orders\" and then \"The Loyal Order\".}",

Also, the British \"Independent Order of Oddfellows, Manchester Unity\", and the IOOF have recognized each other inter-fraternally; members of the Manchester Unity and the IOOF can visit each other's lodges, and are welcome as brothers and sisters. 21st century Some branches of the order (i.e. some countries) have allowed women to join the Odd Fellows itself, leading to the Rebekahs decline in importance.

    "textAfterTable": "Symbols, lodges, officers, positions and degrees The most widely encountered symbol of the IOOF \u2013 on signage and gravemarkers \u2013 is the three-link chain (\"the Chain With Three Links\", the \"Triple Links\") with three initials, 'F', 'L' and 'T', one each inside each link, signifying Friendship, Love and Truth. The Independent Order of Odd Fellows in the USA has three levels of \"Lodge\": the Subordinate Lodge, the Encampment, and the Patriarchs Militant. In addition, there is a private club named The Ancient Mystic Order of Samaritans (AMOS). In Australia, this system has been implemented in a slightly different, but largely similar manner.[24] Advertisements Subordinate Lodge The Subordinate Lodge is the Lodge assigned to new initiates.[25] The initials of the subordinate lodge are \"FLT\" (Friendship, Love and Truth). Once a member has made their way through all the degrees and has had the 3rd degree (truth) bestowed upon them, they are entitled to hold an officer position in their lodge, and are also eligible to go on further in Odd Fellowship through the higher degree branches such as the Encampment and the Patriarchs Militant (aka the Canton).
