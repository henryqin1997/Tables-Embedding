            "On campus there is a police station. There are there 24/7 365. They are there on all holidays and whenever the school is closed. If you call 911 from a land line on campus they will come to you wherever you are. If you are taking a late class or on campus studying late and you happened to park some blocks away, you just have to call the number (483-1800) and they will escort you to your car. As well as the bus stop and wait with you at the bus stop. Also if you lock your keys in your car on campus they will retrieve those for you for and dollar as well as give you a jump if you need it. I feel very safe on campus.",
            "There are over 200 clubs on campus and its very easy to start a new one on campus. You just need two students and a Faculty member. Also some Michigan State groups that allow LCC students to join.",
            "Its great for all students the median age at LCC is 29. We have students coming straight out of high school and returning/new adult students. There are services for single parents, veterans, disabled students, international students. LCC is for every kind of student.",
            "One of the cheapest community colleges in the country and number 75 out of the thousands in the country. Has a ton of selective admission programs. When you become an alumni they will still help you look for employment if you would need that. FREE TUTORING! One on one and drop in tutoring. The campus is updated constantly. Always has the latest technology necessary for students. I can go on and on. It definitely worth it.",
            "Join a club. Use the game room in the library (Wii and Playstations). There is a park next to LCC for soccer and other outdoor activities. Have lunch in the Japanese Water Garden.",
            "Lansing Community College is undergoing major construction right now because of money received from a Federal Grant. The first building they decided to tear apart was the building that had the cafeteria in it. But there is a place that does Wraps and Pizzas still on campus. There is also Gibson's books and Cafe and Gibbys that has tons of foods options right across the street from campus. LCC is also located in downtown Lansing so you can walk a couple blocks and have multiple choices.",
            "There is no Dorm Life at LCC. Its a community college and that is very rare for that to be an option. There are cheap apartments all around downtown Lansing and in the Student Life office they have listings of houses and apartments to rent around campus, as well as listings of people that are looking for roommates. Its much safer than Craigslist so I would definitely check that out.",
            "It depends on the class and the teacher you work with. I've had classes that were an easy A but then I became lazy and got a low B. And I've had classes that I've had to work extremely hard for. Its college you have to work. Work hard and communicate with your instructors and you should be able to pass your classes.",
            "If your a new student prepare for the Assessment Test by looking over the material online. Register for Orientation sooner than later because the sooner you get it out of the way the sooner you can register for your classes. And Get Involved, LCC has over 200 clubs and sports that you can join. Its a great way to beef up your resume, network, and meet other students.",
            "Great place to go if your undecided about what field you want to go into career wise. I say this because its cheap than most community college and the staff and faculty really want you to succeed. I give this school a 9 out of 10."

Write down the course numbers so you can put them in the into the computer system fast, that will give you a better chance at getting the class you want, because they fill up fast. Also, go to ratemyprofessor.com to see which professors recieved good reviews and bad reviews. This was very helpful for me. Trust me, you do not want a bad professor, they can mess up your G.P.A. big time! If you know anyone has has previously attended LCC ask them which classes and professors are good to take. This was very helpful for me, because I usually ended up with great professors because of advice. You will be studying at least 2 hours a day. I didn't believe this statement when my high school teachers told me, but it's true! If you want that 4.0 grade your going better get used to tons and tons and tons of reading and note taking. You will get use to it after a while. I would suggest doing school work at LCC, because when I do it at home there are way to many distractions and I don't learn as much. When I do my homework at LCC I have no food to eat, no Facebook, and no T.V., so I am forced to do homework. If you take a writing class bug the heck out of your professor. I probably had my professor look over my paper at least 5 times before I turned it in. They are there to help you take advantage of it, it will improve your grade so much, I ended up with the blue ribbon award because of it. If you have a G.P.A. of 3.5 or higher join the Phi Theta Kappa Honors club. You get to do community service, meet a ton of new people, and it looks great on your resume'. If you have class in the afternoon you are not going to find a close parking spot. I would suggest having class in the morning. You need to get to L.C.C. no later than 7:50 if you want to make an 8:10 class, because there is usually a long line to park. When you get your Star Card (Card you use to park with) make sure you PUT MONEY on it! You pay $20 for the card but that doesn't go on the card. If you don't put money on it, the card machine in the parking ramp will eat it and you have to pay for a new one. Talk to your professors before or after class. This is a great way for you to get to know each other and for the professor to put a face with a name. It can also help you get a letter of recommendation from them which can be very valuable. If you want to work at LCC you have to apply online. Go to the LCC homepage and click on the employment link. It should take you to this website: http://lcc.experience.com/er/security/login.jsp, where you can fill out your profile and apply for various jobs that interest you. If you need to rent a book, print a paper, see a math/science tutor, or check out anatomy models, go to the Academic Resource Center (ARC room #455) on the 4th floor of the Arts and Science building. They are open M-TR from 8:00-9:00, Friday from 8:00-4:00 and Saturday from 9:00-3:00. This is a great place to study or get help from tutors for free! If you are interested in playing basketball I know the open gyms for the boys team is from 2:00-4:00 pm, and for girls from 4:00-6:00 pm. All open gyms are in the Gannon Gym which is on the 3rd floor of the Gannon Building. If you lose something just check with the Department of Public Safety (DPS), they are located on the second floor of the Gannon Building., 265092=Food is not easy to find on campus and it requires that students walk 5 or 6 blocks into Washington Square for the closest food. The only available food on campus is found in the vending machines. The Gannon building is under construction as I review this and there should be a cafeteria available by Fall 2014. The food I had here before construction was reasonably priced and tasted good--the personal pizzas are my favorite.}",
