            "Prescott College is the place to find adventure! There are several clubs, mostly student run, including a women's adventure club, ultimate frisbee, HUB (helping people of the community build and repair their own bicycles), Juggling, dance workshops, capoeira, etc. You will find students everywhere looking to get together to adventure the national forest, get creative in artistic endeavors, learn and experience film, go on plant walks, and the like. The institution is in full support of self-directed organizations that are conducive to having a quality experience outside of the academia.",
            "The Crossroads Cafe is an excellent place to eat. The employees are all very kind and hardworking. The food is delicious and healthy. The staff strives to offer fast and still quality service. The cafe is conducive for studying, having meetings, and enjoying a lovely meal during their chaotic school year. There is a day called, Community Lunch. Every Wednesday, anyone from the Prescott Community can come to the campus and get a free bowl of delicious soup and a piece of homemade, freshly baked bread! This cafe is truly unique. It's something no one should miss out on!",
            "I have not lived in the dorms but I have visited. They are very comfortable and are in a safe neighborhood right by campus. The rooms are spacious and feel like home. There are spacious kitchen and living room environments. They are well insulated and are sustainable for the environment. The dorms have solar heating and water catchment systems. There is a creek right next to the dorms, offering a peaceful place to find refuge from the chaos of their studies as well.",
            "This school does not have a traditional curriculum. Attitude above other things plays an influential role in the quality of experience at Prescott College. This school mandates presence, attention and mindfulness. It requires the student to actually care about what they are doing; what they are learning, what they are being evaluated on; what they are writing and expressing, etc. There is extensive hands on experience reading and writing, and in turn supporting the development of our skills as human beings.",
            "Be prepared to self-direct. Put yourself out there. Get involved in the community and the events. Use your voice. Everyone wants to hear it. This school is a place that thrives on improvement and change. Be open to the possibilities that can take place in Prescott, including the miracles that happen everyday if you are looking.",
            "Prescott College truly supports students' growth and success in the field of their dreams. This institution encourages students to independently and creatively prosper in their career of choice. This school facilitates the self-empowerment necessary to make a difference in the world, and for each individual to be the best that they can be."

The dorms are townhouses that have two singles and three doubles per house for a total of eight students living in each house. The roommate matching process was slightly flawed the first year but will most likely get better. The houses are lead platinum certified with solar panels on the roofs and efficient appliances. Each house has two fridges and stoves as well as a microwave. Students mostly cook their own food but have the option of getting food at the cafe on campus. Many students joke that these are probably the nicest places they will ever live, they are stunningly beautiful. Their purpose was to provide a sense of security for incoming classes and they did exactly that. They are fantastic place to hang out and brought the freshman class very close to each other., 112257=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This school is the best place for students who are okay with a lot of self-direction and creative inspiration as well as who appreciate the foundational, structural teaching of each subject. It's an amazing place for those who have the desire to reach beyond the classroom and into the universal possibilities of one's own mind as well as the mind of this extraordinary planet. Tips for prospective students The students that come and stay at Prescott College are those who are so passionate about they're doing. This school is meant for students who have the will and drive and self-motivation to make a difference in the world and who have their own dreams of making it happen. Prescott College will fully support and encourage people to attend this school and the ones that graduate and end up succeeding are those who truly want to be here now. Bang for the buck My experience while getting an education is crucial. If I\u2019m not enjoying school and the life that I\u2019m creating while attending school, why should I even be there? I understand that taking courses that I\u2019m not necessarily interested in or going to a college that might be more financially affordable has a great value, in that it progresses",
