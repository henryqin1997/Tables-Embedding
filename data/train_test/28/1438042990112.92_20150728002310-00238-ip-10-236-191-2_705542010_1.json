Megson is desperate to bolster his attacking options ahead of the new npower League One season and has been chasing the services of Neil Mellor throughout the summer. But with no clear end to discussions with the former Owls loanee in sight, the Wednesday boss could be forced to turn his attentions elsewhere. The Owls have also had a bid for Rochdale striker Chris O'Grady turned down, although they could return to Spotlands with an improved offer for the former Leicester City hitman. And Megson may now look to the loan market to bring in a new striker ahead of the big kick-off on Saturday, August 6. Norwich City striker Cody McDonald and West Brom hitman Chris Wood are two names that have been linked with a move to Hillsborough this week. McDonald, 25, is surplus to requirements at Carrow Road following the Canaries' promotion and City have made him available for transfer. McDonald knows the lower leagues well after hitting 25 goals for Gillingham in League Two last term and he's keen for regular first team football next term, whether that be a permanent move away from Carrow Road or a loan deal. Wood, a New Zealand international, had experience of League One football last term thanks to a six-month loan stint in helping Brighton to promotion. Megson could look to either, or both players to boost his attacking options for the new season. And with the new season moving ever closer, the Owls boss will keen to wrap-up a deal sooner rather than later - so keep your eyes on Vital Sheffield Wednesday for all the latest transfer news., 10370=Video - Wednesday's New Forward Joao - Who Are Ya?
