Meticulously constructed with attention to every detail, the Infinity Jersey features an ergonomic cut for total comfort when you're hunched over in the drops. Mavic's MicroVent technology uses micro laser perforations to increase ventilation in key regions of the jersey -- that's right, micro-friggin' lasers. Not to stop there, the Infinity Jersey also features Wick Matrix material designed to push moisture away from skin, so you stay dry and comfortable all the way up the canyon.",
