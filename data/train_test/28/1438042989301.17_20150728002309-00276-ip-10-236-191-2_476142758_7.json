The sleeve retention wire 1210 exits the second inner lumen 1314 at 1306 and pierces through folds in the sleeve 202 at 1304. The sleeve retention wire 1210 re-enters the second inner lumen 1314 at 1302.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{121662=The proximal portion of the gastrointestinal sleeve can be releasably secured within the container 2960 by a locking means (e.g., by an anchor locking wire) to ensure that the anchor does not emerge from container 2960 and deploy before the distal portion 2965 of the sleeve is extended to a desired location in the intestine 112., 116075=The compliance of the anchor 2900, allows it to flex radially over a wide range according to natural contractions and expansions of the duodenum 104. In some embodiments, the relaxed diameter of the wave anchor 2900 can be about 50 mm (i.e., about 2 inches). In other embodiments, the relaxed diameter can exceed 50 mm, being up to 60 mm (i.e., 2.5 inches) or even more. In either case, the wave anchor 2900 can be temporarily collapsed to about 12 mm (i.e., about 0.5 inches) for endoscopic placement., 121005=The distal portion 2965 of the sleeve is releasably secured to the leading or distal portion of the inner catheter so that as the inner catheter is advanced through the intestine 112, distal portion 2965 is also advanced. In this manner, distal portion 2965 is directed to locations in the gastrointestinal tract that are distal from container 2960 and into the intestine 112 (e.g., into the jejunum). Throughout this procedure, the outer catheter 2955 is held in place to ensure that capsule 2960 remains in the duodenum and does not move proximally into the stomach., 119314=The container 2960 holds or houses parts or all of a gastrointestinal implant device (e.g., a gastrointestinal sleeve). The gastrointestinal implant device includes a distal portion and a proximal portion. The distal portion includes a gastrointestinal sleeve and the proximal portion of the device includes a collapsible sleeve anchor for securing the device within the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., in the proximal duodenum). In some embodiments, the container 2960 holds or houses at least the proximal portion of the gastrointestinal device. In other embodiments, the container 2960 holds or houses both the distal and proximal portions. In still further embodiments, the container 2960 holds or houses the entire gastrointestinal device. Some or all of the sleeve portion can be folded and stored in the container 2960 with the sleeve anchor., 83718=The catheter system 1200 includes an outer sheath 1202 for storing the stent 208 in collapsed form, a flange 1216 to pull back the outer sheath 1202 and a sleeve retention wire mechanism 1214 for releasing a sleeve retention wire 1210 from the proximal end of the flexible sleeve 202 after the stent has been released from the outer sheath 1202., 39531=Obesity is an overwhelming health problem. Because of the enormous strain associated with carrying this excess weight, organs are affected, as are the nervous and circulatory systems. In 2000, the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) estimated that there were 280,000 deaths directly related to obesity. The NIDDK further estimated that the direct cost of healthcare in the US associated with obesity is $51 billion. In addition, Americans spend $33 billion per year on weight loss products. In spite of this economic cost and consumer commitment, the prevalence of obesity continues to rise at alarming rates. From 1991 to 2000, obesity in the US grew by 61%. Not exclusively a US problem, worldwide obesity ranges are also increasing dramatically., 123775=In some embodiments, the atraumatic tip or ball 2970 is dimensioned such that it can be pulled back through the sleeve. The inner catheter and outer catheter 2955 are removed by pulling the delivery device 2950 proximally, out of the patient., 82465=The length of the sleeve 202 can be sized to just pass over the ligament of Treitz thereby bypassing only the duodenum and proximal jejunum 106. By doing this, it may not be necessary to provide any anti-buckling mechanisms in the sleeve 202 since the duodenum 104 is not very mobile compared to the jejunum 106. Typically, an anti-buckling mechanism 1102 is added to the exterior surface of a sleeve 202 having a length exceeding the length of the duodenum 104 and proximal jejunum 106., 77097=In an alternate embodiment, the struts 602 can be formed separately and the strut intersections can be welded or attached by other means well known to those skilled in the art. Visually the struts form sections 604 around the circumference of the stent. Each section has a series of triangles with each triangle defined by one distal strut connection 606 and two proximal strut connections 608, 610. The ratio of the collapsed diameter to the expanded diameter of the stent is roughly 1:4., 61098=The duodenum has four sections: superior, descending, transverse and ascending which typically form a U-shape. The superior section is about two inches long and ends at the neck of the gall bladder. The descending section is about three to four inches long and includes a nipple shaped structure (papilla of vater) 114 through which pancreatic juice from the pancreas and bile produced by the liver and stored by the gall bladder enter the duodenum from the pancreatic duct. The pancreatic juice contains enzymes essential to protein digestion and bile dissolves the products of fat digestion. The ascending section is about two inches long and forms the duodenal-jejunal flexure 116 where it joins the jejunum 106, the next section of the small intestine. The duodenal-jejunal flexure 116 is fixed to the ligament of Treitz 118 (musculus supensionus duodeni). The juices secreted in the duodenum break the partially digested food down into particles small enough to be absorbed by the body. The digestive system is described in Gray's Anatomy (\u201cAnatomy of the Human Body\u201d, by Henry Gray) and \u201cHuman Physiology\u201d, Vander, 3rd Ed, McGraw Hill, 1980, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety., 116638=In some embodiments, the implant device includes a retrieval/repositioning feature. For example, the implant device 2800 includes a drawstring 2825. The drawstring 2825 can be selectively woven around the perimeter of the anchor 2900 through openings of opportunity in the anchor 2900. Alternatively or in addition, the drawstring 2825 can be selectively woven through dedicated openings, such as eyelets provided on the anchor 2900 or in the proximal sleeve 202. In operation, the drawstring 2825, when pulled, contracts about the perimeter of the anchor 2900 to reduce the diameter of the anchor 2900. Collapsing the anchor 2900 in this manner before removing or repositioning the anchor 2900 is advantageous in avoiding tissue damage, particularly when the implant device 2800 includes barbs., 114122=The wave anchor 2810 includes a compliant, radial spring 2900 shaped into an annular oscillating pattern. For example, the pattern is a wave pattern, such as a sinusoidal pattern formed about a central axis. The anchor provides an outward radial force, while allowing substantial flexure about its perimeter. Such flexure is advantageous as it allows for minimally-invasive delivery and ensures that the device will substantially conform to the surrounding anatomical structure when implanted., 38374=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/999,846, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,329,285, filed Nov. 30, 2004, which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/339,786, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,025,791, filed Jan. 9, 2003, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/430,321, filed on Dec. 2, 2002. The entire teachings of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference., 123086=Once the container 2960 is in the desired location, outer catheter 2955 is held in position and the inner catheter can be advanced further distally to pull the sleeve and anchor 2975 from container 2960. Optionally, the anchor 2975 is pushed out of the container 2960 using a means for displacing an anchor 2975 from the container assembly (e.g., an anchor plunger). In some embodiments, either the inner catheter or the means for displacing the anchor are used to hold the anchor 2975 in position, while the outer catheter 2955 is pulled proximally to release the anchor 2975 in place., 114662=The annular wave element 2900 can be formed from one or more elongated resilient members radially-disposed about a longitudinal axis and joined together defining a lumen along its central axis formed between two open ends. When implanted, the central axis 2815 of the anchor is substantially aligned with the central axis of the lumen 2820 (e.g., duodenum 104), allowing chyme to pass through the interior of the device 2800. Additionally, the compliant wave anchor 2810 minimizes trauma to the tissue by providing sufficient flexibility and compliance, while minimizing the likelihood of tissue erosion and providing a solid anchoring point to the tissue.}",
