A microheater/microsensor combination is introduced in this MEMS-based gas sensing device that is prototyped using a sputtered Pt (100nm)/Ti (20nm) thin film. A multilayer of SiO2/Si3N4/SiO2 is then deposited for electrical insulation between the sensor/heater layers, while the top layer is made of SiO2 thin film. A sensitive film used to detect the presence of hazardous pollution gases is deposited in the middle area (active area) of this SiO2 top layer. The material type of the sensitive film is determined based on the gas type to be detected. The mechanism of gas detection mainly depends on measuring the change in the electrical resistance of the sensitive film, associated with the absorption of a certain amount of chemical species present in the surrounding environment, relative to its electrical resistance in air. In actual operation, an array of gas sensor cells with different sensitive film materials is used to detect different types of gases; where, calibration curves are usually established to correlate the change in the electrical resistance of the sensitive film with the gas type being sensed and the maximum or optimum operating temperature used by the gas sensor. For the studied MEMS microheater gas sensor, the optimum operation of this microsensor is achieved when the maximum temperature of the active area reaches approximately 400 \u00b0C. A detailed description of the device fabrication procedure has been reported by Mo et al. in 2001 [12].}",
