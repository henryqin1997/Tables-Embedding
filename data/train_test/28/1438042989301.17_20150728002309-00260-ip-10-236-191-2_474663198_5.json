The procedure involved chorioretinal coagulation in which a laser beam positioned from without the eye was used to achieve fusion of the retina and the choroid. See, for example U.S. Pat. No. 3,720,213 to Hobart et al, and No. 3,703,176 to Vassiliadas et al, wherein the techniques consisted of introducing a laser beam from outside the cornea, and by employing the refractive media of the eye itself, the laser radiation was directed in such a manner that it was concentrated at a selected point upon the retina/choroid so that the tissues in a very localized area were congealed.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although this invention has been described in considerable detail, such description is intended as being illustrative rather than limiting, since the invention may be variously embodied without departing from the spirit thereof, and the scope of the invention is to be determined as claimed. Photoablative decomposition can be performed with many wave lengths, including ultraviolet and infrared wave lengths dependent upon the target chromophore absorbers. The 308 nanometer (XeCl*) excimer laser has proven extremely successful, while the 193 nm wave length of the ArF* appears to provide even a safer wave length with 248 nm (KrF*) and 351 nm (XeF*) excimers efficaceous on experimental animals as well as on eye bank eyes. Infrared laser radiations approximating 2.8 to 3.0 microns have also proven effective in all of the photoablative procedures set forth above. It is to be observed that the respective infusion and aspiration ports 68 and 70 may be reversed so that infusion could be effected through the hollow tip 62 whereas aspiration could be accommodated by way of ports 66. It is also to be noted that irrigation may be performed through the use of fluid or viscous materials. In FIGS. 7 and 8, I show another embodiment B1 of a probe whose fiber element 56 is hollow while being supported coaxially within its cannula 58 by suitable struts 60. The end of the fiberoptic element 56 protrudes beyond the distal end of the",
