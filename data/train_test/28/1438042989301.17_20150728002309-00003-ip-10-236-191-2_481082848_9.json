    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention herein is described by examples and a particularly desired way of practicing the invention has been described. However, the invention as claimed herein is not limited to that specific description in any manner. Equivalence to the description as hereinafter claimed is considered to be within the scope of protection of this patent. This is but a single example demonstrating the versatility of offset fixture 900 and the myriad applications in which it may be used to accurately place devices and materials in tissue of interest where a high degree of accuracy and control is needed. In its most general sense, offset fixture 900 is widely adaptable to deploy more than just a locator element. For instance, deployment tubes 910 and 920 may be used alone or in combination to deploy any number of general biopsy devices, localization wires, drugs, or other devices or materials in various combinations as known in the art. For instance, a radiolabled material, such as colloids marked with technetium, may be injected into the lesion area through one deployment tube 910, and a gamma-detecting probe may then be deployed into the tissue through deployment tube 920 to aid in excision of the so-labeled tissue. It is not necessary that offset fixture 900 be used strictly for tangential deployment. Offset fixture 900 may alternatively be configured for polar deployment of one of the locator elements along axis 930 in combination with",
