It's got the Boomtown Days festival in June, and nearby Carthage has it's Maple Leaf Festival in October, both of which are awesome to attend. Tulsa, Springfield, Branson, and Kansas City are only a few hours away, though., 10366=the food court just upgraded in 2012 by putting in a pizza hut express. overall the food is a little pricey.}",

So far, my teachers have been pleasant and willing to help and the overall atmosphere is comfortable. Am learning a lot Being a freshman, some of my classes so far have been common sense type classes (e.g. Oral Communication and the freshman orientation class), but classes that had some real substance (e.g. Sociology, Newswriting, American Literature) were great classes and I did feel like I was learning.
