In Mar 2013, when the FDA completed its re-inspection of the company\u2019s manufacturing facility at Hayward, it issued a new Form 483 with 12 observations. Impax is working diligently on the issues noted by the FDAand expects to resolve the matter quickly. However, the new Form 483 remains a major overhang on the stock., 62680=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system.

As per the terms of the agreement, Glaxo was responsible for the development and commercialization of the candidate outside the US and Taiwan.

We remind investors that a New Drug Application (NDA) for Rytary was filed in Dec 2011.
