            "there isn't really much to do in this little town of altoona but maybe go to the movies , blowing or out to eat.",
            "the food here isn't all its cracked up to be. it takes some getting used to. if you plan on living on campus and off you should get a meal plan , if you don't food in the cafeteria will be full price instead of half off with your meal plan",
            "depending on which dorm you choose to live in you'll be fine. the only thing that will probably be difficult is rooming with someone you've never met. generally freshman are roomed in the first two dorms oak and maple if you want a big room i suggest maple",
            "as a freshman you have to stay on the ball when it comes to your classes and homework. also try to keep in touch with your advisor they will help you out in the long run.",
            "students that plan to attend and that have already been accepted to psu-altoona , i recommend you buy winter cloths because its always cold on this campus.",
            "this campus is small and cozy if you're not really ready for the transition into college from high school. there isn't any kind of violence here. also the towns people , school faculty are nice , open and very helpful to anyone new here."

During this past summer of 2012 the cafeteria on campus was completely remodeled. It looks very modern, but most importantly the food is really good. There is a salad station, a pasta station, an all day breakfast food station, a sandwhich station, a grill station, a coffee/tea/milkshake station, a pizza station, and a chef's choice table., 87493=The food and dining at Penn State Altoona is not the best. Port Sky, the only cafeteria on campus, serves the same food every week and closes at 10:30 PM. There are no fast food restaurants on campus., 143745=When I first started college I gave birth to my 1st son in the middle of a semester. I had him on a Thursday and went back into school the following Tuesday to take a liver exam. I graduated with my Associates Degree in Nursing. I always stress to my children that education is never wasted. I decided about a year ago to go back for my BSN then on to my MSN. When I made this decision my oldest son was starting at PSU at University Park. I remember when I took him to college, he looked at me and laughed and said Here we are again mom in college together. My middle child will be starting college this fall in 2013. My youngest child age 16 is starting to make plans for when she graduates. She has 5 colleges she is interested in and would like to see one or two this summer. I raised my children with respect for education and to absorb all it has to offer because it will never be wasted. I currently work full time as a charge nurse for a hospital in my area. I have been attending PSU in Altoona and have maintained a 3.63 GPA. With over 18 years of experience in nursing I plan on getting my MSN and teach nursing., 230215=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Everyone has a place here even if we are a smaller school. Tips for prospective students It's only 45 minutes from University Park- no big deal at all. You can always transfer there your junior year as well like I am. Altoona is really great and the faculty are funny, nice, and super helpful. Be prepared to work: just because it's a smaller campus doesn't mean it's easier! I would suggest getting involved in clubs because you will make a lot of new friends that way :) Bang for the buck SO many great trips, clubs, sports, the gym is free, computer lab is free with your Student Activity Fee. You really get your money's worth here! I didn't at my first school, so I know first hand if I am getting ripped",
