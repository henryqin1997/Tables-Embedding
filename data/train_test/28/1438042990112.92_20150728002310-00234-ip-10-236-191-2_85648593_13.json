Tip is set for 4:45 p.m., 18306=Belmont started slowly chipping away at its deficit and made it 10-point contest following a jumper by Molly Ernst \u2013 and after Duke missed a lay-up on the next possession \u2013 Torie Vaught pulled down the rebound and Duke was whistled for a foul with 9:05 remaining. Following the personal foul, Duke was charged with a technical, which gave Ernst two made free throws to pull the Bruins within eight., 16979=ETSU used a pair of runs to take the momentum into the locker room, as the Blue and Gold rushed out to a 9-2 spurt in the opening minutes of the first half. \u00a0Then, with the Lady Bucs up two at the 6:57 mark, ETSU closed the stretch on a 13-4 run to lead by double figures at the conclusion of the half. \u00a0, 18723=After the Ernst free throws, Belmont received the ball and made it a 37-31 game when Carroll found Vaught for a lay-up with less than nine minutes left to play. The Lady Bucs silenced the run when Natalie Pickwell (Kingsport, Tenn.) made her only field goal of the game and Gordon converted a three-point play to put the Blue and Gold back up 10, 42-32, at the 7:10 mark., 14027=NASHVILLE (Feb. 18, 2012) \u2013 Despite leading for over 36 minutes of the game, the ETSU women\u2019s basketball team couldn\u2019t overcome a second half meltdown, as freshman guard Katie Carroll buried a three in the corner with 16.4 seconds remaining to carry Belmont past the Lady Bucs, 49-44, on Saturday night inside the Curb Event Center., 15447=With the loss, the Lady Bucs dipped to 7-20, 6-10 in A-Sun play, while also having their 14-game conference winning streak in the Music City come to an end. Meanwhile, Belmont enjoyed its Senior Day and moved its mark to 11-16, 10-6. Following the game, ETSU learned they punched its ticket to the A-Sun Tournament after Lipscomb lost to USC Upstate earlier in the day. However, the best the Lady Bucs can do is move from the eighth seed \u2013 which they are currently in \u2013 to the seventh slot, meaning ETSU will play its quarterfinal game on Wednesday, Feb. 29 in Macon, Ga., 17865=ETSU pushed its lead to 13, 29-16, when sophomore guard Shawn Randall (Orlando, Fla.) found Mitchell open for the fast-break lay-up at the 18:37 mark, while a jumper by Duke with less than 10 minutes to play gave the Lady Bucs a 37-25 advantage., 13824=Saturday, February 18, 2012, 19288=Despite scoring its final points with 3:46 left, ETSU still had a chance to take the lead with under a minute to play; however, the referees called an illegal screen on Mitchell as Pickwell was open for three with 45.5 seconds remaining.}",
