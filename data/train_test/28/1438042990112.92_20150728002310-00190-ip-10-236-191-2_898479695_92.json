            "The most fun available here are the various clubs around campus. Aside from that it's all work and no play.",
            "Their newly built cafeteria is a convenient and mildly inexpensive place to get food. The food itself is above most general cafeterias.",
            "They do not offer any dormitories.",
            "Their science courses should be taken seriously as they hold their students to a high standard.",
            "This is not your normal community college. It's definitely a step above others around san diego county and should find it more challenging.",
            "Affordable, challenging and does more than enough to prepare you to transfer to a 4 year university. Thanks to recent grants by California and the city it has some great new buildings and equipment making it a great place to be."

One thing grossmont knows is that many students are coming from high school, which means they are not used to hard work. Grammar is not a big deal, engagement is not a must, an most difficult classes allow curves which help out on transcripts but not as a student., 84561=the food and dining has changed a lot since i first started. i started school at grossmont college in the fall of 2005. things were not as they are now. they have recently remodeled and constructed a new cafeteria. but more than that, they have created a student center where students are able to go get food and still study. this new student center allows students in the food court to feel like they are home., 70371=As an out of state student tuition is of course a bit more expensive for me; however, I really can not complain. As a Veteran I will pay close to $2500 out of my pocket for 12 credit hours. I feel satisfied with the cost especially with the new campus being built., 262134=For only $1500 a semester, this is an amazing institution to start off at. The professors here are just as good at San Diego State and other big campuses, and a lot of the time work at different universities as well., 501810=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
