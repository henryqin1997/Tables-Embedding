The per capita income was $24,809.[6], 37319=As of 2010, the Phoenix Metropolitan area consists of Maricopa and Pinal counties, comprising a total area of about 14,600 square miles. Because of the size of counties in Arizona, even though Maricopa Pinal counties together contain nearly 4.5 million people, most of the area is unhabited, which gives the MSA an extremely low density compared to other major MSAs in the nation., 77761=In 2010, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was the 24th busiest passenger facility in the world and the 10th busiest in the United States, with more than 38\u00a0million passengers using the facility. With three terminal buildings encompassing 120 gates, more than 20 airlines offer daily non-stop flights to destinations throughout the world., 78234=The Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport started commercial passenger flights in 2004. The airport currently provides service to 39 destinations., 24884=As of the 2010 census, there were 4,192,887 people, 1,537,137 households, and 1,024,971 families residing within the MSA. The racial makeup of the MSA was 73.0% White (58.7% White Non-Hispanic), 5.0% Black, 3.3% Asian, 2.4% Native American or Alaska Native (virtually all Native American) and 16.2% of other or mixed race. 29.5% were Hispanic of any race.[5], 38195=The Phoenix Metropolitan is notable for its warm, desert climate. On average, the area receives about 9 inches of rain annually, with less than 1 inch of snow every decade. In total, the region will see about 32 days of measurable precipitation each year. The MSA is one of the sunniest major metropolitan areas, receiving 295 days of sunshine, compared to the national average of 205. The average July high is about 105\u00b0F (40\u00b0C), with the average January low being about 37\u00b0F (3\u00b0C), still above freezing. Bestplaces gives the Phoenix Metropolitan Area a comfort index[a] of 44/100, which is also the national average.[8], 54139=The Phoenix Metropolitan area has historically been the center of the state's economy. As with the state of Arizona, the area relied on the 5 C's (copper, cattle, climate, citrus, and cotton) for its economic growth and expansion. However, after World War II, the area entered the manufacturing industry, which spurred the growth of what would eventually be one of the largest urban areas in the nation. Currently, the two largest industries are manufacturing and tourism. About 10 million people visit from other States and Canada each year, due to the area's mild winters and long, sunny days. The technology and service industries currently account for almost 77% of total employment in the region.[13] As well as a strong tourism industry, the Phoenix area has a significant business sector. Several Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies have their international headquarters in the area, including Avnet, PetSmart, Insight Technologies, Apollo Education Group, and Sprouts Farmers Market. Other Fortune 500 companies with significant presence include Walmart, the state's largest private employer, American Airlines, which merged with Tempe-based US Airways, and Intel, which has a large regional campus in Chandler.[14], 17523=As for the 2010 Census, the two-county metropolitan area was reported to have a population of 4,192,887. Metro Phoenix grew by 941,011 people from April 2000 to April 2010, making it one of the fastest growing metro areas in the country. This also contributed to the entire state's exceptional growth, as the area is home to more than two-thirds of Arizona's population., 16974=The population of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area increased by 45.3% from 1990 through 2000, compared to the average United States rate of 13.2%, helping to make Arizona the second fastest growing state in the nation in the 1990s (the fastest was Nevada).[4] The 2000 Census reported the population of the metropolitan area to be 3,251,876., 75693=A light rail system (dubbed the \"METRO Light Rail,\" or \"Worm\") runs more than 20\u00a0miles from suburban Mesa, through Tempe and into Phoenix, traveling through the downtown area, offering access to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and linking two of the four metro area campuses of Arizona State University. The light rail began public operation on December 27, 2008, and it was projected to initially accommodate 26,000 boardings a day, or more than 8\u00a0million boardings in its first year. The Valley Metro light rail boardings has experienced constant growth since the beginning. In the year 2012, the light rail boarded just over 14 million people., 15441=The Phoenix Metropolitan Area \u2013 often referred to as the Valley of the Sun, the Salt River Valley or Metro Phoenix \u2013 is a metropolitan area, centered on the city of Phoenix, that includes much of the central part of the U.S. State of Arizona. The United States Census Bureau designates the area as the Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), defining it as Maricopa and Pinal counties. As of the Census Bureau's 2014 population estimates, the Valley had 4,489,109 residents, making it the 12th largest Metropolitan Area in the nation. It is also one of the fastest growing major metropolitan areas, gaining nearly 300,000 residents from 2010 to 2014, and more than 1.2 million since 2000., 76571=Many expansions to the METRO system are currently in the early planning stages, and two are under construction. The Central Mesa extension project, which extends the Main Street line 2\u00bd miles from its current terminus at Sycamore to Mesa Drive in Downtown Mesa, has finished construction and is planned to open on August 22, 2015.[27] The Northwest rail project is still undergoing construction, and is planned to open sometime in 2016. The project will extend the 19th Avenue track from its current terminus at Montebello Ave to Dunlap Avenue, 3 miles north.[28] Many more extensions are funded, with further projects being studied for feasibility.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Communities in Maricopa County that have their own street numbering systems include: One beneficial quality of this arrangement for unfamiliar travelers is that the major north-south arterial roads are rarely similarly named; the \"avenue\" arterials in the West Valley are all odd-numbered and the \"street\" arterials in the East Valley are even-numbered, with the exception of 7th Ave. & 7th St., both being major roadways running parallel and each one-half mile from Central Ave. This has been a source of confusion for some newcomers, who might end up, for example, at 91st Avenue and Thunderbird Road, when in fact they intended to go to 91st Street and Thunderbird Road, between 30\u00a0minutes and an hour away from one another depending on traffic. 1st Street \u2013 1st Place \u2013 1st Way \u2013 1st Terrace \u2013 1st Run \u2013 2nd Street Central Avenue 2nd Avenue \u2013 1st Dale \u2013 1st Glen \u2013 1st Lane \u2013 1st Drive \u2013 1st Avenue [17][18] Most communities in Maricopa County use the Phoenix-County numbering system, with the point of origin at Central Avenue and Washington Street. In the Phoenix-County system, north-south numbered roads labeled \"avenue\", \"drive\", and \"lane\" are located West of Central Avenue, while those labeled \"street\", \"place\" and \"way\" are located east of Central Avenue. Starting with 579th Avenue[19] in the west near Tonopah the avenues count down with approximately 8 numbers per mile to 19th Avenue and count up again",
    "textAfterTable": "Additional confusion can be encountered in Mesa in its urban core, with east-west numbered avenues and drives counting down from 11th Avenue north towards Main Street),[21] and numbered streets and places counting down from 11th Place south towards Main Street.[22] Then, in the eastern part of the city, north-south streets and places count up from 22nd St east of Gilbert Rd,[23] to 112th Street on the Apache Junction border.[24] Also, numerous trailer parks inside the city limits run their own contradictory variations of the numbered street system.[25] Most communities in Pinal County use the Pinal County street numbering system, whose point of origin is at SR 287 and 11\u00a0Mile Corner Road (the intersection of which is known as \"11 Mile Corner\"). Exceptions include: Community Point of origin Apache Junction Idaho Road & Junction Drive Casa Grande Ash Avenue & Center Street Coolidge Central Avenue & railroad tracks Eloy Alsdorf Road & Main Street Florence Butte Avenue & Main Street Queen Creek (follows Phoenix-County) Stanfield SR 84 & Stanfield Road Note that Apache Junction continues Mesa's convention of numbered street names by having the north-south sequence continue up from 112th St while simultaneously having east-west numbered avenues south of Apache",
