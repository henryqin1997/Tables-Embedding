            "This is where Le Moyne really fell apart for me. I saw NOTHING to do except for flyers to get baptized.",
            "The cafeteria was interesting with separate sitting areas based on the food style.",
            "The dorms were nice but, seemed rather dull. I didn't see many posters for stuff to do.",
            "Le moyne seemed to give enough work to challenge you without pushing you over the edge. Because it is so small there are no TA's and the professors seem willing to help outside of class..",
            "Le moyne is very small and quiet. To be honest part of it kind of felt like an advertisement for Syracuse university. However everyone was very polite and friendly."

    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students Le Moyne is for the student that is dedicated and wants to achieve a lot after graduation. Le Moyne produces some of the most successful graduates. They have a great education program as well. The teachers are also dedicated they care a lot about the students success. Tips for prospective students If your interested in a good small private school then Le Moyne is the school for you. It has the right number of students where you can know a majority of the students who go there and still have a lot of privacy. Am enjoying being here I am enjoying being at Le Moyne because from the minute you walk in there are constantly people around. Within the first week you have a lot of chances to get to know the other kids living in your dorm. Also the R.A's are always around to help you out and most are extremely nice. Am learning a lot At Le Moyne since it is a small school all the teachers know you on a personal level, and are very understanding. Teachers make sure that you are understanding the lessons and if you need extra help most of the time",
