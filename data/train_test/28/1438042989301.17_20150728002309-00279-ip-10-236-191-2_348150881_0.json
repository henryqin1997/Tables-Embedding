As a result, in 2013 the United States had the fourth largest proved reserves of natural gas in the world, at 308 Tcf. Russia had the largest reserves at 1,688 Tcf, followed by Iran at 1,187 Tcf, and Qatar at 890 Tcf., 48185=The rapid growth of shale gas has also increased scrutiny of the potential environmental and health effects of hydraulic fracturing. As a result, several states have taken action either to regulate hydraulic fracturing or to issue a temporary moratorium while they explore the issue further. In addition to state action, the U.S. Department of Interior proposed new rules for regulating natural gas drilling on federal lands in 2012, and the EPA has undertaken a Hydraulic Fracturing Study Plan to study the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. (Back to Top) \u00a0, 42181=While most of the world\u2019s gas supply is transported regionally via pipeline, global gas trade has accelerated with the growing use of liquefied natural gas.\u00a0 To maximize the quantity of natural gas that can be transported, the gas is liquefied at an export facility.\u00a0 First, the liquefaction process involves the removal of certain components, such as dust, acid gases, helium, water, and heavy hydrocarbons. Then, the natural gas is condensed into a liquid by cooling it to approximately -162\u00b0C (-260 \u00b0F).\u00a0 Liquefied natural gas (LNG) takes up 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state.\u00a0 Once liquefied, the LNG can be transported by tanker and regasified for use in other markets at an LNG import terminal.\u00a0 Between 2005 and 2011, the liquefied natural gas market grew by more than 70 percent, but the volume of LNG trade has been relatively flat for the past 3 years (2011 to 2013) at around 240 million metric tons (MT) (approximately 11 Tcf). In 2013, Japan was responsible for 37 percent of global LNG imports; its nuclear fleet has been temporarily shutdown as a result of the Fukushima disaster, and it is relying much more heavily on natural gas for its energy consumption. Global gas liquefaction capacity was 290.7 MT in 2013, and is expected to increase more than 100 MT by 2018 with Australia adding 62 MT and poised to become the world's largest exporter., 37172=Figure 5. U.S. Natural Gas Consumption by Sector, 2000 \u2013 2013 (Tcf), 36599=Natural gas use constituted about 27 percent of total U.S. primary energy consumption in 2013.\u00a0 Total U.S. natural gas consumption grew from 23.3 Tcf in 2000 to 26.0 Tcf in 2013.\u00a0 A decline in annual consumption in the industrial sector during this earlier portion of this period has almost been erased, while growth in the electric power sector continues - this sector grew at an annual average rate of 3.5 percent., 36119=Natural gas consumption made up a little more than 24 percent of total global energy use in 2013.\u00a0 The EIA estimated that world natural gas demand climbed to 120 Tcf in 2012, up 3.1 percent from 2011. According to the International Energy Agency, electric power generation remains the main driver behind global natural gas demand growth., 39410=Natural gas markets across the world are segmented, that is, natural gas pipeline systems connect distinct regions of the world, for example, the United States is connected to Canada and Mexico while the United Kingdom is connected to the North Sea and Europe.\u00a0 Natural gas prices are determined within these regional markets based on the available regional supply and demand patterns. \u00a0A general upward trend in world natural gas prices began in the early 2000s as demand for the product began to exceed supply.\u00a0 Following the global recession of 2008 \u2013 2009 a fairly wide spread in world natural gas prices developed (Figure 6)., 46850=Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Energy Outlook 2014, 45588=Source: BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2014, 46327=In the United States, shale gas production is expected to more than double over the next 25 years (Figure 9), and production of natural gas is expected to exceed consumption before 2020.\u00a0 As a consequence, the EIA in its 2014 Annual Energy Outlook Reference Scenario expects U.S. natural gas prices to remain below $5/MMBtu through at least the early 2020s., 25856=Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration 2013, 53381=Mail Address: Center for Climate and Energy Solutions 2101 Wilson Blvd., Suite 550 Arlington, VA 22201, 24751=An assessment of 137 shale gas basins in 41 countries suggest that shale gas resources, which have recently provided a major boost to U.S. natural gas production, are also available in other world regions. The 2013 study reported 6.634 Tcf of technically recoverable shale gas resources in 41 foreign countries, compared with 665 Tcf in the United States., 33825=The U.S. natural gas pipeline network is a highly integrated transmission and distribution grid that can transport natural gas to and from nearly any location in the contiguous 48 states.\u00a0 Interstate and intrastate pipelines deliver natural gas to local distribution companies, directly to some large industrial end users and electricity generators, and to interconnections with other pipelines.\u00a0 The network consists of more than 210 pipeline systems with nearly 306,000 miles of pipe, and 1,400 compressor stations that maintain network pressure and assure continuous forward movement of supplies.\u00a0 To support the seasonal peaking demand of natural gas, there are 414 underground natural gas storage facilities in the pipeline network for additional winter heating demand.\u00a0 There are three types of underground storage facilities: depleted natural gas or oil fields, aquifers and salt caverns. \u00a0\u00a0Additionally, there are 49 locations where natural gas can be imported or exported at the Canadian and Mexican borders. In response to earlier expectations of natural gas import needs, there are eight liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facilities in the United States, which are now underused.\u00a0 With the recent increase in domestic natural gas production, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has authorized three export terminals. One terminal in Sabine, LA is under construction and is expected to begin operations before 2017, while the others in Hackberry, LA and Freeport, TX are not yet under construction. There are dozens of other proposed and potential terminals that are in various stages of the permitting process. (Back to Top), 37480=In 2013, natural gas fueled 27.4 percent of total U.S. electricity generation. From 2000 to 2013, natural gas electricity generation grew at a faster rate than total electricity generation (4.9 percent per year versus 0.5 percent per year). This growth can be attributed to a number of factors, including low natural gas prices in the early part of the decade.\u00a0 Additionally, gas-fired plants are relatively easy to construct, have lower emissions compared to other fossil fuels, and have lower capital costs and shorter construction times compared to coal power plants.\u00a0 More information about natural gas fired electricity generation can be found on the Center\u2019s Natural Gas Techbook page., 30376=Currently, natural gas combustion-related emissions account for about\u00a021 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, while fugitive methane releases from natural gas systems (production, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution) represent 2 percent of the total. Globally, natural gas combustion accounted for 20.2 percent of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions in 2011. (Back to Top), 44089=Prospects for U.S. liquefied natural gas exports depend significantly on the cost-competitiveness of U.S. liquefaction projects relative to those at other locations.\u00a0 Over much of the last decade, lower supply expectations and higher, volatile prices prompted new investments in U.S. natural gas import and storage infrastructure.\u00a0 Since 2000, North America\u2019s import capacity has expanded from approximately 2.3 Bcf/day to 22.7 Bcf/day, around 35 percent of the United States\u2019 average daily requirement.\u00a0 Yet as of 2009, U.S. consumption of imported liquefied natural gas was less than 0.3 Bcf/day, leaving most of this capacity unused. The ability to use and repurpose existing U.S. import infrastructure\u2014pipelines, processing plants, storage and loading facilities\u2014will help reduce total costs relative to new facilities.\u00a0 While liquefied natural gas makes up a small portion of U.S. imports, it is important in other parts of the world. The majority of the gas trade in the Asia Pacific region is in the form of LNG imports to Japan, South Korea, China, India and Taiwan from Qatar, Malaysia, Australia, and Indonesia (Figure 8). (Back to Top), 46757=Figure 9. U.S. Natural Gas Production, 1990 \u2013 2040 (Tcf), 47088=EIA\u2019s International Energy Outlook 2013 projects world LNG trade to nearly double from 2010 to 2040, and the United States is expected to become a net exporter of LNG in 2016., 40386=Prices in the U.S. and Canadian markets have plummeted due to the abundant supply of North American shale gas.\u00a0 Asian markets have seen higher gas prices due to increasing demand in China, South Korea and Japan.\u00a0 Europe has also seen higher prices as a result of increased demand as well as periodic Russian supply disruptions from 2005 \u2013 2009., 31473=As at the end of 2012, the Potential Gas Committee estimated that the total assessed U.S. shale gas resource was 1,073 Tcf. This represented approximately 48 percent of the United States' total traditional gas resource of 2,225 Tcf. Total technically recoverable resources, which also include coalbed gas resource of 158 Tcf, were 2,384 Tcf. This represents an increase of around 25 percent from the previous assessment in 2010., 43719=With surplus domestic supply and substantially higher prices in other regional markets, several U.S. companies have applied to the relevant agencies for permission to export liquefied natural gas with Houston-based Cheniere Energy being the first company to win approval for its Sabine Pass facility in 2012, followed by Freeport LNG and Cameron LNG., 33128=Development of fracking technology has created the present boom in natural gas production. This technology was initially funded in the 1970s through the U.S. Department of Energy and with more than 20 years of federal tax credits (1980 \u2013 2002). (Back to Top), 40760=Supply and demand responses, the seasonal nature of demand (residential winter heating or summer cooling through increased electric power generation requirements), or cold weather and hurricane-driven supply disruptions, have all contributed to natural gas price volatility in the United States in the last decade (Figure 7).\u00a0 In 2001, several years of declining productive capacity and increasing demand resulted in a sharp winter price spike.\u00a0 Prices spiked again in 2005 in the wake of hurricanes Rita and Katrina, which temporarily curtailed supplies from the Gulf of Mexico. \u00a0Prices remained high relative to historic norms, peaking along with other energy commodities in 2008.\u00a0 Since then, average annual wellhead prices in the U.S. have gone down. \u00a0Two factors \u2013 an abundance of shale gas and the slow pace of economic recovery following the recession \u2013 have contributed to sustained low prices. (Back to Top), 45856=According to the EIA\u2019s International Energy Outlook, natural gas is expected to be the world\u2019s fastest growing fossil fuel, with consumption increasing at an average rate of 1.5 percent per year to 2040.\u00a0 Growth in natural gas is expected to occur in every region and is most concentrated in developing countries, where demand increases more than twice as fast as in developed countries., 32019=Total domestic dry natural gas production in 2013 was 24.3 Tcf. This figure represents the remainder from a total gross withdrawal of 30.2 Tcf of product, after venting and flaring, removal of non-hydrocarbon gases such as CO2, removal of natural gas liquids and other losses.\u00a0 From 2007 to 2012, shale gas production grew at an annual rate of nearly 52 percent.\u00a0 Natural gas is produced in 33 states and in the Gulf of Mexico. According to the EIA, Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Colorado and New Mexico account for 83.3 percent of U.S. production in 2012.\u00a0 The geography of U.S. natural gas production is changing with an increasing percentage of production coming from other states like Pennsylvania and Arkansas. From 2010 to 2012, natural gas production increased fourfold in Pennsylvania; the state was responsible for more than 9 percent of U.S. production in 2012.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Table 1: Fossil Fuel Emissions Levels (Pounds per Billion Btu of Energy Input) Compared to other fossil fuels, natural gas is considered relatively \u201cclean\u201d because when it is burned it releases fewer harmful pollutants. Compared to coal or oil, natural gas combustion releases smaller quantities of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide. The combustion of natural gas also emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal.\u00a0 However, methane itself is a potent GHG, more than 20 times more powerful in terms of its heat-trapping ability than CO2, though it is shorter lived in the atmosphere.\u00a0 Sources of methane emissions include landfills and coal mines as well as digestion by cows and other ruminant animals. Emissions from equipment leaks, process venting and disposal of waste gas streams are known as fugitive emissions. Environmental Impact In the residential buildings sector, almost 95 percent of natural gas is used for space and water heating, with cooking and clothes drying making up the remainder. In the commercial buildings sector, space and water heating comprise the majority of natural gas use (63 percent), but other uses \u2013 including cogeneration (the use of natural gas to generate electricity and useful heat), also known as combined heat and power \u2013 compose one-third of natural gas usage.
