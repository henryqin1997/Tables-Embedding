The TNG Season 1 Blu-ray was released on 24 July 2012 and the TNG Season 2 Blu-ray is announced for the 4 December 2012., 99312=After several months of speculation and partial confirmation, on 28 September 2011 (the 24th anniversary of the series premiere), StarTrek.com announced that The Next Generation would be remastered in 1080p high-definition, for release on Blu-ray Disc and eventual syndication, starting in 2012., 91379=Star Trek: The Next Generation was billed initially as being set 78 years after the days of the original USS Enterprise. [1] (page 16) However, after the series' first season was established as being set in the year 2364, this reference became obsolete as dates were then able to be set for the original series and the four previous films. When this happened, it was established that the events of the original series were about a hundred years before the events of TNG. With TNG's first season being set in 2364, 78 years prior would have been 2286. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home partly takes place during this year along with the shakedown cruise of the USS Enterprise-A., 8576=Star Trek: The Next Generation (often abbreviated to TNG) is the second live-action Star Trek television series, set in the 24th century. Like its predecessor, it was created by Gene Roddenberry. Produced at Paramount Pictures, it aired in first-run syndication (by Viacom in the US) from September 1987 to May 1994. The series led to two spin-offs in the \"TNG era\": Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (which it ran alongside during its final two seasons) and Star Trek: Voyager., 90664=According to issues of Star Trek: The Official Fan Club Magazine from early 1987, TNG was originally planned to be set in the 25th century, 150 years after the original series and the Enterprise would have still been the featured ship, but it would have been the Enterprise NCC-1701-G. Gene Roddenberry ultimately changed the timeline to mid-24th century, set on board the Enterprise NCC-1701-D, as an Enterprise-G would have been the eighth starship to bear the name and that was too many for the relatively short time period that was to have passed., 14009=Four of the Star Trek motion pictures continued the adventures of the TNG cast after the end of the series in 1994. Star Trek Generations served to \"pass the torch\" from the Original Series cast, who had been the subject of the first six motion pictures, by including crossover appearances from William Shatner, James Doohan, and Walter Koenig; it also featured the destruction of the USS Enterprise-D. Star Trek: First Contact, released two years later, was the first of the motion pictures to solely feature the TNG cast, transferred aboard the new USS Enterprise-E and engaging with one of their deadliest enemies from the television series, the Borg. Star Trek: Insurrection followed in 1998, continuing certain character arcs from the series. In 2002, Star Trek Nemesis brought some of these character arcs and plot threads to a seemingly definite conclusion, although some cast members expressed hope that future movies would yet pick up the story. Regardless, a new generation of actors appeared in 2009's Star Trek, which created an alternate reality and returned the focus back to James T. Kirk and Spock., 93475=Andrew Probert was first hired by Roddenberry in 1978. However, not until 1986, when Roddenberry was preparing to launch a new show, entitled Star Trek: The Next Generation, did he call upon Probert to take a lead design role. Everything had to be rethought, imagined, planned and redesigned. As the vision evolved in the designers' minds, the evolution was charted in successive sketches and paintings.}",
