Referring now to FIG. 25, an alternative mounting platform 94b-12 is coupled to the latch 41-12 including the resilient backstop portion 126b-12. As shown, the mounting platform 94b-12 does not include mounting fingers coupled to the ends of the rectangular support plate 106b-12. Rather, a first and a second support plate barb 134b-12 and 136b-12 (not shown), respectively, are provided to retainably mount the latch 41-12 to the connector housing 31-12. As shown in FIG. 26, the respective second housing end 33-12 defines a rectangular support plate mounting slot 138b-12 in which the respective rectangular support plate 106b-12 slidably engages. Respective first and second support plate barbs 134b-12 and 136b-12 engage the inner walls of the mounting slot 138b-12 to securely retain the latch 41-12 to the housing 31-12. FIG. 24 illustrates the connector assembly 30-11 with the first and second latches 40-11 and 41-11 mounted to the housing",
