During the Ch\u016bnin Exams, she can measure the perfect distance for attack or defence between herself and her opponent.[9] Because of its heaviness and size, she found another way to wield the Jidanda by using explosive tags to lift it and use it as a defence.[11] Tenten manipulating the Jidanda's movement with explosive tags. Intelligence Edit While a weapons specialist, Tenten is well-versed in taijutsu, being able to defeat several assassins in combat during the Cursed Warrior Extermination Mission. She is also the fastest kunoichi of her age group. Her speed of movement and recovery is such that she could quickly regain consciousness after being hit by Raiga Kurosuki's lightning-based attack, in time to evade the latter's point-blank range",

After Neji asked Sasuke to present who he was, Sasuke didn't answer, to which Tenten giggled to herself, thinking it was cute. During the written exam, Tenten assisted Lee in gathering answers. Using strings to adjust hidden mirrors on the ceiling, Tenten allowed Lee to see his fellow ninja's answers and copy them without being caught. To know that Lee saw the answer she sneaked in for him, Lee had to adjust his forehead protector. She was seen again during the second",
