            "Description",
            "SOLID-LIQUID SEPARATOR - An activated carbon adder adds activated carbon to raw water before flocculating sedimentation, to adsorb suspended matter contained in raw water, a liquid cyclone is adapted to separate activated carbon with suspended matter adsorbed thereon, from raw water containing activated carbon, an inflow line is connected with the liquid cyclone so as to cause raw water containing activated carbon before flocculating sedimentation to flow into the liquid cyclone and swirl therein, an activated carbon discharge line discharges activated carbon spun down out of raw water containing activated carbon in the liquid cyclone, from the liquid cyclone, and a pretreated water discharge line discharges raw water having got rid of activated carbon as pretreated water from the liquid cyclone, allowing for a reduced amount of chemicals to be used, with production of a reduced amount of sludge.",
            "Water-Purification Pretreatment System - A water-purification pretreatment system removes raw water of suspended solids heavier in specific gravity than water before a water-purification treatment of raw water taken from a water source and the system includes a liquid cyclone configured for raw water to inflow thereto and to be swirled inside thereof to separate from raw water suspended solids heavier in specific gravity tan water, an inflow line connected with the liquid cyclone for raw water to be supplied to the liquid cyclone and configured for raw water being supplied to swirl inside the liquid cyclone, and an outflow line configured for raw water having suspended solids separated therefrom to outflow as pretreated water from the liquid cyclone, allowing for a reduced load on a treatment of solid suspended solids as a water treatment for water purification plants.",
            "SOLID-LIQUID SEPARATOR - A liquid cyclone is configured for inflowing raw water containing impurities as targets of collection to be forced to swirl inside to spin down impurities contained in raw water, an inflow pipe is connected with an upper portion of the liquid cyclone to supply the liquid cyclone with raw water, and configured for supplied raw water to be forced to swirl inside the liquid cyclone, a connecting portion is connected with a lower portion of the liquid cyclone, and configured with a discharge port to discharge spun down impurities from the liquid cyclone, an impurity collector is connected to the liquid cyclone with the connecting portion in between, and configured to collect impurities discharged from the liquid cyclone, an obstacle is disposed in or near the discharge port, and cold to prevent impurities collected in the impurity collector from backing up into the liquid cyclone, and an outflow pipe is connected with a top portion of the liquid cyclone, and configured for raw water having got rid of impurities to outflow as treated water from the liquid cyclone; whereby impurities separated from raw water is prevented from being re-mixed in raw water, allowing for an enhanced separation performance.",
