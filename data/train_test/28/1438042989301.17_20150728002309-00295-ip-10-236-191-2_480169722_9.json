No. 5,352,712, issued Oct. 4, 1994 (a continuation-in-part of the aforedescribed application) teaches that compositions analogous to those taught in its parent, but bearing any reactive end groups which do not adversely effect the cured coatings prepared from them, may be used. Each of these applications are expressly incorporated by reference herein., 114523=This coating composition, before cure, had the following temperature/viscosity profile, measured using a Brookfield viscometer, model LVT, 6 rpm, #34 spindle: 5430 cps at 25\ufffd C.; 4310 cps at 28\ufffd C.; 3440 cps at 30\ufffd C.; 2310 cps at 35\ufffd C.; and 1520 cps at 40\ufffd C. The liquid composition had a refractive index of 1.4856 at 24.6\ufffd C. and a density of 8.89 lb/gal (1.07g/cc)., 89191=The uncured coating composition had the following viscosity values at these temperatures, measured by a Brookfield viscometer, model LVT, 6 rpm, #34 spindle: 4250 cps at 25\ufffd C.; 3360 cps at 28\ufffd C.; 2810 cps at 30\ufffd C.; 1940 cps at 35\ufffd C.; and 1305 cps at 40\ufffd C. The uncured composition had a refractive index of 1.4870 at 24.2\ufffd C. and a density of 8.66 lb/gal (1.04 g/cc)., 36931=Still other properties exist which are desirable in both primary and secondary coatings. For example, fiber manufacturers are motivated to coat the fibers as rapidly as possible to attain the economy of faster cure speeds, as these result in higher line speeds. The cure speeds of coating materials may be determined by constructing a UV dose versus modulus curve. The lowest UV dose at which the coating modulus exhibits dose independence is considered its cure speed. There is therefore a demand for faster curing coatings; for example, high line speeds are obtained with primary and secondary coatings which may be applied wet-on-wet and simultaneously ultraviolet light-cured. One way of doing this is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,830, issued Oct. 2, 1984 to Carl R. Taylor, which patent is expressly incorporated herein by reference., 95784=This coating composition, before cure, had the following temperature/viscosity profile, measured by a Brookfield viscometer, model LVT, 6 ppm, #34 spindle: 4720 cps at 25\ufffd C.; 3780 cps at 28\ufffd C.; 3070 cps at 30\ufffd C.; 2060 cps at 35\ufffd C.; and 1385 cps at 40\ufffd C.

Its density is 8.75 pounds per gallon; its theoretical functionality is 2.5 and its theoretical molecular weight is 1700. When cured it has a tensile strength of 3150 psi; a tensile elongation of 83%, and a glass transition temperature of 48\ufffd C., 99708=Before cure, the coating composition of this Example had the following temperature/viscosity profile, measured by Brookfield viscometer, model LVT, 6 rpm, #34 spindle: 25\ufffd C.:5440 cps; 28\ufffd C.:4280 cps; 30\ufffd C.:3490 cps; 35\ufffd C.:2370 cps; and 40\ufffd C.:1085 cps. The uncured composition had a refractive index of 1.4852 at 26.0\ufffd C. and a density of 8.69 lb/gal (1.04 g/cc)., 40494=There have recently been developed optical fiber coats which are very moisture resistant and which have excellent thermal, hydrolytic and oxidative stability, Applicant's U.S. Ser. No. 742,531, filed Aug. 8, 1991 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,531, issued Sep. 8, 1992 (a continuation application of U.S. Ser. No. 350,239, filed May 11, 1989), teaches coating compositions prepared from acrylate or methacrylate based components, e.g., a primary coating including, inter alia, an acrylated urethane oligomer based on a hydrocarbon polyol; an alkyl acrylate monomer; and a photoinitiator and a secondary coating including a polyester and/or polyether based acrylated urethane oligomer; an acrylated compound capable of adjusting viscosity; and a photoinitiator., 56392=(D) Uvithane\ufffd ZL-1178 oligomer from Morton Thiokol, Inc., Morton Chemical Division, Princeton, N.J., polyether based aliphatic urethane acrylate. This oligomer has a viscosity of 55-75 poises at 120\ufffd F. and 700-800 poises at 78\ufffd F. and, when cured neat, has a tensile strength of 325 psi and an ultimate elongation of 45%., 52897=The molar ratio of the polyol, diisocyanate and endcapping monomer is preferably approximately 1:2:2., 108199=This composition had a viscosity of 2620 cps at 25\ufffd C. When drawn down and cured as in earlier Examples, a cure ratio of 68.2%, a gasoline swelling value of 35.4%, and peel test values at 50% relative humidity of 105.0 grams and at 95% relative humidity of 45.4 grams were measured., 29006=This is a division of application Ser. No. 08/454,585, Filed May 31, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,791, which was a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/341,172, filed Nov. 16, 1994, now U.S. Pat.

Its density is 8.91 pounds per gallon; its theoretical functionality is 2 and its theoretical molecular weight is 1500. When cured it has a tensile strength of 1200 psi; a tensile elongation of 87% and a glass transition temperature of -27\ufffd C., 74471=An optional secondary coating may be applied atop the primary coatings of the invention. Suitable secondary coatings are those which are known in the art, including but not limited to those disclosed in copending application U.S. Ser. No. 868,933 filed Apr. 16, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,712, issued Oct. 4,1994 (incorporated herein by reference).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While the invention has been disclosed in this patent application by reference to the details of preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood that this disclosure is intended in an illustrative rather than in a limiting sense, as it is contemplated that modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art, within the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. These coatings, when cured, possess excellent thermal, hydrolytic and oxidative stability over the long term, as predicted by accelerated aging tests at increased temperature and humidity, and are resistant to penetration of both water and organic solvents in order to protect the integrity of the underlying fibers. The primary coatings of the present invention, then, have several important qualities which make optical fibers coated with them useful for many applications and particularly suitable in local area networks for fiber-to-the-home uses. CONCLUSION This composition had a viscosity of 4230 cps at 25\ufffd C., and performed well, before thermal aging, as well: it had a 2.5% modulus of 214.1 psi (when cured in air at 0.7 J/cm2); swelled 28.2% when soaked in gasoline; and required 85.0 grams and 39.6 grams of force at 50% and 95% relative humidity, respectively, to peel. However, upon thermal aging at 125\ufffd C. for only 3 days, an exudate was noted, indicating thermal instability. A composition was made up which was identical",
