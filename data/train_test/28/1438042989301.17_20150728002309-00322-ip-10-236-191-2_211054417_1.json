The researcher sought to examine variables that cause vocational teachers to experience stress in their teaching occupations and to evaluate the effects of these related stressors. This research evaluated the relationships between school systems and vocational teacher stress, teacher internal characteristics and vocational teacher stress, and students and vocational teacher stress. It also analyzed vocational teacher stress using a proposed causal model that was developed using the literature on teacher stress as a conceptual framework. The model attempted to examine the linkages that exist among vocational teacher stress, school systems, teacher internal characteristics, and students. Role ambiguity, role conflict, school stress, task stress, supervisory support, nonparticipation, peer support, role overload, and management style were the areas identified in the literature that could be used as indicators of the school systems category. Role preparedness, job satisfaction, life satisfaction, illness symptoms, locus of control, and self esteem were the concepts identified in the literature that could be used as the variables associated with teacher internal characteristics. Class size, student learning, and student behavior were the three areas identified in the literature as student related variables. Files",
