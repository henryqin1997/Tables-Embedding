Intel also uses the term \"conflict-free\" in a broader sense to refer to suppliers, supply chains, smelters and refiners whose sources of conflict minerals do not finance conflict in the DRC or adjoining countries. Intel processors manufactured before January 1, 2013 are not confirmed conflict free. The conflict free designation refers only to product manufactured after that date. For Intel Boxed Processors, the conflict free designation refers to the processor only, not to any additional included accessories, such as heatsinks/coolers.}",
