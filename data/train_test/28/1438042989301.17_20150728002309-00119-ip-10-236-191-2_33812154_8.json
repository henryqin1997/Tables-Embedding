Tuesday, March 4th, 2014 Agile India 2014 Conference \u2013 Final Attendees Profile Posted in Agile, agile india, Community, Conference | No Comments \u00bb P.S: Every week, I get at least 10 emails from people asking me about Agile India membership. I don\u2019t get it! Why do you want to give me your hard-earned money for no good reasons? The current membership program has no real benefits and hence we\u2019ve closed it. I\u2019m currently working on a new membership model for Agile India, which will provide real membership benefits. At that point you can justify spending money on membership. If you have ideas on how we should structure the membership program, please drop me a note. Good ideas win free membership. Stay tuned for more\u2026 Agile India was happy to host the world\u2019s first job fair dedicated for hiring Agile practitioners. The goal of the Agile Job Fair was to create a platform dedicated for the Agile practitioners to meet their potential Agile employers and for companies to find Agile practitioners to enable their journey to Agile adoption",
