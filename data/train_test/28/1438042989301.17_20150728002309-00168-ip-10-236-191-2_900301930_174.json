            "Even though SDSU is thought of as an unsafe campus, the only type of crime we get here is phone thefts. If your Iphone is in your pocket whenever you walk somewhere, then you'll be perfectly fine.",
            "it's HUGE!!!",
            "It's a big school, so there are all types of people. I think there are a lot of social and outgoing people so if you like to stay in your room and play video games all the time, maybe you should reconsider.",
            "There's an annual undie run, which is very big. Also, one of the best places on campus is the turtle pond. It's a cute, serene place to eat lunch or study.",
            "A lot of people choose to get into Greek life, but it's not for everyone. If you don't have a car you can go to parties or take the trolley to different parts of the city.",
            "The food isn't too bad, but it's also not too healthy and the options get boring after a while. Vendors come outside of University Towers every night, so even if you don't live there, you should try to take advantage of them and come anyways!",
            "If you live at Cuic or University Towers then you have nice suites and personal bathrooms. If you live in the other dorms than your rooms are going to be tiny and you're going to have communal bathrooms.",
            "Most lower division classes aren't too bad.",
            "Try to be very social and don't skip too many classes, because it may hurt you in the end.",
            "It's a great school. Greek life is very big. Everybody is gorgeous looking."

The average high school GPA for the class of 2017 was a 3.8., 504193=Go to the gym, play bowling at kearny mesa bowl since the aztec center is closed until fall 2013, go to the SDSU men's basketball games at Viejas Arena or concerts, go to the SDSU Football games at Qualcomm Stadium, and watch sports or listen to music/play video games., 360756=not really big here since the drug bust in 2007. many sororities/fraternities were suspended., 245933=There's a lot to do in San Diego! A cultural feast. Get a copy of the local weekly magazine, The Reader, when you arrive. Balboa Park alone has over 20 museums, biking and jogging paths, huge gardens, Spanish Village with an old California feel and artisans' shops, and hospitality houses from many countries. If you're a foreign student, go there for local information and socializing. The Park also hosts the Earth Fair every April. Movie theatres near campus show an eclectic array of films. The beaches are wonderful for surfing, relaxing and playing with your dog., 454032=The school is becoming increasingly difficult to gain acceptance to. For those hoping to transfer, keep in mind that there is a followup application due in January., 399492=food is tasty, but there could be more options. the associated students building which is set to open fall of 2013 will have great dining choices., 313617=I am an incoming freshman, and I will be attending in Fall 2015. I have some friends that go here, and they say that you should be very careful with the party scene here on campus. There are a lot of parties that you can go to, but always make sure to be careful!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here There are so many things to do. What with all the clubs, the ARC, pool, bowling, concerts, and nearby beaches, there's no way you can get bored. Am learning a lot Most of the teachers I've had have been great and are dedicated to helping their students. It may be a party school, but don't be fooled - the classes can be rigorous.

The college is full of beautiful nature which includes hundreds of different types of plants, flowers, and trees. In the middle of the school is a coy pond full of fish and turtles, this pond is so relaxing to visit during a break or just",
