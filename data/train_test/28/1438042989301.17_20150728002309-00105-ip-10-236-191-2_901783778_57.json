            "There are lots of dining choices on campus, so food is never an issue. Additionally, there is a large variety of food, so whatever your tastes are you will find something to eat.",
            "The dorms are just what you would expect. Nothing fancy, but they are perfectly fine to live in.",
            "I managed to ease through high school, but college is a different story. If you want to succeed, you have to try.",
            "Make sure your application is solid. This school is not for everyone, and you have to be smart to get in.",
            "The University of Rochester is a small school on a big campus. It is a great school for any major, whether it be engineering or music. Those interested in research should be especially interested in the U. of R, because it is extremely easy for any student to participate in undergraduate research."

Vegan and vegetarian options are found everywhere and the school is very accommodating towards documented allergies. The food is edible, but don't expect high quality, 328703=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 49160=Dandelion Day is typically the last Friday in April, when the entire student body congregates on the residence quad for a carnival, celebrating the arrival of good weather, and the end of a looonnnnngggg winter., 184147=It snows from December to April. There is an underground tunnel system linking different academic buildings that you come to appreciate during the winters., 295417=If you have time to spare, then I recommend going to Danforth Dinning with is located in the Freshman building Sue Bee, Susan B. Anthony. If your in a rush, go to Douglass, or the pit, which is the basement of Common Connections. If you ever have time, which you will, I strongly recommend getting a Mel Burger which is in the Meliora Dinning Center above Douglass Dinning Center. It was annoying as a freshman that you were required to get an unlimited dinning plan because it was expensive and had little declining. However, this upcoming year 2013-2014 should offer a new plan for freshman which offers so many meals a semester and more declining. I would recommend getting one of those plans rather than the unlimited since you get to choose what you want., 211329=Engineering--the school is one of the top for engineering--and anyone who wants to do research. It's in the top 40 in research universities. There is a med school, so students who want to be medical professionals are also perfect. The Sign Language program is amazing, taught by deaf teachers. Rochester has a 1:7 deaf to hearing ratio., 103354=Hey! The University was ranked sixth (6th) by the Daily Meal in their 75 Best Colleges for Food in America for 2014., 105285=The University of Rochester is one of the nation's leading higher education. With a faculty to student ratio of 9:1, students are assured that they will receive the attention necessary for them to succeed throughout their years here at the U of R. Class size are typically 10-25 students, but in the sciences and math, it tend to be pretty large. But wait, don't be scared, workshops or professor/teacher assistant office hours are offered for to students sitting in these classes. In writing classes, there are also writing fellows and consultants at your service. If interested, I would advice a prospective student to do intensive research about the university. Meliora.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Hillary from Palmyra, NY 01/03/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 16 out of 16 people found this review useful. 2 of 68 Categories Comments Great for these types of students UR accepts well-rounded individuals who have the grades, the activities, and the community service. More specifically, UR has an amazing medical program, since it is associated with Strong Memorial Hospital. It also contains the Eastman school of Music, which is one of the best music schools in the nation. However, the Rochester curriculum can really be tailored to fit any type of student. The only necessary quality I would say is dedication. Tips for prospective students The University of Rochester loves to see an International Baccaulaureate degree or Advanced Placement credits. And of course, as with any other college, make sure to have plenty of extra-curricular activities and community service. Bang for the buck Though it is very expensive, the University of Rochester is very prestigious, a degree from UR means more than from other colleges. In addition, the Career Center will work",
