If you count defensive tackle Cedric Thornton, who spent most of 2011 on the practice squad, that's 12 guys likely fighting for 10 spots. Jim Washburn's group returns nine players, if you count Brandon Graham and Antonio Dixon, both of whom missed most of last season with injuries. Others who will be back: Jason Babin, Trent Cole,",
    "textAfterTable": "Note that I didn't include Dixon, Graham or Thornton in the table. Dixon had no sacks and one hurry in four games (42 pass-rushing opportunities). Graham had no sacks and one hurry in three games (28 pass-rushing opportunities). Thornton was not active on gameday. After signing on for a second tour of duty with the Birds, Babin led the team with 18 sacks and 48 hurries. I'll save some of you the trouble of posting in the comments that he's not great against the run, but the bottom line is Babin was brought here to rush the passer, and he did that at a high level last season. Cole finished second in both categories with 11 sacks and 42 hurries. And as I pointed out recently, he finished strong with five sacks and 14 hurries in the final four games. On the interior, Jenkins led the way with 5.5 sacks and 24 hurries. Patterson and Landri also contributed. As always, it's good to look at opportunities. In the next table, the first column is sacks per pass-rushing opportunity; the second is hurries per pass-rushing opportunity; and the third is sacks PLUS hurries per pass-rushing opportunity. Thanks to Pro Football Focus for tracking total numbers of chances for each player. \u00a0 Sack % Hurry % Sack + Hurry % Babin 4.2% 11.2% 15.4% Cole 2.9% 11.2% 14.1%",
