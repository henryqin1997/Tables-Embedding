The ball wasn\u2019t cleared in the Fulham box and the midfielder arrived to power a low shot into the bottom corner. Ruiz tried to net his hat-trick and spur another comeback, but his free-kick was hit over the bar and then Rodallega came within an inch of scoring in the last minute but was just unable to get his head on the cross. To add insult to injury, Sean Morrison then blocked on the line from Kacaniklic\u2019s shot to put the seal on",
