The first and second arms 2 and 3 are at a ratio of 1:2 in length., 26754=As to the first arm 2, rotational driving force from the arm rotation motor 8 is transmitted through a pulley 32 fixed on an axis of said motor 8 and through a belt 33 to the first arm 2 fixed on a pulley 34, thereby rotating the first arm 2. Said rotational driving force is transmitted through a stationary axis 35 fixed on the first arm 2 and through a pulley 36 fixed on said axis, and a belt 37 to the third arm 4 fixed on a pulley 38 diameter of which has a ratio of 1:1 to that of the pulley 36, thereby rotating the third arm 4. Accordingly, since the third arm 4 is connected to the first arm 2 at a ratio of 1:1, the third and first arms 4 and 2 always rotate in a same direction, and maintain a parallel state to each other. The first and third arms 2 and 4 are approximately equal in length., 30666=FIGS. 5(a) and 5(b) are views indicating a comparison of robot arm rotation areas, and installation spaces between a case of controlling folding directions of the joints and a case of not controlling it respectively. In the case of not controlling the folding direction of the joints, in order to always make the angle between the robot hand direction and third arm 4 maintain 90\ufffd or more such that the distal end portion of the second arm 3 may not extend beyond the distal end portion of the third arm 4 when the robot hand 5 moves in a straight line, the robot installation space has to secure a width Lb shown in FIG. 5(b) that is approximately two times as the length of the second arm 3. (Notes: the first arm 2 and third arm 4 maintain a parallel state to each other) As compared with it, in the case of controlling the folding direction of the joints, the robot installation space only needs a width La shown in FIG. 5(a) that is approximately two times as the length of the first arm 2, so that, since a ratio of the first arm 2 to the second arm 3 is about 1:2, the robot installation space is about half. The folding direction of the joints is controlled by controlling motors 6, 7 and 8 through a control unit which is not shown in the figure.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having described preferred embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims. For example, although the above embodiment shows the composition in which rotational driving means (arm extension motor 6, robot hand rotation motor 7, and arm rotation motor 8) for rotating the arms and robot hand are located in the base 1, and they transmit the rotational driving force to arms through pulleys, belts and so forth, not limited to this composition, a composition in which each of arms includes a rotational driving source, can also be applied. As to the movement from P-point to H-point, as shown in FIG. 19(a), the wafer is firstly moved from P-point to Q-point in a straight line passing over the robot rotational center A. Then, as shown in FIG. 19(e), since the joint direction in H-point (FIG. 18) is same as that in Q-point, the wafer is moved from Q-point to N-point in a straight line. At the same time, the robot hand is rotated 180\ufffd. At the end, as shown in FIG. 19(f), the wafer is moved from N-point to H-point in a straight line. FIG. 18 shows movements",
