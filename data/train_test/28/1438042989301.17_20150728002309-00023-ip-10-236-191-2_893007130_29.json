            "You can always call for an escort if you feel unsafe, and after 10pm, RUPD closes all the gates except for the one that goes next to RUPD's building.",
            "We have something better: Residential Colleges! It's like a sorority/fraternity, except it's co-ed and there's no hazing. There's still that same sense of pride and community (and T-shirts, jackets, and even Snuggies with your college's name!) that a sorority/fraternity would provide.",
            "There is definitely lots of clubs to join. It's very easy to join a club. At the beginning of the year, there's an Activities Fair where every club on campus has a booth and you can sign up to join their email list. And even if you miss it, you can still join clubs; you get a list of clubs on campus during orientation week, and you can look up the email addresses of presidents of clubs you want to join on the Rice website and email them. They'll be happy to add you!",
            "Rice is great for quirky students who like to work and play hard and are also very laidback. I don't think there's any typical Rice student; the only thing we seem to have in common is our weirdness!",
            "Every Residential College has its own traditions (even the newer ones, one of which I am currently in), but I'm not aware of the traditions in residential colleges that are not my own, so I won't discuss them here. Some university-wide traditions we have are Baker 13 (on the 13th and 31st of every month, a bunch of students run stark naked save for some shaving cream on their private parts and smear shaving cream on windows of every college. It's...a very odd tradition. Think that scene in Mulan right after she says, I never want to see a naked man again.), etc.",
            "Yes, Rice is expensive, but it's definitely cheaper than colleges of its same caliber.",
            "Often, colleges have fun activities planned. Every college has one or two big public parties that you can go to. I suggest checking at least one of them out. I'm not much of the partying type, though, so usually I'll do something quieter with my friends, like watching British television every Saturday. Also, it's Houston, so there is always something exciting to do if that's your thing.",
            "It's not just good college food, it's good food, just in general. Housing and Dining even has a suggestion box on their site if you want to suggest something. The chefs are approachable, too, if you need anything. Unfortunately, the serveries are closed on Saturday nights to encourage us to explore dining options outside of the Rice, but there are events that have free food on Saturday nights, so take advantage of those! Somehow, I usually manage to get dinner on Saturdays (most likely because I'm in Rice's Marching Owl Band, and we have section dinners after every football game), so it all works out.",
            "The Residential College System really contributes to dorm life. I think the coolest part of being in a Residential College is that you can sit down at just about any table at a meal in your college's common room and talk to anyone in your class (and even other classes). Being in a Residential College allows you to bond so much. After Orientation Week, we really do feel like a family. There's also homework help available from the Academic Fellows of the college, and you can learn about careers and valuable skills such as resume-making from the college's Associates, adults who are affiliated with the colleges. (They also give awesome Thanksgiving dinners for those of us who can't go home for the break!)",
            "It's hard work, of course. A university of this caliber has to be. The professors here make you work really hard, but it's worth it in the end.",
            "Stay over as a prospie to get a feel for not just the campus, but also the Residential College system. This is a good way to see if you like the system or not.",
            "Rice is a fun but tough university, full of many different kinds of students with many different quirks and oddities. We're all a bit nerdy, but we're also very laidback. Rice creates a sense of community in its students."

There are very few reports of crimes relative to other college campuses and Houston as a whole. That being said, crimes do occur and you should be wary when venturing off campus into the city of Houston. RUPD (Rice University Police Department) does a very good job at keeping students safe and under control during campus-wide events. Clubs and Activities",
