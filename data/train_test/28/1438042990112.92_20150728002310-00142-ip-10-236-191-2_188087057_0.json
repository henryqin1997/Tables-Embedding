A recent report by the Chronicle of Higher Education on The College of 2020 asserts that progressive universities offer programs that are conducive to students\u2019 mobile and technology-rich lifestyle (Chronicle Research Services, 2009). Therefore, innovative parent educator degree programs require technology that transcends geographical boundaries and prepares new professionals where they live and practice, incorporating research that reflects population trends in family life. The online delivery of a continuing education professional development program by the University of Iowa, demonstrated that this mechanism could be viable with professionals interested in parent education (Greder et al, 2010)., 5918=To respond to these demands, in 2005 the University of Minnesota began the re-development of its parent education program. For more than 25 years the University offered a classroom-based graduate program leading to a parent educator license (Minnesota requires a teaching license for all parent educators who are employed in school districts across the state.). With financial support and resources from the University, a consultant team of parent education practitioners redesigned eight courses for online delivery. These courses also were packaged as a graduate certificate in parent education, consisting of fewer credits than required for teacher licensure (16 versus 27 credits). By the fall of 2008, all courses in the certificate program were available for online delivery, and the graduate certificate could be promoted as a completely online program., 4789=A major consideration in the move to online delivery was to ensure instructional quality from the classroom environment be maintained. Therefore, we incorporated quality assurance principles of effective distance education, including those set forth by The Institute for Higher Education Policy (Anderson, 2009; IHEP, 2000, as cited in Cheney, 2008; Swan, Fredericksen, Pickett, Pelz, & Maher, 2000). Some of these principles, discussed later, include instruction that is guided, paced, and moderated; the use of a variety of features; providing technology support; and emphasizing social engagement.}",

Certificate-only students identify at least six other states and two counties as their homes. We also have seen a diversification and interest in the parent education courses from students in disciplines other than family life education. Students earning advanced degrees in child psychology, social work, and educational policy currently take our courses.

Each course begins with introductions between the students and instructor. Generally, this is done through a discussion forum, with students invited to share pictures, videos, and links to other online activities that acquaint them with others, such as blogs or social networking sites (e.g., Facebook).

Shared characteristics of the adult learners in the parent education program are their maturity, diversity, and practical goals. Based on a recent survey of enrolled students (Walker & Hardman, 2008), many come to the program with years of experience as a parent and/or working with parents, families, or children in some capacity. The average age of students is 37 and most (80%) are married with children living at home. While taking courses, 56% of the students work full time and another 31% work part time. Some come to the program right from an undergraduate program or take it as part of other advanced degree programs; others have been out of school for several years or more. Students also represent a range of locations, ethnicities, cultures, and perspectives on parenting. And, their technology skills and resources vary. Thus, the parent education program must address the needs and interests of a slightly older, more mature population of learners who bring a rich diversity of life experiences and lifestyle demands and who have a practical, targeted focus for their investment in learning. Like most adult learners, they have much to offer and expect much from a higher education program (Merriam, et al, 2008)., 41178=Neal, L., & Miller, D. (2005, July 21).

    "textBeforeTable": "Table 1. Principles of Effective Learning Applied to Elements of Online Instruction in Parent Educator Preparation Courses* Critical to the design of learning environments is that these perspectives complement each other and that a systems approach is used to coordinate the content, process, and assessment of instruction (Bransford et al., 1999). Therefore, all courses in the parent education program integrate learning design principles and systematically integrate parent educator competency standards. Table 1 and the sections that follow summarize the ways in which instructional design aspects of the online parent educator program integrate learning environment perspectives. Determination of aspect match to learning principle was facilitated in part, by a checklist for online teacher preparation assessment (Greenhow, Dexter, & Reidel, 2006). Our PE program introduced innovation both to online instruction and to parent education professional development through design elements that represent contemporary neuroscience research on integrative principles of learning. Specifically, we incorporated the four learning environmental design perspectives set forth by John Bransford and colleagues (Anderson, 2004; Boettcher, 2007; Bransford, Brown & Cocking, 1999). Learner-centered environments begin with the knowledge, attitudes, experience, and cultural perspectives that learners bring to the setting, build on these perspectives, and provide a rich, interactive setting that permits the learner to make meaning and construct new knowledge. Knowledge-centered environments intentionally structure content and learning activities across the curriculum to provide an integrated path to understanding. Particularly important for students in the parent education program is movement from existing, experiential",
