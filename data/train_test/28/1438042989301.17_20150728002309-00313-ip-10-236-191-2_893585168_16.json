    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck While it is an expensive institution to attend, the prestige and reputation hold true. CMU provides a strong background in any field, but it also provides a variety of diversity and experience that are invaluable and certainly prepare for life after college. Am enjoying being here Even though CMU has a reputation for all work and no play, there is surprisingly always something to do, both academically and socially. In the classroom, many professors are casual and approachable. Outside the classroom, there are many organizations, sports teams, dance troupes, concerts, musicals, and other social events at which to meet people...and that's just on campus! The city of Pittsburgh also has much to offer, including shopping, the arts, and food! Am learning a lot I am a freshman, so a lot of my courses are introductory and relate to courses I took in high school (ie - biology) and I am therefore familiar with the material. But I have learned a lot more detail, especially in my science courses. Login to rate or flag the reviews Jacob from Pittsburgh, PA 12/09/2009",
