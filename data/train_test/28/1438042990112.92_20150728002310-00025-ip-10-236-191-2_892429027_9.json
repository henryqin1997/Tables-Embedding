            "There are always alerts, be it via email,texts or bulletins. Students are constantly being reminded of the dangers of an open campus. We are also updated on any mishaps that occur on campus using the same mediums. Safety patrol are always around making sure the campus is secure.",
            "There are a variety of clubs, ranging from Jewish to single parents. With so many clubs on campus, there is never a moment of boredom as it were on campus. These clubs always have an activity planned that not only entertains but educates the student body as well.",
            "The CCB building is where the action takes place.On any given day a large body of students can be seen congregated near the building making new friends and drawing others to their cluster of gaiety.",
            "The main dining facility houses several eateries. It is safe to say that no student is dissatisfied with the selections made available. It doesn't hurt that the food is quite good either.",
            "Dorm life is non existent as it is a community college.",
            "The majority of the professors are excellent teachers. They are experts in the field that they teach so they are able to make the lesson enjoyable as well as easy to understand. It is interesting to note that Nassau awards the largest number of Associates Degrees in the state of New York. Students are expected to attain a minimum of a C average, in most departments, to attain credit for that class.",
            "The most important tip for an college student is to create and manage their GPA. This Acronym stands not for grade point average but goal, plan and action. It is advisable that every college student have a goal they ultimately want to meet, create a plan to get to that goal and then act on that plan. This will prove to be successful. It never hurts to plan and be prepared and as such students should also prepare for class by researching their professors. Websites such as rate my professor.com allow a student to get to know their professors before entering the class room. Also, if it is available, use the school's website to research the material the professor will require for the course i.e. the textbook. It never hurts to have an advantage.",
            "Nassau community college affords its students an inexpensive and wonderful start to a promising future. There are many programs and professors who provide work placement and internship opportunities that propel students further along on their journey to success. I award my college five stars and recommend it as a start to any who dream of attending college but cannot afford it."
