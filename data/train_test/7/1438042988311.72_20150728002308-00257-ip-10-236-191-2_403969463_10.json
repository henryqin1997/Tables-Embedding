He posts reviews on every Canon lens/body sounding somewhat authoritive \"just buy it\" but take the reviews with a grain of salt as he does not own Canon DSLRs. Ken was a big fan of the S95 so a good review of the S100 is not surprising. No Respect. No respect at all. I've always thought of him as the Rodney Dangerfield of photography. Ken Rockwell is the Rush Limbaugh of photography. steven2874 wrote:",
