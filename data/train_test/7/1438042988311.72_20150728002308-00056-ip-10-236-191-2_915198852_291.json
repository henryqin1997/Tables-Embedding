    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Make sure to check your emails. You could miss out on something if you don't. Meet with an adviser before you sign up for classes. Then you won't be taking classes that you already had credit for or that are too hard and unnecessary for your degree. I speak from personal experience! Don't be afraid of asking questions. Everyone is friendly and very helpful. Try to figure out ahead of time what college you're going to after Valencia. Then the advisers can help you more with what classes you should take. Bang for the buck I can learn so much at Valencia, and it doesn't cost that much. I have friends who complain about prices at other colleges, but thanks to Valencia's fantastic prices, I can afford to go to college. In fact, I plan on taking as many required classes as I can at Valencia because they're so inexpensive. Am enjoying being here I was scared about college before I started going to Valencia. However, now I know that Valencia will help me with anything I'm having problems with, and they will do it in a manner that makes my education fun and profitable. Valencia is a comfortable and enjoyable learning environment. Am learning a lot",
