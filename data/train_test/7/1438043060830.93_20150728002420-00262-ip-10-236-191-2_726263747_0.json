The ones I was hoping to find that are not available here are Larceny, HH6/BIB and VOB. Unfortunately I could only find the Larceny but I found lots of other stuff cheaper and way cheaper than what I can buy it for here so I literally filled up my trunk.

(3) The JBBIBis N/A in 1L here but the .75L are $25 so I divided by 3 and multiplied by 4 to estimate what it might cost in a Liter bottle here. (4) Stagg Jr is State Min of $50 here but the only time I saw it on the shelf it was $70 so I bought one of each batch I saw since who knows when I might see it up here ever again for proper state min price and I used that value instead of state min like I did for the others. (5) Larceny is not available here at all so it is not included in the Tot $ IN row's cell. (6) I didn't count the",
