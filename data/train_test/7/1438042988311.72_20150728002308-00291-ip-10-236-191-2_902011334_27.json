            "Security is pretty ineffective. There have been isolated attacks on students by townies. Generally security is just there to impress your parents if you come to visit, and they take themselves very seriously. They won't bust you unless you do something really stupid though.",
            "Greek life is either taken way too seriously, or taken very lightly, depending on who you talk to. None of the greeks are national though.",
            "The clubs are pretty cool. It is nice to have people with similar interests around, or at least be able to find them.",
            "Wooster is great for students that can financially afford to go wherever they want and my not be cut out for a few of their first choice schools.",
            "There is a tradition of attempting to fill an arch in the humanities building with snow in the winter, but it rarely works. It is fun if you have the time though. Although it's not a tradition it happens every year that some people are forced to transfer out after our yearly tuition spikes. Everybody has a friend that has had to, and it's sad every year.",
            "Wooster is a bad buy, plain and simple. Don't be fooled by any guides or books that say otherwise. With the loads of college guides out there, every school gets put on some list at some point or another. As a student on the ground, I can tell you that Wooster is entirely too expensive, even with the best financial aid, for the product that you get in the end.",
            "There isn't a whole lot to do in town because of how small it is. Most people just end up drinking or smoking weed or something. It can get boring, I'm not gonna lie.",
            "The dining is actually pretty good. There is a full buffet spread for all three meals; it's pretty nice. There are two dining halls and one is vegetarian. The number of students is being permitted to rise pretty aggressively though, so the lines are LONG if you show up at the wrong time.",
            "The dorms are basic, and res life won't do anything for you unless you annoy them about it. If you do come here, bring earplugs because there is a good chance that you get stuck near someone who parties late and has no conception of thin walls.",
            "The academics are mediocre. The professors are hit or miss. Also, it is true that you end up learning almost as much from other students as you do from your professors (in a different way, obviously) and the students here are intellectually hit or miss like the professors. This is mainly because to go here you have to first clear the financial hurdle, which eliminates a lot of smart students right off the bat, and so the people that get in are generally wealthy, but they may or may not be very bright.",
            "Look at other schools. I can't speak for all liberal arts colleges, but I can say that there are many better options out there than Wooster. The education is flat out not worth the money, even with the financial aid, and honestly regardless of how the admissions office flatters you they are after your money, and your success is a secondary consideration.",
            "Wooster's commitment to socio-economic diversity is honestly a bunch of crap. There are a lot of east coast old money kids here, which is fine, but it really speaks to the economic exclusivity of Wooster and the social climate. It's kind of ironic how economically exclusive it is, because it's really not academically exclusive at all which means the school is just after the money and the prestige so many people think it buys."

It is great to walk to class and receive a lot of hellos and smiles. It is wonderful to know a lot of peoples names and always be able to talk to someone at anytime. Everyone is very nice and always willing to help others. There are tons of opportunities to join many different clubs, groups, and get involved in different activities. The campus is beautiful, all year long, it is small and very personable. Every student has the opportunity to grow as a student and as a person at this college., 172822=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 123510=The move in process is always aided by fall athletes that are there for their camp week. Every year on the day that senior theses are due all the seniors get drunk and march through a big arch in the humanities building. And every year the family of each student gets a letter saying that administrators try to provide the best education at a reasonable cost, but in order to maintain the wooster lifestyle tuition and fees have to go up by some ridiculous amount., 95302=You get a tootsie roll your senior year when you turn in your thesis. Also, the seniors always march through a big arch we have on campus every year. Sometimes if there's a lot of snow in the winter, people try to fill it up, but it never works., 61851=Don't come here. The strong and frequent tuition hikes alone make it not worth it, and the aforementioned campus culture makes it a lot worse. Everybody has a friend who had to transfer out for financial reasons, and al ot of others are taking on enormous debt. They (tuition hikes) also make the school very economically exclusive, and foster a very high maintenance culture and environment. Payscale recently ranked wooster #778 out of bout 1200 schools in its best value category (#1 being the best). Ultimately, good students will succeed wherever they go, and there are plenty of better options.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I think the most notable aspect of the curriculum is its inter-disciplinary qualities. I can think of numerous occasions in which information from one class has connected to what I am learning in another class. Wooster is not merely about giving students the facts and then testing them on names and dates. Instead, the College is dedicated to teaching students how to apply knowledge to all areas of college life.
