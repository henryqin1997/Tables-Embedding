He\u2019s no stranger to agricultural policy, as Brown has testified in front of both the House and the Senate on dairy issues., 12661=Before the farm bill can be dissected, \u201cforget all that you thought or heard about the farm prior to January 2014,\u201d said Brown., 9850=This February webinar is archived and available for viewing. Other past webinars can be found at www.hoards.com/webinars., 7630=Garrett Oetzel presents \u201cCows and their calcium\u201d at noon (Central time) on Monday, March 10. Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) is an important determinant of fresh cow health and milk production. Recent research has highlighted the negative effects of hypocalcemia: reduced early-lactation milk yield, elevated risk for displaced abomasum and reduced fertility at first service. Measures to control it will be discussed including nutritional approaches and strategic treatments. The March webinar is sponsored by Bio-Vet, Inc., 11130=Each herd\u2019s production base will be based on their annual production for 2011, 2012 or 2013, whichever is higher. Herds without a full year of production will have their value extrapolated to generate an annual level or their herd size will take the national production average. The USDA will adjust the base annually, depending on total U.S. milk production growth., 10743=The expected start date is September 1. However, Brown suggests producers will be able to start enrolling this summer at their FSA office. Not all the details have been set by USDA yet, so there is some waiting until all the rules have been established.}",
