    "textBeforeTable": "In terms of the OMG's modeling \"stack\", then, we have in the Eclipse Modeling Project In the examples plugins, a new Pivot metamodel is used to support Editors and direct Java Code Generation. Traditionally, the Eclipse Modeling Project has two such metamodels: Ecore and UML (Ecore being its own meta-metamodel). Hence, the OCL component provides an OCL binding for each of these metamodels. OCL can parse constraints in either Ecore or UML models, and can evaluate them on the instances of Java classes generated from these models. Eclipse OCL provides a parser and interpreter for OCL constraints and expressions on any EMF-based metamodel. By that is meant any metamodel whose meta-metamodel is Ecore, and which (in being a metamodel) provides an EMF importer to create GenModels that generate a Java implementation. What is Eclipse OCL? Dresden OCL and Eclipse OCL are independent Open Source developments by independent teams. There is little commonality beyond best endeavours to comply with the OCL specification and exploitation of EMF as the underlying modeling infrastructure. What is the difference between Dresden OCL and Eclipse OCL? None. Prior to the Kepler release, the internal organisation at Eclipse involved an MDT container project, and so Eclipse OCL and Eclipse UML2 were frequently referred to as MDT/OCL and MDT/UML2 respectively. What is the difference between MDT/OCL and Eclipse OCL? Questions in this section are directed at those that are",

See also EMF 2.3 JVM Requirements. The UML dependencies may be ignored if support for UML models is not required. The Xtext dependencies may be ignored if the OCL editors are not required. Java 1.6 is needed if on the fly compilation of OCL derived Java is required. Luna dependencies are provisional. How do I workaround org.eclipse.emf.ocl deprecation in Helios and later? The deprecated org.eclipse.emf.ocl feature and plugin were removed in the Eclipse OCL 3.0.0 release. Unfortunately some projects, notably UML2-Tools, continue to reference it. This prevents their Galileo releases being installed on Helios. A Helios release of UML-Tools has been built (26-July-2010)",
