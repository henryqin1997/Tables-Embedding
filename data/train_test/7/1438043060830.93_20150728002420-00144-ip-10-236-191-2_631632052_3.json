The lobbyists at PMA Group have been Murtha's fifth most generous campaign donor over time, but he is just one of 284 members of the 111th Congress who have collected money from the firm, which specializes in securing federal earmarks for its clients.

Time to tackle the last descriptor in our characterization of mega-donors: their overwhelming whiteness. Race, of course, can be a fraught topic, and in this case we have the added disadvantage\u2026, 26849=April 26, 2012\u00a0|\u00a0At the outset, nobody thought Rep. Tim Holden, a 20-year Democratic incumbent from Pennsylvania, would have a competitive race in his 2012 bid to keep his seat for yet another term. But that was before the Campaign for Primary Accountability (CPA), a new super PAC, and other outside spending groups began to focus on the on the district., 50418=February 17, 2009\u00a0|\u00a0Money manager Robert Allen Stanford now has two things in common with embattled investment manager Bernard Madoff: both have come under scrutiny for allegedly defrauding their investors, and both have given significant funds to politicians. Between its PAC and its employees, Stanford Financial Group has given $2.4 million to federal candidates, parties and committees since 2000., 30090=October 16, 2011\u00a0|\u00a0Overall, fund-raising by all GOP presidential candidates is down about 50 percent this year compared to the money raised by all Republican presidential candidates at the same point four years ago, according to research by the Center for Responsive Politics., 20507=May 2, 2014\u00a0|\u00a0Overall spending on lobbying\u00a0may have fallen again in the first quarter of 2014, but not everyone decided to pull back. In fact, some companies and industries pumped up their lobbying in the quarter, with the chemical and pharmaceutical industries leading the pack.\u00a0Dow Chemical\u00a0was the company with the biggest jump from the fourth quarter of 2013\u2026, 40366=October 5, 2010\u00a0|\u00a0Sen.

Neil Abercrombie of\u2026, 55888=September 11, 2008\u00a0|\u00a0When the federal government announced two months ago that it would be seizing mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, CRP looked at how much money members of Congress had collected since 1989 from the companies. On Sunday the government proceeded with the takeover and we've returned to our data to bring you the updates, this time providing a list of all 354 lawmakers who have gotten money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (in July we posted the top 25)., 37934=November 17, 2010\u00a0|\u00a0Despite a stubbornly sour national economy congressional members' personal wealth collectively increased by more than 16 percent between 2008 and 2009, according to a new study by the Center for Responsive Politics of federal financial disclosures released earlier this year., 56738=April 3, 2008\u00a0|\u00a0From aircraft and weapons manufacturers to producers of medical supplies and soft drinks, the investment portfolios of more than a quarter of Congress\u2014and of countless constituents\u2014include holdings in companies paid billions of dollars each month to support America's military in Iraq and elsewhere., 52230=October 2, 2008\u00a0|\u00a0Like reading tea leaves, one way to predict how a congressional race is going to go is by looking at the disparity in fundraising between the candidates. So far this election cycle, 280 House and Senate incumbents on November's ballot have collected at least 10 times more than the opponent they face in the general election. In this installment of Races to Watch, Capital Eye looks into why some of these incumbents have been such successful fundraisers., 45959=October 16, 2009\u00a0|\u00a0An initial Center for Responsive Politics analysis has found that sitting members of the U.S. House of Representatives raised $48.2 million from July 1 through Sept. 30, 2009, based on the 336 reports we have in. The mean amount these lawmakers raised was $143,640, and the median amount was $126,680., 14377=March 24, 2015\u00a0|\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s almost-a-surprise victory last week seems at least partly due to how he played the digital game, with an aggressive online outreach effort, active social media accounts and short but attention-grabbing videos. That digital strategy\u00a0was mostly engineered by an American consulting firm, Harris Media, which was recently hired by Sen. Rand\u2026, 35696=February 14, 2011\u00a0|\u00a0Several Republican freshmen have also drawn from Washington, D.C.'s lobbying community to fill out their staffs. For this week's PolitiQuizz, we're asking you take a look at the hiring patterns of three of these freshmen., 44653=July 30, 2010\u00a0|\u00a0Few politicos receiving significant cash from the Wyly brothers were interested in talking about it Friday., 32457=May 26, 2011\u00a0|\u00a0In an election year where more congressional incumbents were ousted from power than any time since 1948, political action committees were quick to switch allegiances from one party to the other in the aftermath of the historic Democratic losses., 38710=November 4, 2010\u00a0|\u00a0The priciest midterm election in U.S. history saw a Republican tide sweep numerous Democrats out of office, as voters anxious about the state of the economy ousted more House incumbents from office than any time since 1948. While several money-in-politics axioms held true, money was not a panacea for embattled politicians., 54816=September 12, 2008\u00a0|\u00a0Uncle Sam bailed out Freddie Mac and the company's twin sister, Fannie Mae, this week, and the next in line in the Wall Street family to get a helping hand might just be Lehman Brothers. Executives at the struggling investment bank are looking to sell the company with assistance from the government--and fast--as its stock plunges. Although the government isn't expected to completely bail out Lehman Brothers, the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, the company has built a strong financial relationship with politicians over the years and coincidentally ranks fourth in the largest contributors in the race for the White House., 15271=October 16, 2014\u00a0|\u00a0The involvement of immediate family members in a drunken brawl does little to boost one\u2019s political prospects. On a different level, the same might be said of a stingy leadership PAC. Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin\u2019s SarahPAC continued to perform underwhelmingly as a source of funds for other candidates in 2014\u2019s third quarter, a\u2026, 17716=July 22, 2014\u00a0|\u00a0During Facebook\u2019s early years, the company barely noticed\u00a0Washington,\u00a0taking a full five\u00a0years to spend its first dime on federal lobbying. Then, the\u00a0company\u2019s investment in the capital began growing\u00a0rapidly,\u00a0alongside its\u00a0revenue\u00a0and ambitions. Now, as a full-fledged corporate behemoth, with a billionaire CEO recently interested in politics, the company\u2019s lobbying has exploded, making even its recent expenditures look small.\u2026, 36380=December 3, 2010\u00a0|\u00a0From January through September, 29 unique groups have lobbied on the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" ban on openly gay service members, according to a Center for Responsive Politics review of federal lobbying reports explicitly mentioning the measure., 22191=July 24, 2013\u00a0|\u00a0Candidates will do most anything to win elections -- including, in some cases, putting their campaign committees deep in debt., 43169=August 24, 2010\u00a0|\u00a0Congressional members' vehicles are hardly created equal when it comes to how much you, as a taxpayer, are subsidizing them. What's equally unequal: How much information members of the U.S. House of Representatives are willing to reveal about the wheels you're providing them., 24226=September 19, 2012\u00a0|\u00a0It may look like a network of misfiring neurons, but our visualization, done in collaboration with Newsweek & the Daily Beast, actually shows the connections between shadow money groups., 39532=October 7, 2010\u00a0|\u00a0Thirteen Tea Party-backed Republicans want the U.S. Senate to experience a new brand of political brew after November 2. The question isn't whether they will or won't, but rather, how many of them will be in office?
