All staff are friendly, the hotel is clean & maids clean/change beds every day. The swimming pool is not massive so can get busy on peak days but we always managed to find a sunbed, there is also a smaller pool for young ones. We never stayed for the entertainment, but often heard/saw bits of it as we were heading out. I believe they have a mini disco for the kids and then a different act each night. One of the best things about the hotel is the food - there are different themes every night, Chinese night, Italian night etc...one night they even had a chocolate fountain! I had stayed at other hotels in Benidorm & these had the best",
