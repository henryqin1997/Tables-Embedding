They say it's not necessary to declare a major right away, and that is half right, but the sooner you know, the sooner you can move on to a university. There's no such thing as finishing up general ed before I go to a university, and then finding out what my major should be. Also, this college's accreditation is currently under question by the the state college board (April 2013), so beware., 168488=Pretty popular weight training facilities that I disovered during my first Weights class. Considering the fairly low tuition, academic bang for buck is good, but don't expect a cosmopolitan, big-city campus with those kind of amenities (like art gallery & museum). Library (aka learning resource center) is attractive & modern, with plants & murals to make it pleasant; there's plenty of one-person carrels and several small study rooms that always seem to be occupied. Parking permits now $40/semester, $20 for summer session (as of 2013), with daily parking passes available for those infrequent visitors. As of summer 2012, tuition is $46/credit hour for in-state students, with a reasonably moderate enrollment fee assessed on out-of-state students., 305449=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 275884=This is my first year at Victor Valley college, the 2014 spring semester jus started and so far I am enjoying my time here. Everyone is helpful and understanding., 165568=Police station on lower campus, but I rarely if ever see them circulating. One shooting suicide Fall 2012, but no one else was hurt according to press. Generally feel safe attending evening events here. Parking lots well lit, with visible emergency call stations scattered throughout., 63520=i have been attending victor valley college since the fall of 2007. i have to say that my experience thus far has been nothing but positive. the instructors really push for excellence, which i appreciate.}",
