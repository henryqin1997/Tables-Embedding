The sessionID string may expire after a predetermined period of time, necessitating a new communication session. For example, the sessionID may expire after a period during which no communications are exchanged. This period may be programmed into server 44. Similarly, the sessionID string expires when a communication session terminates. It is noted that more than one agent may be present on local network 30 and more than one proxy may be present on local network 14. There may be a one-to-one correspondence between devices and agents and between devices and proxies. Alternatively, a single proxy may service different devices and, likewise, a single agent may service different devices. Similarly, multiple proxies may service the same device and multiple agents may service the same device. The local protocols run on local networks 14, 30 may be TCP/IP or a serial protocol, such as RS232 or RS485. The protocol run on external network 26 may be HTTP. The virtual tunnel may comprise a telnet session (e.g., the tunnel is implemented during the telnet session). It is noted that client application 24 and server application 39 may communicate directly when a direct connection can be achieved (e.g., if they are on the same network). To effect direct communication, if client application 24 and server application 39 use TCP/IP, server application",
