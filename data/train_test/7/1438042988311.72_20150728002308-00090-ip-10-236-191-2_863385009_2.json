He beat the previous European outdoor record of 8:01.18 set in Berlin at the 2009 World Championships by his compatriot Bouabdellah Tahri. Mekhissi-Benabbad finished second in that Meeting Areva 3000 metres steeplechase race, which was won by Ezekiel Kemboi in the world's best time of the year (7:59.03).[13], 34840=At the 2014 European Athletics Championships in Zurich, Mekhissi-Benabbad was disqualified after finishing first in the 3000m steeplechase.

He became the first non-Kenyan in 24 years to finish first or second in the Olympic 3000 metres steeplechase event. Coincidentally, the last non-Kenyan to do so was a Frenchman - Joseph Mahmoud - who won the silver medal at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Mekhissi-Benabbad improved further at the 2008 Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich meeting, finishing behind Paul Kipsiele Koech in second place in a personal best time of 8:08.95,[4] making him the fourth fastest 3000 metres steeplechaser that year.[5], 16914=Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad (born 15 March 1985) is a French middle-distance runner of Algerian origin who mainly competes in the 3000 metres steeplechase.

That was not the first time that Mekhissi-Benabbad had abused a mascot. After having won the same race at the 2010 European Championships championships in Barcelona, Mekhissi-Benabbad asked a mascot to kneel in front of him before he pushed it to the ground.[2], 21149=Mekhissi-Benabbad won the 3000 metres steeplechase gold medal at the 2007 European Athletics U23 Championships.

Mekhissi-Benabbad's new world record time of 5:10.68 in that 2000 m outdoor steeplechase race was almost 4 seconds faster than the world record time of 5:14.43 set on 21 Aug 1990 by Julius Kariuki, the Kenyan who would hold the 2000\u00a0m outdoor steeplechase world record for almost 20 years until it was broken by Tahri.[11], 3324=1500\u00a0m outdoor: 3:33.12 (Tomblaine 2013) 2000\u00a0m steeplechase outdoor: 5:10.68 (Reims 2010), 27110=Mekhissi-Benabbad won his second consecutive 3000 metres steeplechase Olympic silver medal at the 2012 Olympics in London. In the final, with 200 metres in the race remaining, Ezekiel Kemboi was in the lead, followed by Abel Kiprop Mutai in second place, Roba Gari in third place and Mekhissi-Benabbad in fourth place. Mekhissi-Benabbad then swept past both Gari and Mutai to finish second behind Kemboi. \"I want to congratulate Ezekiel Kemboi because he won and it is not by chance because he won in 2004. ... He is stronger than me, but I do hope one day I can beat him,\" Mekhissi-Benabbad said right after the race.[12], 23370=Mekhissi-Benabbad opened the 2009 season with an appearance in the 3000 metres event at the Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix, where he registered a personal best of 7:53.50.[6] Another personal best came in the 3000 metres steeplechase at the FBK Games in Hengelo, again behind Brimin Kipruto, as he took second place in 8:06:98.[7] Mekhissi-Benabbad secured a prominent 2009 IAAF Golden League race victory at the Meeting Areva in Paris with a time of 8:13.23.[8] He was selected to represent France at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, where he was seen as a possible medallist in the 3000 metres steeplechase. But he failed to complete his heat in that event when he was forced to step off the track injured with just over a lap to go.[9], 20159=Mekhissi-Benabbad made his first appearances as a junior athlete in 2004, running at the 2004 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, where he was 61st in the junior race, and at the 2004 World Junior Championships where he was eliminated in the heats of the 3000\u00a0m steeplechase.

With about 300 metres to go in the final, Mekhissi-Benabbad passed Ezekiel Kemboi, then Paul Kipsiele Koech and became jointly in the lead with Conseslus Kipruto. Just after clearing the third-last hurdle in the final bend, Kemboi saw his chance and surged forward to pass both Mekhissi-Benabbad and Kipruto. From then on, Kemboi never relinquished his lead. Kipruto overtook Mekhissi-Benabbad at the start of the final straight and eventually finished second behind Kemboi. Right after the race, Mekhissi-Benabbad admitted that he was finding it hard to cope with the pressure. \"In the French team I am under a lot of stress and pressure, but I have to deal with it the best I can. ... I had to settle for bronze again but it is never easy to win one. I am on the podium and that is what counts.\"[14]}",
