            "I have never felt unsafe on the campus. A main road runs through the campus, and drivers are very aware of the students crossing the street.",
            "Greek life is very noticeable on campus, and is a strong presence on campus. Rush week is very big, and many students are personally invited by members of the Greek life programs to enjoy different rush activities.",
            "I would again like to state that STEM majors would be most comfortable within Tech. However, the school is expanding the other departments, and this gap should quickly be minimized. The school is also home to a very strong Honors Program, which requires more in depth studies and commitment. The Honors Program is not overwhelming, and prospective students may wish to look into enrolling in the program.",
            "Tennessee Tech has been consistently ranked as a school where you will get the most Bang for the Buck. All the facilities at Tech you would hope for are present, and the school is renovating and improving at a noticeable rate, only enforcing this endowment.",
            "Student interests on campus are surprisingly varied, and a prospective student should easily be able to find an activity on campus they would enjoy. From sports to live action role playing with padded swords, the actives on campus are enjoyable and new. Tech is a bit of a suitcase school however, and the weekends are home to a less full campus.",
            "Food and dining at Tech is improving. The meal plan for students is flexible, and a student can exchange a meal at any food establishment on campus with only one exception:, the library's small cafe. In addition to meal exchanges, students also have Flex Dollars which can be spent at any location. These act as a way to purchase food outside of the three meal exchanges you are permitted a day. The dining options on campus are expanding. In addition to the main cafeteria on campus which has a buffet style serving option, different fast food restaurants are either opened or opening, including Papa Johns and Chick-Fil-A. Off campus options are varied yet delicious, and typically honor student discounts.",
            "The dorms vary based on which building you are in. The two buildings designated New Hall are noticeably nicer compared to the rest of the dorms, yet are more expensive to live in. Though dorms are being renovated and improved daily underneath the new President and Provo of Students, they are still slightly disappointing without any personal amenities. Once I brought in my own carpet and curtains, as well as purchased a loft for my bed, it became much more pleasurable to live in. I do not live in a New Hall building.",
            "Having only taken general education classes so far, my first impression has been favorable. Nearly all my classes were taught by full time professors holding doctorates, and the classes which were not taught by them were not lacking in regards to depth and fulfillment. My one complaint is that the current registration progress is somewhat stressful, and you may have to work to get your schedule to fully fit within what you envision.",
            "Understand that this school is primarily a school for STEM students: you may not fully fit in if you study a major more involved with the liberal arts. Greek life is very active here, and there is not one particular type of student who can become involved with a fraternity or sorority. One building is being fully renovated per semester, and different amenities are being installed daily campus wide. The minor inconvenience of dealing with construction is small in comparison to the more modern conveniences which will soon be available, but some prospective students could be deterred from this fact.",
            "Tennessee Tech University is a research based school, priding itself on the strong STEM major studies it can provide. Located at an accessible location within the state of Tennessee, the nearby locations vary from student hangouts to state parks to relax in. The school is undergoing a positive transformation with new leadership, and students are enjoying new classes and accommodations being found at Tech."

The only good food places close on Friday at 5:30 and open on Monday mornings around 10. Starbucks is really quick., 320415=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 7206=I enjoy the small town feel of Tech. It's safe and cops are always patrolling so I don't have to be as nervous about walking over to the library at night. Also the campus is small so if I am running late for that 8 o'clock class I can get there in five minutes.}",

Also their are a lot of upper class man that you can go to get help from. Tips for prospective students Guided tours are great because they show you everything but also they are only showing you the good stuff. Stop a couple of students on campus ask them their major, what they like and dislike about the school, and any other questions you might have. Don't be afraid to ask most students really enjoy Tech and would be more than willing to answer a question. Oh and don't let the dorms scare you, its a small space but it works. Bang for the buck I feel like I am making a great investment in my future by going here. I'm getting a",
