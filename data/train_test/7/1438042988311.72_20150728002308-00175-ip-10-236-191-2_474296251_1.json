I\u2019ve read every single KH book and despite their more chick-lit feel and the no/very low steam, fade to black love scenes, I always somehow find myself engaged, charmed, and entertained by her witty writing, fun, quirky characters, and sweet, humorous stories. KH created another genuine, flawed, cute, funny, strong, insecure, loveable, lonely, relatable heroine in Emmaline and made me feel every emotion right along with her. Jack was a perfect, imperfect, romantic hero and exactly what she needed. I just wish there had been a lot more page time spent on Em and Jack together and much less on detailing their past relationships with their uber annoying exes. The ending felt slightly rushed, and I wanted a teensy bit more of an apology and groveling on Jack\u2019s part. And of course, I keep hoping/wishing that KH will turn up the heat in her books by about 200 degrees! But it\u2019s still a great read that made me feel, smile, laugh, and cry, so 4-4 \u00bd highly enjoyable stars! ...more",
