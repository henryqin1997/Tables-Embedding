Physical description: 249 pages : illustrations ; 26 cm Notes: Originally published: Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012. Summary note: 520 \"Meek little Mole, willful Ratty, Badger the perennial bachelor, and petulant Toad. Since their first appearance over a hundred years ago in 1908, they've become emblematic archetypes of eccentricity, folly, and friendship. And their misadventures--in gypsy caravans, stolen sports cars, and their beloved Wild Wood--continue to capture readers' imaginations and warm their hearts long after they grow up. Begun as a series of letters from Kenneth Grahame to his son, THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS is a timeless tale of animal cunning and human camaraderie\"-- Provided by publisher.
