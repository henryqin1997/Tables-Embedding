            "In this paper, we present a method that uses panoramic images to perform local homing. Our method is different from others in that it does not extract any features from the images and only performs simple image processing operations. Furthermore, it uses a method borrowed from computer graphics to simulate the effect in the images of translations of the robot to compute local motion parameters.",
