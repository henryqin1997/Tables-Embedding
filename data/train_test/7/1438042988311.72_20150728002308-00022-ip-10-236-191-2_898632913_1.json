            "If you like to have fun but do not want it to take away from your learning because of too much then this is a great school for you. They try to make it interacting and they have a lot of resources to help you with your school work.",
            "Stay on top of financial aid because there are a lot of students and you don't want to miss out on your money. Go to class it makes the work a lot easier to understand if you are actually there when the teacher teaches it rather than just trying to learn from the book.",
            "The school is great and I'm only paying 1,500 per semester after all the financial aid I'm receiving and 1,000 of it will be paid by work study so you tell me is it worth it.",
            "The campus is great. There is always some type of student involvement activity going on, not always interesting but they're trying. The only down fall is the expensive cafeteria food but you can always order out.",
            "The teachers make there schedule around you and if you don't understand they are happy to help. They will even take the time to make extra work just for you. I am really learning a lot and actually remembering it later on."

This is when there are venders and activities are going on. For example, if its a beautiful day, they'll have a dj with free food and games., 116636=It's very safe around the campus, but if you are a commuter don't go home too late (5 o'clock is the latest for me)., 106544=Rutgers University (Camden Campus) is providing me with an exceptional educational experience due to the location, curriculum, and career counseling center. The campus is close to public transportation so getting to my 8:00 a.m. class is not a problem. The curriculum is stimulating with professors who not only love to teach, but also are networked with employers who could possibly hire me upon graduation. The career center is helping me create a stellar resume to obtain part-time employment while I am a student, helps me to fine tune what my minor should be and prepares me for interviews upon graduation., 59850=I am a transfer student from out of state. I will be attending Rutger's in Spring 2013 and therefore, cannot rate the college., 152138=May be but none that I am aware of., 16886=Small campus with all the benefits of affiliation with a big school. The professors, counselors and programs for the opportunity of service to others is great. As a freshman coming in in September, I was made to feel welcomed as part of a community, a family.}",
