Steve had already passed by then and I wish that I would have had the opportunity to meet him. Better yet, I wish that he was still around but when it's your time to go you go, even when it's way too early. Larry has told me how I really would have liked Steve and from what I have read it sounds like everyone liked Steve. Keep up the great work. Marv Clausen, Parker, Colorado, 522811=Steve Brew was a great man. When I graduated from Chadron State College in 1991, Steve was an engineer on the BN Railroad. I worked afternoons and went down to the old city auditorium every morning so I could and play basketball with all the engineers and conductors that just got in from a trip or were waiting to go out on a trip.\u00a0 Steve was a good player and one of the best passers around. I learned quickly when making cuts to the basket that you never turned your back to Steve when he had the ball. If you did, you would be wearing it.\u00a0 Everyone loved Steve. Towards the end of his pickup basketball career, he had already torn both Achilles and would still come down at times and watch the pickup games because he loved the game and loved to teach and coach the game.\u00a0 I will guarantee he is smiling right now watching all the kids he has coached become successful in life.\u00a0Jeff Mills, Alliance, Nebraska}",

Near the end are five facts, none of which are likely to be found on any other WNBA player roster: 1) Jordan can juggle (even if she can't dunk); 2) Jordan loves hot dogs (even though she's never been one); 3) Jordan eats peanut butter and jelly sandwiches before every game (kind of like Elvis did before his performances, only his sandwiches were peanut butter and banana); 4) Jordan participated in 4-H for three years (just like thousands of other Nebraskans); and 5) Jordan and younger brother Kyle saved their own money to pay for a 25-by-50 foot concrete slab so they could practice basketball at their ranch. To get a three-point line, the slab covered up their grandma Dorothy's garden. No wonder Jordan made 295 three-point shots at Nebraska \u2013 67 as a freshman, 67 as a sophomore, 81 as a junior and 80 as a senior (choosing, we assume, an assist over one last howitzer). Jordan Hooper is much more than the numbers she put up in the Big 12 Conference and then the Big Ten, and those numbers Five Interesting Facts about Jordan Hooper",
    "textAfterTable": "What If Brew Never Saw Hooper as Hoopster? \u00a0 Hooper, in fact, is just now seeing herself as a professional player. Even though it\u2019s a far cry from a Wyo-Nebraska elementary league, she truly believes that if her mom hadn\u2019t talked to Steve Brew, basketball probably never would have been a big deal to a girl growing up on a ranch about 45 minutes northeast of Alliance, where Brian Hooper, her father, was a fourth-generation rancher with 7,000 acres of land in Sheridan County. \u201cMy dad wanted me to get started in AAU and kind of pushed me a little bit more,\u201d Hooper recalled, \u201cbut I put my foot down. I wanted my summers to be mine and wanted to enjoy my life. I decided if colleges don\u2019t want me, they don\u2019t want me, so I\u2019ll just deal with that when I get older. That was kind of my attitude. Maybe that was the wrong attitude, but I think it worked out okay for me.\u201d \u00a0 Basketball has never burned out Jordan Hooper, and she admits she\u2019s just now getting into the rhythm of envisioning herself as a pro player, so her level of excitement has soared with every sunup and sundown.
