I also, was nervous because I work a part time job, and attend school in the evening. So, I didn't think I could handle that. But, the staff at Brown Mackie Made me very comfortable, and helped me overcome this nervousness. The instructor's are thourough, and try to make sure everyone gets the understanding of what's being taught. If you don't pass your classes here, with all of the tutoring available, then this means you are not applying yourself., 82572=I have only enrolled. Will not start until July 2.

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This school is great for everyone, especially for those who have a busy schedule because this college works on a one class a month schedule. Bang for the buck Just like all other universities and colleges, it cost to go to school, so just try your hardest and it will all pay at the end. Am enjoying being here I really enjoy being at Brown Mackie College. Am learning a lot I am learning alot at Brown Mackie College because of the way they organize the classes one per month, it is alot easier to focus on just that one class.
