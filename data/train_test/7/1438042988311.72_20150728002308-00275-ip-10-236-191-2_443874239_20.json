            "Product Identification - Included are embodiments for product identification. One embodiment of a system includes an image capture device that captures a real-time video image of a retail environment product and a memory component that stores a computer application. In some embodiments, the computer application causes the system to identify the retail environment product from the real-time video image and determine whether a predetermined potential product is similar to the retail environment product. Similarly, in some embodiments, the computer program causes the system to provide, in response to determining that the predetermined potential product is similar to the retail environment product, product identification information for the retail environment product, the product identification information including an altered version of the real-time video image.",
