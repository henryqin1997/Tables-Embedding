In the 2005/06 season all 30 NBA teams combined generated revenues of about 3.37 billion U.S. dollars., 4769=NBA league revenue - additional information The teams of the NBA generated combined revenues of around 4.8 billion U.S. dollars in the 2013/14. This marks the highest figure to-date and is an increase of 230 million U.S. dollars on the figure from the previous season. The average revenue per franchise throughout the whole of the NBA was 159.6 million U.S. dollars in 2013/14, a slight increase compared to the average revenue in 2012/13, which stood at 152 million U.S. dollars. The team which garnered the most individual revenue was the Los Angeles Lakers, who generated almost 300 million U.S. dollars in the 2013/14 season. The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA, and have won 16 NBA championships. The only other teams to create revenue of over 200 million U.S. dollars in the season were the New York Knicks, the Brooklyn Nets and the Chicago Bulls. The Knicks won two NBA championships in the 1970s, but have struggled to return to their former glory in recent years. In the 2012/13 season, the team won its first division title in 19 years but was eliminated in the second round by the Indiana Pacers. Gate receipts made up 27.55 percent of the total revenue of the NBA in 2013/14, and teams also generated revenue though television deals with local broadcasters. The LA Lakers signed a deal in 2012/13 with local broadcasters including Time Warner Cable and Sportsnet which will see them earn 200 million U.S. dollars annually for the next 20 years. Miami Heat and Brooklyn Nets both have smaller deals which earn them 20 million U.S. dollars per year.}",
