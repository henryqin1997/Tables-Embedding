I was already used to working several hours, so my dorm life was not as much as I know it could have being that I worked and attended school at the same time.

Yet, when I did eat on campus, our meals were great and now I understand that meals are healthier than what they were in 2008., 34059=The dorm rooms are not the best at TSU. However, they plan to build a new dorm by the year 2014. Hale, Rudolph and the on campus apartments are the best living spots.}",
