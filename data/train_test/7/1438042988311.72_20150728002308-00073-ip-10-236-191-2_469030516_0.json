The Gators shot a 2-over-par 290 and share second place with No. 2 Georgia. Florida held the lead for a portion of the day, but top-ranked Alabama closed round one in impressive fashion and finished at 3-under 285, five shots better than second place. LSU is in fourth at 4-over 292, and Mississippi State is in fifth following a 5-over 293. \u0093We didn\u0092t finish like we wanted to, but I thought we put ourselves in a good position,\u0094 UF head coach Buddy Alexander said. \u0093Tyson (Alexander) got off to a good start and everyone fed off that. We dropped some shots coming in, but we got off to a solid start.\u0094 The par-72, 7,331-yard Frederica Golf Club yielded only one team round under par. Windy conditions combined with undulating greens served as an obstacle for low scores at the course that is playing host to its first SEC Championship. \u0093The golf course did a good job identifying the best teams,\u0094 Alexander said. \u0093It is a long course with very difficult greens. It is exactly what we thought it was going to be. It is in fabulous shape, and we consider it an honor to play here.\u0094 Horschel returned to championship form with his 1-under round that put him in a four-way tie for fourth place. Alabama\u0092s Joseph Sykora is the clubhouse leader following a 4-under 68. Ole Miss\u0092 Jesse Speirs and Alabama\u0092s Michael Thompson, the nation\u0092s No. 2 player, share second place with 2-under 70s. \u0093Billy played well today,\u0094 Alexander said. \u0093He had a chance to be close to the lead. He was patient, and I was proud of how he played.\u0094, 517=Second round action gets underway at 8 a.m. ET. Florida, Alabama and Georgia are in the final pairings that begin at 10:30 a.m. ET.

Junior Toby Ragland (Jacksonville, Fla.) is in a tie for 58th position following a round of 80 (+8). \u00a0 Horschel fired an even-par front nine before turning it on by playing his next six holes at 3-under, which included back-to-back birdies at 11 and 12. He dropped two shots with bogeys on holes 16 and 17 and finished his back nine at 1-under. Senior Manuel Villegas\u0092 (Medellin, Colombia) even-par round of 72 was highlighted by an eagle-three on the par-5 15th. Villegas, who is in eighth place with eight other players, added a birdie and three bogeys to his round. \u00a0 Sophomore Tyson Alexander (Gainesville, Fla.) got off to a stellar start that saw him hold sole possession of the lead at one point during the day.
