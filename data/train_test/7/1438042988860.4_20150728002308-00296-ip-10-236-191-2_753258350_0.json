Most of more than 100 residents and community who attended a meeting Monday night at the Waddy Ruritan Club, expressed certainty that a rogue dog, or dogs, is responsible for the mauled calves and goats, at least five of which have had to be euthanized, which were found between Nov. 30 and Dec. 6. And now there could be confirmation coming.}",
