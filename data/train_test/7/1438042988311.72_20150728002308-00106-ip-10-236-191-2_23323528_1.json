            "Overall, I loved what this suit brought to the table. I cannot emphasize enough that this suit rocks in warmer waters where the water temperatures will be on the high side of wet suit legal temperatures. The shorter legs are more welcome and the faster transitions can be taken advantage of in these races as opposed to cold water races and training."
