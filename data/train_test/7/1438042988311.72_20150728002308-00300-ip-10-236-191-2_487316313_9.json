For example, the Ribavirin and antigen can be employed in admixture with conventional excipients (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral, enteral (e.g., oral) or topical application that do not deleteriously react with the Ribavirin and/or antigen). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohols, gum arabic, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, polyetylene glycols, gelatine, carbohydrates such as lactose, amylose or starch, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, perfume oil, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, pentaerythritol fatty acid esters, hydroxy methylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, etc. Many more suitable carriers are described in Remmington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th Edition, Easton:Mack Publishing Company, pages 1405-1412 and 1461-1487(1975) and The National Formulary XIV, 14th Edition, Washington, American Pharmaceutical Association (1975), herein expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties. Vaccines can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, coloring, flavoring and/or aromatic substances and the like that do not deleteriously react with Ribavirin or the antigen., 31659=At two and four weeks following i.p. immunization, all mice were bled by retro-orbital sampling. Serum samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibodies to rNS3. To determine the antibody titer, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was performed. (See e.g., Hultgren et al., J Gen Virol. 79:2381-91 (1998) and Hultgren et al., Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 4:630-632 (1997), both of which are herein expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties). The antibody levels were recorded as the highest serum dilution giving an optical density at 405 nm more than twice that of non-immunized mice., 54898=Vaccines comprising various antigens and amounts of these antigens have been provided to animals for many years. Thus, conventional vaccine preparations can be modified by adding an amount of Ribavirin that is sufficient to enhance an immune response to the antigen. That is, existing conventional vaccine formulations can be modified by simply adding Ribavirin to the preparation or by administering the conventional vaccine in conjunction with Ribavirin (e.g., shortly before or after providing the antigen). As one of skill in the art will appreciate, the amount of antigens in a vaccine can vary depending on the type of antigen and its immunogenicity. The amount of antigens in the vaccines can vary accordingly. Nevertheless, as a general guide, the vaccines can have approximately 0.25 mg-2000 mg of an antigen (e.g., a hepatitis viral antigen)., 48271=Preferred nucleic acid-based antigens include a nucleotide sequence of at least 9 consecutive nucleotides of HCV (SEQ. ID. No. 13), HBV (SEQ. ID. No.: 14), or HAV (SEQ. ID. No. 15). That is, a nucleic acid based antigen can comprise at least 9-25 consecutive nucleotides, 25-50 consecutive nucleotides, 50-100 consecutive nucleotides, 100-200 consecutive nucleotides, 200-500 consecutive nucleotides, 500-1000 consecutive nucleotides, 1000-2000 consecutive nucleotides, 2000-4000 consecutive nucleotides, 4000-8000 consecutive nucleotides, and 8000-9416 consecutive nucleotides of any one of SEQ. ID. Nos.: 13-15 or an RNA that corresponds to these sequences., 34508=This characterization assay can be used with any Ribavirin derivative or combinations of Ribavirin derivatives to determine the extent that a particular vaccine formulation modulates a cellular immune response. To determine CD4+ T cell responses to Ribavirin-containing vaccine, groups of mice were immunized s.c. with either 100 \u03bcg rNS3 in PBS or 100 \u03bcg rNS3 and 1 mg Ribavirin in PBS. The mice were sacrificed ten days post-immunization and their lymph nodes were harvested and drained. In vitro recall assays were then performed. (See e.g., Hultgren et al., J Gen Virol. 79:2381-91 (1998) and Hultgren et al., Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 4:630-632 (1997), both of which are herein expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties). The amount of CD4+ T cell proliferation was determined at 96 h of culture by the incorporation of [3H] thymidine., 44479=For example, HCV vaccine embodiments comprise Ribavirin and a HCV peptide of at least 3 consecutive amino acids of SEQ. ID. No.: 1. That is, a vaccine embodiment can have Ribavirin and a HCV peptide with a length of at least 3-10 consecutive amino acids, 10-50 consecutive amino acids, 50-100 consecutive amino acids, 100-200 consecutive amino acids, 200-400 consecutive amino acids, 400-800 consecutive amino acids, 800-1200 consecutive amino acids, 1200-1600 consecutive amino acids, 1600-2000 consecutive amino acids, 2000-2500 consecutive amino acids, and 2500-3011 consecutive amino acids of SEQ ID. No. 1. Preferred HCV vaccines comprise Ribavirin and a peptide of at least 3 consecutive amino acids of HCV core protein (SEQ. ID. No. 2), HCV E1 protein (SEQ. ID. No. 3), HCV E2 protein (SEQ. ID. No. 4), HCV NS2 (SEQ. ID. No. 5), HCV NS3 (SEQ. ID. No. 6), HCV NS4A (SEQ. ID. No. 7), HCV NS4B (SEQ. ID. No. 8), or HCV NS5A/B (SEQ. ID. No. 9). That is, preferred HCV vaccines can comprise Ribavirin and a peptide with a length of at least 3-10 consecutive amino acids, 10-50 consecutive amino acids, 50-100 consecutive amino acids, 100-200 consecutive amino acids, 200-400 consecutive amino acids, 400-800 consecutive amino acids, and 800-1040 consecutive amino acids of any one of (SEQ. ID. Nos. 2-9)., 17172=The use of vaccines to prevent disease in humans, farm livestock, sports animals, and household pets is a common practice. Frequently, however, the antigen used in a vaccine is not sufficiently immunogenic to raise the antibody titre to levels that are sufficient to provide protection against subsequent challenge or to maintain the potential for mounting these levels over extended time periods. Further, many vaccines are altogether deficient in inducing cell-mediated immunity, which is a primary immune defense against bacterial and viral infection. A considerable amount of research is currently focussed on the development of more potent vaccines and ways to enhance the immunogenicity of antigen-containing preparations. (See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,056,961; 6,060,068; 6,063,380; and Li et al., Science 288:2219-2222 (2000))., 57436=Compositions having Ribavirin and an antigen that are suitable for transdermal administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable suspensions, oils, creams, and ointments applied directly to the skin or incorporated into a protective carrier such as a transdermal device (\u201ctransdermal patch\u201d). Examples of suitable creams, ointments, etc. can be found, for instance, in the Physician's Desk Reference. Examples of suitable transdermal devices are described, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,818,540 issued Apr. 4, 1989 to Chinen, et al., herein expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety., 53512=Since Ribavirin has been on the market for several years, many dosage forms and routes of administration are known. All known dosage forms and routes of administration can be provided within the context of the embodiments described herein. Preferably, an amount of Ribavirin that is effective to enhance an immune response to an antigen in an animal can be considered to be an amount that is sufficient to achieve a blood serum level of antigen approximately 0.25-12.5 \u03bcg/ml in the animal, preferably, about 2.5 \u03bcg/ml. In some embodiments, the amount of Ribavirin is determined according to the body weight of the animal to be given the vaccine. Accordingly, the amount of Ribavirin in a vaccine formulation can be from about 0.1-6.0 mg/kg body weight. That is, some embodiments have an amount of Ribavirin that corresponds to approximately 0.1-1.0 mg/kg, 1.1-2.0 mg/kg, 2.1-3.0 mg/kg, 3.1-4.0 mg/kg, 4.1-5.0 mg/kg, 5.1, and 6.0 mg/kg body weight of an animal. More conventionally, the vaccines contain approximately 0.25 mg-2000 mg of Ribavirin. That is, some embodiments have approximately 250 \u03bcg, 500 \u03bcg, 1 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, 300 mg, 350 mg, 400 mg, 450 mg, 500 mg, 550 mg, 600 mg, 650 mg, 700 mg, 750 mg, 800 mg, 850 mg, 900 mg, 1 g, 1.1 g, 1.2 g, 1.3 g, 1.4 g, 1.5 g, 1.6 g, 1.7 g, 1.8 g, 1.9 g, and 2 g of Ribavirin., 45818=Similarly, preferred HBV vaccine embodiments comprise Ribavirin and a HBV peptide of at least 3 consecutive amino acids of HBsAg (SEQ. ID. No.: 10) or HBcAg and HBeAg (SEQ. ID. No. 11). That is, a vaccine embodiment can have Ribavirin and a HBV peptide with a length of at least 3-10 consecutive amino acids, 10-50 consecutive amino acids, 50-100 consecutive amino acids, 100-150 consecutive amino acids, 150-200 consecutive amino acids, and 200-226 consecutive amino acids of either SEQ. ID. No. 10 or SEQ. ID. No. 11. Further, preferred HAV embodiments comprise Ribavirin and a HAV peptide with a length of at least 3-10 consecutive amino acids, 10-50 consecutive amino acids, 50-100 consecutive amino acids, 100-200 consecutive amino acids, 200-400 consecutive amino acids, 400-800 consecutive amino acids, 800-1200 consecutive amino acids, 1200-1600 consecutive amino acids, 1600-2000 consecutive amino acids, and 2000-2227 consecutive amino acids of SEQ ID. No. 12., 16093=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/719,619 filed on Nov. 20, 2003, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/104,966 filed on Mar. 22, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,059 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/705,547 filed on Nov. 3, 2000, now abandoned both of which claim the benefit of priority of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/229,175, filed Aug. 29, 2000. The aforementioned applications are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties., 20140=In addition to antiviral activity, investigators have observed that a few guanosine analogs have an effect on the immune system. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,063,772 and 4,950,647). Ribavirin has been shown to inhibit functional humoral immune responses (Peavy et al., J. Immunol., 126:861-864 (1981); Powers et al., Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother., 22:108-114 (1982)) and IgE-mediated modulation of mast cell secretion. (Marquardt et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therapeutics, 240:145-149 (1987)). Some investigators report that a daily oral therapy of Ribavirin has an immune modulating effect on humans and mice. (Hultgren et al., J. Gen. Virol., 79:2381-2391 (1998) and Cramp et al., Gastron. Enterol., 118:346-355 (2000)). Nevertheless, the current understanding of the effects of Ribavirin on the immune system is in its infancy.}",
