Various changes or modifications of the method of the invention or the product produced thereby might occur to workers in the an without departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. The method of producing a ferrule having an angled, domed end face as shown and described herein results in approximately a one hundred percent coincidence of the radius vertex and the fiber axis, requires no special ferrule blanks, and is consistent in result. The method is relatively simple and quickly accomplished. Ferrules made with the present method assure good contact and registration between the fibers of mating ferrules without the necessity of compressing the ferrule ends, and despite temperature variations or extremes. d. a 0.3 micron aluminum oxide polishing film at 150 gr/mm2 for 3 seconds. c. a 1 micron diamond polishing film at 150 gr/mm2 pressure for 60 seconds; and b. a 3 micron diamond polishing film at 150 gr/mm2 pressure for 30 seconds: a. a 6 micron diamond polishing film at 150 gr/mm2 pressure for 45 seconds; 2.
