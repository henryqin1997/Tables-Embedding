    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{225329=Societal change in the use of kanji when composing Japanese and changes in the use of ruby implementations in text layout methods have been affecting the usage of ruby itself. Ruby was not very popular while the Touyou Kanji Table (\u5f53\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u8868) (the list of kanji characters for everyday use, issued by the Government on November 16, 1946) was in effect because, in principle, it discouraged the use of furigana in its 'directions for use' section. The Jouyou Kanji Table (\u5e38\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u8868) (the list of kanji characters in common use, issued by the Government to replace the Touyou Kanji Table on October 10, 1981) has changed the scope of the list. (The Touyou Kanji Table defined the list of all kanji characters that can be used for any documents, while the Jouyou Kanji Table was designed to be a 'reference guide' for the use of kanji to compose contemporary Japanese for general use in society.) For example, the preface of the Jouyou Kanji Table states that one may consider the use of 'furigana (annotations to indicate pronunciation)' when the text appears too difficult to read. This is why the use of ruby has been increasing today. The use of ruby is common in magazines and books, and even newspapers have begun to use ruby these days., 226817=The specification of ruby composition was first introduced in the second revision of JIS X 4051, which was further revised in 2004 to add jukugo-ruby, katatsuki-ruby and the dual ruby composition with which two distinct runs of ruby are attached to the same base characters (4.12 Ruby Composition)., 188586=There must be no space between any characters described in 3.1.10 Unbreakable Character Sequences.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "A.1 Opening brackets (cl-01) General punctuation marks are script neutral in ISO/IEC 10646 and there is no \"Opening Ideographic Parenthesis\" specifically encoded for CJK scripts in the standard. However, because of the typographic difference among scripts with respect to base line position as well as width and glyph design, the same set of punctuation marks usually do not fit to both Latin and Japanese text. To work around this issue, many existing implementations use compatibility characters encoded separately in the standard for the purpose of round-trip integrity with the legacy encoding standards. For example, while this document lists U+0028 LEFT PARENTHESIS as a member of opening brackets (cl-01), the compatibility counterpart U+FF08 FULLWIDTH LEFT PARENTHESIS is used in the Japanese context in most Japanese text layout software. (note 1) The following are lists of (non-ideographic) characters from a subset of ISO/IEC 10646 (collection number 285 \"BASIC JAPANESE\" and 286 \"JAPANESE NON IDEOGRAPHICS EXTENSION\") grouped by character class according to the classification explained in 3.9.2 Grouping of Characters and Symbols depending on their Positioning.
