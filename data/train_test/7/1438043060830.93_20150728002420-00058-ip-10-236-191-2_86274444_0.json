EPA defines a sole or principal source aquifer as one which supplies at least fifty percent (50%) of the drinking water consumed in the area overlying the aquifer. These areas can have no alternative drinking water source(s) which could physically, legally, and economically supply all those who depend upon the aquifer for drinking water. For convenience, all designated sole or principal source aquifers are referred to as \"sole source aquifers\" (SSA). Sole Source Aquifer designation is one tool to protect drinking water supplies in areas with few or no alternative sources to the ground water resource, and where if contamination occurred, using an alternative source would be extremely expensive. The designation protects an area's ground water resource by requiring EPA to review all proposed projects within the designated area that will receive federal financial assistance. All proposed projects receiving federal funds",
