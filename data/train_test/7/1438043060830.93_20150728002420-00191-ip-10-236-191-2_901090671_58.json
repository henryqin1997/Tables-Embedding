            "Very important and very thought out at SBCC. The Campus security is everywhere and will walk you to your car of class at night or during the day. The campus is easy to navigate and quite open with a feeling of safety through out. People of all ages are on this campus as it is a City College and they all feel comfortable being there.",
            "So many to list.",
            "Best for people who are friendly, active and love to play!",
            "School and Sun. The best academics and the best beach ever. WOW",
            "This is the place for FUN. Surfing, SUP, kayaking, hiking, mountain biking, running, volleyball, tennis, golf and every outdoor sport you can imagine. The weather is beautiful 365 days a year. The night life on the main drag is famous for pool, darts, movies, small stores, and drinking (if you are 21). There is definitely something for everyone. LA is just a short 1 1/2 hour drive south and SF is a longer drive north but accessible. Have FUN",
            "SBCC has a culinary program that cooks for the cafeteria and cafe. So one gets the tastiest food whenever one needs to recharge their batteries.",
            "The teachers want to be here and want to give you the best education ever. The classes are hard and the teachers are always available for help, questions, and discussions. If you are willing they are there to push you forward.",
            "1. Try every different class you ever thought you might be interested in. 2. Join many different groups, clubs and activities to feel connected to the school. 3. Go to the Tutoring Lab. They are great!",
            "SBCC is the #1 City College in the Nation. It does not get any better than that on every level of academics, support, and beauty. It is the BEST place to start your education."

In the complex, they had a dining area that was open from 8:00-9:00 and always had quality food available. Each morning you could order an omelet with your choice of fillings or multiple other breakfast options. The lunch menu was full of healthy dishes and appetizing sides. For dinner you have many different options from a double cheese burger to fresh salmon, all of which covered by your rent! You can go in as much as you want and pig out as much as you could. Again, the do your dishes!!, 202144=SBCC is a very friendly campus and very divers. Its also very cheap and has nice weather. Good value, was voted #1 in the nation of 2013., 303215=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 246812=Luckily SBCC (Santa Barbara City College) is an open enrollment university, so don't stress about GPA or SAT scores. If you graduated highschool, currently possess a GED, or are 18 years old, you can be admitted to the university. The best thing you can do before arriving here is to pack shorts and t-shirts because that's about all that anyone wears out here! Even in February the mid-afternoon never dips below 60 degrees. On a more serious note, I do advocate mentally preparing yourself for a collegiate lifestyle, this is it. Just because it's a community college don't assume you'll skate by and get away with truancy and disrespect. This place is built to help you succeed, and gives many students a gateway or second chance into the university of their dreams, treat it with respect., 160604=Halloween is a week long party in Santa Barbara. Flotopia is also a big party day centered around the beach and day drinking. Great tip, its easy to avoid the partying by not living in Isla Vista. If you live in Isla Vista you will most likely have to party often. May be a good or bad thing., 241366=SBCC is a spectacular value, especially if you're in-state California. Out of state's (Such as myself) only paid $3000 for a semester of 5 classes, since you pay by the unit. (15 units x 200 a unit = $3000). In state pay significantly less, and most of my friends from California were only paying $1500 a semester. That's only $3000 dollars A YEAR for a world class education that you can carry with you for 2 years before you transfer to a major university. Let's look at it this way: Myself, out of state, pay $6000 in tuition a year. If I had attended UCSB (University of California Santa Barbara) I would have been paying roughly $35,000 dollars in tuition FOR ONE YEAR. So for 2 years of my 4 year degree, I will be paying $12,000 dollars, vs, $70,000 dollars. I don't know about you, but the math there is pretty convincing. With student loan debts on the rise, it makes a lot of sense to keep it cheap while you can.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students To all prospective students, I would definitely recommend attending Santa Barbara City College. A lot of people have a negative connotation associated with a community college. They think it's where people go who can't get in to better schools. Well, that is false! I am proof of that. I got in to UCSB and Cal Poly SLO right out of high school. But I chose to attend SBCC first because I knew that I would be saving money, and receiving an equally, if not better, education! Santa Barbara City College has so much to offer its students. Bang for the buck SBCC definitely gives you more bang for your buck. The units are so cheap compared to what you will pay elsewhere, and the classes are just as good, if not better! I would say they are better, because you're getting smaller class sizes which helps you fully learn the material. Plus, the teachers actually care about their students and want to see you succeed. Honestly, you will do better in classes at community college, and you are paying less. So you are paying less money, to do better in school, than you would if you were to take the same classes at a 4 year university. Honestly, I was going to transfer after two years, but i've decided to stay an extra year, take some",
