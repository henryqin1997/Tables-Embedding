Hungarian was used along with Latin and German in the records of all areas of the old kingdom of Hungary before 1918. This includes present-day Hungary, Slovakia, southwestern Ukraine, western Romania, Serbia, Croatia and the easternmost part of Austria. To read Hungarian records in these languages, use the Latin Genealogical Word List (34077) and German Genealogical Word List (34067).
