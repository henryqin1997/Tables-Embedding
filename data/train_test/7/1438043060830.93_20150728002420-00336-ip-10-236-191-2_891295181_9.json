            "From what I've heard, the food is good, but I've never eaten at the cafeteria myself.",
            "I don't have any experience with the dorms.",
            "The College of Central Florida is very focused on academic excellence and has many programs that center around maintaining good grades.",
            "For incoming students, pay attention to due dates, because most teachers don't accept late work. Keep your work in line with a collegiate standard and always get enough sleep to be ready for morning classes.",
            "The College of Central Florida has a wide array of majors and classes to fulfill the needs of any students. The teachers are helpful and very involved with the learning of their students. I believe any student will greatly enjoy their time at CF."

These students are the ones that make sure there are activities around campus that allow for all students to attend. African American Student Union (AASU) is a club that brings minority awareness and allows guest speakers on campus to bring about this awareness as well. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus Most students have never heard of Set Friday at the College of Central Florida. This is where certain clubs set up an event that includes music, dancing, food, and games. It is held behind the gym and because most students do not have school friday they are not aware of the event. What to do for fun Almost every week there are events that occur during activity hour. This allows students to get to know the clubs around campus as well as the people. They have intramural sports, which are very fun to cheer on the sidelines too or even meet the athletes around campus.
