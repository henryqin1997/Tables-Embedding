Mutations in this gene have been associated with familial dysautonomia.

Elongator may play a role in chromatin remodeling and is involved in acetylation of histones H3 and probably H4. Involved in cell migration. Involved in neurogenesis (By similarity). Regulates the migration and branching of projection neurons in the developing cerebral cortex, through a process depending on alpha-tubulin acetylation (By similarity).
