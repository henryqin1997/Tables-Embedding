            "People who love to be near the beach & want to finish school on a budget as well as within a good amount of time. I also hear the Nursing program is one of the best in the County.",
            "The gardens in the Ag department are beautiful & serene. There are some orchards on the East side of campus that are well worth the walk as well.",
            "Look into scholarships or federal aid, it's always worth the time. Also, to get the bang for your buck, take the time to get to know your teachers. They appreciate the eye contact or the words of encouragement.",
            "There is an awesome Agriculture Club & the garden area is one of the prettiest spots on campus. There are other clubs that can fit almost any hobby or interest.",
            "The cafeteria has just recently been closed because there is a huge lacking in funds. There was a great salad bar before it closed though!",
            "There are no dorms on this campus.",
            "Coming from a public high school was an easy transition & not nearly as difficult as it should have been. A challenge is something to be desired.",
            "Take the time to look into your prospective teachers, sign up for classes early and check out the library's art.",
            "Ventura College is a small Junior college close in proximity to both the beach as well as hiking trails in the beautiful mountains of Ventura County. There have been wonderful teachers as well as terrible ones just like at any school, but the good out weigh the bad. Many new facilities have just been built this past semester & they look beautiful & are well used."

Tips for prospective students Have a good attitude, check in with a counselor twice a year to make sure you're on track. Take advantage of extra curricular activities. Bang for the buck Finishing up my second year here as probably saved me $60,000!!! Am enjoying being here I have grown a lot since high school by using the community college as a stepping stone to a 4 year school. It has allowed me time for jobs, internships and balancing that with my homework. Am learning a lot I have been pleasantly surprized at how much I have learned. The teachers for the most part are very good and easy to deal with. Login to rate or flag the reviews Gabriele from Fillmore, CA 07/27/2012 Reviewer is A current",
