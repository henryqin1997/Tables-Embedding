            "Don't be surprised if you see Campus Security walking around even during the day; and try to brighten their day with a quick hello and a bright, cheery smile!",
            "So far I haven't seen anyone running around in a toga, but I've only been here a few months so it may still happen. Fingers crossed it doesn't though, well unless I've got a camera with me!",
            "There are so many clubs, sports, and activities here you won't be able to pick just one! For all you spook-lovers, UMW has its own Paranormal Investigation club called UMW PI!",
            "UMW is a college that is especially suited towards, a small town attitude. This is a place where taking a walk at 3 a.m is most likely only going to get you in trouble with Campus Security, not get you kidnapped by some creep. It is especially suited towards students who have a hard time focusing on six or seven subjects at a time, as UMW students take only one class at a time 3 hours a day 5 days a week for 18 days! Go block scheduling!",
            "For anyone looking for a good ghost story behind their campus, you've come to the right place at UMW! As the fourth floor of Main Hall is haunted by the ghost of a little girl hit by a car on her way to piano lessons on the fourth floor of Main Hall.",
            "Personally I feel that there is no better place to attend college than UMW, as you find that every teacher will go out of their way to help you understand the course. This level of commitment is something hard to obtain in a bigger more prestigious school like Yale or Harvard.",
            "There are many things to do at UMW, the fair grounds are host to many rodeos, fairs, and concerts. The Met offers a more bar/ night club setting for those of you old enough to drink! Also our neighboring cities of Butte, Bannack, and Virginia City also offer a more metropolitan (in the case of Butte), and historical environment to visit. There is also a Hotsprings very near by that you can relax and enjoy!",
            "It will never be as good as a home-cooked meal, but it is definately better than a high-school cafeteria! Also PizzaHut is your friend, and always tip the delivery guy!",
            "Expect the unexpected; and don't be afraid to tell your roommate to turn off the light, their music, or just to generally shut up.",
            "While you may think that having only one class a day is a breeze, keep in mind that you're learning an entire year's worth of information in 18 days! Though I have to admit some classes do seem to be extremely easy.",
            "Schedule a trip to Dillon, look around the campus, talk to students or faculty, examine the dorms, eat at the cafeteria, and find that elusive Post Office!",
            "The University of Montana-Western is an exciting and memorable place to attend college. It has some of the most gorgeous scenery in western Montana. UMW is the place to go for higher education!"

With Experience One, you will be in groups and your teacher will act as a facilitator instead of a dictator. Tips for prospective students Take advantage of LACE. They will help you study for tests, read your papers, and give you tips for your classes. Bang for the buck It is cheaper than the two main colleges in Montana.",
