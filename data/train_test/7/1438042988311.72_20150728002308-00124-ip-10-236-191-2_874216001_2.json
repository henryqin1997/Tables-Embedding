On Thao\u2019s second album, We Brave Bee Stings and All, the feel is one of childlike playfulness, with skipping, lighthearted arrangements belying the more somber content of her lyrics. Put on Bee Stings, produced by Tucker Martine (Decemberists, Sufjan Stevens), and enjoy the finger-snapping, banjos and trombones. \u201cBeat (Health, Life and Fire)\u201d opens the album with punchy, acoustic guitars and a marching snare drum, while Thao\u2019s lilting vocals trill like a songbird about betrayal and disappointment.\u00a0 \u201cBag of Hammers\u201d is utterly charming, replete with tongue-clucking and maracas, serving to delay the revelation of the narrator\u2019s intent with the subject at hand. Thao has a talented band on board, adding the expected as well as the unexpected (Wurlitzer piano, Hammond B3 organ, Marxaphone, melodica and more) to her own piano and guitar playing, and giving her songs a lively, full sound with varied textures.\u00a0Her cover of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cYou Really Got a Hold On Me\u201d is languid and lovely, an ethereal pleasure., 126021=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
