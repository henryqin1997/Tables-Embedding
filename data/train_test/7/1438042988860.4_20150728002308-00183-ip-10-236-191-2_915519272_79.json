            "There are several clubs and events around campus. There is a gym one can go to and there is a student lounge with a pool table, ping pong table and plenty of tv's as well. Your free to bring cards to play and on occasion there will be video game consoles in the lounge to play with your fellow students.",
            "Theres is no dedicated food on the campus I go to. There are four campuses, soon to be five, and the Dade city campus one does not have food establishments on campus. Make sure to either bring food to eat, or stop by the surrounding town and find a local place to eat.",
            "There are no dorms on campus so make sure to be prepared to have a housing arrangement set-up prior to your semester starting.",
            "The classes I have taken have varied in difficulty but for the most part as long as you work hard, complete your assignments, participate in class then you will be able to be proficient in passing your class. The hardest classes are science group of classes including chemistry, biology, anatomy etc. It also depends on your professor as those subjects have a priority on memorization be prepared for that.",
            "A good thing to do is to make sure to get your textbooks, used, rented or even buy online as with much colleges the prices are quite high. Also having fellow students numbers or email just in case you miss class or need help is also a good tool as well. Show up to class, study hard, utilize free tutoring if needed, and ask help from fellow students or the professor if you need help.",
            "A campus that is situated in a peaceful environment and a great community college. Great professors, small classes, affordable tuition, and many free events to go to around campus. You cant go wrong with cheap tuition, small classes and plenty of classes to choose from."

I started my classes in August of this year and I'm amazed at how much I have accomplished., 46477=I just started attending this school this year (January). So far, the two teachers I have taken a class with have been very nice and helpful. I met with an adviser once who was quite nice as well, but not real knowledgeable about the field of study I wish to enter (marine biology). Truthfully for the money, it is a pretty good college so far. I plan to pick back up with classes in January., 365852=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 212702=There is also something going on at Pasco-Hernando Community College. For example, this being the month of October, PHCC is holding a trick or treat day for your kids and/or siblings. There is always free food and games to play held by the many clubs here at PHCC.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students The biggest tip I could give is to take at least one English Composition course before attempting classes that comply with the Gordon Writing Rule. Many of the classes require MLA documentation and that is best taught in English Composition I. Bang for the buck PHCC definitely beats going to a university for the first two years of college. compared to a university, PHCC is by far cheaper. If you are a resident, i highly recommend taking advantage of dual enrollment to save even more money. Will enjoy being here Their 4 campuses are beautiful and well equipped, with a great atmosphere for both learning and fun.
