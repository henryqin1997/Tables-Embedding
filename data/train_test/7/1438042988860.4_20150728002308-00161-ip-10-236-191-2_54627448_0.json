For example, to create a variable called City that can hold up to 25 characters, you would type: city: String[25]; If you do not include a maximum size, the string is given a default maximum size = 255.

Operator Precedence The following precedence table applies to Real and Integer operators. Parentheses always have the highest priority, and operators of equal priority are always performed left to right. Priority Operation First * / DIV MOD Second + - For example: To evaluate 4.0 + 6.0 * 3.0, you must follow the precedence table and perform the multiplication first, and the addition second. Hence, evaluating this expression will always give an answer of 22.0. If you want to perform the addition first, you must include the 4.0 + 6.0",
