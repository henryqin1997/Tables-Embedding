            "The campus offers free patrol escorts to any location on campus. Don't be afraid to call, each of the officers is kind and enjoys promoting safety.",
            "There are a lot of organizations on campus, though many of them do not do much throughout the year. This would be a negative but the possibilities to get involved and make an impact are massive. Even if an organization needs direction, they almost all have a great foundation for which to begin. All that is needed is a little bit of motivation and the opportunities are nearly endless.",
            "Independent, self-motivated leaders",
            "A lot cheaper than many other universities nearby with excellent programs. Get to know the faculty, the key to success at any university.",
            "The best source for fun n campus is probably the new Recreation Center. With rock-climbing, yoga, swimming and great workout equipment this is the best place to unwind after a rigorous school week. There are several great bars around town if that is more up your alley, The Boulevard is a local pub offering student discounts and local brews.",
            "With the addition of the Student Union building the dining options are much better than they used to be, though still pale in comparison to other universities. The Blue Raider Grille is possibly the best source of food on campus though it is also the most pricey.",
            "The dorm life is difficult here mainly because you cannot stay in your room during winter break. Each student is required to move out and move back in between each semester, this adds unnecessary stress for returning students.",
            "Depending on your level of study the professors are quite different, in many of the upper level courses it is common for the students to do much of the learning on their own and use the classroom time to ask questions and go into depth for each of the topics. For many of the lower-level classes though the classroom is very relaxed, the professors know that your education is what you make of it and not what they have you memorize.",
            "Get involved! I know this may sound cliche, but it helps so much. Attend a few meetings for clubs in your desired major and other fields of interest. The best way to maintain great grades here is to start study groups early and do not hesitate to ask questions of the professors. Every professor that I have had the pleasure to know at this university has been excited to help students learn. Standing out will help you fit in here.",
            "With wonderful opportunities for campus involvement, this university is a great place to build your resume. The career development center also does a great job in helping aid students for the work force by providing resume assistance, pointers on getting a great letter of recommendation and they even have clothing that can be borrowed for interviews. The best part of this campus is definitely the students, everyone that gets involved has a real desire to succeed and get the best education possible."

There is also a building called the KOM its located on the northwest side of MT it was the first learning building built at MTSU., 22802=The academics are some of the best in the country seeing as we're ranked #47 in public colleges for 2010-2011. I feel that there is so much offered that is free here, but cost at other colleges. Free printing and other services on campus, who could not love that?, 951390=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 28354=It's a wonderful school for music people! They have a GREAT music program! If I may say so, it's the best in the state of Tennessee! The Honors Program is great! It has wonderful professors and a great building (although it's kind of far from the center of campus). MTSU started off as a teacher college. The new education building is having the finishing touches put on it as we speak. There should also be a new parking garage in a few years and by the end of the fall 2011 semester (I think) the new Student Union will be finished! So students looking for the old and the new both encompasses in a campus should look no further than MTSU!, 583348=If you are a young adult looking for a good education, you may find it here! Be sure to have your ducks in a row math wise, since they seem to keep students in a never ending loop of taking math 1100 semester after semester and ultimately ends in failure!, 639934=Applications are on a first come first serve basis. If you apply in January, usually you know if you have been accepted in a month or two., 512071=I attended MTSU from 2007-2009 and loved it. The campus is welcoming, beautiful, and the possibilities for involvement are endless. I am excited to be going back this coming spring to finish my degree as a non-traditional student., 139395=There is a great selection of food on this campus like Pizza Hut Chick-fil-a and an Asian place along with other favorites! MTSU is all about good for for there students there are 2 dining halls and snack machines everywhere and the new student union building with all new restaurants will be open Fall 2012., 913621=It's Murfreesboro. There is a good deal of crime here but the amount of cops here probably outnumbers the citizens in this city 2:1. Just be smart about where you're going and when/with who., 544638=1. Meet as many new people as possible! It's college you will need them! 2. I would not recommend 8 O'clock classes unless you are a morning person. 3. Remember that some science classes require a lab, which makes this a 4 credit hour class., 387698=can't say, i haven't had class yet. im an incoming freshman 2012, 766450=There is a 24/7 police force that works only for MTSU. Call 2424 and they will be there in three minutes or less. There is also a texting alert system that alerts students if there is a part of campus one should avoid, like if there was an armed robbery or bomb threat. The campus police will even walk you to and from buildings at night if you get scared.}",

Also, even though Murfreesboro seems like a small town, MTSU is huge - with over 25,000 students! One you here, you HAVE to get involved. Find something you enjoy and meet others with the same interests. Also, MTSU is not car-friendly. Parking is never fun, so living in a dorm will be very easy to navigate the campus. Bang for the buck It's a very cheap school compared to a whole lot of other universities and MTSU is just as good. Most professors really care about your time here as well as all of the student services. You do pay a couple thousand dollars.. but you truly get a lot out of it! Am enjoying being",
