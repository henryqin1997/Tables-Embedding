(AP) \u2014 Olympians should have figured out one thing by now: What they can or cannot wear at the London Games has very little to do with their fashion, marketing sense or patriotism, and a whole lot to do with rules, regulations and, of course, money. The overseers of the Olympics are protective of their brand and rings \u2014 considered one of the most recognizable logos in sports \u2014 and what the athletes wear when they\u2019re competing has been tightly regulated, much to the chagrin of some of the games\u2019 stars. Take Michael Phelps, for example. He recently tweeted his dismay at no longer being allowed to wear a swimming cap bearing miniature American flags on the front and back. \u201cGotta love an organizing committee telling us we can\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d he said on Twitter. But neither the International nor U.S. Olympic Committees are making any apologies. The IOC keeps a tight grip on when and where advertising and other markings can be worn at the games. After all, its coffers took in more than $2.4 billion (over the four-year period ending in 2008, for instance) in marketing rights from companies like McDonald\u2019s and Coca-Cola., 25698=The Los Alamos Monitor | lacirculation@lamonitor.com | 505-662-4185 256 DP Road, Los Alamos, NM 87544 Office Hours are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, 33377=Copyright \u00a9 2015}",
