    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Alternative embodiments can provide even greater savings. For example, if there are dedicated external memory buses (in place of shared external memory bus 21), one external data-transfer operation directed on one external memory can begin before a prior write operation to a different external memory is completed. In multi-processor systems, there are more situations in which a processor will not need to wait for the result of prior read operation to issue a request. Thus, greater use may be made of the system-bus cycles freed by the present invention. The present invention allows for system buffers that are used only for write requests or for both read and write requests. The present invention provides for system-bus buffers of different depths. These and other modifications to and variations upon the illustrated embodiments are provided for by the present invention, the scope of which is defined by the following claims. FIG. 3 indicates the savings where a memory write occupies four bus cycles. In that case, the system bus is occupied for only five of twenty cycles consumed by the memory accesses. The series of writes is completed seven bus cycles before the writes are completed. Thus, the system bus is free much sooner than it would be without the system buffer. In addition, there are system-bus cycles available before the series is completed; these can be used for non-external memory operations, such as accesses of internal memory,",
