To give you an idea how much they vary, here are a few examples: Oleg Maddox: Roll: 1 3 6 12 21 32 44 61 81 100 Pitch: 1 4 8 15 24 33 44 60 77 100 Yaw: 0 10 19 32 43 54 63 74 86 100 crazyivan1970: Roll: 27 38 52 63 69 75 83 88 93 100 Pitch: 28 44 55 62 70 79 88 93 96 100 Yaw: 29 40 48 57 66 76 86 93 95 100 plus 7 deadband. The Author: Roll: 13 21 28 39 53 65 77 88 96 100 Pitch: 22 28 37 45 54 65 77 88 97 100 Yaw: 35 41 48 56 67 76 82 89 95 100 As a starting point, the author suggests the following: Roll: 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 Pitch: 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100 Yaw: Leave it at default for the time being. In addition to the ten sensitivity sliders, there are two",
    "textAfterTable": "Further controllers will follow the same format, with the number at the end of the conf.ini designation being one less than the number at the end of the controls assignement screen. Only very rarely will this table let you down. Users of several CH controllers set up to emulate a single controller and users of Saitek HOTAS units (X-36 and X-45) using 3rd party drivers may notice some anomalies. If there are anomalies, a worst case method of finding out which line belongs to which axis is to set the values in one line at a time to all zeros then test fly the game to see which axis doesn't work. Once you have established which line in the file belongs to which axis on your controllers you can go about transferring your old sensitivity settings to your new controller configuration. This part of the process is relatively simple if you already had sensitivity settings you were happy with, it's a simpe matter of copying your old settings from where the controller sat before to the correct lines. If you haven't previously adjusted sensitivity it can take some more time, but should be approached in the same manner as you would when using the sliders in the game's hardware setup screen (see the section on sensitivity for more detail). Remember that the game only consults the conf.ini file each time you restart it, so",
