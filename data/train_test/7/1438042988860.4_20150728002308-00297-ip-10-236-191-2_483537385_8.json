Accordingly, the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims. In contrast to the prior art, the present invention utilizes a zoom control device that permits a user to quickly and easily enlarge or shrink the size of text and icons shown on the display of the handheld device. Additionally, the handheld device may have a pointing device that can be used to quickly effect scrolling of display. The zoom control device makes it easier for the user to zoom out to quickly see more information on the display, or zoom in to more easily read information on the display. In conjunction with the pointing device, the user can quickly and easily scan through information. Please refer to FIG. 14. FIG. 14 is a fourth embodiment of the present invention, a PDA 90. The PDA 90 is nearly identical to the PDA 70 except that the zoom control device has been incorporated into the pointing device. The pointing device 104 is a two-dimensional rocking switch, similar to that of the third embodiment PDA 70. However, a pressure-sensitive switch (not shown) is disposed under the central portion 106 of the rocking switch 104. A user may rock the switch 104 left, right,",
