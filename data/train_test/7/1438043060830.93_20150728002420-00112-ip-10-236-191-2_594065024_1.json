    "textBeforeTable": "Treating constipation during pregnancy Many of my patients experience constipation during pregnancy, even after increasing dietary fibre and fluids. Are there any safe treatments I can recommend to them? Although the recommended first-line therapy for constipation includes increasing fibre, fluids, and exercise, these are sometimes ineffective. Therefore, laxatives such as bulk-forming agents, lubricant laxatives, stool softeners, osmotic laxatives, and stimulant laxatives might be considered. Although few of the various types of laxatives have been assessed for safety in pregnancy, they have minimal systemic absorption. Therefore, they are not expected to be associated with an increased risk of congenital anomalies. However, it is recommended that osmotic and stimulant laxatives be used only in the short term or occasionally to avoid dehydration or electrolyte imbalances in pregnant women. It has been estimated that approximately 11% to 38% of pregnant women experience constipation, 1 which is generally described as infrequent bowel movements or difficult evacuation. 2 Pregnancy predisposes women to developing constipation owing to physiologic and anatomic changes in the gastrointestinal tract. For instance, rising progesterone levels during pregnancy and reduced motilin hormone levels lead to increases in bowel transit time. 2,3 Also, there is increased water absorption from the intestines, which causes stool to dry out. Decreased maternal activity and increased vitamin supplementation (eg, iron and calcium) can further contribute to constipation. 3 Later in pregnancy, an enlarging uterus might slow onward movement of feces. 4 Constipation can result in serious complications such as",
