    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations One skilled in art will appreciate that the foregoing embodiments are illustrative of the present invention. The present invention can be advantageously incorporated into alternative embodiments while remaining within the spirit and scope of the present invention, as defined by the appended claims. . The system and method can be used in applications above the surface, on the surface and below the surface. the system and method can be used with systems having any number of separate communication links, which can be separated by time or separated by frequency. The described invention will work with any Radiated RF Signal booster independent of frequency. The described invention will also work with WiMax routers, RFID devices, and other applications that need to collocated antennas. FIGS. 12-14 and can be used in mobile applications (e.g., land, sea, and air) as illustrated in FIGS. 6-11 . The system and method can be used for any application where the transmit antenna and the receive antenna are not collocated. The system and method can be used for fixed applications as illustrated in FIGS. 6-11 The system and method described herein can be used for any application to provide real-time amplification and radiated re-transmission of a received radiated signal without the use of frequency conversion. The system and method can be used in simplex systems (e.g., systems that provide time separated two-way communications)",
