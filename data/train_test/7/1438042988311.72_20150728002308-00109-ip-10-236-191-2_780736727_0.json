Im arriving in BKK on july 30th. and leaving to phi phi until august 6th, then going to chiang mai on the very 6th, and from there to laos and find my way down to bangkok around the 20th to finish in koh samui or koh pagang for some days of relax! I have been in almost all america and europa, but this is my first time into Asia. Im been living the most part of my life in Barcelona, Spain, then spent some time in London and now installed in Paris. Im really keen to travel a lot this summer! but i know travelling with partners is always more funny. If anybody is going to be around those dates, please let me know and we can plan something together!
