            "We have campus security that patrols around campus 24 hours a day and also we have a few police officers who do the same. We also have emergency buttons posted all throughout campus ensuring your safety.",
            "We do have a few of the Greek life chapters. They are very good people, who do not do things like hazing or anything crazy that you would see in movies. They give great opportunities for scholarships and ways to better yourself as a student.",
            "Their are so many different clubs and activities that you can participate in during the year. They also accept any new clubs that students want to make.",
            "This school is great for students who have a tight budget, yet want to get a good education.",
            "For this being such a cheap school, you get more than you paid for. You get an excellent education and also a great time.",
            "For fun, we have many activities that go on on campus. Their are signs posted all around campus inviting you to come have fun with everyone else on campus.",
            "The cafe is not very large, and they do not offer the best varieties of food, but they do their best with what they have. We also have other places to go on campus if you would like to pick up a snack.",
            "At CSU-Pueblo we have three new dorms, one old traditional, and also on campus apartments. Personally, i find all of the dorms to be very nice and they are set at a good cost.",
            "The academics are beyond good. They actually teach you things you need to know instead of wasting your time and money.",
            "Before attending CSU-Pueblo make sure you are ready to see large tarantulas during the warmer months. And also, if you are having trouble in class, go visit your professor. They are their to help you, so when you need the help get it instead of failing.",
            "If i had to rate CSU-Pueblo i would have to give it four out of five stars, one reason being that this school is not as expensive as other colleges, but it gives you the knowledge you need to move forward in life.. I believe that CSU-Pueblo is a very good school academically wise, the teachers are available for one on one time and they are there to help us. The only reason i did not say five out of five is because the campus is not as nice as other schools, but they make up for it by the teachers they have."

I will attend CSU-Pueblo in the fall of 2014., 155637=I lived in the dorm the summer of 2011 and it was really fun to get to meet new people you might have the same classes with but since my parents lived here I decided not to live there anymore because it was too expensive., 295022=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 274843=A new tradition is the 33 things to do before you graduate list. It is a campus wide list based on open student ideas and then a survey to choose the top 33 thins to be put on the Bucket List; 33 was the chosen number because CSU - Pueblo was established in 1933. A location would definitely be the spirit rock which is actually miles from the actual campus is the prairie behind the school., 106324=The food is really expensive. Last semester is was a $1.79 for bottle of water. You can get a bottle of water for $1-1.25 most places. $5 at one of the carts or dining places on campus is typically just enough to get you a container of fruit and maybe a drink. Coffee typically is at least $3. Compared to outside sources of food, I give this a low rating., 170217=The diverse campus at CSU-Pueblo is what makes this school unique. I am a recent veteran and they have been extremely helpful, so military friendly indeed. The cost is something that I can afford near-by school were in excess of 10,000 to live on campus per semester vs CSU-Pueblo at 2960., 131849=Our band is very entertaining, our football team made it to the NCAA D-2 championships during the 2011 season, the drama and art department is also excellent and well known throughout our town., 70596=Food isn't that great and a little expensive but the kitchen is being renovated so it should improve by 2013.}",
