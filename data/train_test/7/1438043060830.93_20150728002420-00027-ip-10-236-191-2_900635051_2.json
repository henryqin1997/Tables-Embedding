            "Southern Virginia has an honor code and enforces the values of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The honor code is strict, but it's not too strict. There is a dress code and no alcohol is allowed. If that is appealing to you, I highly suggest you attend. You'll grow spiritually and educationally.",
            "If you are considering Southern Virginia I highly suggest you go. The education, location, and people are amazing. Be prepared to study a lot. It's definitely hard work but pays off.",
            "Southern Virginia is a Liberal Arts school which is a total different approach to college. I absolutely love it. There is more class room discussion, more papers, and critical analyze. It's more expensive then State colleges, but it's totally worth it. Not to mention Southern Virginia is generous with scholarships.",
            "I love Virginia. Campus is beautiful, the state is beautiful, not to mention it's a quick trip to Washington D.C. and lots of other states. The people are great and friendly, Buena Vista is a great city and I enjoy being here.",
            "Southern Virginia is an amazing experience. The teachers are all amazing. Because the school is small, you have very small class sizes, which is so nice. The teachers know you by name and are very willing to work with you."
