Referring to FIG. 12a, block 166, for the purpose of illustration, is provided with a single cavity 190 containing photodetector 176 that is illuminated by ambient lighting generated by lamp 192 through gap 188. When pendulum arm 172 is in contact with block 166, however, light to photodetector 176 through tunnel 194 is blocked by the pendulum arm 172 causing the internal impedance of the detector to substantially increase and thereby generate an electrical signal to circuitry 140 to operate servos 42, 44. The intensity of lamp 174 is large enough to ensure adequate transmission of light to photodetector 176 through gap 188 and the photodetector is biased into a sensitive portion of its operating region. Although the lamp 174 is illustrated as being an incandescent lamp in FIG. 12, it is to be understood that the lamp could, if desired, be in the form of a light emitting diode (LED). Dispersion of light through tunnels 182 and 184 is large enough to ensure transmission of reflected light through the photodetector tunnel 184 at all times while the pendulum arm 186 is out of contact with block 164. Although not shown in FIG. 12, transmission of light between the lamp 174 and photodetector 176 can be improved by locating optical fibers",
