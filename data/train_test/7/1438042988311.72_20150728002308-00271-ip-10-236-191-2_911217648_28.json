            "very safe! i leave my laptop unattended in the library all the time. crime is virtually nonexistent here.",
            "la is not too far, but malibu itself really only offers the beach. there isn't too much excitement in our backyard, so you have to seek it out.",
            "there is only one cafeteria, but it is pretty good. it always has grill items, but mixes it up with international food, all-american dishes, etc.",
            "dorms have restrictions regarding members of the opposite sex, alcohol, etc, but overall they are spacious and people enjoy the sense of community they provide.",
            "pepperdine can be as hard or as easy as you make it. if you want to get a lot out of your education and challenge yourself, pepperdine offers very rigorous courses that make your college experience worthwhile. on the flip side, if you're just trying to scrape by with a degree from a fairly prestigious school without putting in too much work, you can find those types of classes as well.",
            "if you like a fast-paced lifestyle, pepperdine is probably not your best option. not much goes on around here, but that does not mean the people are boring. we're all involved in countless activities and we're really community-oriented and friendly. just don't expect a party every night.",
            "pepperdine's location is amazing, the weather is always beautiful, and the people are too. the school is small and intimate which can be good or bad. the quality of life here is great."

If you're willing to hike, there are also cafeterias at the Drescher graduate campus and the School of Law. Food at the regular Seaver cafeteria is decent but has gotten rather dull due to lack of variety. Students living in residence halls have to purchase a meal plan. Girls usually get by with the minimum B-plan ($1500 equivalent) while guys eat more and end up upgrading to C-plan ($2000) or higher, though one can feasibly get a solid three meals a day by supplementing the B-plan with cereal or other groceries from Ralphs (about a mile away, and campus transportation gives free shuttle rides there)., 168966=The classes are pretty demanding, but you learn so much in the little time you are here per semester. Each semester is about 3 and a half months- that's right, you get out in April your second semester!, 238584=Pepperdine University is a private institution that was founded in 1937. It has a total undergraduate enrollment of 3,474, its setting is suburban, and the campus size is 830 acres. It utilizes a semester-based academic calendar. Pepperdine University's ranking in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is National Universities, 54., 237536=The student-faculty ratio at Pepperdine University is 13:1, and the school has 67.7 percent of its classes with fewer than 20 students. The most popular majors at Pepperdine University include: Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services; Communication, Journalism, and Related Programs; Social Sciences; Multi/Interdisciplinary Studies; and Psychology. The average freshman retention rate, an indicator of student satisfaction, is 90.2 percent., 349490=I toured Pepperdine last October and I was awestruck. The whole campus was amazing including the academics, campus life, and yes, the view was awesome too. I was completely amazed with Pepperdine., 44674=This has drastically increased since my freshman year 3 years ago. Today, Pepperdine has several dining options, including Jamba Juice, LaBrea Bakery, the Waves Caf\u00e9, and the HAWC student center, as well as coffee carts and small, airport-style take-out options. The quality of food has increased exponentially, as well as the variety of healthy, vegetarian and vegan options. Meal plans are organized on a point system; Freshman must have no less than the 1,100 point meal plan. 1 point = 1 dollar, and all points are loaded onto each student's ID card. Points roll over from Fall to Spring, but expire at the end of each Spring semester. The price of food is not unreasonable, but some food takes upwards of 20 minutes to prepare, worse during the busy hours. Further, the Caf closes at 8:30, so for late-night food, students go to the HAWC, which stays open until 2:00am. LaBrea is only open for breakfast and lunch, and Jamba Juice closes around 8.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I would encourage students to have an open mind when coming to Pepperdine and to be grateful! It is a beautiful school with incredible students and faculty. I have found that the more involved and open I have become to new experiences have made my time much more enjoyable. You will definitely meet students who insist on maintaining the too cool for school attitude. But I have found that there are way more students who appreciate everything Pepperdine has to offer, and seek out the good in their studies, lectures, and relationships. Truly take advantage of the wonderful professors and their willingness to help you. Pepperdine is an amazing environment that encourages its students to explore and learn about themselves while still challenging and motivating them to be the best possible version of themselves. Am enjoying being here The people here are amazing! Everyone is incredibly gracious and open to forming meaningful and lasting relationships. Never did I imagine finding so many best friends who comfort, encourage, and accept me the way Pepperdine students have. The campus is the perfect environment to learn and experience the person you were meant to become while being surrounded by motivating people. Am learning a lot Pepperdine definitely has some amazing teachers who are willing to go",
