This explains why Kai Hopf took the legendary Hero as the starting point for the development of the brand new IDOL and adapted it exactly to the requirements of the freestyle world record champion Gollito Estredo in a number of stages. The superiority of the 4 batten design is obtained (as well as on the HERO) primarily through the BALANCED.LUFF.LENGTH that determines the precisely balanced ratio of luff- to boom length: As short as possible for radical throw-ability, as long as necessary to ensure sufficient stability for a maximum wind range. The draft being more forward oriented which produces a lot of lift",
