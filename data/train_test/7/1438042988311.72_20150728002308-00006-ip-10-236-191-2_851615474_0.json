This is particularly helpful when international reviewers are involved. Structuring the agenda carefully so that the agenda is focused and people's time is used efficiently, and Typically, meeting logistics are one of the major costs of a peer review for DOE/EERE. The table below shows there is a wide range of costs for peer reviews. Expenditures vary depending on the number of projects reviewed, the number of reviewers, whether the meeting is open to the public, and the length of the review. Ways of controlling the cost of the review meeting include the following: Often an honorarium is paid to reviewers depending on time spent, as well as reimbursement of travel expenses. This is particularly true if the same reviewers are used more than once. Federal employees cannot be reimbursed for their time, while academics and consultants usually are. A typical honorarium is $500 per day. Often the size and scope of the program or project determines the venue for the peer review. Scheduling the event using public facilities (hotels, conference centers), meal planning, and audiovisual requirements, all should be completed well in advance of the actual meeting. Logistics and Cost Considerations Each of the EERE core criteria and additional criteria for which the program seeks review input can be stated as questions for the reviewers in terms specific to",
    "textAfterTable": "For some programs, utilizing an identified EERE common support contractor for peer review logistics and related activities might reduce the complexities and costs of conducting peer reviews. A single contractor could provide continuity and consistency across time and reviews. The contractor could work with those who have ongoing reviews to maintain institutional memory and provide tutorials to others, in each case tailoring review logistics to meet the needs of individual programs. This support would reduce the cost and burden of review, simplify the tracking of progress, and aid in the sharing of lessons learned. To help ensure fidelity to the core principles of the guidelines presented here, the contract for this work could be re-competed after a set period, say 4-5 years. For other programs, these benefits may be outweighed by the specialized knowledge and experience that other contractors have developed over the years in managing peer reviews for particular programs or topical areas. Also, it may be a good idea to rotate contractors providing logistics support to keep the review process fresh and objective. In the past, at least one program has defrayed costs by turning the peer review effectively into a large conference and charging attendees (other than the peer reviewers) a conference registration fee. If such an approach is considered, careful attention should be given to allow waivers of registration fees so that stakeholder groups such as nonprofits or others are not inadvertently excluded by the cost of registration.
