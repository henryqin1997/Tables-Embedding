HOW TO READ THESE TABLES: The search for campaign cash makes \"dialing for dollars\" one of the most time-intensive parts of any political campaign. Where do all those well-heeled donors live?

Senators and other high-profile incumbents may draw from the Big Three sources of campaign cash nationally: New York City, Washington, DC and Los Angeles. METHODOLOGY: The numbers on this page are calculated from contributions of more than $200 from individuals, as reported to the Federal Election Commission. PAC dollars are not included.
