As described herein above, it is preferred that top panel 12, and side panels 14 and 66 be configured to be installable and removable without tools. This among other things reduces the amount of time needed to disassemble computer chassis 10 for repair and upgrades. It is further preferred that many of the computer components such as the power supplies, the disk drives and the fan assembly be installable and removable without tools to further facilitate the ease and quickness of repair, replacement and upgrades accordingly. It is also preferred that many of the computer components such as the disk drives and the power supplies be hot pluggable, i.e., can be removed and installed without powering down the system. Referring now to FIGS. 10 and 11, there is illustrated a more detailed view of the printed circuit board insertion/removal mechanism 76. As depicted, printed circuit board insertion/removal mechanism 76 includes a handle 126 which is pivotally connected to subpanel 128 at pivot 130. Subpanel 128 is secured to printed circuit",
