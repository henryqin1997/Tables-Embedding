    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{5053=The first peace time ruler after this lengthy and disastrous war was Marwan Ibn Al Hakam (died 65 AH/684 AD). One of the first duties he performed was to destroy the original Quran, the one that was so scrupulously written by the Prophet's own hand, \"fearing it might become the cause of NEW disputes\" [see `ULUM AL-QURAN, by Ahmad von Denffer, Islamic Foundation, Leicester, United Kingdom, 1983, Page 56.]. The question an intelligent person must ask is: \"If the original Quran were identical to the Quran in circulation at that time, why did Marwan Ibn Al-Hakam have to destroy it?!\", 51351=[36] Sura 9 consists of 127 verses, and 9+1+2+7 equals 19. Let us look at all the suras whose digits of sura and verses add up to 19. There are 10 suras that meet this specification, and the total of their sura numbers and numbers of verses is 1216, or 19x64. The data are shown in Table 20., 6602=How could these `Meccan' verses be found with Khuzeimah, a late `Medinan' Muslim?! How could a Medinan sura contain Meccan verses, when the universal convention has been to label as `Medinan' all revelations after the Prophet's Hijerah from Mecca??!! Despite these discrepancies, plus many more glaring contradictions associated with Verses 9:128-129, no one dared to question their authenticity. The discovery of the Quran's mathematical code in 1974, however, ushered in a new era where the authenticity of every element in the Quran is proven (Appendix 1)., 56336=As illustrated by Table 23, many conform with the Quran's code only if Sura 9 is excluded; it does not consist of 129 verses. Without Sura 9, the total number of verses in these 13 suras is 627, 19x33. Additionally, the sura number, plus the number of verses, plus the sum the sum of verse numbers, add up to 23655, or 19x1245. These phenomena would have disappeared if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses., 8003=[1] The first violation of the Quran's code by Verses 9:128-129 appeared when the count of the word \"God\" (Allah) in the Quran was found to be 2699, which is not a multiple of 19, unless we remove one. The count of the word \"God\" is shown at the bottom of each page in this translation. The total shown at the end of the Quran is 2698, 19x142, because the false injections 9:128-129 have been removed., 10539=[4] The occurrence of the word \"God\" from the first Quranic initial (\"A.L.M.\" of 2:1) to the last initial (\"N.\" of 68:1) totals 2641, or 19x139. Since it is easier to list the suras outside the initialed section of the Quran, Table 1 shows the the 57 occurrences of the word \"God\" in that section. Subtracting 57 from the total occurrence of the word \"God\" gives us 2698- 57 = 2641 = 19x139, from the first initial to the last initial. If the human injections 9:128 and 129 were included, the count of the word \"God\" in the initialed section would have become 2642, not a multiple of 19., 48014=If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the total would have become 1159+2 = 1161, not a multiple of 19., 42335=[29] Since Sura 9 is odd-numbered, and its number of verses is also odd, let us look at all the odd-numbered suras whose number of verses is also odd. This gives us 27 suras: 1, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 25, 27, 29, 33, 35, 39, 43, 45, 57, 63, 81, 87, 91, 93, 97, 101, 103, 105, 107, 111, and 113. They consist of 7, 127, 123, 43, 99, 111, 77, 93, 69, 73, 45, 75, 89, 37, 29, 11, 29, 19, 15, 11, 5, 11, 3, 5, 7, 5, and 5 verses, respectively. The sum of these sura numbers, plus their sum of verse numbers is 2774, 19x146. If we take the wrong number of verses for Sura 9 , i.e., 129, this miracle disappears., 26481=[19] Sura 9 consists of 127 verses. The digits of 127 add up to 1+2+7 = 10. Let us look at all the verses whose digits add up to 10, from the missing Basmalah of Sura 9, to the extra Basmalah of Sura 27. If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the grand total would be 2472, instead of 2470 (19x130); 2472 is not a multiple of 19, and this phenomenon would have disappeared. The data are in Table 8., 47735=[33] The numbers 127, 128 and 129 have two digits in common, \"1\" and \"2.\" Let us consider all the suras whose number of verses contains the digits 1 and 2. By adding the sura numbers plus the numbers of verses, we get 1159, 19x61. See Table 18., 31261=As shown in Table 10, the total count of the digit \"1\" in the un-initialed suras is 1406, or 19x74. Obviously, if Sura 9consisted of 129 verses, we would see two additional 1's, from 128 and 129, and the code would be violated., 14847=[9] Another important word that occurs in the false Verses 9:128-129 is the word \"Raheem\" (Merciful). This word is used in the Quran exclusively as a name of God, and its total count is 114, 19x6, after removing the word \"Raheem\" of 9:128, which refers to the prophet. According to 7:188, 10:49, and 72:21 the Prophet did not possess any power of mercy., 46265=If Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses, the total number of verses would have been 1577 + 129 = 1706, not a multiple of 19., 63683=When we add 114, plus 1161, and remove 2, we get 1273, or 19x67. Compare this total (1273) with the total reported in the Item 44 below. Of the 9 suras listed in Table 27, which one has the extra 2 verses? The answer is provided in Item 44., 13460=[5] Sura 9 is an un-initialed sura, and if we look at the 85 un-initialed suras, we find that the word \"God\" occurs in 57 of these suras, 19x3. The total number of verses in the suras where the word \"God\" is found is 1045, 19x55. If 9:128-129 were included, the verses containing the word \"God\" would increase by 1., 10279=[3] As shown at the end of Sura 9 in this translation, the total occurrence of the word \"God\" to the end of Sura 9 is 1273, 19x67. If the false injections 9:128-129 were included, the total would have become 1274, not a multiple of 19., 28732=[20] The falsifiers wanted us to believe that Sura 9 consists of 129 verses. The number 129 ends with the digit \"9.\" Let us look at the first sura and the last sura whose number of verses ends with the digit \"9.\" These are Sura 10 and Sura 104. By adding the sura number, plus the number of verses, plus the sum of verse numbers, from Sura 10 to Sura 104, we get a grand total that equals 23655, or 19x1245. The details are shown in Table 9., 65458=As shown in Table 28, Sura 9 stands out in glaring disharmony; it is singled out as the sura that contains the false verses. The total of suras and verses becomes divisible by 19 only if Sura 9 is removed. Note that the divisible total, after removing Sura 9, is 1273, 19x67, which is the same total obtained in Item 43 above after removing 2 verses. This remarkable phenomenon proves that Sura 9 could not contain a verse No. 128., 35561=[25] Adding up the digits of the Quran's suras and verses produces a multiple of 19, provided the correct number of verses for Sura 9, 127, is taken. To do this, you make a list of the Quran's 114 suras and the number of verses in each sura. Add the digits of every sura number. The sum of digits of 10=1, 11=2, 12=3, 99=18, and so on. The total for all the suras is 975. The same thing is done for the numbers of verses in every sura. For example, Sura 2 consists of 286 verses. The digits of 286 add up to 2+8+6=16. For Sura 9, the digits of its number of verses add up to 1+2+7=10. The total for all 114 suras is 906. Thus, the grand total for the sum of digits of all the suras and verses is 975+906 = 1881 = 19x99. Naturally, this observation would not be possible if Sura 9 consisted of 129 verses. Table 12 is abbreviated to illustrate the calculations., 29548=[21] The false injection consisted of Verses 128 and 129 at the end of Sura 9. If we look at the numbers 128 and 129, we see two 1's, two 2's, one 8, and one 9. Now let us look at all the verses in the Quran,and count all the 1's we see. This means the 1's we see in verses 1, 10, 11, 12, 13... 21, 31, and so on. The total count of the 1's is 2546 (19x134), provided the correct number of verses in Sura 9, 127, is used. If 128 and 129 are included, the grand total becomes 2548, which is not a multiple of 19 (Table 11)., 14381=[8] The INDEX TO THE WORDS OF THE QURAN, lists 116 \"Rasool\" (Messenger) words. One of these words is in 9:128. By removing this false verse, 115 \"Rasool\" words remain. Another \"Rasool\" word which must be excluded from counting is in 12:50, since it refers to the \"messenger of Pharaoh,\" not the messenger of God. Thus, the total occurrence of \"Rasool\" of God is 114, 19x6., 3108=Ali's protest is documented in many references, but I cite and reproduce here the classic reference AL ITQAAN FEE 'ULUM AL QURAN by Jalaluddin Al-Suyuty, Al-Azhareyyah Press, Cairo, Egypt, 1318 AH, Page 59 [see Insert 1].}",

THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE \"A messenger has come to you from among you who wants no hardship to afflict you, and cares about you, and is compassionate towards the believers, merciful.

He is the Lord with the great throne.' \" [Insert 3] The translation of the two false verses is shown in Insert 3: distinguishing the true believers from the hypocrites (they uphold traditions). producing an awesome miracle in its own right, and demonstrating the major function of the Quran's mathematical system, and resulted in: As it turns out, the injection of the two false Verses",
