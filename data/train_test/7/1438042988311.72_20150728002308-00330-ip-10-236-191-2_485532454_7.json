In this particular embodiment, module 2 includes a transceiver chip 43 or equivalent device capable of transmitting and receiving RF signals used in the communication of information between a camera 10 including module 2 and other devices such as a flashpack 22 (FIG. 3). A suitable transceiver chip 43 is manufactured by RF Micro Devices, Inc. of Greensboro, N.C., and is identified by model number RF2915.

No. 7,016,603, entitled \u201cWireless Communication Module,\u201d now allowed, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 37471=As a result of the difficulties encountered using cables with remote photography lighting, various remote control devices utilizing multiple wireless technologies have been developed to remotely control photography equipment such as flashpacks and secondary cameras. Infrared (IR), cellular, light pulse, and radio frequency (RF) are some examples of wireless technologies employed in prior art devices. One particularly effective system is the PocketWizard\ufffd MultiMAX\u2122 designed by Lab Partners Associates Inc. of South Burlington, Vt. The PocketWizard\ufffd MultiMAX\u2122 is an intelligent device that utilizes RF technology with a fully programmable transceiver. Much of the technology incorporated in the design of the PocketWizard\ufffd MultiMAX\u2122 is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,359,375, which is incorporated by reference as if fully disclosed herein, issued to Clark on Oct. 25, 1994.}",

On the contrary, the present invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents that may be included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. While chip 43 is primarily described as providing RF signals, it is to be appreciated that the present invention encompasses the use of a chip that transmits and receives other signal types. These other signal types include infrared, sound, cellular, magnetic, and light pulse. Wireless communication module 2 of the present invention offers advantages over prior art devices because it makes it possible to convert a previously non-wireless device to a device having full wireless communication functionality. In addition, the original device does not have to be substantially altered or modified. Of course, the wireless communication module may be altered to fit within various geometrical configurations. Changes to the original device such as modifications to firmware or software or minor physical alterations to ensure the module will fit within the original device are not considered substantial alterations or modifications as defined herein. Rather, substantial modifications include comprehensive modifications to the structure of the original device that require new molding of the original device body, changes that substantially impact the costs of",
