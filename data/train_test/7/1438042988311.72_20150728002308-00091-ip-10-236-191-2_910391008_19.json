    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students ONU is great for students who are looking for personalized education and a tight-knit campus community. The university has top-ranking pharmacy, engineering, and business colleges. There are also many unique degree programs, such as a 6-year Pharm D, Pharmaceutical Business, Forensic Accounting, and Forensic Biology. Tips for prospective students Get involved as soon as you reach campus! Ada is a small community, but once you meet friends and participate in campus organizations, you will forget that you are surrounded by corn fields! Bang for the buck It can't be denied that ONU is an expensive private school, but don't let that discourage you! Financial Aid is readily available and the quality degree programs are well-worth the investment. Am enjoying being here Students, faculty, and staff at ONU are warm and welcoming from the moment you step foot on campus. No matter where you go, you will be greeted with a smile and a helping hand. The small school atmosphere makes it hard to not enjoy your time here...you are sure to run into a friend around every corner! Am learning a lot",
