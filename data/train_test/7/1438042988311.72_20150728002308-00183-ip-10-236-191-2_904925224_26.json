            "Lately, there have been a series of robberies on Duke's campus that have instilled a little bit of a sense of fear in the students when it comes to safety. For the most part, just like in any other place, it's simply important to stay aware of your surroundings at all times, and to not be stupid and walk around by yourself in the middle of the night. Duke has also, as a result of these robberies, majorly stepped up security, which has vastly improved the feeling of safety on campus.",
            "Greek life, while maybe not made up of the majority of students on campus, is still one of the prevalent cultures on campus. Especially as a freshman, the frattiness of Duke is somewhat difficult to avoid/ignore, but that doesn't mean there's any other culture out there, it's just a little more difficult to find them.",
            "If there's a particular club you're looking for, I can almost guarantee you'll find it. In the rare chance that there's not one already established, you always have the opportunity to start your own.",
            "I suppose the whole bench burning tradition is unusual, although any student who comes here will find out soon enough so I won't go into detail. There's a very strange fascination with the campus squirrels, which all bear the appearance of crazed druggies. Many people don't know about the Coffeehouse, the only student run coffeeshop at Duke, as well as the only location on East where alcohol is permitted. For those seeking an alternative study space, a coffee in the middle of the night, or some awesome music on the weekends, that's the place to be. WXDU, the Durham community based radio station is also located on campus, and is a wonderful place to go if you get involved and become a DJ. The station contains a magical library of endless supplies of music, and is simply nestled away on East.",
            "As much as I hate the Duke slogan work hard, play hard, I must admit that it is a pretty accurate description of the campus lifestyle. Now, I'm not saying that the only thing to do on campus is party, all though that is certainly a big part of what students do. There is always something going on, somewhere, just about at any time, whether it be a party, a Duke event, workshop, concert, etc. Check out the Duke Performances, because as students, you get $10 tickets to a whole bunch of incredible shows that would ordinarily cost much more. Hit up the free concerts at Coffeehouse, or the fascinating workshops at the Arts Annex. If you're bored on campus, it's not Duke's fault, it's yours.",
            "This is one area in which Duke falls a little short. While there is a lot of food on campus, and it is certainly much better than that of many other college campuses, I do feel that there could be a great deal of improvement in the food offered. For one, it's difficult finding food that is actually healthy when eating in the dining venues on campus, and, alternatively, for those who are wanting to cook for themselves (like me), there's a very limited amount of groceries. There are some good food options though, like certain restaurants which will accept Duke food points. On the other hand, Durham is an incredible town for any foodie, so if you're bold enough to explore the city, a delicious world awaits.",
            "Living at Duke is very interesting, because the freshman living situation is very different from any other year, and in theory, students could have a different type of housing each year they attend. As a sophomore, I can talk about freshman housing (East campus housing) and my current living style (Central Campus housing). Freshman year dorm life is awesome, because all the freshmen live on the same campus (East), and so there's an automatic sense of camaraderie that is put into place, making it much easier for everyone to make friends and seek out other people. The East Campus dorms are also pretty nice for the most part although it can vary on which dorm you're located in. Central Campus living, on the other hand, is the best thing ever. Many people speak poorly about Central, seeing as it's not on either of the main campuses, but so many people live there that it's still an incredibly social location. Additionally, Central housing is actually apartment style, which is unbelievably incredible, as the apartments are spacious and offer a greater degree of privacy than any dorm.",
            "Academics at Duke are hard. There's no other way to put it, but that should also be the expectation when going into a university that many consider one of the Ivys. Honestly, even as a hardworking highschooler, I had no idea what was coming in terms of homework/studying my freshman year, and so it was definitely a shock. Luckily, Duke has millions of resources to help students out with their studies, not to mention the fact that people are typically always open to offering help when asked.",
            "Take advantage of everything Duke has to offer, because it's unlikely you will ever find yourself in a situation where you are just having opportunity after opportunity thrown at you (not to mention free food, shirts, and other merch). In addition to that, take advantage of Durham, the great city that Duke is located in. Many students have weird misconceptions about Durham, which is one reason the university, although centered in the middle of downtown, is still so disconnected from the outside community. Durham is actually a rich center of food, music, and a growing culture that is open and fun to participate in. As already mentioned, don't be afraid to recognize flaws in the university system, and to speak up about them! By doing so, people can create change for the better on campus, which will only benefit the university and its students as a whole.",
            "Duke is a wonderful place, but just like any university, it is by no means perfect. The glamour and enchantment surrounding this gothic wonderland needs to be taken with a grain of salt, with a little bit of criticism. But don't get me wrong, the ability to witness and embrace Duke's flaws are the key to working the university system and making the absolute most of the incredible opportunity it is to attend Duke."

There is a new housing model (will be starting in the 2012-2013 school year) that is intended to foster stronger bonds between people living in the same dorm. There is also a brand-new dorm on West Campus with beautiful rooms that people are very excited about., 109436=First of all, Duke is a very difficult school to get admission into. This school is the most selective university in the Southern United States. If you are submitting SAT scores, you MUST submit results of SAT II Subject Tests (2 tests required.) Failure to meet this will potentially jeopardize your application. To get in, you should have a consistent record of high academic achievement and perfect SAT scores for a competitive application. At the same time, don't worry if you don't have a 4.0 GPA and a 2400 SAT score - Duke's admissions are entirely holistic and are really much concerned who you are as a person. Strengths in other areas will compensate for grades that are less than ideal. Duke loves the academically motivated and intellectually curious student who is often willing to undertake challenges. That student should be able to be challenged by their peers/professors as much as they are willing to challenge them. Last of all, you should dedicate yourself to one or two activities you love and demonstrate only one thing: Impact. Remember that Duke, along with other universities such as Princeton, Yale, MIT all look for future leaders who are willing to make a difference in their community., 268411=- Go to the activity fair to see what is available for you to join on campus, and you get a lot of cool free stuff - Join Greek Life! - Go to as many sporting events as possible. Even if you are not that into sports, the energy and vibe at the games is something that makes Duke unique. - Try to ration your food points Freshman year, in March when you just can't possibly eat at the Marketplace any more you will be happy to still have another option -If you have a car, bring it. It's sometimes nice to get off-campus to go grocery shopping at the nearby Target or Kroger, and there are two malls about 10-20 minutes away, 222739=Tenting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzyzewskiville http://dukegroups.duke.edu/kville/k-ville-tenting-policy-2010-2011/, 280710=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 201991=Use your AP and IB credits; Duke is not somewhere you want to retake a course. Be prepared to be in the midst of literally 1500 high school valedictorians in your class alone. Everyone works hard and really cares about their performance, so don't think you'll be able to breeze through.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck For such an expensive school, Duke still sucks every penny that you have left out of you. A parking pass is around $300 and you WILL get at least 3-4 parking tickets in your years here. In addition, the club sports and Greek fees are ridiculous. However, the fact that your professor probably wrote the textbook you're studying and the daily maid service in the dorms definitely make the financial crunch worth it in the long run. Am enjoying being here The students and faculty at Duke are extremely receptive and interesting people. There is never a boring day as long as you take the time to get to know those around you. Everyone is from around the world, which has really opened my eyes to different perspectives and cultures. We have a great Greek life, sports program, and events of all sorts every day of the week. The campus is beautiful and the Raleigh-Durham area is an exciting regions, especially with UNC and NC State both within a 20 minute drive. However, as I'm one of the few students who migrated north for college (I would say a large percentage of the population is from the Northeast), I detest the frigid, cold, windy, and rainy winters. Am learning a lot",
