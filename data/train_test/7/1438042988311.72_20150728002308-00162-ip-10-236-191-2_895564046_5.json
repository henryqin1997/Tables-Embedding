    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{47069=10/24/13: Perhaps it is karma, perhaps it is luck, or perhaps it was just a very bad move by the Giants. San Francisco Giants reliever Brian Wilson injured his elbow in April 2012 and underwent his second Tommy John surgery (the first being in college at LSU) and his season was over as quickly as it began. After winning the World Series, the Giants decided to non-tender him and he became a free agent. So what does he do? He signs with the arch-rival Dodgers and returned in late 2013. By the postseason he was showing his previous dominant stuff. That is coming back to haunt the Giants as they are trying to find some replacement for him and may keep searching for a long time., 59610=5/30/13: The Giants are playing well - in fact they are right at the top of the NL West with Arizona and Colorado lurking. But it seems like the Giants are struggling a bit. The pitching has been good, but not great like in past years. The team still struggles to score runs, but does enough to win. Over the weekend, however, they got a big win. Outfielder Angel Pagan got to the plate in the bottom of the 10th inning with one man on. He proceeded to lace a shot to right field, which took an odd bounce off the outfield wall. Pagan raced 360 feet around the bases and scored a two run, inside the park, walk off home run. The first time that has happened in the majors since 2004., 47769=10/17/13: Make no mistake about it, the San Francisco Giants are in rebuilding mode. Of course, it is fact that the Giants won the 2012 World Series. But it is also fact that the 2013 version of the team was well under 500 and 16 games behind the first place L.A. Dodgers. The Giants starting pitching is not what it once was as key members seemed to age overnight. Next year is a new year and the Giants look like they are bringing back Tim Linsecum after two terrible seasons. They will need more than that, however, to compete with the Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks., 44019=11/28/13: The Giants took another step towards solidifying their pitching staff for next season. San Francisco re-signed reliever Javier Lopez to a three year, $13 million deal (pending a physical). Lopez is a left handed specialist and age 35. This deal is essentially the same as his previous deal with an extra year added on (the last deal was two years for $8.5 million). Lopez has a 2.26 ERA in four seasons with San Francisco, highlighted by a 1.83 ERA in 2013. The Giants also added starter Tim Hudson to the rotation, agreeing with the pitcher to a two year, $23 million deal., 21318=8/28/14: Stop me if you have heard this before \u2026 but a funny thing happened at the ballpark last week. The Giants were visiting the Cubs and losing 2-0 when a rain storm rolled through. The groundscrew could not get the tarp on the field quickly and the infield was soaked. The game was through 4.5 innings, so could be considered a legit game. The Giants protested and actually won the protest - marking the first time a protest has been upheld since 1986. The Giants need alll the wins they can gather at this point as they are essentially chasing a wild card spot with just a few weeks left in the season., 39073=1/23/14: The Giants won the World Series in both 2010 and 2012 on the back of top quality pitching. They had been able to retain their starting rotation for several years, and actually have only one change in 2014: Tim Hudson is replacing Barry Zito. Last season was a disaster for the rotation. It is quite possible that the long 2012 season and injuries sapped the strength of the rotation. With a full offseason to recover, the Giants' rotation figures to be much better this coming season. Madison Baumgarter was their best pitcher last season and looks to be the number one this time around. The Giants also hope that Matt Cain and Brian Vogelsong can rebound, and that will make things more interesting in the NL West., 42246=12/19/13: The Giants, again, focused again on retaining their free agents rather than go shopping throughout the league. They did add two interesting players who could both be steals for the team. San Francisco signed Tim Hudson to replace Barry Zito in the rotation. Hudson had a down 2013, but has shown to be a great pitcher when healthy. The team also signed Michael Morse on a one year, $5 million deal to play left field. He too had a subpar 2013 season, but has the talent to put up big numbers and be a huge part of the Giants' offense in 2014., 48363=10/10/13: There is no secret or deep analytical thought behind the Giants subpar season. It all lies in the pitching. Sure, there were injuries, but every team has to deal with that. Pitching is the easy culprit. Last season (2012), the Giants' rotation ranked fifth in the National League in ERA. They were 13th in 2013. General Manager Brian Sabean seems to understand the situation and has admitted that the 'window is closed' on the current group. So expect the Giants to be active in the free agent market for the next several months as they try to rebuild their rotation and get back to elite status., 48987=10/3/13: The Giants are getting a quick start on setting their roster for 2014. On Saturday, the team signed outfielder Hunter Pence to a five year, $90 million extension. With Pence under contract for the foreseeable future, the Giants are trying to retain pitcher Tim Linsecum. Linsecum has severely struggled for the past two seasons, but has several Cy Youngs to his name and was a key part of the Giants' two World Series championships. Some suggest Linsecum could get $30 million on the open market, but that seems high considering his struggles the past two seasons., 43421=12/5/13: The Giants continue to work on their rotation for next season, which was their Achilles Heel this past season. They have already re-signed Tim Linsecum and added Tim Hudson. Now they are reportedly working toward a deal to keep Ryan Vogelsong. Most expected Vogelsong to remain with the Giants, even though the Giants declined his $6.5 million option for 2014. Vogelsong struggled all year, but it looks like he will return, albeit likely at a reduced rate. At age 35, this may be the last contract that Voglesong that signs, and almost ensures he will retire as a Giant., 45789=11/7/13: Barry Zito had a club option for 2014, and surprising to absolutely nobody, the team declined to pick it up. In fact, they are probably happy to finally get the noose of his contract off of their necks. Zito just finished up a seven year, $126 million deal that he never lived up to, including a terrible 2013 season with a 5.74 ERA over 133 innings - so it is no wonder the Giants did not feel like paying another $18 million. Zito did receive a $7 million buyout, which has to make people wonder about long term big money contracts and why teams continue to commit to them (hello, Anaheim Angels)., 41659=12/26/13: Give the Giants PR staff some credit for originality. The Giants will give out Hunter Pence bobbleheads on April 9th in a game to 40,000 fans. Bobbleheads are nothing new, and some may argue have just gotten annoying over the past few seasons. But this is different. Pence rides a motorized scooter to home games and the bobblehead honors that. Pence is featured on his scooter in a Giants jersey and blue jeans, with a backpack. That is a far cry from the standard baseball player in full uniform and could make this one a collectors item for its uniqueness., 33085=4/3/14: The Giants, for the past several years, have had to hear that they do not score enough runs. Even when they won their two World Series in 2010 and 2012 - which was not that long ago, and the Giants have many of the same players - that was the knock against them. Well, a new season may mean new results. The Giants outblasted the Arizona Diamondbacks on Opening Day, winning 9-8. The teams combined for 17 runs and 30 hits on the day - disproving the theory that pitching is ahead of hitting early in the spring., 11922=3/4/15: Professional baseball players and coaches who enjoy smokeless tobacco, otherwise known as 'chew' or 'dip', depending on the style, may have to load up on nicotine gum or patches when they play in San Francisco in the near future. The City is proposing a ban on smokeless tobacco at every playing field in San Francisco, including at AT&T Park. The 2011 CBA bans conspicuous use of smokeless tobacco and it has been banned outright in the minor leagues. This is a positive step to curbing the use of smokeless tobacco, which is suspected of being a cause of Tony Gwinn's death last year., 36678=2/20/14: San Francisco made a minor deal this week in signing Chris Cotillo to a minor league contract. The odd thing is that this deal, unlike most minor league deals for veteran players, does not include an invitation to spring training with the big leaguers. Cotillo has not played in the majors since 2011, and he was not a terribly effective hitter then. Still, he brings a veteran presence and the ability to play several positions. It is a low risk deal for the Giants; one which could provide bench depth down the line - and those kind of guys are always needed., 28249=6/6/14: The Giants are pretty good this year. In fact, they are the best in the league so far, even better than their cross-bay brethren, the Oakland A's. Finally, outfielder Angel Pagan is healthy and hitting lights out. Pablo Sandoval has found his groove as well. Most importantly, the pitching staff has rebounded from last season. Ryan Vogleson has a 1.325 ERA. Madison Bumgarner was 4-0 in May and Tim Hudson has turned back the clock to his previous form. As of right now, the team looks unbeatable, and they will surely be in the running in October., 32440=4/10/14: The media focus in the National League West is of course focused on the L.A. Dodgers. They are the glamour team of the West Coast. They have an enormous payroll and a lot of big stars. They are expected to win the division, if not the entire National League pennant. Sneaking under the radar is the rival San Francisco Giant. The Giants have been an afterthought since their disappointing 2013 season. However, they are healthy and retooled. And, through the first week, are proving their critics wrong. They ended the week at 5-1; good enough for the best record in West, and that included a 7-2 win over the Dodgers., 27045=6/19/14: There seems to be no stopping the San Francisco Giants these days. They have the best recording all of baseball and the best run differential (+56) in the National League. They also own a 7.5 game lead on the NL West. It does not matter if they play at home or on the road, they have 20 or more wins in both categories. This seems to be due to the resurgence of the Giants pitching staff (and the offense doing its part as well). The Giants struggled all of last year, and that may have been fatigue from the previous season when they won the World Series. As it is going now, we may see another Bay Series in October., 62813=10/4/12: The San Francisco Giants are preparing to take on the Cincinnati Reds in the first round of the National League Playoffs. Game One will be Saturday, October 6th in San Francisco. Game Two is scheduled for the next day before the series heads back to Ohio for Games Three and Four. The Giants will be sending Matt Cain to the mound for game one. Cain ended the season with a 16-5 record and a 2.03 ERA. The Reds will counter with right-hander Johnny Cueto. Cueto is a hard thrower and was 19-9 this season with a 2.78 ERA. Runs will be hard to come by., 38440=1/30/14: It is time for a nice story. Almost three years ago, at opening day 2011, Giants' fan Bryan Stow was beaten severely and continues to deal with traumatic injuries and brain damage. Giants' third base coach Tim Flannery raised $96,000 for his medical expenses through donations, auctions, and sales of his CD. Giants reliever matched Flannery's original $25,000 donation and franchise legend Will Clark donated another $10,000. It is a wonderful gesture by Flannery, and the entire organization and fan base should be proud of his efforts. Hopefully, this type of savage foolishness will never happen again., 35404=3/6/14: The Giants won two World Series championships on the backs of their dominant starting pitching just a few years ago. They imploded last season, but things could be looking up in 2014. Both new comer Josh Johnson and long-time Giant Tim Linsecum had good outings in their spring training debuts. Both pitchers are looking to bounce back from poor 2013 seasons and both are on short-term contracts. It is still a long way to go until Opening Day, and much, much longer to go until the playoffs, but if these two guys can return to their dominant forms, then San Francisco could be a contender., 27690=6/12/14: Are we seeing the rebirth of the Giants right before our very eyes? It seems like it. Of course, the Giant won the World Series in 2010 and 2012. The team was expected to compete in 2013 but completely failed in that regard. But they look reborn. They look like the team that won those championships. They took three of four from the defending National League Champs, St. Louis Cardinals, last week, and are the first team to reach the 40 win plateau this season. Right now, it is tough to argue against them in the National League., 10684=3/18/15: The Giants have some concerns about their starting rotation this season. Staff ace and 2014 playoff hero Madison Bumgarner is back - though he was simply very good and not other-worldly in the regular season in past years (kind of the bizarro Clayton Kershaw). There are questions after Bum, though. Tim Hudson is available and says his ankle injury is a non-issue. Matt Cain says he felt good after his first start since last July. Those are encouraging signs, but far from sure things. Regardless, the Giants are the reigning champions and still have a lot of talent on the roster., 37864=2/6/14: Back in 2011, Giants (and former Florida State star) catcher Buster Posey was bowled over in a home plate collision. Posey suffered several injuries including a fractured leg and three torn ankle ligaments. Home plate collisions have been a part of baseball for decades, but they are coming to an end. Posey has become the poster-boy for such collisions, but he will not talk about the new proposed rules. Posey does not want this cachet on his resume. That being said, their is just cause for trying to eliminate the most dangerous play in baseball., 40406=1/9/14: The Giants won the World Series in both 2010 and 2012, largely because of great pitching and strong defense. Then 2013 came and the wheels came off. The Giants were last in the NL West, which was already weak (excluding the Dodgers). So the question has to be now if the Giants have done enough this offseason to get back to a competitive level. The re-signed a lot of their own guys, including Hunter Pence and Tim Linsecum. They added veteran pitcher Tim Hudson to the rotation. But it still seems like they need more offense. There are still a few shopping days left until spring training, so maybe they will make another move., 29430=5/22/14: About a quarter of the way through the season now and San Francisco Giants are resembling the teams that won the World Series in 2010 and 2012. They are winning at home, which is expected, but are even better on the road. They are five games over .500 away from home, which is second best in all of MLB. While the offense is getting them the lead going into the late innings, the bullpen has been outstanding on shutting the door and owns a collective 2.17 ERA - very impressive. The Giants do not look like they are slowing down anytime soon and have opened up a comfortable four game lead in the NL West., 65255=AT&ampT; Park, located in San Francisco, California, is the home ballpark for MLB's San Francisco Giants. The $357 million stadium began construction in 1997 and officially opened in April 2011 when the Giants hosted the nearby Los Angeles Dodgers for a three-game series. At the time of opening, AT&ampT; Park was the first MLB venue built without the use of public funding since 1962. Despite its primary use by the Giants, the venue has played host to a variety of teams from an array of sports including the San Francisco Demons of the XFL, California Redwoods of the UFL and University of California Golden Bears. The stadium has also been the home of the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl since 2002. AT&ampT; Park has seen its fair share of historical moments which include Barry Bonds' 500th, 600th, and 700th home runs. Bonds also surpassed Babe Ruth with his 715th home run, as well as Hank Aaron's all-time mark with his 756th long ball in 2007. A pair of stellar pitching performances has also been recorded at AT&ampT; Park, the first coming in 2009 when Giants starter Jonathan Sanchez threw the first no-hitter in the ballpark's brief history. In 2012, San Francisco's Matt Cain hurled the 22nd perfect game in MLB history becoming only the second pitcher to achieve that feat while striking out 14 batters. The 41,915 seat stadium routinely goes over capacity, setting a record attendance of 44,046 in Game 2 of the 2010 NLDS. The Giants went on to win the World Series that season, winning Games 1 and 2 on their home field., 52605=8/22/13: The Giants downfall this season would have been hard to predict just four months ago. Even two months ago they were in contention in the NL West, but the season has simply turned to dust. Many cite the lack of quality starting pitching and simple fatigue as the reason. However, it is deeper than that. The Giants have lacked a 'spark' all season. Angel Pagan provided that last post-season, but he has been injured for most of the year. In reality, there are a lot of reasons the Giants have struggled in 2013. Perhaps a good rest and healing in the offseason will do them well, and they can come back and challenge the Dodgers in 2014., 16510=11/5/14: Congratulations go out to the San Francisco Giants, the 2014 World Series Champions. This was not an easy campaign and the Giants only made it into the playoffs as a wild card. They marched through the playoffs behind the outstanding pitching of Madison Bumgarner, who was named the MVP. Bumgarner had two wins in the World Series and came out of the bullpen on two day's rest to throw five dominant innings and earn the save in the deciding Game 7 at Kansas City. It is the third World Series title for the Giants in the past five years, an accomplishment few can equal., 44621=11/21/13: The Giants know they have to find a new rotation after a disaster-filled 2013 season. The team re-signed Tim Linsecum, so they expect him back. They let Barry Zito's contract expire, which surprised no one since he was pretty much awful in his seven years with the team. Now the team appears to be interested in Jason Hammel. They have requested his medical records. Hammel was with Baltimore last season and had an ERA just under 5. He was also injured and maybe the Giants are betting that he will be much better when healthy for a full season., 49578=9/26/13: The Giants may have found another diamond in the rough with pitcher Yusmeiro Petit. Petit, now 28, was once a top prospect. But even two months ago he was stuck in the minors with an ERA well over 4. He got a spot start in July, then was fully recalled in August. He has been lights out since the promotion. In 38 innings, he has a 3.08 ERA and almost pulled off a perfect game. He may have even pitched himself into a rotation spot for next year. That would be an amazing feat for a guy that very recently looked like he may be a career minor leaguer., 19409=10/1/14: After a one year absence, the San Francisco Giants are heading back to the playoffs. The Giants won the World Series in both 2010 and 2010 - primarily from dominant pitching. That pitching greatness has evaporated, but the team has gotten better at scoring runs. San Francisco was able to punch their ticket last Thursday when the Milwaukee Brewers (who suffered a monumental collapse over the past six weeks) were defeated by the Cincinnati Reds. The Giants will have a Wild Card game, and anything can happen there. In the meantime, they can help themselves to making that a home game with a couple more wins.}",
