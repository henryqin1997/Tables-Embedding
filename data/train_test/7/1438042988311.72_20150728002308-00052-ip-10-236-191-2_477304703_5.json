A preferred embodiment consists of the use of unsaturated polyester resins, that is to say of solutions of unsaturated polyesters in copolymerisable compounds. The unsaturated polyesters to be used in the process according to the invention are prepared according to known processes by polycondensation of at least one \u03b1,\u03b2-ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid with 4 or 5 carbon atoms as a rule or its ester-forming derivatives, optionally mixed with up to 90 mol %, relative to the unsaturated acid component, of at least one aromatic, cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid with 8 to 10 carbon atoms and/or at least one saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acid with 4 to 10 carbon atoms or its esterforming derivatives, with at least one polyhydroxy compound, preferably a dihydric alcohol with 2 to 8 carbon atoms - i.e. polyesters as described by J. Bjorksten et al. in \"Polyesters and their Applications\", Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York 1956. Examples of unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, or their derivatives, to be used preferentially are maleic acid or maleic anhydride or fumaric acid. However, it is also possible to use, for example, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid, itaconic acid or chloromaleic acid. Examples of the aromatic, cycloaliphatic or saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, or their derivatives, which are used are phthalic acid or phthalic anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid or tetrahydrophthalic acid or their anhydrides, endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid or its anhydride, succinic acid or succinic anhydride anhydride and succinic acid esters and chlorides, adipic acid and sebacic acid. For the preparation of resins of low inflammability it is possible to use, for example, hexachloroendomethylenetetrahydrophthalic acid (Het-acid), tetrachlorophthalic acid, tetrabromophthalic acid, dibromoricinoleic acid or tetrabromoricinoleic acid. Flame resistance is also achievable by addition of halogen-containing compounds which are not co-condensed in the polyesters, such as, for example, chloroparaffin. Polyesters to be used preferentially contain co-condensed maleic acid radicals of which up to 25 mol % can be replaced by phthalic acid radicals or isophthalic acid radicals. Dihydric alcohols which can be employed are ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,4-butenediol, neopentyl glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, perhydrobisphenol, the oligomers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, sugar alcohols and other cycloaliphatic and aromatic diols such as, for example, p-dimethylolbenzene or its isomers, and their hydrogenation products, and others. Ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, diethylene glycol and dipropylene glycol are used preferentially., 23073=Compounds which can be used for curing are compounds known as epoxide resin curing agents, such as are described, for example, in Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry), (Houben-Weyl), 4th edition, volum 14/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1963, pages 499-532. The preferred curing agents are amines (ibid., pages 516-523)., 33661=Examples of these compounds to be used according to the invention are described, for example, in High Polymers, volume XVI, \"Polyurethanes, Chemistry and Technology\", edited by Saudners-Frisch, Interscience Publishers, New York, London, volume I, 1962, pages 32-42 and pages 44-54 and volume II, 1964, pages 5-6 and 198-199, and also in the Kunststoff-Handbuch, volume VII, Vieweg-Hochtlen, Carl-Hanser-Verlag, Munich, 1966, for example on pages 45 to 71. In the process according to the invention, water can be co-used as a blowing agent., 35938=Preferred organic tin compounds which can be used are tin(II) salts of carboxylic acids such as tin(II) acetate, tin(II) octoate, tin(II) ethylhexoate and tin(II) laurate and the dialkyl-tin salts of carboxylic acids, such as, for example, dibutyl-tin diacetate, dibutyl-tin dilaurate, dibutyl-tin maleate or dioctyl-tin diacetate. Further examples of catalysts to be used in the process according to the invention, and details of the mode of action of the catalysts, are described in the Kunststoff-Handbuch, volume VII, published by Vieweg and Hochtlen, Carl-Hanser-Verlag, Munich 1966, for example on pages 96 to 102., 39201=These can also be used as reaction resins in the process of the invention. They are combinations of monoacrylates and/or monomethacrylates, in combination with dimethacrylates and oligomethacrylates and, optionally, polymeric acrylates, methacrylates and their copolymers of very diverse degrees of polymerisation, with or without functional groups, (such as, for example, double bonds), which are capable of participating in the polymerisation or copolymerisation when the foam is being cured. The polymers of this class of compound to be used according to the invention are described, for example, in Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry) (Houben-Weyl), 4th edition, volume 14/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1962, pages 1,010-1,078., 46683=Suitable auxiliaries of this type are, for example, phenols and phenol derivatives, preferably sterically hindered phenols, which contain alkyl substituents with 1-6 C atoms in both o-positions relative to the phenolic hydroxyl group, amines, preferably secondary arylamines and their derivatives, quinones, copper salts of organic acids, and addition compounds of copper (I) halides to phosphites, such as, for example, 4,4'-bis-(2,6-di-tert.-butylphenol), 1,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris-(3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxy-benzyl)-benzene, 4,4'-butylidene-bis-(6-tert.-butyl-m-cresol), 3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxy-benzyl-phosphonic acid diethyl ester, N,N'-bis-(\u03b2-naphthyl)-p-phenylenediamine, N,N'-bis-(1-methylheptyl)-p-phenylenediamine, phenyl-\u03b2-naphthylamine, 4,4'-bis-(\u03b1,\u03b1-di-methylbenzyl)-diphenylamine, 1,3,5-tris-(3,5-di-tert.-butyl-4-hydroxy-hydrociunamoyl)-hexahydro-s-triazine, hydroquinone, p-benzoquinone, toluhydroquinone, p-tert.-butylpyrocatechol, chloranil, naphthoquinone, copper naphthenate, copper octoate, Cu(I)Cl/triphenyl phosphite, Cu(I)Cl/trimethyl phosphite, Cu(I)Cl/trischloroethyl phosphite, Cu(I)Cl/tripropyl phosphite and p-nitrosodimethylaniline. Further suitable stabilisers are described in Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry) (Houben-Weyl), 4th edition, volume 14/1, pages 433-452, 756, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1961. For example, p-benzoquinone used in a concentration of 0.01 to 0.05% by weight, relative to the polyester resin, is very suitable., 14103=From the mixing chamber, the mixture is allowed to issue through a nozzle into a zone of such pressure that foaming occurs. The length to diameter ratio of the nozzle should be between about 1:1 and 5:1. Further characteristics of the device described in the abovementioned application are certain rotating stirring devices containing distributors which direct the flow of liquid in the mixing chamber in such a way that the mixing process takes place uniformly., 40747=E. Phenolic resins such as are described, for example, in Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry) (Houben-Weyl), 4th edition, volume 14/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1963, pages 193-291, should also be mentioned as further condensation resins., 13316=DOS (German Published Specification) No. 1,504,654, May 14, 1969 has disclosed a process and a device for the manufacture of foams, for example from mixtures of unsaturated polyesters and monomers containing >C = CH2 groups. According to this process, a suitably viscous liquid mixture, for example, a polyester resin, is mixed in a pressure chamber with a blowing gas or with agents which generate such a gas and are soluble or dispersible in the liquid mixture, during which mixing the mixture remains practically free from bubbles. The nature of the blowing agent should be such that it is absorbed by the mixture at relatively high pressures and relatively low temperatures but forms a foam with the mixture at low pressures and higher temperatures., 38427=Further examples of surface-active additives and foam stabilisers, cell regulators, reaction retarders, stabilisers, flameproofing substances, plasticisers, dyestuffs and fillers and fungistatic and bacteriostatic substances, which can optionally be co-used according to the invention, and details of the use and mode of action of these additives, are described in the Kunststoff-Handbuch (Plastics Handbook), volume VI, published by Vieweg and Hochtlen, Carl-Hanser-Verlag Munich 1966, for example on pages 103 to 113.}",
