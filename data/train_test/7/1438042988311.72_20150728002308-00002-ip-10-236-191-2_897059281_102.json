            "With emergency call kiosks every 100 yards, consistently lit pathways, and even personal campus safety officers who patrol every dorm every 2 hours and will escort from one campus location to another at night, CU is probably one of the safest campuses in the country. Not to mention the fact that Boulder has an extremely low crime rate in general.",
            "CU has a great selection of student clubs that host tons of activities at an extremely discounted, if not free, rate. Study abroad and Alternative Break programs are popular and constantly offered.",
            "Students who love the outdoors, especially the snow--Colorado has the most Olympic-quality ski/snowboard slopes in the country. Also, students who aren't sure if they want a large or small school. While the school is large population-wise, Boulder feels like a small town. You will see familiar faces everyday throughout your school career, and you can find small, intimate entertainment venues. Yet, you can also experience a busy campus that is always full of fresh young faces, and if you really want big-city attractions, Denver (with a population of 1 million) is only a 1 hour and free (for students) bus ride away.",
            "While CU's tuition may seem expensive for the fact that it is a public institution, it is very easy to double- or even triple-major, and CU offers several 5-year masters programs that ultimately allow you to get great bang for your buck.",
            "There are multiple hubs of activity and entertainment in Boulder and on campus. Mackey auditorium has hosted nationally-acclaimed bands and comedians for years in a beautiful, and acoustically perfect theater. There is a nightclub, bowling alley and pool hall, and bar right in the student center on campus. Then, you have the University Hill, a hotspot of student/youth-targeted restaurants, stores, and music venues. Last but not least, Pearl Street outdoor mall is a landmark of Boulder that hosts fine dining establishments, several microbreweries, haute-couture shopping, and city-sponsored events such as weeknight concerts during the summer.",
            "CU recently completed the construction of the Center for Community (C4C) which contains the largest dining hall on campus. The dining hall here contains several all-you-can-eat stations ranging from Persian cuisine, to Asian dishes, to a Burrito and Sushi Bar, to a full sandwich bar with accompanying panini machines. Most of the food is local, and is prepared entirely on-site. Aside from the dining hall, the C4C also has its own bakery where fresh pastries and bread are made everyday and two Grab-n-Go caf\u00c3\u00a9s that serve fresh-made sandwiches and personal pizzas. Moreover, CU accommodates all types of allergies--even gluten (and at no extra cost, too).",
            "The dorms have great amenities and accommodations such as lounge areas--with pool tables, vending machines, flat screen TVs--but also dining halls right in your dorm or at least some sort of Grab-n-Go caf\u00c3\u00a9 where all you have to do is swipe your student ID and go.",
            "CU Boulder has varying degrees of academic rigor depending on the school and program. It is possible to slide by easily with a C average and party, but it is also guaranteed that in the right major, a degree from CU is very highly looked upon. For example, the Physics program, and Engineering and Business schools are competitively ranked in the United States. Thus, degrees within these areas will carry more weight than, say, a Humanities or Sociology degree. Finally, nearly all of CU's graduate programs are extremely laudable.",
            "Do your research well before the first day of class and do not simply take the opinion of an advisor. They often want you to get through slowly so you pay more. Instead, pick up a FREE copy of a course catalog and see what kind of prerequisites are needed for certain classes; or how your major sequence is set up to make sure you don't get stuck missing a class that is only offered one semester of the year; or what courses count for two separate major requirements (giving you the possibility of double-majoring in the same amount of time). Also, most courses require a complementary recitation along with the lecture part--if you do not know what a recitation is look it up--that is often at a terrible time of day and simply makes it so you have one extra day of class without the benefit of the extra credit hour. However, some equivalent courses do not have the recitation requirement so enroll in those.",
            "A truly beautiful campus rivaled only by the rigor and expectations of the curriculum and the value of a degree with the university's stamp of approval. The city of Boulder, itself, has a unique culture, style, and feel that seemingly complements the campus life and the college experience. With 30,000 undergraduate students, there are a plethora of events both on and off campus that guarantee that a student never has a dull moment."

Every Halloween, students can participate in the Nearly Naked Mile and run downtown in their underwear or costumes. St. Patrick\u00e2??s Day is known for parties on The Hill, Boulder\u00e2??s college and Greek neighborhood, with parties in excess of 1000 people and couches burning in the streets. (Don\u00e2??t worry \u00e2?? violence is pretty rare.) 4/20 is one of the most popular yet controversial events, with large gatherings of students on campus to smoke marijuana. However, CU has recently banned smoking on campus and took measures to prevent the tradition last year. Marijuana is now legal to possess in Colorado, although it is still against the Federal Law. It is legal to possess in Boulder, and illegal to smoke in public, although many Boulder police don\u00e2??t seem to mind., 106206=Watch out when applying for the dorms. If you aren't sure you want to, then don't apply too soon. If you do apply and then decide you don't want to live in the dorms, get out quickly and petition for staying somewhere else. Also, watch out for the fees like the health care plan and such. They add up to well over $2000 sometimes., 167326=For students from Colorado, the university is easily the most expensive public choice and it is difficult to see why. The rec center was literally built before my parents graduated from CU and many of the buildings are poorly prepared for academics such as my programming classroom which did not have a projector despite the professor's repeated requests. More, the university creates a facade of monies well spent while essentially throwing student funds down the drain. A new and unneeded dining hall and an athletic center for losing teams were recently given funding over an expansion for the crammed and nationally ranked engineering school and the unchanged-since-the-1970's environmental design building. And the dorms aren't cheap, nearly $1000 a month per person for a 12x12 room with shared bathrooms is hardly a steal even in Boulder and $8 a meal is above eating out. Verdict, unless you have a major you can't do anywhere else, find somewhere else. Coming from out of state? forget it, tuition is more than many private schools., 901246=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 544907=The oldest structure on campus, it was built in 1876, is this gorgeous building called Old Main. Because it is so beautiful, people get married there and it hosts special events. Also every October, CU Boulder hosts the Nearly Naked Mile for homeless shelters. Every runner donates 5 items of clothing and then we run a mile through campus in \u00e2??minimal\u00e2?? clothing. It is so much fun! During football season, Ralphie, our REAL buffalo mascot, leads the football team into Folsom Field at the beginning of games and the \u00e2??Ralphie Runners\u00e2?? run him around the field. This also happens at the end of half-time. Then every Thursday, there is a glow in the dark bike ride through campus. They play music, decorate their bikes in neon strips, and ride everywhere through campus!, 184609=Boulder is a wonderful place to live. The weather is gorgeous, the people are friendly, anything a student needs whether it be a place for school or living supplies, books, food, entertainment, or a great coffee shop to study or just relax at, is within a 1 mile radius of campus. On top of that, there are 5 major ski resorts under 2 hours away and they are very easy to drive to. It's great to be able to get up early on a weekend morning, get to the mountain by 8:30 when the lifts open, ski all day, and be back in time to study at night!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck CU Boulder is pretty expensive, but it's worth it. So much of the tuition money you pay goes toward making the school a better place and helping students. Am enjoying being here CU Boulder is a great school. There are different schools in the university that you can apply to, and each school has a number of majors to choose from. The advisors are very helpful, and there are also many other resources available for students for any type of needs you may have. Most of the professors are easy to talk to and easy to get in contact with, so there is always a way you can get help. There are also some free tutoring services on campus, and tutoring is free if you live in the residence halls. The campus is beautiful. It's a bit large, but it's not that difficult to get used to, and it's fun to explore. Students also have free access to school rec centers. Boulder has a great environment with wonderful people, so it's not hard to make friends. Am learning a lot CU Boulder has a variety of classes with levels you can choose from that suite you. No doubt, some classes are a little more challenging than others,",
