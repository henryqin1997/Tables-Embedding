This includes stops at Cornbury, Glanfest, Hop Farm Festival and the Tramlines, before embarking on the Alive Tour during the month of September., 4280=In April, the Dunwells rolled out their first new track to the upcoming album called \"Sleepless Nights.\" The same month, they began their first British trek in 2014 dubbed the Light Up the Skies Tour. It kicked off in Stratford and wrapped at Town Hall in Leeds before the guys returned stateside for a festival blast., 2915=This folk rock quintet consists of Joseph Dunwell (vocals, guitar), David Dunwell (vocals, guitar, piano, banjo), Jonny Lamb (vocals, drums), Rob Clayton (bass) and Dave Hanson (guitar, pedal steel). At one time these guys were doing solo gigs in local clubs and pubs. But they brought all that talent together in October 2009, releasing their self-funded debut single \"Elizabeth\" the following spring., 4656=The Dunwells have had an exciting 2014 \u2013 and the year is only half over., 3933=By mid-June the Dunwells found themselves in the midst of 80,000 strong at Bonnaroo in central Tennessee. And though they played various smaller stages instead of the main stage, the band rocked out three times throughout their Saturday visit. They kicked off the day by playing at the Ford Garage, then headed over to the Sonic Stage before closing out the festivities at the New Music on Tap Lounge., 1980=Named HMV Retail's \"Next Big Thing of 2012,\" The Dunwells have played various venues and festivals. They opened for Mumford & Sons and also performed at South by Southwest in March 2012. A summer tour followed, and the band traveled throughout the US and UK, including stops at Red Rocks, Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits., 4566=Fans were ecstatic when the band revealed they had been writing and recording with producer Stephen Harris since late 2013. That led to the booking of a slew of dates both in the US and the UK to kick off the New Year, and the band has been going non-stop ever since., 2485=Doors really opened for the group when they were asked to perform at the 2011 Folk Alliance International in Memphis, Tennessee. They were signed to the Austin-based label Playing In Traffic Records soon after, then pulled together eleven captivating songs that would make up their first album. That project, \"Blind Sighted Faith,\" came in February 2012 with defining tracks like \"I Could Be A King,\" \"So Beautiful\" and \"Goodnight My City.\"}",
