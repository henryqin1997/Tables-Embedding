Dependable and a sure grip will lead to many birdies.\" - Matt LaCourte Jr \"The best putter on the market, HANDS DOWN! I carry 3 10time Aviars and a DX. A truly \"go to\" disc for upshots within 225 feet and in. With my loft putting style, this putter helps me get my disc high in the air, but with a great predictable hyzer finish at the end of its flight.\" - Ken Franks Speed 2, Glide 3, Turn 0, Fade 1 It is made from the Aviar \"small bead\" mold which means it has no bead on the rim. Some of the other Aviar models are made from the Aviar \"big bead\" mold which means they have a bead at the bottom of the rim.
