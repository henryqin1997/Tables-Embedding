    "textAfterTable": "Detailed Description: Temporomandibular Disorder is a common disease nowadays, but there is no guideline for the treatment of TMD. TMD can be divided into masticating muscles dysfunction; internal derangement; inflammation; osteoarthrosis, this study will classify the internal derangement, inflammation and osteoarthrosis into three types according to the TMJ pressure. Then the patient will receive the adjust pressure treatment according to their TMJ pressure. The first part of the TMD patients will receive psychogenic treatment, medicine, physical treatment, bite plate, occlusion treatment, rebuilding occlusion treatment, orthodontic treatment, et. If the patients do not have a good curative effect, part of them will change the treatment into arthrocentesis, arthroscopic treatment or operation treatment, the other part of patients, according to their TMJ pressure, receiving the associated adjust pressure treatment or adjust pressure treatment only. This study will call on the patients for three years and collect the clinical information, then doing the medical statistics. \u00a0 Eligibility Ages Eligible for Study: \u00a0 16 Years to 60 Years Genders Eligible for Study: \u00a0 Both Accepts Healthy",
