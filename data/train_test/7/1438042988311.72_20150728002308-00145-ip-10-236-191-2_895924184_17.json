    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot As a double major I began taking the maximum load possible my second semester of freshman year. One of my majors is Graphic Design and the other is General Music. Both require a rather large number of pre-requisites and I was kind of overwhelmed by the road ahead of me. To tell you the truth, it still seems overwhelming at times because I'm only one year into school and about to start my second and two majors can really take it out of you. I'm even taking summer courses so that I can try to complete both degree programs within four years. But every single teacher I have there is understanding of what I'm trying to accomplish. Every single class I have taken here has been informative and relevant to the degree program to which it applied and up to date! I ended the year with a 3.7 GPA and I know that the knowledge I gained from the year will carry over into the next three years and inevitably into my career!
