    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been shown and described with regard to a preferred embodiment thereof, those skilled in the art will recognize that various changes in form and detail may be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. As mentioned above, the techniques described herein with regard to texture mapping coordinate u may also be used to assign values of texture mapping coordinate v, and are equally applicable to other types of nonlinear mappings, such as Gouraud shading and Phong shading. For Gouraud shading, the color values red (r), green (g) and blue (b) can be approximated in a perspectively correct manner through simple substitution of these values in place of the u and v values used in the texture mapping embodiments described above. Likewise, normal values N can be substituted for the u and v values in order to obtain appropriate perspectively correct approximation when Phong shading surface detailing is employed. The non-recursive methods of FIGS. 7-8B do not require the repetition of the recursive methods of FIGS. 3-6. However, some basic principles exist in both methods. All the methods rely on the fact that the maximum error which would result from an interpolation to determine u (rather than a straight mathematical calculation) will always reside on one of the sides of the triangle. This allows the implementation of the above methods, which use",
