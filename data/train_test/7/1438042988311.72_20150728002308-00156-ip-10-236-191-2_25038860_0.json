    "textBeforeTable": "Here's a look at the odds for each team involved: The draft lottery will award three lucky teams the top three overall picks in this year's draft. The remaining 11 teams will then receive picks No. 4 through 14 in inverse order of their regular-season records. On Tuesday night, the draft lottery will determine the fates of these teams as they all wait to see how the Ping-Pong balls fall.

Until then, we can speculate where each team may go with its lottery selection. There's plenty of talent at the top of this draft, and each team figures to improve in a big way. Here's a possibility of how things could unfold in June's draft if the current order was upheld: 2014 NBA Lottery Mock Draft Pick Team Selection Position College 1 Milwaukee Bucks Andrew Wiggins SF Kansas 2 Philadelphia 76ers Jabari Parker SF Duke 3 Orlando Magic Dante Exum PG",
