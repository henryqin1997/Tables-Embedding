In Canada, it is estimated that in 2009 there will be 1,300 new cases of cervical cancer and that 380 women will die of this disease. The corresponding 2009 data for Ontario is 500 new cases and 140 deaths. In Canada, cervical cancer screening with the Pap test allows for the diagnosis and curative treatment of precancerous lesions of the cervix or early cervical cancers. Symptoms of cervical cancer include vaginal bleeding and discharge. Unfortunately these are often associated with more advanced disease.}",
