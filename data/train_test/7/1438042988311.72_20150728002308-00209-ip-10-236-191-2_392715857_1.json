As they climbed higher into the mountains, they watched as the desert browns were exchanged with forest greens as the scrub-thorn trees disappeared and stands of pine and oak took their place. Finally, where the valley widened out and the river slowed its pace in a series of sweeping meanders, the priests jubilantly announced that \"this is the place!\" The zenithal sun passed overhead on the equivalent of August 13, and 260 days later it passed over again on its way northward. It was not the tropical paradise that most of them had probably visualized when the expedition began, but it did meet the criteria of the \"place where time began.\" In a sense, for the Maya it represented a \"homecoming\" in an otherwise alien land, for they had discovered a place where the sacred almanac -- the very essence of their preoccupation with time -- could be calibrated as it had \"in the beginning\" but in an environment with which they were quite unfamiliar. Cop\u00e1n, the ceremonial center which they founded here, was to become not only the southernmost major center of the lowland Maya civilization, but ultimately one of its most important astronomical centers as well. Its earliest Long Count stela dates to the year A.D. 426., 16019=Figure 43A. This screen display produced by the VOYAGER computer program recreates the sky at sunset in late April in the year A.D. 1000, as it would have appeared through the main window of \"El Caracol\" at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in the Yucat\u00e1n. From the information inset at the top of the display, it will be noted that the sun is directly overhead at the latitude of Izapa (declination 14\u00ba.47) and that it is setting at an azimuth of 285\u00ba.5 -- which would have been precisely in the middle of the observatory window. Although the Pleiades set within minutes of the sun -- at the right-hand edge of the window -- they were not visible in the bright afterglow of the sun. Such a reconstruction proves with dramatic eloquence the author's thesis that the sunset on August 13 -- the only other day of the year that the sun is vertically overhead at the latitude of Izapa -- constituted one of the key astronomical events in ancient Mesoamerican timekeeping. (The VOYAGER program is a product of Carina Software, San Leandro, CA 94577.), 62905=4:30 A.M., 63117=5:54 P.M., 64574=5:06 A.M., 70149=5:44 P.M., 69936=6:13 A.M., 64350=6:13 P.M., 47808=The five major pyramids of Tikal were all constructed within a 40-year period beginning in the mid-eighth century A.D., apparently as part of an ingeniously designed astronomical matrix. The sight-line between Temple I and Temple IV (the highest of the pyramids) marks the sunset position on August 13, whereas the sunrise position at the winter solstice is perpetuated in the sight-tine between Temple IV and Temple III. Because Temple I and Temple III are sited due east-west of each other, they mark sunrise and sunset alignments at the equinoxes. Although there was no star located directly above the earth's pole of rotation in Maya times, a sight-line from Temple V to Temple II appears to have marked the most westerly position of the Maya's equivalent to a polestar, Kochab., 70429=5:40 A.M., 63366=5:56 P.M., 63861=6:10 P.M., 13841=\"El Caracol\" at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 has long been recognized as an astronomical observatory whose foundations are Maya and whose subsequent embellishments are Toltec. Perhaps the most significant alignments of this structure are those of its front door and its principal window, located just above it, both of which look out at the western horizon toward the sunset position on August 13., 63816=4:55 A.M., 63571=4:58 A.M., 62871=5:50 P.M., 69902=5:43 P.M., 53933=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In pointing out that a lunar eclipse visible at Cop\u00e1n did in fact occur on this oft-repeated date, I am left wondering why an event of such transcendental importance, coming so shortly after the debacle the Maya astronomers had experienced with the Dresden Codex, was not given more prominence than it was. David Stuart, one of the leaders of the new epigraphy movement, not only states that the \"astronomical conference\" hypothesis has long since been refuted (1992, 170), but goes on to describe the accession to power of Ruler 16 on that date (178). In the discussion which follows, we also learn that a mysterious \"Personage A\" was likewise \"seated\" on that date, as well as a chieftain known as Yax K'am Lay (180). Stuart admits that he is not certain to what these \"seatings\" refer, but cautions us that a \"seating\" event does not necessarily imply a ruler's inauguration, nor do they point to patterns of co-rulership. Thus, at least we can be assured that Cop\u00e1n did not acquire three new chieftains on the day the eclipse took place., 55308=This screen display produced by the VOYAGER computer program recreates the total lunar eclipse of June 29, A.D. 763, as seen from the major Mayan astronomical center of Cop\u00e1n in present-day Honduras. The sky has been 'whitened' for ease of reproduction and the author has superimposed upon it explanations of the various symbols. As explained in the text, the author's identification of this eclipse as the event which occasioned the multiple recordings of the Mayan date of 9.16.12.5.17 6 Caban 10 Mol at Cop\u00e1n strongly argues for the validity of the initial Thompson correlation rather than for his \"revised\" one. (The VOYAGER program is a product of Carina Software, San Leandro, CA 94577.), 70183=5:51 A.M., 64105=6:14 P.M., 41553=Figure 48. The western horizon at Tikal as seen from Temple I. The low, squat structure in the middle foreground is Temple II, which serves not only as an architectural counterweight to Temple I as seen across the plaza of Tikal but also as a horizon marker for the enigmatic \"8\u00ba west of north\" orientation when viewed from Temple V. The latter orientation was present at La Venta about 1000 B.C., but also shows up at the Maya capital about A.D. 800. Farther to the left, Temple III defines the equinoctial sunset position as seen from Temple I, while the highest of the skyscraper pyramids -- Temple IV, on the right -- fixes the sunset position on August 13 as seen from Temple I., 70463=6:20 P.M., 42281=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, as will become apparent from the discussion to follow, there is good reason to believe that the highest pyramid of the five -- that labeled by the archaeologists as Temple IV -- was actually the first to have its site established. It was constructed on the water-divide directly in line with the sunrise position over Victoria Peak on December 22. (It should be kept in mind that staking out the site of a pyramid and completing its construction are two very different things; the lintel of Temple IV was not put into place until after A.D. 741.), 48621=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The latter is the lowest and most unpretentious of the five skyscraper pyramids. Indeed, when one stands atop Temple I and views the western horizon, the equinoctial sight-line to Temple III and the August 13 sightline to Temple IV bracket Temple II on either side. Although it might seem that Temple II's function was merely to serve as an architectural counterweight to Temple I, its construction for such a purpose would have represented a sizable commitment of both manpower and resources solely for aesthetic reasons. Moreover, the site of Temple II -- offset slightly to the south, allowing unobstructed sight-lines between Temples I, III, and IV -- suggests that aesthetics alone did not dictate its placement. Furthermore, when the azimuth of Temple II as viewed from Temple V is found to be 352\u00ba, or 8\u00ba west of north, one cannot help but remember that the Olmecs had used that same orientation for the layout of La Venta nearly 1800 years earlier., 64631=6:11 P.M., 71909=5:16 A.M., 64872=5:08 A.M., 76717=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To be sure, in both instances the Venusian cycle could only have been worked out by long and patient counting. Having the Long Count against which to tally such a lengthy series of observations would surely have helped the Maya to expedite record keeping and insure its overall accuracy, but it would not have been essential to the process itself. Indeed, the major purpose of the \"Venus table\" in the Dresden Codex seems to have been to assist the Maya priests in making periodic corrections to their calculations, for in any 104-year period the planet got 5.2 days out of phase with the table (Kelley, 1977, 58). (For a detailed discussion of how the Maya shifted the base of their calculations to keep Venus \"on track,\" see Closs, 1977, 89-99.), 63434=5:09 P.M., 71172=4:44 A.M., 70217=6:32 P.M., 70962=5:40 P.M., 63185=5:02 P.M., 62939=4:43 P.M., 64060=4:48 A.M., 70679=5:28 A.M., 65121=5:09 A.M., 69970=6:56 P.M., 45864=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the positions of the first three pyramids had been worked out, the siting of a fourth structure (Temple V) could now be established. For this a hill about 250 in (800 ft) to the southwest of Temple I was chosen. The exact position of Temple V, however, forms an alignment which makes a perfect right angle with that of Temples I and IV Ironically, Thompson, for all his fascination with and love for the Maya, was not terribly impressed with their architecture, and candidly makes the claim that they were incapable of constructing a right angle (Thompson, 1974, 94). However, the alignments between Temples IV, I, and V at Tikal convincingly prove him wrong (Hartung, 1977, 114)., 71206=5:14 P.M., 64305=5:03 A.M., 22719=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 By this time they had put more than 150 km (90 mi) of forest trail behind them, but the priests who were leading the expedition knew that many more days of travel still lay ahead. Back in Tikal the zenithal sun passed overhead on the equivalent of August 5 and did not again cross the zenith until May 8. Although the former date was only 8 days before the \"day that time began,\" the sun was also 8 days too late in its second passage over Tikal, resulting in an interval of 276 days between the two zenithal passages. Now, as they entered the Motagua Valley, the priests checked the interval between vertical suns again, and found that it had narrowed to about 265 days. Its southward passage took place on the equivalent of August 10 and its northward transit occurred on May 2. There was no option now but to follow the Motagua upstream until the correct interval could be located., 2033=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As the wave of urbanization swept over the peninsula of Yucat\u00e1n in the centuries following the founding of Edzn\u00e1, the flat and featureless landscape of the low, limestone plateau afforded the Maya with few opportunities to orient their incipient cities to topographic features of any significance. At El Mirador, in northernmost Guatemala, for example, evidence is just now coming to light regarding its impressive proportions, its age, and its configuration. Dating to just about the beginning of the Christian era, this site appears to have followed the pattern of Edzn\u00e1 in its layout, for its dominating structure -- a lofty pyramid called by its excavators Danta (\"tapir\") -- is squarely oriented toward the setting sun on August 13 over the Tigre pyramid, some 2 km (1.25 mi) to the west (Matheny, 1987, 334-335). This does not mean, however, that the principle of solsticial orientation had been either forgotten or totally abandoned, because that was definitely not the case. Where the topography permitted -- and among the lowland Maya, this was in very few instances indeed -- locating a ceremonial center with respect to a solsticial sunrise or sunset was still most probably the preferred principle to employ. Thus, when the ceremonial center of Uaxact\u00fan in the Pet\u00e9n region of northern Guatemala was founded -- most likely about the first or second century A.D. -- its site represented the point on the watershed between the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean from which the winter solstice sunrise could be calibrated over Baldy Beacon (1020 m, 3346 ft) in the Maya Mountains of Belize. (However, this did not prevent the local priests from \"reinforcing\" the azimuths of both the summer and winter solstices architecturally, for one of the earliest illustrations of archaeoastronomic alignments ever reported -- by Frans Blom in 1924 -- was the relationship of the structures in Group E at Uaxact\u00fan. He noted that sight-lines from Building VII to the northern corner of Building I and to the southern corner of Building III mark the sunrise positions on the summer and winter solstices, respectively, while a sight-line through the middle of Building II commemorates the equinoctial sunrise [Rojas, 1983, 25, 281.), 67010=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In contrast to the very slowly changing positions of the sun and Venus during superior conjunction, it will be seen from Table 5 how rapidly they move first toward one another and then away from one another at the time of inferior conjunction. Again, the Mesoamerican observer would not have been able to precisely establish the time of their closest passage, but anyone employing the Codex Borgia would have anticipated the planet's disappearance on March 26 and its reappearance about 12 days later on April 7. In this instance, the angular separation of the two bodies would have diminished to just under 12\u00ba. Using the Dresden Codex, the disappearance of Venus would have been calculated as occurring on March 28 and its visual return would have been anticipated some 8 days later on April 5. Interestingly, in this instance the visual extinction of Venus would occur when the angular distance between the sun and Venus fell below 10\u00ba. Though the angular values are identical to what they were at the time of superior conjunction, they have here been reversed in the two indigenous sources, again reinforcing the difficulty which the early Mesoamericans had in pinpointing the planet's true position during its supposed absence in the underworld., 71718=4:18 A.M., 71988=4:00 A.M., 6674=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 During the following two to three centuries, civilization spread through the jungles of Pet\u00e9n like a tidal wave. In what has to have been the greatest crescendo of land clearing and city building that the Mesoamerican world had ever witnessed, the Maya peoples rose to unparalleled heights of political organization, economic prosperity, and social sophistication. Although several writers have labeled this the \"Old Empire\" period of the Maya, Frans Blom more accurately defined it as the \"Pet\u00e9n period,\" for most of this feverish expansion was geographically concentrated in the rain forests of what is today northern Guatemala, Belize, and the southern Yucat\u00e1n. Only in later Classic times (after 600 A.D.) did a similar wave of development occur farther north, giving rise to what the same writers called the \"New Empire\" of the Maya, but which Blom has characterized as the \"Yucat\u00e1n period\" (Blom, 1983, 309 - 310).\u00a0 The preferability of Blom's terminology derives not only from his insistence on the difference in geographic focus, but also because the Maya seem never to have developed anything like a unified empire. Indeed, most likely because of the environment in which they lived, their most extensive political unit did not evolve beyond the level of the city-state. The most unfortunate consequence of this fact, in turn, was an ongoing rivalry between adjacent political dynasties which manifested itself in an almost endemic state of warfare. A strikingly frequent subject of both Maya art and inscriptions are dynastic struggles and slave raids, whereas fortifications were an integral part of many of their early urban centers, such as Edzn\u00e1, Tikal, and Bec\u00e1n., 71138=5:47 P.M., 71386=5:48 P.M., 49703=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In the case of La Venta we had argued that the point in the heavens toward which its central axis was aligned was the closest thing to a pole star that existed for the Olmecs in 1000 B. C. Naturally, any point so close to the north celestial pole would be circumpolar and therefore have no rising or setting position which could be marked against the horizon. On the other hand, the star Kochab (magnitude 2.07), with a declination of 83\u00ba.5 in the year 1000 B.C., was only about 6\u00ba.5 away from the pole of rotation in that year and was thus the celestial body with the smallest radius of movement. However, in the intervening 1800 years, precession had caused Kochab to shift its declination to just under 79\u00ba, so by the year A.D. 800 it was 11\u00ba away from the pole. But, in the same time period, the star Polaris (magnitude 2.02) had precessed from being just over 17\u00ba away from the pole in 1000 B.C. to the point where its declination was 82\u00ba.7, or just under 8\u00ba away from the pole in the year A.D. 800. Thus, by the time the Maya were reaching their apogee, Polaris had replaced Kochab as being the closest bright star to the pole of rotation but even then it was still a good 8\u00ba away from where it is today. In fact, the present generation of humanity is one of the few which can actually think and speak in terms of a \"polestar,\" for at no other time in recorded history has a highly visible celestial body stood so close to the pole of rotation as Polaris does now., 33450=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In any event, whether the journey was accomplished in one season or in many, it resulted in the founding of a ceremonial center at what is now known as either Alta Vista or Chalchihuites in the state of Zacatecas. Located at an elevation of 2200 in (7200 ft) in the eastern foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental, it has access to a stream just below it and a sweeping view over the mountains to the east. Situated within 2 km (1.25 mi) of the Tropic of Cancer (Aveni, 1977, 5), it is aligned with Cerro Picacho, a notably sharp peak on the northeastern horizon, at the summer solstice sunrise. To reinforce this alignment the builders of the site dug trenches about 2.5-3.0 m (7- 10 ft) into the hillside and plastered them with adobe. Nearby, a temple with 28 irregular columns apparently replicates the changing size of the moon as it advances from one phase to another, and on an adjacent hilltop, two pecked crosses of unmistakable Teotihuacano vintage have been found (Aveni, 1977, 5). Dating to the late fifth or early sixth century A.D., Chalchihuites provides clear-cut evidence of the active astronomical concerns of the priestly elite of the great Mesoamerican metropolis at the apogee of its economic, political, and cultural existence., 65166=6:07 P.M., 68386=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to Lucrecia Maupom\u00e9 (1986, 44), most scholars believe that the ancient Mesoamericans used the inferior conjunction of Venus to define the length of its cycle, although both Eduard Seler and Mart\u00ednez Hern\u00e1ndez are dissenters to this view. In any event, Aveni's findings concerning the variable length of Venus's disappearance at inferior conjunction scarcely makes that any more reliable an indicator of the planet's location in the sky than any of the other longer phases., 64951=6:04 A.M., 70894=5:46 P.M., 64677=5:54 A.M., 14921=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have already seen how their \"obedience\" to the sun-god seems to have led to the founding of a \"relay station\" on the ridge that visually separated Orizaba from the Valley of Mexico and how they had laid out their city in the valley to align both with the winter solstice sunrise over Mexico's highest mountain and with the sunset on August 13 (see Figure 23). Somewhat later, their preoccupation with the movements of Venus had prompted them to establish an astronomical observatory in the northeastern hills at Xihuingo to mark the planet's extreme rising and setting positions (Wallrath and Ruiz, 1991, 297). Therefore, it was probably only a question of time before their curiosity would send them off on a couple of more distant expeditions to answer two of the most fundamental questions posed by their cultural heritage., 80472=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the Maya's efforts to accurately predict eclipses were crowned by success so late in their history (i.e., A.D. 763), then their struggle to define the phases of Venus appears to have come even later still. Indeed, Floyd Lounsbury (1983) argues that the Maya \"Venus table\" was historically set in motion on the Long Count date of 10.5.6.4.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab, which equates to November 20, A.D. 934. On that morning, a heliacal rising of Venus occurred which Lounsbury has called \"a unique event in historical time,\" because it came exactly three Great Cycles (146 x 260 days) after the base date of the Dresden Codex. Lounsbury believes that the Maya astronomers did not recognize the need to shift bases (i.e., correct their calculations) until a full Great Cycle had elapsed. Ironically, attaining such precision at such a late date must have been small consolation indeed for a society whose very foundations were already crumbling beneath them., 13252=The principle of orientation to the August 13th sunset was probably first utilized about 800 B.C. and continued well into Classic times. Its use implies an enhanced level of sophistication over and above the basic principle of solsticial orientation. The extent of its geographic diffusion is a good approximation of the limits of the Mesoamerican cultural realm as it existed at the peak of Teotihuac\u00e1n's influence., 75704=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, the fact that the details of Venus's movements were not defined by the Maya until the early seventh century -- to wit, the base date of the Dresden Codex, which is 9.9.9.16.0 1 Ahau 18 Kayab = February 6, A.D. 623 -- reveals how elusive the solution of this riddle must have been, even for a people with such a sophisticated mathematical system as the Long Count. Even so, as Michael Closs observes (1977, 97), they chose a nonastronomical base for their count, suggesting to him that the Maya sought to correlate the movements of Venus to its supposed \"birthday\" on 1 Ahau, in order to facilitate their computations using the Long Count. On the other hand, for those peoples living on the Mexican plateau who were not the cultural beneficiaries of the Long Count, the answer seems to have come even later still, judging from the fact that the Codex Borgia dates to Aztec times., 77600=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of critical importance, however, was finding a well-defined starting point from which the cycle could be calibrated. (The difficulty of using the planet's disappearances we have already discussed.) But what, after all, is fixed about a \"star\" that shows up in the eastern sky before dawn for nearly eight months, disappears for about two and a half to three months, then reappears in the western sky shortly before sunset for something over eight months, and disappears again for between 8 and 12 days? Indeed, as Aveni has shown, the Maya appear to have incorporated lunar observations into the Dresden Codex in an effort to pin down the movements of Venus, assuming somewhat naively that the motions of one celestial body probably controlled or influenced those of another (Aveni, photocopy preprint, n.d., 11). Kelley, on the other hand, makes the reverse argument, stating that there are indications that Venus's movements were \"somehow used in predicting eclipses\" (1977, 70). As Thompson has pointed out, \"Both phenomena [solar eclipses and the heliacal risings of the planet Venus] were greatly feared by the Maya\" (1972, 111)., 71954=5:49 P.M., 65200=6:10 A.M., 57924=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After the sun and the moon, the planet Venus is the brightest object in the heavens. Small wonder, then, that for the peoples of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica it figured prominently in both their mythology and religious rituals. Unlike the ancient Greeks who only belatedly realized that the \"morning star\" and the \"evening star\" were one and the same body, the Mesoamericans recognized it as a single celestial object which passed through a cycle having four distinct phases, even though they did so without ever truly understanding what occasioned these respective changes. Among the Maya, who formalized their observations of Venus in the Dresden Codex, it was described as a morning star for a period of 236 days, followed by a 90-day period of invisibility when it was assumed to be in the \"underworld.\" This, in turn, was followed by a 250-day period when the planet was seen as an evening star, after which there was another 8-day period when it again \"disappeared\" into the underworld. Although the lengths of the individual phases were certainly not as precise as suggested by the above numbers, the complete Venusian cycle according to the Maya totaled 584 days, a value which is remarkably close to the planet's 583.92 day synodic period recognized by modern astronomers. (As David Kelley has pointed out, however, the Venusian interval varies from 579.6 days to 588.1 days within a given five-year period, so the 584 value is really a mean [Kelley, 1977, 58].), 70849=5:26 A.M., 60859=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These differences can perhaps best be understood by examining the following tables which present critical data relating to two of Venus's most recent conjunctions with the sun. In both tables, the rising and setting times of the sun and Venus are as they would have been experienced from the major ceremonial site of Cholula on the Mexican plateau. Cholula was chosen for this example because (1) it is known to have been a key center for the worship of Quetzalc\u00f3atl, the god-king who was believed by the Nahuatl-speaking peoples of the meseta to have been reincarnated as the planet Venus, and (2) it is considered by many anthropologists to have been the source of the Codex Borgia, the primary indigenous account of the planet's movements stemming from the Mexican plateau (Krickeberg, 1982, 193). In the first table, the superior conjunction of June 13, 1992, is presented statistically, whereas in the second, the inferior conjunction of April 1, 1993, is displayed in the same manner., 63684=5:24 P.M., 64917=6:09 P.M., 4482=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ironically, when the so-called Maya capital of Tikal was founded just 25 km (16 mi) to the south of Uaxact\u00fan about a century later, along the same height of land between the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, its site marked the point where the winter solstice sunrise could be seen over Victoria Peak,, which is the highest peak in the Maya Mountains (1122 m, 3681 ft). Indeed, one is tempted to speculate that the Maya may initially have thought that the culminating peak of that range was Baldy Beacon, but upon discovering some years later that this was not true, they felt obliged to build a second and larger ceremonial center to commemorate the critical calendrical event over the higher mountain. Otherwise, there is certainly little reason for having located two major ceremonial centers so close to one another -- a matter which, it may be pointed out, has long puzzled most archaeologists (see Figure 39)., 44827=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With the location of Temples IV and III now worked out, the position of Temple I was automatically fixed. It would be located directly east of Temple III so that priests standing atop the latter structure could calibrate the equinoctial sunrises (i.e., on March 21 and September 21) over Temple I. (Of course, once both pyramids were in place, priests standing atop Temple I could use the backsight to Temple III to calibrate equinoctial sunsets as well.) Temple I's exact distance from Temple III, about 300 m (1000 ft), would be determined by the intersection of the equinoctial sunrise line with the point from which the August 13 sunset could be viewed against the midline of Temple IV's doorway. In other words, priests standing atop Temple I could calibrate their most important day -- \"the day the world began\" -- by sighting to the middle of the doorway of the highest pyramid the Maya ever constructed., 64384=5:43 A.M., 70600=5:29 A.M., 65234=6:58 P.M., 63321=5:02 A.M., 19588=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These, of course, were two very sound geographic questions and to answer them fieldwork would be required. Expeditions would have to be sent out to determine physically where the sun passed vertically overhead on the equivalent of August 13 and where the sun \"stood still\" on the equivalent of June 22. In the first instance they realized that the quest would take them southward, no doubt to the fabled paradise of Tamoanchan. (According to the legends of Teotihuac\u00e1n, their forebears had come from a lush, green forested region so named, replete with exotic birds and butterflies, far to the south.) Much as they may have been tempted to undertake this journey themselves -- and who knows, perhaps one or more priests from Teotihuac\u00e1n formed part of the expedition's personnel -- this was a task best left to someone nearer at hand, so this assignment they allocated to their Maya subordinates in Tikal. The mandate was clear: keep going southward until a place was found where a 260-day interval exists between zenithal sun positions., 71093=5:23 A.M., 51399=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The discovery of the Dresden Codex in the Yucat\u00e1n speaks to much of the Maya's lunar research having been carried out in that region, most likely at places like Edzn\u00e1 and Uxmal. However, it would appear that the ultimate breakthrough for the Maya came at their astronomical site of Cop\u00e1n, in the mountains of western Honduras, some eight years after the base dates recorded in the Codex, for in 763 an event of singular importance took place there. For well over half a century debate has centered on what this remarkable event must have been, for the date of its occurrence is engraved no fewer than eight times on seven different altars, stelae, and buildings (Carlson, 1977, 105). Initially, Herbert Spinden proposed that an astronomical congress must have taken place on that occasion, for the date is accompanied by portraits of what seem to be important personages seated on pillows (Spinden, 1924). Epigraphers have more recently suggested that the much-repeated date commemorates the accession to power of an important king. Although I cannot evaluate the merits of either of these arguments, I can point out that on the date in question a total lunar eclipse, visible from Cop\u00e1n, took place just after sunset. When the difference of longitude between Honduras and London is factored in, the Maya Long Count date (using Thompson's original correlation value) and Oppolzer's date agree perfectly. (The multiply recorded Maya Long Count date is 9.16.12.5.17 6 Caban 10 Mol, which equals Maya day-number 1,415,637. Adding the GMT correlation factor of 584,285 yields Julian Day number 1,999,922, which equates to June 29, A.D. 763. Since the midpoint of totality occurred at 7:10 P.M. Honduras time, it was then 1:10 A.M. in London, where a new Julian Day had begun at midnight. Thus, the lunar eclipse in question, listed as number 3050 in Oppolzer's catalog, is recorded as having taken place on Julian Day number 1,999,923, which is, of course, what the date then was in Europe.) It would appear, therefore, that coming so shortly after the \"near misses\" which had been calculated in the Dresden Codex (see Chapter 6), the eclipse at Cop\u00e1n may well have been the first such event which the Maya successfully predicted. Indeed, it may well be that they were so certain of their success, that for the occasion they had convened an astronomical congress to witness it., 63650=4:33 A.M., 70350=5:31 A.M., 64139=5:21 A.M., 62826=5:15 A.M., 37114=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, the discovery that one or more of the pyramids contain the tombs of nobles and/or their consorts has tended to confuse some scholars who have been reluctant to lift their gaze out of the holes they have excavated in the ground and look skyward instead. As the loftiest creations of the Maya, the five pyramids of Tikal represent an earthly fixation with a celestial concern, for in 1979 1 discovered that they had been constructed as an astronomical matrix whose purpose it was to calibrate the most important dates in the Maya year., 69857=5:36 A.M., 56055=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, in pointing out my uneasiness with even this one result obtained by the epigraphers who, in Coe's words, have \"broken the Maya code,\" I realize that I have already defied one of the most outspoken professional warnings that I have ever seen in print, to wit this quote from Linda Schele: \"The decipherment has occurred. There are two ways to react to it. One is to embrace it, and if you can't do it yourself, get someone on your side who bloody well can. The other is to ignore it, to try and destroy it, to basically dismiss it\" (Coe, 1992, 273). On the other hand, if anyone has any doubts about the solsticial and other alignments which figure so prominently in the exposition presented here, he or she can either replicate my observations in the field or make the required measurements on large-scale maps for themselves., 64418=6:49 P.M., 70395=5:45 P.M., 72022=4:22 P.M., 63072=5:05 A.M., 64723=6:54 P.M., 64985=6:57 P.M., 71764=4:44 P.M., 63895=4:56 A.M., 65531=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although no Mesoamerican observer could have known when the actual moment of conjunction took place, had he been privy to the calculations contained in the Dresden Codex he would have expected the planet's disappearance on April 30 and its reappearance on July 28. As can be seen from Table 4, this meant that the Maya were essentially unable to distinguish the planet's position any closer than about 12\u00ba from the sun at the time of superior conjunction. Someone employing the calculations of the Codex Borgia would have anticipated the planet's disappearance on May 5 instead, when its angular separation from the sun had narrowed to about 10\u00ba.5, and its reappearance on July 22, when its angular distance had once more widened to about the same value. In other words, using the naked-eye astronomy available at the time, there was an angular discrepancy of at least 1\u00ba.5 -- equivalent to about 6 days in time -- in the two observational records, revealing how difficult it was to actually pinpoint the planet's location with any degree of accuracy. However, recent calculations by Anthony Aveni have demonstrated that the 8-day period of invisibility used in the Dresden Codex at inferior conjunction can actually vary from as few as 3 days to as many as 16, depending on the ecliptic's orientation to the horizon (Aveni, photocopy preprint, 8)., 70104=5:33 A.M., 63616=6:00 P.M., 9946=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, it is probably safe to say that during the entire Classic Period not a single major Maya ceremonial center was erected without preserving in at least one of its key structures an alignment either to a solstice or to the sunset on August 13. Denied the option of using a topographic feature for such a purpose, the Maya incorporated these sacred precepts into the very fa\u00e7ades of their buildings. The palaces at Sayil and Labn\u00e1, the Codz Pop at Kab\u00e1h, the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, the Temple of the Magician at Uxmal, El Castillo at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, and the main pyramid at Tonin\u00e1 are but a few examples of such alignments. All Maya ceremonial centers likewise employed the Long Count in the dating of their monuments., 71615=5:19 A.M., 17229=Figure 43B. A reconstruction of a late April sunset in the year A.D. 1000 with a photograph of the window of El Caracol superimposed over the dome of the Griffiths Observatory planetarium. It clearly shows the setting sun in the middle of the window and the Pleiades to the upper right. On August 13th, when the sun is again overhead at Izapa, the same phenomenon may be observed, but without the presence of the Pleiades. (Photograph courtesy of E. C. Krupp.), 42949=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 However, because Victoria Peak is not easily visible on the southeastern horizon, the Maya erected a second pyramid to mark this alignment as seen from Temple IV (no doubt following the pattern of architecturally reinforcing key astronomical alignments which seems to have already been established at Uaxact\u00fan). This was Temple III, which was constructed on somewhat lower ground about 400 m (1300 ft) to the southeast. In order that it actually serve as a horizon marker, it was necessary to surmount the pyramid with a massive roof-comb, an architectural embellishment which the Maya frequently used to give their otherwise squat-looking structures more impressive height. And, in the case of Temple III, the roof-comb was a full three tiers high -- not just for aesthetic reasons but quite obviously for the practical one of intersecting the horizon. Thus, as viewed from the top of Temple IV, the middle of the triple-tiered Temple III will be seen to just intersect the distant horizon at the azimuth (i.e., 115\u00ba) where the winter solstice sunrise occurs over Victoria Peak.
