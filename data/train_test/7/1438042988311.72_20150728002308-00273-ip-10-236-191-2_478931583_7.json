    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{69389=FIG. 5 diagrammatically illustrates a merchandise showroom screen-lobby level. This merchandise showroom can show the products either in text or by illustration. Illustrations are preferable but download time to customers must be taken into account when designing the system. Screen area 209 provides an electronic entrance way to an exemplary automobile store. The merchandise showroom screen indicates that the automobile store will be closed until July, 1997. In contrast, house or home appliances store 211 is open to customers until Jun. 15, 1997. Large appliances are open until June 10. The electronic store is open daily. The products and services offered for sale through this system are functionally grouped together. It is believed that users may browse through the merchandise showroom and select one or more items and potentially bid for the purchase of one or more items from one of these electronic stores. However, it is beneficial to show the user at the lobby level or merchandise showroom screen that the system operator sells a wide variety for products and services., 80618=The bid checker file enables all members or preregistered customers to determine what bid was accepted for a particular product or service. The Bid Checker File-Screen Table includes a short description of the item, the open, close and bid acceptance date and a bid chart. The bid chart shows the member pseudonym or nickname (M-PSE 1), the member's identification number which is hidden (H) except in certain situations, the date of the bid, the bid amount and the accepted bid. In the Bid Checker Table set forth above, the accepted bid has been underlined. The member ID number is only revealed to the system operator and is only revealed to the member whose ID number matches one of the hidden member ID numbers shown in the bid chart. In this example, member with the pseudonym M-PSE 1 has been assigned a membership or customer number CU 849. That member placed a bid of $38 on, for example, a pair of NIKE shoes. Member #1 placed that bid on May 1, 1997. The same member placed another $32 bid on the same pair of NIKE shoes. That $32 bid was accepted by the system as the highest winning bid from all bidders while excluding other higher bids from the same member. Of course, the bid chart cannot be compiled until after bids have been accepted. Members with pseudonyms 5, 6, 12 and 20 placed bids on the NIKE shoes on May 1, 1997. Those member bids were offers to purchase to NIKE shoes for $31, $30, $30 and $27. Since member #1's bid of $32 was higher than all other member's bids, member #1's bid of $32 was awarded., 96680=For example, the member account activity shown in FIG. 7 reveals that on May 1, 1997 the member placed four bids for one pair of NIKE shoes. The bids range from $22-$38. The electronic bid, auction and sale system accepted a $32 bid and the goods were shipped on May 9, 1997. The confirmation number XP321 is shown as a field in that data record. In contrast, the member placed two bids on May 15, 1997 for theater tickets. Since the bid cycle is still open, the account activity screen reveals that no bids have been accepted. A summary of the member's monthly bid charges is also provided. The system operator charged $3 per bid for the shoes and $5 per bid for the theater tickets. Accordingly, the $22 bid charge has been accessed against the member's American Express (AMX) credit card. This is reflected in the bid program (FIGS. 6A, 6B) in step 326 wherein the system clears a bid charge for all the bids posted by the member., 73942=The item description table includes information regarding the generic name of the product or service, the brand name, the manufacturer and/or supplier of the product or service, model number, SKU number, manufacturer's suggested retail price MSRP, and the number of units offered for sale through the system. For example, the system operator may contract with a distributor of Westinghouse refrigerators in order to sell 200 refrigerators during the month of August, 1997. These refrigerators must be identified by manufacturer, brand, the available colors of these refrigerators must be identified, and the suggested retail price should be posted to spur sales or bids on these units. The system operator identifies and posts a minimum opening bid. A customer's bid less than the minimum opening bid will not be accepted. With respect to the refrigerator example, the customer or user may be able to select the color of the refrigerator. Accordingly, the item description file or screen should show or be configured to show, if necessary, the color selection available to the customer/member/user. These are restrictions or conditions of the sale unique to each item offered for sale., 90111=In step 340, the system electronically compiles the total bid count for each merchandise item offered for sale. In step 342, the system computes the running average bid for each item offered for sale, the mean of those bids, the mode and the range of all bids made and all bids accepted or awarded as \"winning\" bids. In step 344 the system conducts a frequency analysis on the bid data. This frequency analysis may be helpful to the system operator and to the suppliers and the manufacturers of the products and services. For example, if the sales of electronic equipment is heavily concentrated at Saturday between the hours of 5:00 and 11:00 p.m., it is important that the system operator keep the electronic store open during that time frame. On the other hand, the sales of automobiles may be concentrated during a time frame of Sunday, between 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Further, a frequency analysis of the bidding price, the time of day the bids were posted, and even the geographic location of the members may be useful to the system operator. If the system operator wishes to enhance his sales position with the supplier or manufacturers of these products and services, the system operator could sell this information to the manufacturers and suppliers., 97633=The member account activity screen also shows that on April 20 the member placed two bids on a Westinghouse stove. Since the member's bids were below the accepted bid of $265, the screen shows \"NA\" or not applicable. However, the member was charged $20 for placing two bids on the Westinghouse stove.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets The claims appended hereto are meant to cover modifications and changes within the scope and spirit of the present invention. Other interaction between the computer system 20 and call center computer system 62 is discussed in detail above in connection with FIGS. 1-10. The customer may place a bid via call center 62 and that bid, after being entered by the operator at call center 62 would be electronically posted at computer system 20. After the close of the bid cycle and on the acceptance date, computer system 20 would then award the winning bids and identify the winning bidders. Computer system 20 then posts these winning bids and compiles the publicly available bid chart discussed above in connection with the Bid Checker File-Screen Table. Thereafter, computer system 20 could compile an electronic file identifying the winning bids, the amount of those bids, the members' names, e-mail address and telephone numbers and other member data and electronically ship that information to call center computer system 62. The operator at call center computer system 62 could then open a voice or audio channel with the customer at telephone 13 to notify the customer that he or she is the winning bidder. Thereafter, the operator at call center 62 could confirm the sale, establish a method of payment and confirm the ship date of the goods.
