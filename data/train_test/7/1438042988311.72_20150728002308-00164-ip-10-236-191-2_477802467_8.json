    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As described in detail, in the waterproof connector-mounting construction of the invention, the tapered portion is formed at the connector-mounting through hole formed through the mounting member, and the housing, having the mounting plate, is mounted on the terminal, and the seal ring is mounted on the exposed portion of the terminal, and the mounting plate is mounted on the mounting member, so that the seal ring is held in intimate contact with the tapered portion through the mounting plate. Therefore, the two areas (which require the waterproof sealing), provided respectively between the mounting member and the housing and between the housing and the terminal, can be sealed in a waterproof manner by the single seal ring provided in the tapered portion. As a result, because of the reduced number of the component parts, the reduced production cost and the enhanced assembling efficiency can be achieved. In the above-mentioned waterproof connector-mounting construction 70, although the outer peripheral surface of the flange 59 is exposed as the terminal exposure surface 68, the outer peripheral surface of the base portion 57 of the terminal 49 may be directly exposed as a terminal exposure portion 68. In this case, it is not necessary to form the flange 59, and the formation or processing of the terminal 49 can be made easier. In such a construction, also, the tapered portion 45 is formed at the connector-mounting through hole 45, and",
