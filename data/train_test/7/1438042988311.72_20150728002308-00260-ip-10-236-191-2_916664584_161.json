            "There is nothing like a Clemson Football game in Death Valley. The most exciting 25 seconds in college football happens here as the Tigers run down The Hill at the beginning of every game. The spirit and happiness is apparent to all those around and you can hear the crowd cheering from a mile away.",
            "In Clemson there is never nothing to do. If you love the outdoors, this is the place for you. With Lake Hartwell five minutes down the road and the mountains just a short drive away, the weekends are filled with sunbathing and hiking. During football season Death Valley is the place to be. If those aren't for you there is shopping and several movie theaters about fifteen minutes down the road.",
            "Food and dining isn't quite gourmet, but the staff does a great job with the resources provided. In just the two years I have been here there have been many changes for the better, so I'm sure things will only improve! Plus, aside from dining halls there are several places to eat such as Subway, Chili's, and multiple cafes.",
            "For me, I loved dorm life. The dorms are a fun way to meet new people, especially your roommate since you share a room. While yes, there isn't much space, there is much fun to be had in that small 9x11 foot space. Keep an open mind and remember to have patience; you and your roommate are both new to college.",
            "Classes in college will almost always be harder than high school, but don't lose hope if at first you don't succeed. Clemson is an academically prestigious institution, but with amazing support behind the students. Professors have office hours and the University offers free tutoring in the library as well as specified Student Instructors for many courses. I have never once felt as though help could not be reached.",
            "Keep an open mind and try new things. Let yourself explore; the scenery is magnificent. Join clubs, participate in school activities, and definitely go to the football games! Clemson is a unique place with a heart the size of Texas. You have to live on campus freshman year, but enjoy being so close to classes and in the middle of all the action! By immersing yourself in activities you will find yourself falling into a routine and make friends for life.",
            "Set in the beautiful hills of Clemson, S.C., you won't find a school with more spirit, pride, and integrity than Clemson University. Professors are helpful, students are kind, and the Tiger's home turf is a one of a kind place. With the help of a great staff and support system, students are able to have successful academic semesters as well as enjoy the perks of Clemson such as the quaint down town area, Lake Hartwell, and Death Valley Stadium."

Applied learning has helped to advance Clemson to the top 20 public schools in the country as of 2014. Overall the University wants you to succeed in academics as well as future career opportunities, producing successful students., 578417=I'd say there's probably around a 1000 people affiliated in greek life? It's everywhere but you definitely DON'T have to join to make friends or feel complete, 23290=Clemson has many things to do. There are always sports going on. You can join intramural, club, or varsity sports. There are many clubs and leisure skill classes you can take. Clemson also has random activities that they send you emails about. Last December, Clemson even went to the extent to set up an ice skating rink right on campus., 814391=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 667409=Clemson is a great campus to be on during the school year and even when school is not in session. It is ranked in the top 25 for colleges and has great staff that are very welcoming. I cannot wait to start in August., 662857=I had no intention of going to Clemson until I toured in April of senior year. The campus was beautiful and there was something about it that made it feel like a close-knit community. There's not much to do in the surrounding area if you don't have a car but there are so many organizations on campus that if you just give your email at the organizations fair, you'll always be a part of something and have something to do. I'm not a huge fan of the housing and dining but that's pretty much all that's ever bothered me., 434569=Keep your GPA up and your SAT score high. Clemson is selective, but it never hurts to apply even if you think you will not get in! Also, never think that just because you have a 1600 on the SAT or a 4.0 you will get in. Clemson seems to look a lot at extracurricular activities too., 199601=clemson is definitely a sports-minded school. football season welcomes the tigers in august. in december the torch is handed to basketball season. and in march we are graced by baseball season. throughout the year there are also other sporting events to go to and for those who are not interested in sports, clemson offers great bands for concerts in the coliseum on campus. clemson also organizes social events for all tigers, not just greek life. if clemson can't entertain you, there is sure to be something happening in charlotte, nc or atlanta, ga which are both a short two hour drive from clemson.}",

If you feel that this University is for you, you will have that special moment where your heart tells you that Clemson University is the school for you. Tips for prospective students Dear Prospective Students, Do you best at your college or university that you may be attending because any school means hard work. The degree you are trying to obtain will not be given to you, but instead you have to earn it. Attending college is the start of your new life; so use your advantages the best you may know how and make something of yourself. The world needs intelligent young women to continue making it a better place. Always strive for success and never give up. Am enjoying being here Clemson University is a great college with much to offer. The campus is beautiful and spacious, the faculty, staff, and students are nice and regardless the situation you will feel at home.
