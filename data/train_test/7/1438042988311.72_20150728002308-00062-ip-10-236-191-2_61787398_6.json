I expect meconopsis to take up to a year to germinate (or so the sites I have gone to say) but regular old perennials and annuals. I am NOT that patient. However, never being willing to cry 'uncle' I will faithfully sow my little heart out (am saving gallon milk jugs as fast as possible.) I still have problems with the dividing up. I think I will try what the greenhouses do when they sow in flats. Do straight rows (as much as you can do in a milk jug). that would make separating them in the spring easier. On the other hand, if I only get a couple to germinate, then no problem separating.

I wish the WS experts would chime in, but until then, here's my 2 cents. It depends on the species",
