    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6383=There are multiple sources of noise that can affect the amplified signal that is input into analog to digital converter 160 shown in FIGS. 4, 7 and 8A-F. For example, as described above, mains hum and DC wander noise can effect the signal. In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 4, 7 and 8A-F, this noise is removed using filter 150. In an alternate embodiment, rather than using a hardware solution like filter 150 to remove the 50/60 Hz mains hum and/or DC wander noise from the voltage potential difference signal received from electrodes 105, some or all of this noise can be filtered out of the signal, after being digitized by analog to digital converter 160, using known software techniques implemented in software residing either on CPU 165 forming a part of a body monitoring device or on a separate computer that receives the digitized signal. In this embodiment, filter 150 would be eliminated and only a single amplifier having a gain on the order of 500 to 2500 such as first stage amplifier 115 would be used in circuit 100 or 200. A two stage amplifier may also be utilized, having first stage gain of 50-500and a second stage gain of 10-50. These steps (in either the hardware or software implementations), in effect remove components of the signal having frequencies that are considered to be too high or too low to constitute a heart related signal, with a typical ECG signal having a frequency in the range of 0.5-4 Hz.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{227150=For example, a set of N ECG wave forms may be selected. The average distance between beats is identified and a time period \ufffd of the interbeat period before and \ufffd of the interbeat period after to truncate each waveform. It is specifically noted that other clipping distances are possible and could be variable. As with the descriptions of beat matching above, a graphic description of the process is the most illuminating. N signal wave forms are detected in the clipping mode and are modeled, as with the ADD graphs above, with the signal features being measured by the intensity or brightness. The signal is assigned an intensity or numerical value. The surrounding area has no value. The equator line of each wave form is identified, being that horizontal line such that the areas above and below this line are equal. A meridian line is identified for each wave peak as that vertical line that subdivides the QRS spike into two pieces, split at the peak value of the signal. All N images are overlapped such that all equators are coincident and all meridians are coincident. All intensity or numerical values for each point in the N signals are normalized such that all values are between two known boundary values, such as 0 and 1000. The result is a representation that captures the average heart beat morphology for that person over that period of time including, within the non-coincident areas, signal segments where the wave forms tend to be most coincident, having the highest values and the least coincident, having the lowest values. In addition, each of the N images could be scaled prior to overlap, wherein the height of the R point of each wave forms a constant. Additionally, accuracy may be increased by selecting X segments of X wave forms in row and performing the above analysis with the sequence of X wave forms instead of just with one., 119014=A monitor device and associated methodology are disclosed which provide a self contained, relatively small and wearable package for the monitoring of heart related parameters, including ECG. The monitor device is primarily a simple, unobtrusive housing which is wearable in the sense that it is temporarily affixed to the user's body, but also wearable in the sense described in Stivoric, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,711, issued Mar. 4, 2003, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference hereto. Stivoric teaches that the sizing, flexibility and location of items attached to the body significantly affect the ability of the wearer to recognize the item as part of the body, reducing the irritation factor associated with wearing such an item for extended periods of time. Furthermore, the use of the appropriate shapes, materials and locations reduces the interference of the item with normal body movement and activity. Each of these factors increases the wearability of the item and therefore increases the compliance of the wearer with the need for long term and continuous wear., 115948=Another significant shortcoming of ambulatory devices is electrical noise. Noise is detected from both ambient sources surrounding the body, movement and organ noise within the body, and most significantly, the movement of the body itself, including muscle artifacts, motion artifacts, skin stretching and motion between the electrode and the skin. A variety of patents and other references relate to the filtering of noise in many systems, including heart rate detection. In Zahorian, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,524,631, issued Jun. 11, 1996, a system is disclosed for detecting fetal heart rates. A significant noise problem exists in that environment, including the heart action of the mother, as well as the significant noise and distortion caused by the fetus'location within a liquid sac inside the mother's abdomen. Zahorian utilizes multiple parallel non linear filtering to eliminate such noise and distortion in order to reveal the fetus' heart rate. The system, like many of the prior art, is unconcerned with the wearability of the monitoring device or the ability to continuously monitor the subject over a long period of time., 120138=More specifically, the monitor device may be of a type described in Teller, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,605,038, issued Aug. 12, 2003, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference. The primary focus of the monitor device itself is to provide the functionality described below in a housing or other package which is comfortable for long term wear, remains in place during normal daily activity so as to continuously provide a quality signal or data record and also reduces the noise or other interference to that signal or record created by the device itself. One focus of the device is to provide a self-contained housing which incorporates all or at least the majority of the operating hardware. The monitor device, in addition to the Teller device, may further include, as an accessory or rigid housing substitute, a large sized adhesive strip, similar to that used for cuts and abrasions which contains the sensor package within the current location of the absorbent material. Reduction of weight and bulk is very important to increasing the ability for the device to remain affixed in both the right location and with proper contact to the body, especially under rigorous conditions, such as exercise. The device is easy to put on and take off without need for extensive or clinical skin preparation, if any. The device is provided with an appropriate type and strength of adhesive required to keep the weight of the device from disconnecting any snaps or other connections, or pulling the electrode off of the skin. One primary advantage of the device is the elimination of long lead wires which, in addition to being unsightly and inconvenient, act as large antennas for creating noise input to the system. Reduction in the amount of snap connections also reduces these noises, which are common for Holter and loop devices. While not necessarily possible with the current state of processor and sensor size, it is clearly contemplated that the instant system, given the appropriate miniaturization of hardware, could be as simple as sliding on a watch or pair of glasses, utilizing the same basic methodology and equipment identified herein., 177516=In one embodiment, filter 150 includes switched capacitor low-pass and high-pass filters with adjustable cutoff frequencies to allow for experimentation. Such a filter 150 may be constructed using the model LTC1164\u20146 low-pass filter chip sold by Linear Technology Corporation followed by a model LTC1164 high-pass filter chip also sold by Linear Technology Corporation, which chips provide an eighth order elliptical filter with very sharp cutoff characteristics. Experimentation with this implementation has shown that a low-pass cutoff frequency of 30 Hz and a high-pass cutoff frequency of between 0.1 Hz and 3 Hz worked well. Although allowing for flexibility, this implementation is relatively expensive and was found to consume a significant amount of power., 114100=Matsumara, U.S. Pat. No. 5,050,612, issued Sep. 24, 1991, discloses the use of a multi-electrode sensing watch device, identified as the HeartWatch, manufactured by Computer Instruments Corporation, Hampstead, N.Y., for certain types of heart parameter detection. While Matsumara discloses that the conventional use of the HeartWatch device is in conjunction with a chest strap, he also identifies an alternative use which relies solely on the multisensor watch device itself. The device has two electrodes at different distances along the arm from the heart, and the detected waveform from one electrode is subtracted from the other to obtain a resultant signal. Matsumura identifies this signal as not resembling an ECG, but states that it is useful for detecting ST segment depression. No teaching or suggestion of the efficacy of this method for the identification of heart rate or other heart related parameters is made., 97637=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/502,764, filed Sep. 12, 2003; U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/510,013, filed Oct. 9, 2003; and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/555,280, filed Mar. 22, 2004.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Although particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in the accompanying drawings and described in the foregoing detailed description, it is to be further understood that the present invention is not to be limited to just the embodiments disclosed, but that they are capable of numerous rearrangements, modifications and substitutions, as identified in the following claims. The ECG wave form collected from inside any of the equivalence class regions will not necessarily have the shape of a standard ECG wave form. When this is the case, a mapping can be created between a ECG wave form taken within a single equivalence class region and ECG wave forms taken between equivalence class regions. This can be done using the algorithm development process described above, creating a function that warps the within equivalence class region to be clearer when displayed as a standard ECG wave form. . This may be utilized in conjunction with a permanent, or durable housing 305 which contains the remaining aspects of the device's functionality. Additionally, the entire device could be rendered in a disposable format, which anticipates a limited continuous wearing time for each system. In this embodiment, as mentioned previously, the entire device might be rendered in a patch-like flexible housing, polymer, film, textile or other support envelope, all of which could be spring-like and which may be mounted anywhere on the body. This includes a textile",
