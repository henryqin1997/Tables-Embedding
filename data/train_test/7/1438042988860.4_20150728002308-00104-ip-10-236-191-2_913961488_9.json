            "Overall, the campus is safe. There are security guards that sit in the freshman and sophomore housing at the front desk and make sure only students enter the building. Emergency buttons are located throughout the campus. It's not recommended to walk alone at night outside campus grounds; if this is needed there you can call a walking escort to accompany you while walking.",
            "Greek life is not a big thing at our school. However, many people do join sororities or fraternities because it's a good way to meet new people and feel involved. There are many Greek life events and social gatherings which can be fun.",
            "There are many different clubs and activities that are offered at Saint Joes. Being involved in any club or activity is preferred if you want to feel involved in the community.",
            "Students who like... *small class sizes *stone buildings *urban setting *student-teacher relationships *mid-size campus",
            "They say don't walk on the Saint Joseph's Seal before graduation or else it's bad luck. This is located in the foyer of Mandeville, the business school.",
            "Although Saint Joes is expensive, it provides an outstanding academic curriculum with intelligent professors who are always willing to help. Saint Joes offers shuttle services to the east and west sides of city avenue. The west side is where most of the off-campus housing is located. The east side is where most of the stores, restaurants, and supermarkets are located as well as some off-campus housing. Also, there are escorts running 24/7 for your convenience.",
            "There are always events being held through the school, especially through the Student Union Board. There are so many to choose from and the nice thing is that most of them are absolutely free! Some examples are trips to the King of Prussia Mall, movie nights, comedians, etc.",
            "There is a cafeteria, which is buffet style, with a new addition of gluten-free foods. They usually provide different themes during the month. Along with the cafeteria, there is a declining balance side, which consists of 3 different food places with a variety of hot foods. There is also a small food/convenience store for students who don't have a car or are looking for something quick. Across from Saint Joes, right next to the bookstore, there is Larry's cheese steaks and Cosi which accept declining balance money through the school.",
            "As a freshman you have the option to live in a dorm-style, suite-style, or house setting. There is currently a new freshman dorm, said to be one of the biggest in the country, being built for the upcoming academic year. As a sophomore, you live off campus and Saint Joes provides you with housing options. As a Junior and Senior, you have the option to live in Saint Joes housing or find another place on your own. Many students choose to find places on their own because it's cheaper.",
            "The academic curriculum is challenging, but not impossible. It depends on your major. Saint Joes is known for their business school as well as their food marketing program. Saint Joes provides many opportunities for jobs after graduation because of its academic reputation.",
            "This school is perfect for students who don't want to go to a huge state school or a tiny school; this school is a mid-size school with over 5,000 students enrolled. Also, Saint Joes is recommended for students who prefer the student-teacher relationship. The class sizes are relatively small and it's easy to get help. Your professor will know you by your name compared to being known as a number at big schools. To walk from one end of campus to the other is not far; it takes about 20 minutes, at the most. Additionally, many of the buildings are castle-like made of stone.",
            "Saint Joseph's University is a quaint school with a beautiful campus. This school is a perfect mid-size school with a well-known academic curriculum. Saint Joes excels academically and athletically."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The professors on campus are very knowledgeable in their subject matter. They are very helpful and want to assist students as much as they can, even if it does not pertain to the class's subject matter but life in general. Professor make class interesting by integrating hands-on activities and the use of technology to better their lectures. Also, the books they choose for the class are often excellent and up-to-date; although like many schools...expensive. The core major/minor classes are well taught and thorough...and the GER classes are not a waste of time. Attending St. Joe's will earn you a well-rounded education!
