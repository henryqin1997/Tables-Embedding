And like the other two, this mill had a smooth powerband and it was easy to get into the upper rpm. Aside from that, I have to really give credit where credit\u2019s due and praise the transmission. This gem shifted like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before. Stacy\u2019s transmission of choice is a Rockland-modified Tremec and it practically shifts by itself. There\u2019s no second-guessing during shifts and I don\u2019t think I ever want to drive another car without a similar setup. Yes, it was that impressive. Although many of the other cars\u2014including other DSE cars\u2014also had great balance, this car felt the best to me. It was a very friendly dancing partner in the slaloms and was more confidence-inspiring than the others due to its very linear and not-over-the-top power. That, coupled with great gearing, made this car a joy to drive, except for one thing: The brake balance on this car was inconsistent throughout the day. At one point, something had developed that was problematic and caused it to act erratic during some sessions. The brake balance problem required me",
