In 2007, Kuwait supplied more than 2.6 million barrels of oil per day to the world market, making the relatively small country a central player in the petroleum industry. Kuwait contains proven oil reserves of roughly 102 billion barrels and proven natural gas reserves of 63 Tcf. The Supreme Petroleum Council dictates Kuwait's oil policies, while the Kuwait Petroleum Council manages both domestic and foreign investments in the oil sector.}",
