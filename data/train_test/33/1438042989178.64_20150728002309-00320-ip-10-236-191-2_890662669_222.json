            "Make sure to register for classes early because students definitely start registering before the semester begins. Make sure to know where your classes are before class starts that way you know the exact location of your building. Ask questions. Make sure that you keep in touch with your advisor that way you know if you are on the right track for graduation.",
            "This university is so diverse that I really enjoy the immerse group of students at this campus. The university has phenomenal school spirit that I am so happy to be a part of this university. This school has the best faculty and staff who are always there to assist you."

This along with federal aid will really diminish the need for loans!, 529412=Humans versus Zombies is a staple of the campus in October for Halloween. It's a week long, campus-wide, game of tag essentially. It happens once every semester and is one of the most fun events I've ever participated in/watched!, 750471=There's a really cool sundial type thing with a meteorite in the middle of it, and on the summer solstice at 1:12 pm the circle above casts a shadow perfectly onto the circle in the center., 1116083=Food in the Argos, Andros, and Juniper/Poplar areas have ok food. Their food changes all the time but has sections that are always constant like sandwiches and pizza. The Marshall student center has a subway, panda express, chick-fil-a, and an organic section. After spring break of 2013 a pollo tropical is going to be on campus., 532688=The classes are consistent with whatever level you sign up for (1000 to 4000). Even if the course material is difficult, the professors are VERY accessible, as well as are the free tutor services and learning centers., 579975=The bathrooms are all cleaned regularly, the Juniper-Poplar Hall was just built in 2009, and there are always constant get togethers and fun activities on each floor., 176636=Apply early and be persistent. USF has not traditionally turned applicants away but this has changed over the past few years. Not everyone gets accepted anymore. Entrance requirements like GPA and SAT are really important so take the time to earn a high GPA and study for the SAT. Also, the university offers millions of dollars in scholarships to new students but you have to apply for them several months before the school year starts. Start looking into scholarships as early as October of the year before because their deadlines are often in the spring and long before the school year begins. Make some friends who are already at the university since they can give you specific tips on who to go to if you have an issue during the application process. It's easy to get lost in a big state university system so be diligent and take everything seriously. You'll have plenty of fun once you're accepted.}",

Oh yea, study hard and make your classes top priority. Enjoy this time in your life. You get back as much as you put in. Bang for the buck Tuition is going up, and USF recognizes that. The fees included in tuition do not begin to cover what you can receive from this school. There are SO many free things around campus. If you pay attention, you can usually find free food\u2026daily. There are so many activities and events that are free to you just for being a proud BULL! Things such as awesome concerts, shows, and lectures (08-09 we were blessed with performances by Flo-rida, Lady Antebellum, Mike Epps, Christian Finnegan, and BILLY NYE\u2026yes...the science guy!). Money cannot buy the friends and family you make here or the awesome experiences you will encounter. Am enjoying being here OF COURSE I ENJOY BEING HERE! Since orientation before my freshman year, I have felt at home. Everyone I have encountered in this university is enthusiastic and school spirited, while being academically focused and ambitious. In my opinion, the best part of this school is the tradition. Sure, schools such as UF and FSU have",
