For example, if the line of indicia of pattern 14 intersected the line of indicia of pattern 10 rather than superimposed parallel, then the crescents will appear asymmetrical. Such asymmetry is an indication of angular misalignment of the two patterns rather than linear misalignment as represented by FIGS. 2-4. The use of circular indicia is advantageous because the resulting crescents provide a readily observable indication of the location and magnitude of closely misaligned indicia when there is no exact indicia alignment. The back-to-back facing of adjacent crescents is an immediate reference identification as to the location of the misalignment value as indicated by indicia 30. It is also preferable that the indicia of patterns 10 and 14 be of the same diameter circles to provide an immediate observation of misalignment by the appearance of a crescent in the misaligned indicia. In FIG. 2, if the patterns 10 and 14 were misaligned so that none of the indicia were aligned exactly, then symmetrical crescents, such as crescents 40 of the same or different areas, would appear in next adjacent indicia rather than spaced from each other with an intervening aligned indicia, as shown. The value of measurement of the misalignment can be visually made by interpolating the difference in area of the",
