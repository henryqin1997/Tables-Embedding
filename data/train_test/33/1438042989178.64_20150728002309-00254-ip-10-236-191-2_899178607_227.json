The school has even gotten recognized by President Obama in 2011 at a graduation ceremony. I found that to be very remarkable!, 207934=Miami Dade College has helped me a lot and I have only attended for one semester. I have learned and improved immensely in mathematics. I first scored into a remedial math class and Im currently about to start MAT1033. Their math lab is the best, the people there are always willing to go the extra mile to help you succeed., 969027=Miami Dade has it's usual clubs, SGA and cultural clubs, etc. In addition to those, in Spring 2012 Homestead Campus added a Journalism Club to the list. The Journalism Club writes articles for the local South Dade News Leader and is very interested in getting it's members published. It's a great club., 199780=Ok, college isn't cheap. People thinkn that Dade is cheap; however, it is reasonable for 4 classes at about 1200 (not books included). Sure other schools are charging a fortune for a class, but it is enough to at least get started and save up for other terms and transfering schools., 1081007=I have been a student with Miami Dade College since 1997. It has been a rough road but they haven't given up on me and I them. To say this unbiased they are a 8 out of 10.}",

Well then, Miami Dade is just the place for you! It's also great for anyone currently working a full-time job. And also, for anyone that is continuing there education after a long hiatus. If you have school spirit and are interested in participating in school events then this is NOT the school for you. Tips for prospective students Apply for the honors college! I wish I would have known it existed before hand. The students in the honors program receive full tuition including books. They get extreme VIP treatment. It is obviously more enduring than the regular classes, but so much more worth it. If you're not honors college material then just sit back & relax because this school is just a two-year extension of high school. Did enjoy being here",
