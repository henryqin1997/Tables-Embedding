No. 08/642,121, filed May 2, 1996, entitled \"An Electrosurgical Generator And System,\" which is incorporated herein by reference. In a preferred embodiment, the control unit 14 includes a generator having a radio frequency (RF) power oscillator with an electrical connection, such as a pair of output connection ports 64, for coupling, via one or more cables 34, to the catheter 12 and electrode assembly 20. When RF power is applied to the electrode assembly 20, the conductive fluid 42 heats up. If the conductive fluid 42 is a saline solution such as 0.9% w/v, the temperature coefficient of the fluid 42 is positive, so that the corresponding impedance coefficient is negative. As power is applied, the impedance between the active electrode 24 and return electrode 26 initially falls and continues to fall with increasing dissipation of power., 45152=Once the vapor pocket completely envelopes the active electrode 24, the impedance rapidly increases to around 1000 ohms, with the actual impedance value dependent upon system variables. Power passes from the active electrode 24 to the conductive fluid 42 via electrical discharges across the vapor pocket. The majority of the power dissipation occurs within this pocket, with consequent heating of the active electrode 24. The amount of energy dissipated, and the size of the vapor pocket, depends on the output voltage. Maintaining the vapor pocket without destroying the active electrode requires a delicate balance of output voltage. If it is too low, the pocket will not be sustained. If it is too high, the electrode assembly 20 can be destroyed. Accordingly, once the impedance has reached a certain point indicating formation of the vapor pocket, the power must be reduced to a selected level.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although preferred and alternative embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated, the invention is susceptible to modifications and adaptations within the ability of those skilled in the art and without the exercise of inventive faculty. Thus, it should be understood that various changes in form, detail, and usage of the present invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited, except as by the appended claims. Note that the invention shown and described herein would also operate if the polarities were reversed, so that the active electrodes became return electrodes, and the (formerly) return electrodes became active electrodes. The nozzle may be particularly useful in combination with the moveable catheter shown in FIG. 9c. A user could thus maneuver the nozzle and electrode assembly adjacent to selected tissue, and concentrate a flow of hot fluid to that selected tissue. The nozzle 132 may employ various jet-related propulsion techniques, such as ramjet theory. The nozzle 132 may be a venturi nozzle or similar device, serving to concentrate and direct the flow of fluid induced by the electrode assembly 20. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 12, the nozzle 132 is a venturi nozzle having a narrow throat 134, and the electrode assembly 20 is placed within the throat 134 of the nozzle. A diffuser 136 may be positioned downstream of",
