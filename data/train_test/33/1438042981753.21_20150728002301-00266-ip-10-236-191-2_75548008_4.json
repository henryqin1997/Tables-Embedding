    "textBeforeTable": "Table: FXS Idle Voltage Table: FXS Idle Voltage shows idle line voltages supplied by various Cisco gateway FXS interfaces. Idle Line Voltages Cisco voice gateways were designed for ONS connections and by default the FXS interface supplies either -24 Vdc or -36 Vdc idle battery, whereas off premise services, such as a CO, would require voltages of -48 V because it might have to interconnect over much greater cable lengths. Certain Cisco FXS interfaces can be configured to supply higher voltages. Idle Battery Voltage The industry standard for PBX and key systems requires that the ring detection circuit be able to detect a ringing signal as low as 40 Vrms. This voltage takes into account the effects of load and cabling voltage drop on a ringing signal generated from a central office (CO). Conversely, the CO (exchange) must supply ringing with enough power to drive the maximum load over the maximum cable length. In order to meet this requirement, a CO-based unit must present a ringing signal with an amplitude of approximately 85 to 100 Vrms. Cisco voice gateways are intended for use as on premise services (ONS) equipment that is colocated or fairly close to equipment that detects ringing, so it can therefore use a lower ringing voltage and still meet the 40 Vrms 5 Ringer Equivalence Number (REN) requirement.",
    "textAfterTable": "Ring Voltage Problems Voltage problems can cause three types of problems: Answering and Call Initiation Problems with Automated Telephony Devices Ringing Problems FXS Ring Failure in the United Kingdom Certain automated devices, such as fax machines, answer machines, multiline phones and voice mail systems, look at the line voltage in order to deduce if the line is busy or idle. If another device is off hook, then the line voltage drops, and the automated system does not answer or initiate a call. If the threshold being used is close to -24 V or higher, this can cause the device not to work as expected. Certain phones might not ring when the default ring voltage and ring frequency are applied from the Cisco FXS interface. For situations where the line voltage is not high enough, a ring booster can be installed between the interface card and the network. Answering and Call Initiation Problems with Automated Telephony Devices In voice port configuration mode, configure the idle-voltage command on the voice port of the FXS to increase idle battery voltage from -24 V to -48 V. The idle-voltage low setting designates -24 V and the idle-voltage high setting designates -48",
