The next day I\u2019ll put a vote for one week (if there will be any competitors that is\u2026). More info could be found at the first LGN Theme Contest post, 139666=Leszek Sta?czyk writes : \u201cWupra (read voopra) is Linux Game store located in Poland and our main customers are from Poland. My store is on-line since 21 August 2009. Linux games are twice expensive for Poles than for British, German or French customers. I\u2019d like change it a little so I offer many games for Linux with the lower price as it\u2019s possible (of course mainly for customers from Poland). Price is very important so I don\u2019t sell games which are overpriced more than it\u2019s rational. I\u2019d like add some cheap games with English language version (final price maybe lower)., 151335=All competitors must send me an email by 30/06/2010. At the next day the 01/07/2010 I will make a poll on the website so you can vote for the winner which will be up for one week. After that I will post the results., 141702=3. Some \u201cPolish\u201d marked games on your website like \u201cUnreal Anthology\u201d and \u201cPrey\u201d says \u201cEnglish\u201d if you look at their data sheet. So are they in Polish or English ? They are in English but UT2004 have only polish subtitles, English was ripped of by CD-Project. I applied a patch for UT2004 but there are only partial English files. When I say Polish that mean Polish cover, manual and Polish language if game have English language game data I added this information to \u201cData Sheet\u201d. I can\u2019t add English subtitles without permission from Epic Games., 142311=So if the data is in English, does it mean the whole game (not cover and manual) is in English ? Correctly, only UT2004 text/subtitles are incomplete for other language than Polish, but the voices and the menus are in English. I can ask Polish distributor for access and permission for add full English (or other) subtitles or Ryan help (he helped me with Postal X, I got permission from RWS to use Linux binary of Postal, Postal 2). I added information about ripped of English version. Also it is possible to order the Full English version with manual and cover but at least 30 requests are needed.}",

This is a bug change as the last two pages were always visible and updated every few months, while the others were \u201cregular\u201d news articles. Here is the graph with more detail (and numbers) : The basic graph shows the visits over 13 months, as you see we had good months and bad months (after the company I worked for got bankrupted and I got fired, I wasn\u2019t in the mood to post much so the visitors came much less, but I\u2019ve found a new job now).
