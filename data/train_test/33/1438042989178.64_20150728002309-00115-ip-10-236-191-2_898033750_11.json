            "Just one word...NOMS!! Food is awesome, bar none.",
            "Excellent. The freshman dorms, aka, the Williams dorms, are awesome. They are larger (or so i'm told) then the other types of dorms on the campus. The only bad thing about that is the walk to the classes, But a bike or car can cure that problem!",
            "Not that hard, but It is a challenge. For a new freshman like me, it is something new for me to experience...but it's a good one to have.",
            "Understand your schedule and get to class on time. Talk to the Student life, Financial aid, and your teachers for aid, they are there to help you. If you want a christian based school, come here!",
            "It is an excellent school. They have pleasant teachers, kind students, and wonderful food. I don't want to leave in two years, but I know I will have to."

Those are our top majors. If you are an education major you are promiced a job teaching when you graduate because they have a 100% placement rate. The education program and the social work programs are phenominal. Tips for prospective students Apply and get to know your admissions counselor because they are so helpful. Your scholarship award amount it sent to you with your acceptance letter, but that is just the base number. If you are considering Warner you should take a tour as well, and talk to some professors of your major. That really helped me make my decision. Bang for the buck For a private, Christian school, Warner is really reasonably priced. The also give out great academic and athletic scholarships. They work really hard to give every student a scholarship, and",
