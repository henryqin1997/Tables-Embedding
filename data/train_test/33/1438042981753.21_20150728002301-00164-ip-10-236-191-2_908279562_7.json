You can live there for the summer if you wanted to and you can renew your lease. The rent as of right now (October 2012) is $385 with a $200 deposit when you first move in. Its not really a dorm if you think about it. Its more of an Apt complex. Your dorm is shared between 4 people. You get your own room that is 10x9. There are 2 bathrooms. 2 in each. The kitchen is fully functional. Its comes with a refrigerator, microwave, oven, and a dishwasher. The freezer is a little small. So you will have figure out spacing details with your roommates. The walls are a bit thin so if your neighbors are making really lowed noises you may here them. But otherwise not a bad place to live. The people working in the office are friendly and always willing to help., 98071=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Bang for the buck Hawkeye Community College is worth the money. I honestly thought that I would be in over my head when I wanted to attend college. I thought that I would be spending so much money that I felt I would never be out of debt after I graduate. Once I started looking into Hawkeye, I realized that not only is Hawkeye a great school with staff ready to help with all of your problems, but it is also very affordable. You spend about as much for your whole degree here that you would spend in one semester at most four year colleges. I believe that Hawkeye Community College is worth your money no matter if you are going to live in the apartments, or off campus. You will be satisfied with how much less you will be in debt after you graduate and also will be wowed at how inexpensive Hawkeye really is. Am enjoying being here I enjoy being at Hawkeye Community College because I love the fact that the teachers will always be willing to help you, no matter what the circumstances. Also, there are many different student activities to attend, making it easier to meet new people, or just have some fun in between your classes. There is such an enjoyable energy",
