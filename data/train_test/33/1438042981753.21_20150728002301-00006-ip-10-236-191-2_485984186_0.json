So, in 2010 when the sales representative arrives at the farm gate, he is likely to be greeted with, \u201cI see you had a good day. Your top bull looks great. I\u2019ll take 10 units.\u201d While the sale was made, the discussion was anti-climactic. The representative did not get to share the data, the daughter photos, or the \u201cinside scoop\u201d about the merits of the cow family. The end result was achieved but was not nearly as fun for either party I would assume., 8898=It is December 7 and sire summary information has been released. It used to be a really exciting time when there were only two sire summaries per year, as the momentum would build in January and July. In my youth, several A.I. representatives were in the yard with their new information and full of enthusiasm soon after the information became official. Then proofs went to quarterly releases, and in 2010 there were four sire summaries plus several genomic releases, and even less hype resulted. With more releases, the less they seem to matter. However, in 2011, we will see traditional sire summaries only three times \u2013 April, August, and December.}",
