This steel has an extremely high resistance to staining and rust. Trulock Chokes are heat-treated to a high strength level (200,000 PSI) in order to resist wear. We craft all of our chokes on CNC lathes from solid bar stock. Welded tubing is never used. All extended chokes are knurled for easy installation and removal (no wrench needed). Of course, all Trulock Chokes carry a Lifetime Warranty. MPN: \u00a0TIBER12 Trulock Ti (Titanium) 12 Gauge Choke Tubes",
