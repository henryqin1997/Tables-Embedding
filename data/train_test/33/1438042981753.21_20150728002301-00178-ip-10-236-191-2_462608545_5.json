    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25617=In FIG. 2, is shown the use of the inventive process for ion plating. Equivalent parts of the apparatus in FIG. 2 are numbered with the same reference numerals as the corresponding parts in FIG. 1. For ion plating, the workpiece 5 is cathodic relative to an anodic evaporation source 11 of coating material. A glow discharge plasma 12 is formed between an anode 10 and the workpiece 5 by voltages generated by the pulse power supply 9. The distance between the vapor source or evaporation source 11 and the workpiece 5 is between about 20 to 5.0 cm. The workpiece 5 has a negative potential of between 100 to 1000 volts relative to the vapor source 11. The current density within the vacuum chamber 1 is approximately 0.5 mA/cm2 at a low gas pressure which may be below 100 Pa. The ions in the plasma 12 are scattered so that even complicated geometries of the workpiece 5 are coated uniformly., 32397=An ideal pulse contour for the power input is a square, as shown in FIG. 5. This means that the power increase and decreases should be as fast as possible, for example faster than one microsecond. The pulse duration is usually less than 100 microseconds. The pause duration after each pulse is usually within the range of 100-1000 microseconds. With these values, the risk of an arc formation is very low, yet the glow ignition after each pulse is guaranteed.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although other modifications and changes may be suggested by those skilled in the art, it is the intention of the inventor to embody within the patent warranted hereon all changes and modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of his contribution to the art. The auxiliary heating 35 mentioned above can be positioned on the inside or on the outside of the vacuum vessel in alternate embodiments. Therefore, the coating treatment with the inventive process leads to much lower waste and the working expenses are lower. The coating rate is higher and the uniformity of the coating over the whole work load is better because the strain induced by sputtering is lower. Referring to FIG. 6A, a partial schemmatic of two work chambers with a work load is shown. To the left side is a cooled wall chamber 30 with cooling elements on the outside surface, while on the right side is a hot wall 31 from a chamber 1 of the present invention provided with insulation. Different individual workpieces 32 to be coated are positioned on a support 5 within the two chambers chamber. The hot wall 31 of the illustrated embodiment has the heating means 35 internal of the wall. As can be seen in FIG. 6B, different temperature profiles are formed which differ depending on the type of chamber walls provided. In FIG. 6B, the graph of the temperature profile in",
