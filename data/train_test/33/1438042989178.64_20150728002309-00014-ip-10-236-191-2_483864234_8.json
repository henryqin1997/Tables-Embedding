Variations in the physical architecture and dimensions of the invention will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art based upon the disclosure herein, and such variations are considered to be within the scope of the invention in which patent rights are asserted, as set forth in the claims appended hereto. All publications and references cited herein are expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. An optional cylindrical member 126 is embedded in the barrier region 108 to provide a backing plate for the balloon 124 and increase structural stability for the tip region 100 and barrier region 108 junction. The cylindrical member 126 does not extend into the first and second chambers 112, 114, but, rather, terminates at a wall 128 of the barrier region 108. As compared with the embodiment of FIG. 2, the tip region 100 is increased in length due to the placement of the aperture 120 with respect to the pressure sensor element 110, but has a similar diameter. The cylindrical member 126 can be a tube and will not interfere with the mounting of the pressure sensor element 110 in the tube 122, as in FIG. 2. If the cylindrical member is not present, a portion of the barrier region 108 proximate the aperture",
