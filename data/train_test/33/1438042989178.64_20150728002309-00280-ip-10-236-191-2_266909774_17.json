ISP will also be assisting patrol Unofficial (source). Some activity on Starcom21 TG 13020 'D10 DETAIL A' was noted on 2/29/08 and probably related to Unofficial. For coordination between ISP and METCAD agencies, I'd expect it to be on 155.055 IREACH (at least one transmission was heard on IREACH that could have been related). A News-Gazette article reported that Illini EMS provided medical assistance. They use 451.450 (DCS 131) but it's unknown if there was any Unofficial radio traffic on there.
