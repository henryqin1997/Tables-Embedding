The free event, which begins at 5 p.m., will include kids\u2019 activities, a gourmet food truck expo, a holiday concert, and a Shabbat service. The event will be led by Temple Beth El\u2019s Rabbi Dan Levin, Rabbi Jessica Spitalnic Brockman, and Cantorial Soloist Lori Shapiro. \u201cChanukah Under the Stars is an opportunity for our congregation to share our love and passion for Jewish life, and the celebration of Chanukah, with the broader community of Boca Raton,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThe celebration of Chanukah highlights so many wonderful values and ideals: the notion of having faith in difficult times, the notion of perseverance to achieve your goals, the idea that you should never surrender what you believe in even when it\u2019s dark and difficult and dangerous. The theme of bringing life into dark places, especially at the darkest time of the year, is something that I think speaks to not just Jews, but everyone across the spectrum, which is why Chanukah is such a popular celebration for our people.\u201d Levin explained that this special event is used to invite the broader Jewish community of Boca Raton to celebrate the season. Proceeds raised from food and drink sales will benefit the Giving Tree of Temple Beth El and Ruth Rales Jewish Family Services. \u201cThere is a long standing tradition of giving what in Hebrew is called \u2018Tzedakah\u2019 in the celebration of the sabbath,\u201d Levin said. \u201cThere is a custom that during each Shabbat one should think about those who are less fortunate, and these two wonderful organizations do so much to make a difference in the lives of the needy in our community. A big part of the celebration of Chanuakah is bringing light into the dark times and places.\u201d Bring your family and friends to this holiday celebration. There will be bounce houses, a delicious casual Shabbat meal, face painting, crafts and more. There will also be a childrens' sing-a-long cocnert before the Shabbat service at 7:30 p.m.}",
