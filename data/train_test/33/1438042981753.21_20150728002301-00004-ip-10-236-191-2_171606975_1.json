    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{986=Is it safe to say Jason Marquis has officially put his disastrous 2010 behind him? The right-hander certainly has done everything in his power to reverse the trend so far this year, capped tonight by a brilliant, 3-0 shutout of the Giants and ace Tim Lincecum., 41819=Making a better point on Marquis numbers for his career, he is 71-50 in his career from April to July 31st. 28-42 for August 1st to the end of the season.With that type of winning percentage for April to July, he is an All Star but far from it with his career numbers which is why the Nats got him at $7.5 million a season., 20150=Masnstinks, 1) Marquis trade value depends on continued success and health; not just a good April and no under no circumstances do you extend him \u2013 that would be a Bowden move \u2013 buy high; sell low. 2) Why exactly do we 'really need that roster spot'?; do you really think Bernie gets us more wins at this stage? I for one really do think he's better of playing every day in Syracuse. 3) Best guess on Harper \u2013 Potomac on June 1st and Harrisburg for a month at the end of the year; start the season at Harrisburg next year; finish at Syracuse with a Sept. callup. Start 2013 in DC. 4) I would not let Zim back until he's 100% healthy; let's not turn a muscle strain into a muscle tear. The team is performing miraculously well considering we have at least 2 replacement level players in the lineup every day. Kudos to Riggleman., 29657=Back in 2007 Chris Marrero was at Hagerstown for 58 games before being promoted to Potomac. He hit .290 with 14 homers there. The minor league season is barely 20 games deep in a 140 game schedule. I would think the Nats are gonna wait at least another month before they promote Harper, if he stays halfway hot that is., 66406=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 16393=Marquis' trade value just went way up. And the value of Matt Stairs\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. we really need someone in that roster spot ( Bernie, the shark?),how long can the fo let this go without admitting they made a huge mistake? Nice to see some of the other \"veterans\" contributing. and \u2013 just how badly hurt is Zim,- will we see him by June 1st? when will Harper move to Potomac? Mark \u2013 the fans want to know!, 22490=re: Harper as a PNat on 6/1\u2026Assume continued performance akin to the last 10 games. PNats start a 14 game homestand on 6/6 that goes into their AS break. Thinking that should they bring him up in June, it would be during this homestand so that he can get settled in at one location, take a 3 day break, then hit the road with the PNats thereafter.(now too much coffee in belly), 8657=Two nights ago I ripped the Nats for the implosion against the Mets.I made a big deal on how you had to hold leads in the late innings on top of producing the key plays and runs at the key time.That is what we saw tonight, what a great game. Now the only way to beat Lincecum is to hope he isn't sharp in the early innings, pounce on him and hold on for dear life. That is what the Nats did and then Marquis showed us the stuff we had thought that we would get last year.The big question, looks like Marquis is the real deal now and I guess we have to thank National management for not giving up on him.Just wonder if it may be a good deal to talk now, in April about extending his contract past next year. He could possibly get some support from Marquis due to last year but I feel that if Marquis continues these kind of starts that he may be really expensive after this year.Just a thought on a great evening, today could be the best win of the year. Be interesting to see if this spurs the team on to better days., 35652=Cy Young Marquis has never been more than a .500 pitcher with an era hovering around 4.00, but if you combine his terrible stats from 2010 with this year, he'd have to naintain pretty good stats over this full year to reach that average over 2010 & 11 \u2014 stats like this year's 3-0 with a sub 3.00 era. Life tends to even out and so does Jason Marquis \u2014 he may just keep this pitching pace up for the rest of this year. Go for .500 tonight Nats!!, 54071=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern. You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 18286=Anon, last years disaster was based on an injury. He tried to gut it out. He couldn't do it because he was INJURED. If you haven't followed Marquis, this is what he is and what Rizzo bought last year. He is a winning pitcher before the All Star break. The year before the Nats got him he was the Rockies All Star. You all may remember July 6, 2009 when Marquis shut out the Nats 1-0. That brought his record to 11-5 after that game Marquis started his normal 2nd half slide and finished the season 4-8 to finish 15-13. In 2006 almost to the same day July 7 he won 8-2 for the Cardinals and took his record to 11-6 and finished the season 14-16.His history is undeniable. He helps his teams in the 1st half of the season and then gets a tired arm. Every team knows this so Anon at 8:14 and everyone else that thinks it, there is no great trade value for Rizzo unless he gives him some rest in June and July to conserve him for the 2nd half.The other note on Marquis is he typically went 7 to 8 innings in 2009 before the All Star break. I think you have to keep him under 90 pitches to keep him fresh and Riggleman has only kept him under 90 once so far this season. So do you ride Jason hard now and get what you get or ration him for a longer run?, 14473=It's great to see Marquis do well after last year's disaster. And because the better Marquis performs the better return the Nats will get when Rizzo traded Marquis in July. Capps for Ramos was a great move last year so hopefully Rizzo can get someone as good for Marquis. Marquis was never part of the long term plan and I would guess that Rizzo is already eyeing some MLB ready prospects on teams that might be contending for a trade., 24257=JD-Point 1 \u2013 Right onPoint 2 \u2013 I 100% disagree. You have 13 position players, 8 you play and 5 on the bench. The Nats have been play with a 4 on the bench essentially and that has hurt Riggleman and the team and while you can't say it has cost you a game, intangibly it could have.Point 3 \u2013 On Harper, take your own advice on your point #1. Depends on continued success and health. That is how his timeframe will be determined success and progress.Point 4 \u2013 Agreed. As sad as Zim's own health is, he has to be 100% when he comes back and solve this. Who would have thunk that the same type of injury he had at the end of 2010 has sidelined him much of 2011. SAD, 10304=Great game for Marquis and nice to see what he can for us when healthy. On the batting side of the equation, FP mentioned that Jason was at the park at 2:00 working on his hitting before the game. Guess it must have paid off (although he was already hitting the ball pretty well \u2013 see April 24 game in Pittsburgh). One idle thought that occurred to me last night: *somebody* wants another Silver Slugger., 30599=Anon8, when the Nats signed Marquis I had hoped they did their research. You nailed it! That is what Marquis is. Clear and consistent history and unfortunately most on here dont want to do any homework or research. The start in 2009 before he shutout the Nats he shutout the Dodgers.My quote for today is MARQUIS IS A 1ST HALF STUD AND A 2ND HALF DUD. With that said, way to go Jason, that was a gem and prove me wrong for August and September!, 13065=Golfersal: Probably too late for an extension. In this walk year, and assuming he continues on the same path, Team Marquis will definitely want to test the FA waters so as to allow the marketplace to determine his value. And from the club perspective, at this point, the Nats would be negotiating against themselves.Team Marquis (again, assuming the same level of performance) is now in position to go to a contender in June/July and get into the playoffs, then go the FA route. That's a pretty good scenario! Nats get value for Jason, and oh by the way, can reacquire him as a free agent. That's a win/win.Reiterating, and Mark emphasized this during his Beltway webcast interlude earlier this week*: it's a function of Marquis' continued fine performance.*non-compensated plug, 36732=Joe Seamhead, its a good question on the bone chips except you can go back even more years and see the same fall off but maybe the harsh falloff in 2009 was because of the bone chips.I just think if you don't push him hard in June he may last longer. Many pitchers suffer from arm fatigue in the latter parts of the season. You can hope that this year is going to be different, its just that I am a strong believer in the past results is your best indicator for future results. Marquis is only 32 years old and the one strong positive was the bone chip surgery was successful and could keep his arm in better shape to go the distance.I think Mark'd point is don't start thinking Marquis is going to be trade bait as teams will be skeptical.}",
