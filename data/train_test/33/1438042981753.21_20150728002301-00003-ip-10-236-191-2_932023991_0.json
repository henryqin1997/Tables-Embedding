Please note that some of the information in the bulletins is compiled from external, open source reports and is not a direct result of US-CERT analysis. Low - Vulnerabilities will be labeled Low severity if they have a CVSS base score of 0.0 - 3.9 Medium - Vulnerabilities will be labeled Medium severity if they have a CVSS base score of 4.0 - 6.9 High - Vulnerabilities will be labeled High severity if they have a CVSS base score of 7.0 - 10.0 The vulnerabilities are based on the CVE vulnerability naming standard and are organized according to severity, determined by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) standard. The division of high, medium, and low severities correspond to the following scores: The US-CERT Cyber Security Bulletin provides a summary of new vulnerabilities that have been recorded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Vulnerability Database (NVD) in the past week.
