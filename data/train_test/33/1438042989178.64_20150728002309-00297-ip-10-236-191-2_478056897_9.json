The electronic memory can hold a code which relates to the nature of the stock loaded in the cassette. The printing apparatus can read the code and adapt the behavior of the printing apparatus accordingly, such as by increasing the fuser temperature when a particularly heavy paper is loaded in the cassette.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets While the invention has been described with reference to the structure disclosed, it is not confined to the details set forth, but is intended to cover such modifications or changes as may come within the scope of the following claims. The usage of the web 126 can be measured in any manner familiar in the art, such as by associating a counter with a stepper motor or other mechanism (not shown) which moves web 126; or, alternately, the usage of web 126 can be inferred from a number of prints made by the apparatus since the last install of a fuser module 12. The CRUM 13 can also retain at a predetermined location therein a code symbolic of the length of web 126 provided at install of a particular module 12; in this way, alternate designs of fuser module 12 (such as a \"long-life\" web 126 of a particularly long length, or a low-cost module with a relatively short web 126) can be taken into account. Further, CRUM 13 can retain at a predetermined location therein a code symbolic of a desired web speed for web 126, which would be manifest in, for example, the frequency of signals sent to a stepper motor which moves web 126; in this way, a module 12 having a new design web 126, which may not require as fast a motion for effective cleaning as a previous design, can",
