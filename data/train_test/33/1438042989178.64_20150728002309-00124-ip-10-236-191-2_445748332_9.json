Timed pitching at 137kph during a trial in 2004, the talent spotter said he would contact the Dodgers and say he'd found an \"interesting kid\". Cricket coaches were also interested in him and he spent two off-seasons at the Academy. Since then his cricket career has been more regular pitch than vicious curve ball, and after an unproductive two-year stint at Tasmania, he returned home to South Australia for 2009-10, where he first appeared on the domestic scene four years earlier. He played three Shield matches last summer, picking up four wickets, and a one-dayer., 31537=Leaving his native South Australia after only two limited-overs games, Duval appeared in Tasmania's 2nd XI in 2005-06, but also suffered a knee tendon injury. The following season he earned his first one-day cap for the Tigers against his old state and claimed 1 for 54 after making a handy 32. His first-class debut came in 2007-08 but in four appearances he was unable to claim more than one wicket in an innings. After collecting nine victims from three first-class matches in 2008-09 he had itchy feet again, and accepted an offer to return to Adelaide Oval, where the Redbacks were rebuilding their bowling stocks.
