Ask someone to name a prominent computer scientist and you are more likely to hear the name Bill Gates than Alan Turing. In fact, computing is both a science and an industry, each stimulating the other. Everyone knows that logic and computing have something to do with each other, but few understand the remarkable correspondence that links them. A model of logic and a model of computing, each published at the dawn of the computer era, turned out, half a century later, to coincide exactly. We will follow this correspondence through three strands of work, connecting three varieties of logic, three researchers at Edinburgh's Laboratory for the Foundations of Computer Science, and three applications to web technology. 11.00 \u2013 11.30 Coffee 11.30 \u2013 12.30 Call-by-value is dual to call-by-name The rules of classical logic may be formulated in pairs corresponding to De Morgan duals: rules about \"and\" are dual to rules about \"or\". A line of work, including that of Filinski (1989), Griffin (1990), Parigot (1992), Danos, Joinet, and Schellinx (1995), Selinger (1998,2001), and Curien and Herbelin (2000), has led to the startling conclusion that call-by-value is the de Morgan dual of call-by-name. This lecture presents a dual calculus that corresponds to the classical sequent calculus of Gentzen (1935) in the same way that the lambda calculus of Church (1932,1940) corresponds to the intuitionistic natural deduction of Gentzen (1935). It includes crisp formulations of call-by-value and call-by-name that are obviously dual; no similar formulations appear in the literature. The paper gives a CPS translation and its inverse, and shows that the translation is both sound and complete, strengthening a result in Curien and Herbelin (2000). 14.15 \u2013 15.15 The Girard-Reynolds isomorphism (second edition) Jean-Yves Girard and John Reynolds independently discovered the second-order polymorphic lambda calculus, F2. Girard additionally proved a Representation Theorem: every function on natural numbers that can be proved total in second-order intuitionistic predicate logic, P2, can be represented in F2. Reynolds additionally proved an Abstraction Theorem: every term in F2 satisfies a suitable notion of logical relation; and formulated a notion of parametricity satisfied by well-behaved models. We observe that the essence of Girard's result is a projection from P2 into F2, and that the essence of Reynolds's result is an embedding of F2 into P2, and that the Reynolds embedding followed by the Girard projection is the identity. We show that the inductive naturals are exactly those values of type natural that satisfy Reynolds's notion of parametricity, and as a consequence characterize situations in which the Girard projection followed by the Reynolds embedding is also the identity. An earlier version of this work used a logic over untyped terms. This version uses a logic over typed term, similar to ones considered by Abadi and Plotkin and Takeuti, which better clarifies the relationship between F2 and P2., 113117=Wed, 14 Apr 2004, 151737=Generic information: http://studres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Library/Distlec/2007-1, 78437=Thu, 19 Apr 2001, 141784=Fri, 01 Dec 2006, 93480=Thu, 14 Mar 2002, 164642=Mon, 23 Feb 2009, 194196=Fri, 22 Apr 2011, 37425=Biography (Speaker 2): Santosh Shrivastava obtained his PhD in Computer Science from Cambridge in 1975.

Although these are massive markets and certainly meet many consumer needs, the computer science behind them is seriously flawed, and makes these devices unnecessarily hard to use. 11.00 \u2013 11.30 Coffee 11.30 \u2013 12.30 The cargo cult of mobile phones (and a cure) The user interface of a mobile phone allows the user to search for phone functions, such as setting ring tones, dialing, texting, and so on. From a computer science perspective, this just requires a searching algorithm. We therefore compare typical phone algorithms with standard computer science algorithms -- and find that current phones are feeble compared to what they could be! 14.30 \u2013 15.30 The cargo cult of calculators (and a cure) Finally, we take a single, extended example of cargo cult computer science: despite their huge market and evident success, calculators are shown to be veritable weapons of maths destruction. After reviewing their problems, and diagnosing them as failures of applying elementary computer sicence, we show how and what solutions can be used to make them much better. A new and exciting approach (which we exhibited at the Royal Society summer science exhibition in July) will be demonstrated: indeed, a new weapon of maths construction. Departmental Seminar Room 1.33 a Jack Cole Building Wednesday 3rd May, 2006 14.00 \u2013 15.00 The cargo cult of scientific computing (and a cure) After exposing widespread problems in the consumer market of embedded computer systems in the previous day's three lectures, we now turn to the academic domain of serious computer science to seek refreshment... Unfortunately, we find the same problems, of unreliable and flawed results widespread throughout the scientific research literature... a cargo cult computer science indeed! More importantly, we move on to discuss what we can do about it., 87693=Wed, 12 Dec 2001, 149613=Biography: Professor Alan Burns has worked for a many years on a number of different aspects of real-time systems engineering.

Room 0.35 (Jack Cole Building) In this lecture we review the DTN work over the last 10 years, starting from the origins as an initiative to provide a commodity network system for the planned manned mission to Mars, and ending up with an architecture for any network that is challenged by frequent disruptions, from oceanographic sensing, to disaster relief communications when everything else has failed, and on to building useful services in places where the population cannot (yet) afford an infrastructure. 11.00 \u2013 11.30 Coffee Coffee Room (Jack Cole Building) Coffee & Tea with Biscuits 11.30 \u2013 12.30 Lecture 2: Opportunistic Networking - Making people network. Room 0.35 (Jack Cole Building) 4 billion people have cell phones. Most have not just a radio for voice communication, but also a bluetooth, short range radio which allows devices to communicate directly (without involving a cell tower). Increasingly, devices also have WiFi which can also be used without any recourse to a provider. We can build networks that use encounters between devices carried by people, and then use the natural mobility of humans (walking, cycling, driving, in trains, planes etc) to carry stored data to the next hop. Such systems can be used in a wide variety of scenarios for disaster communication when the infrastructure is broke, for networks in developing regions (or out in the middle of the ocean, or in space) where there isn't any infrastructure anyway, and for applications which may enjoy high capacity, but do not mind higher (or even uncertain) delays. In the process of designing and building such systems, we may accidentally (on purpose) design systems tat simply work better in the now more traditional setting of the Internet, but cope more seamlessly with the occasional glitches that show up there. We may find it easier to build applications on such systems that tolerate occasional (or frequent) disruptions. One interesting synergy I will touch on here is that applications for opportunistic networks often entail unspecified sender or recipient (i.e. they are data dissemination applications) which resemble some of the new ideas in Data Oriented networking in the Internet. At the same time as resource pooling and multipath routing, and interest-based delivery are being explored for the Internet to support this, such approaches have already proved natural in designing data forwarding schemes in Opportunistic Networks. We'll look at one such protocol. 14.30 \u2013 15.30 Lecture 3: How much delay must I tolerate in my DTN/Oppnet? Room 0.35 (Jack Cole Building) It turns out that we have a wealth of data emerging from measurement made by wireless networking researchers (e.g. on Crawdad) but also increasingly of interest to social scientists (anthropologists trying to understand human society) and medical researchers (epidemiologists trying to understand the spread and evolution of diseases). In this final part of the lecture, I will look at the emerging models we have both for delivery success and delay, and for capacity of DTNs.

For example, today's hardware allows us to examine more complex economic models and do larger simulations in shorter time. Advances in evolutionary computation enable us to search the space of models more efficiently. Some research in computational finance challenge the fundamentals of economics. Others attempt to gain an insight into financial markets, or to explore business opportunities. This talk briefly outlines the scope and agenda of computational finance research. Reference: E.P.K.

EDDIE is a financial forecasting tool developed at University of Essex. It is based on genetic programming, a branch of evolutionary computation techniques. As a tool, EDDIE works with the user in the following way. The user supplies EDDIE with a set of factors or opinions(collectively we call them indicators)that he/she believes is relevant to forecasting. By using historical data, EDDIE helps the user to explore possible interactions between these indicators. Throughsupervised learning, EDDIE builds decision trees that can be used for forecasting. EDDIE is not designed to replace experts; it needs expert knowledge to succeed. Experts will play the role of identifying relevant indicators and evaluating the decision trees. EDDIE has been tested extensively on a large amount of data for identifying investment and arbitrage opportunities. References: E.P.K. Tsang & J. Li, EDDIE for financial forecasting, in S-H.

However, we know that many software systems that are delivered are either never used at all or require extensive modifications after delivery to make them usable. We argue that one reason for this is that the designers of these systems have not taken account of the organisational environment in which these systems are used nor of the work practices that they must support. These lectures will discuss work that has been going on at Lancaster since 1990 to address these issues. Its goal is to develop and integrate organisational and social analysis with approaches such as object-oriented analysis so that we have an improved understanding of the real requirements for organisational software systems. The work has been interdisciplinary and has involved cooperation between social scientists and computer scientists. I will discuss the evolution of our work from initial ethnographic studies that were used to inform the design of an air traffic control system through to our most recent work on an integrated method of social and object-oriented analysis. I will illustrate how methods from the social sciences have been adapted to be practically useful for software systems design and reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of inter-disciplinary working., 11015=1972, 49533=Mon, 21 Apr 1997, 93686=Biography: Professor Derek McAuley joined Marconi in January 2001 to establish the new Marconi Labs in Cambridge.
