            "There are plenty of security guards, and there are safety call boxes littered throughout the campus. All students are automatically notified if a crime has taken place on or near campus, and as far as I've ever seen, there haven't been any actual violent crimes, just petty thefts.",
            "People who don't really like large crowds, or prefer quieter scenes, or just learn in environments with fewer students and less going on.",
            "Even though it's just a smaller branch campus of Penn State, you're still getting a Penn State degree, and paying just a little less for it.",
            "There are plenty of clubs based around video games, there are bowling, poker, and game nights. The busses take you to the local mall and movie theaters, and there are a TON of great restaurants in the area.",
            "I've eaten several times at the local cafeteria, and I just wasn't too impressed.",
            "I lived off campus throughout my entire time there, so I really have no idea.",
            "Penn State Altoona definitely has its difficult classes, but there are also some that are just an outright joke",
            "Be ready to work as hard as you can, college requires a lot of time spent doing work on your own, unlike high school.",
            "It's a great place, if you like tiny schools. The professors are usually great, and willing and able to help you with problems. It's not so great if you're looking for a big college experience, however."

During this past summer of 2012 the cafeteria on campus was completely remodeled. It looks very modern, but most importantly the food is really good. There is a salad station, a pasta station, an all day breakfast food station, a sandwhich station, a grill station, a coffee/tea/milkshake station, a pizza station, and a chef's choice table., 87493=The food and dining at Penn State Altoona is not the best. Port Sky, the only cafeteria on campus, serves the same food every week and closes at 10:30 PM. There are no fast food restaurants on campus., 143745=When I first started college I gave birth to my 1st son in the middle of a semester. I had him on a Thursday and went back into school the following Tuesday to take a liver exam. I graduated with my Associates Degree in Nursing. I always stress to my children that education is never wasted. I decided about a year ago to go back for my BSN then on to my MSN. When I made this decision my oldest son was starting at PSU at University Park. I remember when I took him to college, he looked at me and laughed and said Here we are again mom in college together. My middle child will be starting college this fall in 2013. My youngest child age 16 is starting to make plans for when she graduates. She has 5 colleges she is interested in and would like to see one or two this summer. I raised my children with respect for education and to absorb all it has to offer because it will never be wasted. I currently work full time as a charge nurse for a hospital in my area. I have been attending PSU in Altoona and have maintained a 3.63 GPA. With over 18 years of experience in nursing I plan on getting my MSN and teach nursing., 230215=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students It's only 45 minutes from University Park- no big deal at all. You can always transfer there your junior year as well like I am. Altoona is really great and the faculty are funny, nice, and super helpful. Be prepared to work: just because it's a smaller campus doesn't mean it's easier! I would suggest getting involved in clubs because you will make a lot of new friends that way :) Bang for the buck SO many great trips, clubs, sports, the gym is free, computer lab is free with your Student Activity Fee. You really get your money's worth here! I didn't at my first school, so I know first hand if I am getting ripped or not. Not here at PSUA! Am enjoying being here I LOVE PSUA. It's small, beautiful, peaceful, and everyone is always really glad to help you. Am learning a lot PSUA has opened my eyes to so many new positions and opportunities!
