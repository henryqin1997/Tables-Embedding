Burleigh, Redcliffe, Ipswich and Wynnum are on 29 points on top of the Queensland Cup ladder with two rounds remaining before the final five play off system begins. A fortnight ago Ipswich were alone at the top. Tweed Heads Seagulls are in fifth spot on 26 points three points clear of Toowoomba and it seems certain the Tweed will clinch a final berth because they play lowly Souths Logan at Piggabeen this Sunday. A win at home would keep Tweed three points ahead of Toowoomba and out of reach even if the Clydesdales beat Burleigh in this weekend?s ABC Televised clash. The bottom appears to have fallen out of the Clydesdales season and without inspirational hooker, Barry Berrigan (suspended) there appears little chance of a win against the Bears. Redcliffe and Wynnum clash in the battle of the bayside at Kougari Oval on Sunday and Wynnum should attract the season?s biggest crowd at a suburban football field in Brisbane. Injury hit Ipswich meanwhile face a tough task against Easts at Langlands Park on Saturday with Easts looking to finish the season on a positive note. The Jets must win this game and secure the two premiership points to stay in the race for a top 3 spot. In matches with no bearing on the finals Central host North Queensland at Browne Park, Rockhampton on Saturday night and Norths host Wests at Bishop Park on Sunday. The Young Guns and the Devils are expected to win but an upset is always on the cards. Next weekend the minor premiership will be decided with the current ?big four? facing a mixed bag of games. Wynnum have the easiest task ? against Wests at Purtell Park on Sunday. Redcliffe and Ipswich have games against Easts and Toowoomba respectively which have the potential for upset results but really the Dolphins and Jets should prevail. Burleigh have the toughest task because they face Tweed Heads Seagulls at Piggabeen. If Tweed get over Souths Magpies this weekend as everyone expects and they beat Burleigh the Seagulls could even leapfrog three of the ?big four? into second spot on the ladder. It makes for a fascinating finish to the premiership rounds with the finals to kick off on the weekend of August 30-31 with team two playing team three and team four playing team five in the knockout clash. The minor premiers will have a bye and play the following weekend against the winners of the team 2 v 3 clash. The loser of team 4 v 5 will be eliminated with the winner playing the loser of 2 v 3., 11333=\u00ab Previous 1604 1605 1606 1607 1608 1609 1610 Next \u00bb}",
