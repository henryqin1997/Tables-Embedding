Pushlets basically use an HTML frame to display the client's HTML and a hidden HTML frame to maintain a persistent connection to a servlet. The connection remains persistent because the servlet never closes the output stream of the HttpServletResponse that is destined for the hidden frame. Instead, the servlet holds onto this output stream and whenever a client update is needed, the server sends JavaScript commands to the hidden frame, where this JavaScript contains the updated HTML. A JavaScript listener function in the hidden frame receives the JavaScript commands, and uses Dynamic HTML (\u201cDHTML\u201d) to replace the contents of the visible frame accordingly. Refer to \u201cPushlets-Whitepaper\u201d, by Just van den Broecke, published Aug. 6, 2002 by Just Objects B. V. on the Internet at http://www.pushlets.com/doc/whitepaper-all.html for more information on pushlet technology.}",
