No. 09/293,601, filed Apr. 15, 1999, entitled METHODS AND DEVICES FOR RECOGNIZING BANKNOTES AND RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,427,020), Ser. No. 09/127,502, filed Jul. 31, 1998 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,345,104), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,862,260.), 29598=This application is a continuation-in-part of allowed application Ser. No. 09/343,101, filed Jun. 29, 1999 now abandoned, which is a continuation in part both of application Ser. No. 09/314,648, filed May 19, 1999 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,681,028), and provisional application 60/134,782, also filed May 19, 1999 (attached as Appendix A)., 72754=The employer e-mails or otherwise sends the candidate an access code. (The code can be encrypted for transmission.) The code is valid only for a certain time period on a given date (e.g., 9:00 a.m.\u201311:00 a.m. on Jun. 29, 1999)., 158942=The present assignee's prior application Ser. No. 09/127,502, filed Jul. 31, 1998 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,345,104) shows techniques by which very fine lines can be printed on a medium to slightly change the medium's apparent tint, while also conveying digital data. Commonly-owned application Ser. No. 09/074,034, filed May 6, 1998 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,449,377), details how the contours of printed imagery can be adjusted to convey digital data. (That technique can be applied to printed text characters, as well as the line art imagery particularly considered.) The assignee's U.S. Pat. No. 5,850,481 details how the surface of paper or other media can be textured to convey optically-detectable binary data. The assignee's U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,841,886 and 5,809,160 detail various techniques for steganographically encoding photographs and other imagery., 152815=It is expected that image input devices will soon become commonplace. The provision of digital cameras as built-in components of certain computers (e.g., the Sony Vaio laptops) is just one manifestation of this trend. Another is camera-on-a-chip systems, as typified by U.S. Pat. No. 5,841,126 and detailed in Nixon et al., \u201c256\ufffd256 CMOS Active Pixel Sensor Camera-on-a-Chip,\u201d IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 31(12), pp. 2046\u20132051 (1996), and Fossum, \u201cCMOS Image Sensors: Electronic Camera-on-a-Chip,\u201d IEEE Transactions of Electron Devices, vol. 44, No. 10, October 1997. Still another is head-mounted cameras (as are presently used in some computer-augmented vision systems). These and other image input devices are all suitable for use in Bedoop systems., 86588=In one exemplary embodiment, the blank magazine page stock is Bedoop-encoded prior to printing. The watermarking can be performed by high speed ink-jet devices, which splatter a fine pattern of essentially imperceptible ink droplets across each page. Each page can be differently watermarked so that, on decoding, page 21 of a magazine can be distinguished from page 22 of the same magazine (and page 106 of the Jun. 21, 1999, issue can be distinguished from page 106 of the Jun. 28, 1999, issue). If desired, each page can be further segregated into regions\u2014either in accordance with the actual boundaries of articles that will later be printed on the pages, or in a grid pattern, e.g., of 3 columns across by 5 rows high. Each region conveys a distinct Bedoop code, permitting different portions of the page to lead to different web data.)}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the many embodiments to which the principles of our invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the detailed embodiments are illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of our invention. Rather, we claim as our invention all such embodiments as fall within the scope and spirit of the following claims, and equivalents thereto. To provide a comprehensive disclosure without unduly lengthening this specification, applicants incorporate by reference the patents, applications, and publications identified above. From the foregoing discussion it can be seen that, rather than replacing paper with electronic media, perhaps the future lies in giving paper digital attributes\u2014hybridizing the physical experience of paper with the technical advantages of digital media. Such an arrangement makes available a great wealth of new functionality, now accessible through familiar paper items, rather than through a \u201ccomputer input peripheral.\u201d It was once popular to predict that paper documents would be replaced with electronic media. In hindsight, electronic media may be recognized as a poor surrogate for paper. Electronic media conveys information flawlessly, but is lacking in experiential attributes. We can hold paper, stack it, own it, deface it, give it, guard it, etc. It provides an opportunity for physical dominion entirely lacking with electronic media. While the foregoing embodiments have generally employed planar objects to convey the digital encoding, this need not be the case. Objects",
