According to the population Research Center at Portland State University, the 2010 Census reveals that the total population of the City of Portland is 583,776 people and the population of Vancouver is 161,791, which means that the total population of the Metro Area is 745,567., 15168=History of KBOO - 1975 to 1990 By 1975 the KBOO Foundation had grown to embrace 800+ members and the Foundation elected its first Board of Directors. This step was important in procuring the license and ownership of the station, which enabled KBOO to relinquish its relationship with KRAB radio and its parent company, Jack Straw Memorial Foundation. Although this relationship had been vital to KBOO's growth and development, it was now time for the Portland station to stand alone and assert its place as a fully competent and independent radio station for the people of Oregon., 18237=In 1991, KBOO moved its transmitter to a new location on the 550-foot KGON tower on Portland's West Hills. The antenna is now 300 feet higher than before, which gives the station much broader range. Also, the station increased its wattage to 26,500. Excited listeners reported hearing KBOO clearly from the Oregon Coast and the outskirts of Eugene for the first time., 16861=In the early '80s, KBOO broadened its commitment to multicultural programming by adding new Spanish- and Asian-language programming. African-American musical programming was added in 1981 and in 1984, KBOO introduced a strip of Hispanic programming. Also, the station's News and Public Affairs Director, along with a group of volunteers, created a nightly newscast, which was supplemented by a new wire service and national newscast from Pacifica Radio., 115683=Once the process had revealed a logical course of action for the future of the organization, the Working Group held a community meeting to present the findings to the KBOO membership and the community at large, which included a community survey. The feedback and input that emerged from the meeting was incorporated into the draft plan before the strategic plan received full approval from the Working Group and the Board. The strategic plan spans a period of five years from 2011-2016. The Plan will serve as a primary source document for KBOO to successfully implement the outcomes of this planning process, which will shape the organization\u2019s future., 101455=The Portland Metro Area includes both the City of Portland and the City of Vancouver, WA. According to the Population Research Center at Portland State University, the 2010 Census reveals that the total population of the City of Portland is 583,776 people and the population of Vancouver is 161,791, which means that the total population of the Metro Area is 745,567., 95900=By the mid-1980\u2019s KBOO had raised enough funds to purchase its building and KBOO was in the black for the first time in memory. The building purchase was completed in 1986. KBOO boosted its power to 23,000 watts and began broadcasting in stereo for the first time. Another major federal grant in 1987 enabled KBOO to upgrade studio equipment, a satellite dish was added on the roof, and the station bought a remote transmitter, which enabled live remote broadcasts of community events., 16337=In 1980, KBOO hired its first new director and began regular new productions. Then in 1981, when urban renewal in downtown Portland forced a search for a new home, KBOO found its present location at 20 SE Eighth Avenue. Through a massive volunteer effort, a new station was created from what was previously an empty warehouse. This move bolstered the organization's strength as a community presence, increased their self-sufficiency and amplified the possibilities for expansion of all aspects of their business., 26169=KBOO\u2019s web presence is active and generates an important amount of traffic. From March 28, 2010 to March 28, 2011, the most current data available shows that www.kboo.fm received 748,411 unique page views, which is a 2.08% increase from the same dates one year earlier., 63807=As a radio station, programming is at the heart of KBOO\u2019s success. Indeed, all future successes rely on the commitment to programming that reflects the needs, realities and opportunities of the community that KBOO serves. Without quality programming the organization will not succeed and therefore the goals and action items contained in this chapter represent the central tenet of this strategic plan and the period of implementation that spans 2011-2016., 18844=History of KBOO - The First Decade of the 21st Century - 2000 to 2010 KBOO is important to the community it serves because of its unique market share, which includes distinctive programming and voices. In the first years of the new century KBOO found itself competing for listeners with other local radio stations and also with the advent and subsequent widespread use of portable media. These factors have caused a decline in membership revenues and listenership. KBOO recognized that it must evolve and diversify in order to move forward, to remain viable, and to attract new and different audiences and supporters., 92148=KBOO began to attract listeners in greater numbers and financial support from listener subscribers began to offset KBOO\u2019s operating costs, although the organization\u2019s budget was still subsistence level. Also, KBOO\u2019s volunteer base began to grow and diversify, which resulted in an increase of local-origin programming. During the summer of 1970, KBOO installed a 1000-watt transmitter that enabled KBOO to be heard in much of Northwest Oregon, which further increased the station's audience and subscriptions., 156315=The Portland Metro area has a population of 745,567 people as of the 2010 U.S. Census, and the ten-year average number of paid memberships at KBOO is 6,249 or less than 1% of the Portland Metro area., 17326=By the mid-1980's KBOO had raised enough funds to purchase its building and KBOO was in the black for the first time in memory. The building purchase was completed in 1986. KBOO boosted its power to 23,000 watts and began broadcasting in stereo for the first time. Another major federal grant in 1987 enabled KBOO to upgrade studio equipment, a satellite dish was added on the roof, and the station bought a remote transmitter, which enabled live remote broadcasts of community events. History of KBOO - Modern Expansion and New Technologies During the 1990's KBOO continued its expansion into areas outside of the Portland Metro Area. The station set up a translator in White Salmon, Washington that enabled the station to broadcast into the Columbia Gorge and also installed a translator in the Corvallis area that enabled KBOO to reach audiences in the Mid-Willamette Valley., 98589=To this end, KBOO initiated this strategic planning process, which began in 2010 and culminated in 2011. The charge was to provide the organization with a five-year strategic plan that clearly states goals, strategies, action steps and timelines for achieving these goals. Additionally, KBOO took a hard look at the organization\u2019s internal needs and abilities in developing a financial plan and fundraising strategy for the same time period. Above all, this planning process symbolizes the organization\u2019s commitment to a future that is full of new and renewed opportunities for evolution and expansion. KBOO is dedicated to thriving for another fifty years and beyond., 37152=Overview In developing goals for the future of KBOO from 2011-2016, the following core issues were considered:, 89377=KBOO Community Radio began in the 1960\u2019s when a group of local citizens in Portland, OR wanted a classical music radio station. Disappointed by the absence of such a station, the group organized themselves as Portland Listener Supported Radio in 1964., 11072=The group of local Portland citizens was inspired to develop a community radio station because of the influence of Pacifica Foundation's KPFA radio station that had been founded in 1949 and had pioneered the concept and the philosophies of a community-based radio station in Berkeley, CA. Friends, family and the community told the founder, Lewis Hill, that non-commercial, listener-supported community radio would never work. However, the concept was successful and spawned numerous community radio stations throughout the country. The example of KPFA certainly inspired a group of passionate and committed Portlanders who created KBOO based on the model that had been developed by Lewis Hill. One of KPFA's former volunteers had created a similar station in Seattle with the call letters KRAB. When the Portland group approached him for guidance, Lorenzo Milam agreed to help them organize a station. After several planning sessions, Portland Listener Supported Radio applied for and received a radio license., 89641=The group of local Portland citizens was inspired to develop a community radio station because of the influence of Pacifica Foundation\u2019s KPFA radio station that had been founded in 1949 and had pioneered the concept and the philosophies of a community-based radio station in Berkeley, CA.

Without quality programming the organization will not succeed and therefore the goals and action items contained in this chapter represent the central tenet of this strategic plan and the period of implementation that spans 2011-2016. The efforts that are implemented now will form the foundation of KBOO in the 21st century, both on the airwaves and within the world of electronic media., 111522=KBOO has been operating since 1969. Historically, the organization has not sought outside funding beyond the funds that are raised during the twice-yearly Fund Drives. Historically the majority of support for the radio station has come from individual or business support in the region., 18616=At noon on July 31, 1999, KBOO began streaming online via its website. KBOO now enjoys a worldwide listenership, and continues to receive feedback and financial support from listeners as far away as Japan and Europe., 94911=In 1980, KBOO hired its first new director and began regular new productions. Then in 1981, when urban renewal in downtown Portland forced a search for a new home, KBOO found its present location at 20 SE Eighth Avenue.

This move bolstered the organization\u2019s strength as a community presence, increased their self-sufficiency and amplified the possibilities for expansion of all aspects of their business., 14428=In 1972, the station formalized its commitment to serving the public and incorporated as a nonprofit organization under the name of the KBOO Foundation. By 1973, the staff had grown to five, with about 50 active volunteers, and approximately 600 subscribers donated an average of $20 a year. The station applied for and was awarded an $80,000 federal grant to help purchase equipment. These numerous accomplishments positioned KBOO for the next phase of development and growth, which would be fulfilling, challenging and stimulating for the organization and the community that it had created around it, as well as for the broader Oregon community that had come to appreciate KBOO for its unique 'spin' on community radio., 91184=At a cost of less than $4000, KBOO Community radio was on the air in June of 1968. With a total output of only ten watts less than an average light bulb and a monthly station budget of $50, the dedicated group of volunteers had created a powerful, innovative and community-driven media source on Portland\u2019s radio airwaves., 187277=Washington State Office of Financial Management, Census 2010 Data, Table: State Population Totals, Including Race and Hispanic Origin, 19991=To this end, KBOO initiated this strategic planning process, which began in 2010 and culminated in 2011.

Also, this significant moment in KBOO's history saw the station transition to a 24-hour broadcasting schedule. Further, KBOO was broadcasting at 12,500 watts. KBOO enjoyed rapid growth in its new downtown location when subscribers soared from 1,200 in early 1978 to well above 2,000 by 1980. Volunteers increased as well to approximately 300 volunteers by the end of the 1970's. This growth drew national attention as one of the strongest volunteer programs in the nation., 92994=In 1972, the station formalized its commitment to serving the public and incorporated as a nonprofit organization under the name of the KBOO Foundation.

It is important to note that Census respondents elect whether or not to declare their race, which means that these numbers are approximate. Also, some respondents may check multiple boxes. This skews the population figures slightly., 94340=KBOO continued to grow and mature and in 1977 the station moved to SW Yamhill Street.

For Vancouver the number is 178,547. The Portland Metro Area includes both the City of Portland and the City of Vancouver, WA. According to the population Research Center at Portland State University, the 2010 Census reveals that the total population of the City of Portland is 583,776 people and the population of Vancouver is 161,791, which means that the total population of the Metro Area is 745,567. Market Demographics: Portland Metro Area Most importantly, this discrepancy is important for KBOO as it moves to implement the strategies for organizational sustainability that are outlined in this plan. It is vital to KBOO\u2019s marketing efforts and community outreach to understand that many new or returning listeners and members identify as multi-ethnic and therefore must be approached with this understanding so as not to offend, misunderstand or wrongly identify potential stakeholders.

This is a moderate gain; however it does indicate an increasing use of the organization\u2019s website. The average visitor to the website spends approximately two minutes on each page, compared to 1 minute 45 seconds during the same time period one year earlier. This indicates that the content is retaining visitors, which is positive for KBOO. The majority of visitors emanate from either Oregon or Washington. From Oregon, visitors from 292 cities sent 194,136 visits, which is up 10.93% percent from one year earlier. Significant to note is that from Portland alone, the number of hits increased 761.9 % percent during this one year period. From Washington, 24,488 people visited from 332 cities, which is significant growth of 34.85% since one year earlier. Seattle, Washington\u2019s biggest city, saw a 943.4% increase in web traffic during this one-year period.
