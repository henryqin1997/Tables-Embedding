            "Ninten arriving in Magicant by Onyx Hook. The song lyrics are from \"DJ Satomi - Castle in the Sky\". When I heard the song, I thought several parts of it sounded like they could be interpreted as Queen Mary singing about Magicant to Ninten. I mean really, Mother 1's Magicant has a literal castle in the sky...",

            "Paula will not react well to seeing THIS on a spider's web in her backyard. I saw that horror movie parodies were involved in this funfest so I, not being an expert on them, decided to look up one and draw a picture. I found this older one called \"The Fly\" and after reading a synopsis, this happened. Have a Ness/Buzz-Buzz fusion trapped on a spider's web and pleading for help."
