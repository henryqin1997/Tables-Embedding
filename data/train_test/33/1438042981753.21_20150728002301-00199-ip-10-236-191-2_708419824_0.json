Those vehicles are now well entrenched in the market and are beginning to show up in repair shops needing service. Manufacturers have adapted their emissions systems to meet the new standards and in some cases the changes are significant. Having a true understanding of these new components and their relationship to each other and the Engine Management System is imperative. We will explore many of these changes from design to functionality and diagnosis, with a special emphasis on the NEW Clean Diesel Technology and how it will affect the repair industry. Diagnosis of catalyst efficiency issues as well as SCR, NAC and DPF systems will be included. Get the information you need to keep these repairs in your shop.}",
