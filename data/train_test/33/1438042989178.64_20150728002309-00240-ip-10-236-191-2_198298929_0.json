He\u2019s simply the best, better than all the rest. I\u2019d bet on Robertson securing 95% of the Yankees saves ROTW. I\u2019d hold Soriano if there aren\u2019t any pressing roster matters for a week or so, but it\u2019s Robertson\u2019s job to run with. Sure, Robertson blew a save last night somewhat spectacularly, but the runs were the first ones he \u00a0allowed since September of last year. He\u2019ll get a long rope; however don\u2019t go dropping Soriano just yet., 126649=Ferris says: May 10, 2012 at 5:10 pm (link), 144230=zoot says: May 11, 2012 at 3:44 pm (link), 84239=TualatinTwoStep says: May 10, 2012 at 1:07 pm (link), 123903=Ferris says: May 10, 2012 at 5:00 pm (link), 139864=Albert says: May 11, 2012 at 5:39 am (link), 118088=Baron Von Vulturewins says: May 10, 2012 at 2:25 pm (link), 85974=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 1:11 pm (link), 27589=Miami Marlins: You\u2019d think by now, we\u2019d know who was stepping in for Heath Bell. However, while Edward Mujica has gotten and converted the save opportunities, Steve Cishek\u00a0hasn\u2019t pitched in five days after he threw five innings over a three day span. There is very little debate that Cishek is the better pitcher and it\u2019s certainly possible he\u2019ll get the save opportunities when he can pitch. However, I\u2019m still backing Mujica. He was acquired in the Maybin trade as a back of the bullpen type. Meanwhile Cishek was a fifth round pick in 2007 and hasn\u2019t closed much in the minors, 19 saves in 175 games. From an organizational perspective, Mujica was acquired more as a closer and Cishek as an arm. I must give made respect for @Jack as he almost got me to flip my position. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m 51% in support of Mujica. UPDATE:\u00a0Of course the above was written before the Marlins had a hold situation in the 8th and Mujica came in. Clearly, @Jack was right, I was wrong and Cishek is the guy to own for the time being.\u00a0And, of course, because it\u2019s the Marlins, Cishek blew the save. He got a lot of help from Giancarlo Stanton who misplayed a bloop single into a triple for Carlos Lee. However, Cishek did manage to walk Chris Johnson, somehow, and gave up a solid single to Brian Bogusevic. Going forward, Cishek will have some issues against lefties, but should remain the front runner in the pen\u2026for now. I\u2019d still like to own both or neither., 115355=PunxsutawneyPhils says: May 10, 2012 at 2:22 pm (link), 112735=RiffRaff says: May 10, 2012 at 1:35 pm (link), 110789=zk says: May 10, 2012 at 1:36 pm (link), 71698=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 11:24 am (link), 128012=albert says: May 10, 2012 at 5:11 pm (link), 90612=EK says: May 10, 2012 at 12:10 pm (link), 73575=WhineSpritzer says: May 10, 2012 at 2:00 pm (link), 142749=Albert says: May 11, 2012 at 9:12 am (link), 120942=Hunter says: May 10, 2012 at 3:34 pm (link), 93386=Sweeney says: May 10, 2012 at 12:33 pm (link), 113891=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 1:36 pm (link), 106264=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 1:18 pm (link), 96418=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 12:14 pm (link), 100686=Charles says: May 10, 2012 at 12:54 pm (link), 107862=zk says: May 10, 2012 at 1:22 pm (link), 81138=TualatinTwoStep says: May 10, 2012 at 11:38 am (link), 145550=albert says: May 11, 2012 at 3:55 pm (link), 94646=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 12:36 pm (link), 131012=Albert says: May 11, 2012 at 5:40 am (link), 133976=albert says: May 11, 2012 at 3:53 am (link), 119497=albert says: May 10, 2012 at 3:35 pm (link), 79352=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 11:41 am (link), 76430=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 11:33 am (link), 97901=smegma says: May 10, 2012 at 12:50 pm (link), 132653=John C. says: May 10, 2012 at 9:28 pm (link), 136990=albert says: May 11, 2012 at 4:00 am (link), 87851=Ferris says: May 10, 2012 at 11:54 am (link), 99144=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 12:51 pm (link), 30875=San Diego Padres: The reason I was so high on Frieri was Andrew Cashner\u2019s inability to throw strikes and how the Padres seem to prefer using Luke Gregerson in the seventh. So, hello Dale Thayer, who was originally signed by the Padres in 2002, but made his debut seven years after that for the Rays. He made his way back to the Padres after the New York Mets found no use for him. Seriously. Exclusively a reliever in the minors, Thayer has a 2.70 ERA, 1.23 WHIP and 3.01 K:BB rate at AAA. Of course a significant amount of those innings came after he turned 28. Thayer isn\u2019t a K guy but a ground ball pitcher in a Jim Johnson mold. So far, his control seems a bit above average. It looks like there is no reason to carry Cashner or Gregerson on your team as Thayer is the handcuff for Huston Street., 77971=FD says: May 10, 2012 at 11:40 am (link), 138529=Traded a Fister for a BJ says: May 10, 2012 at 10:34 pm (link), 82763=Albert says: May 10, 2012 at 11:39 am (link), 157963=Copyright 2007 - 2015 Razzball LLC.

    "textBeforeTable": "Cincinnati Reds: On Wednesday, after Sean Marshall gave up a lead-off homer to Ryan Braun in the ninth, Logan Ondrusek began warming in the bullpen. Marshall then fanned Aramis Ramirez and Corey Hart hit a ball to the warning track in dead center. Jonathan Lucroy followed with a single on the 12th pitch of the at bat and then Aoki got a cheap bloop to left. So, Dusty Baker pulled Marshall for Ondrusek. What the what!?! Ondrusek immediately went 3-0 on the mighty Cesar Izturis and walked him two pitches later. Of course, Travis Ishikawa swung on the first pitch of the subsequent AB and hit a weak fly to left. Game over. Ondrusek is a fine, not special reliever, capable of finishing with a 3.15 ERA, 1.25 WHIP and 55 K\u2019s. He\u2019s no Aroldis Chapman or Sean Marshall though. Marshall has been exceptional aside from one outing and I fully expect him to get the bulk of the saves for the Reds. Los Angeles Dodgers: It seems if you approach Heath Bell territory on the BS meter (Cordero, Guerra), you lose your job. Kenley Jansen is filthy, capably of putting up a 2.50 ERA, 1.11 WHIP and 80 K\u2019s the rest of the way. Finally, you can drop Javy Guerra.
