The sparse array has only a small number of pixels compared to a standard imaging array. For example, a 32\ufffd32 pixel sparse array contains only 1024 pixels compared to the more than 65,000 pixels from a standard 256\ufffd256 imaging array. The pixels in the sparse array are also small and widely separated, i.e. have a small fill factor, so that the full image field is sampled and yet each pixel contains only a fraction of a fringe period even at high fringe densities. This assures significant fringe modulation even when the part is heavily tilted relative to the instrument optical axis.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets It is to be understood that as all of these choices provide substantially the same functionality, they may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. A short coherence light source as used herein is meant to include a broad band light source or a spatially extended light source such that it enables localized fringes to occur near the equal path condition of the interferometer. In the presently preferred embodiment, the AFO electronics 40 supports the AFO detector 30 and contains sufficient digital memory means to store digitized intensity measurements for all the frames from the AFO detector 30 during the scan, as well as scan position information at each frame. The presently preferred method of the present invention sends this data to the host computer 100 for analysis after the scan is complete. The main reason for this is flexibility in processing. The host computer 100 is typically the repository of all information regarding the particular measurement and, as such, can easily account for conditions that are specific to the application. For example, because of a finite depth of focus, it may be impossible to bring all regions of a test surface 66 consisting of a number of raised plateaus at different heights simultaneously into focus. The host computer 100 can then concentrate on bringing into focus those areas of specific interest and",
