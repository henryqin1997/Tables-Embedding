It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto. The invention has been described as a cache using physical addresses. Caches using virtual addresses are also well-known in the art and the invention could be modified to use virtual addresses rather than physical addresses. Direct-memory access (DMA) may also be combined with the invention allowing DMA access to the master cache through a separate DMA channel. The master cache would handle all DMA cycles, only interrupting the slave caches when necessary, when a slave valid bit is set. The slave caches and store queue may be organized in different ways, and the slave instruction cache could include buffering similar to the store queue to allow it to defer line fills from the master cache. The buses between the master cache and the slave caches could be separate busses as described, or a shared bus could be used. An embodiment has been described with valid bits in the master indicating if an instruction or data word is present in one of the slave caches.",
