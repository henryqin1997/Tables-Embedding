Ever since I started attending the Saturday school classes in 2002, I've hoped of attending for real as an animation student. Now I am working hard to start a career in animation. Aside from the usual studies we also have computer labs, fun field days, visiting artists, clubs of interests, and much more.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students Columbus College of Art & Design is an ideal school for hard workers, perfectionists, those that are artistically-minded, creative, outside-the-box, and unique individuals. If you're not 100% or above dedicated and serious about working in the visual art world, this school is most definitely not for you. Tips for prospective students Be ready to enroll yourself into a high-workload school. Although it is an intensive, rigorous school it will reward you with an above-average knowledge and specialization in the art world which is what in turn will get you an education. You have to realize that in the art world no one will care about your GPA like was typical in high school. You have to develop your portfolio and obtain connections in order to get a good job in this field. Being studious isn't enough. Bang for the buck The school is somewhat expensive compared to regular state schools, however, all art schools are in this same above-average range. And compared to all other art schools in the country Columbus College of Art & Design is the cheapest school that is still accredited and taken seriously with a great reputation. Am enjoying being here The school is",
