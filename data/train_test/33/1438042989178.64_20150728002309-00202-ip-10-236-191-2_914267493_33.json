Reviewer has been to campus. 6 out of 6 people found this review useful. 2 of 33 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Biology, Biomedical Science, Chemistry, etc.. Tips for prospective students When applying don't forgot to include every little thing you have done throughout high school, it will make a difference in the end, plus you will end up paying less money! Bang for the buck It is a lot of money but if you have the grades they are very generous in their scholarships and in the end you will be paying for quality Will enjoy being here A brand new student center + the city of Scranton + endless activities and clubs = total fun, when your not studying of course! Will learn a lot",
