For example, when submitting an essay or research paper, check your punctuation, grammar, cite your sources correctly, and keep everything organized. The work can be challenging because of the amount of time needed to complete an assignment but the actual work isn't hard. Spending a good amount of time studying can go a long way which will help you in the long run.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Anyone who dreams of pursuing higher education. Tips for prospective students Community college is a great stepping stone for those beginning their college careers. It's cheaper than big name universities and you get the same quality education; as well as living in a tight-knit community that's friendly and enjoyable. Bang for the buck With the rising costs of tuition, community college is a wise start for those who can't afford to go to a University. You get the same education but at a cheaper price which makes going to school more efficient. Am enjoying being here The school is community friendly and feels warm and welcoming. It also helps that I can stay close to home without commuting. The school also has many options to get involved in clubs and community activities. Am learning a lot The teachers at Antelope Valley College care about my education and are highly qualified to give it. I may be at a community college, but I still have to work just as hard to earn good grades as any other college student in a University.",
