On the weekends, everything is closed by 10pm. There is a variety of restaurants that are located on campus, plus you can add money to your EagleCard and use it at some restaurants off campus as well., 384990=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 226331=When I came to Morehead State University I decided to check out the Greek life. I joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon in the fall semester of 2012 and I'm very satisfied. It allowed me to meet many new people and keep me occupied with things to do in this small town., 4292=Try to look at scholarships specific to this school in September of your senior year. There are several that are specific to this time when some people are just starting to look. If you get your foot in the door during this time, you will do much better financially. Also, make sure you are ready to wake up at 2 am for fire drills. Yes, this will happen at any school you go to., 282373=ADUC which is only open from around 8- 4:30 is the best place you will eat on this campus. It has a bunch of fast food restaurants and is absolutely fantastic though it can get a little crowded. RFOC which is located in Alumni Tower is okay. This is where most go to eat dinner, it's not the best but, it's still pretty awesome compared to eating Ramen all the time.}",

Morehead is a great school with wonderful administrators, and deserves more credit than it gets. I am part of the Music Education department, and I love it. There is such a community here. Students really help each other out and the professors will create a personal bond with you. If you want a small town and a small campus, this is the place for you.
