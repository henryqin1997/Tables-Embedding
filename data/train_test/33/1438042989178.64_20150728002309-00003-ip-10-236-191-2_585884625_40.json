    "textAfterTable": "Hahaha, now I see you're right. Would've been funny if you did say that though. Basically the only brutal death metal band I listen to is Nile. And their lyrics are pretty bad-ass due to the Epyptian themes and all. And I agree about the lyrics... it's one of the least important aspects about the music. The music itself and vocals are way more important than the lyrics. It's ridiculous to not like a band solely because of its lyrics.
