            "This year (2013-2014), we do not have guards at the entrances of campus anymore so almost anyone can set foot on campus, however we do have CSO's and escort systems if you're feeling unsafe at night.",
            "Clubs and activities is also fun when you want to meet people but the only problem with Santa Cruz is that we don't have large places to meet up at for individual clubs, sports, frats, etc.",
            "Every year, we have this thing called First Rain or The Naked Run in which students will run through the campus nude in order to represent our mascot, the banana slug, coming out when it's wet outside.",
            "No matter what anybody says, there is a lot to explore right on campus. The campus is in a forest so there are pathways that you can walk on and discover places that many people do not know about. There are caves, the cat graveyard, tree nine, the rock garden, and plenty of other places I still have yet to see. You just have to take time to go out there and look for something interesting and surely, you will find something interesting.",
            "There's plenty of healthy choices along with other dishes you can choose from. Some colleges have happy hour with delicious desserts. Sometimes the food isn't as great but most of the time, you can find something to eat that will satisfy your stomach for a few hours.",
            "Dorm life is one of the best parts of college, especially if you're a first year. The dorms is where you can easily meet a lot of people who could end up as a longterm friend.",
            "There are some classes that are easier than others but for the majority of your major classes, studying is key. Classes will be tough if you don't put any effort into them.",
            "College is a fun experience but make sure to have a fine balance between fun and academic work or else you might end up on academic probation.",
            "UC Santa Cruz is built in a redwood forest which is great if you ever want to go outside and relax in nature. There's always some sort of event going on every week within the 10 colleges that UC Santa Cruz consists of so there is always something to do if you look around the right areas."

One very important thing to consider about attending UCSC is the tuition rate. Tuition is to raise 5% each year after 2014., 665594=If interested in attending this institution, I would advise you to do good in your school. You do not have to be involved in something for your community or play any sports. I graduated the school with a GPA of 3.7 and SAT score of around 1400 and was able to get in. In other words if you are good at your academics, you are good to go., 342802=April 20th will show you the true hippie tradition of UCSC. Porter Hill is packed with pot-smoking students and locals alike., 789213=It was rated #1 in vegan food I think in 2011 which a plus to me because Im a vegetarian so they do have a lot of options compared to others schools. Usually has a good variety of healthly food and unheathly food. But they start to serve the same stuff and it gets old., 788670=Go to Natural Bridges ! Beautiful beach Use a rent a car or a zip car to go on road trips Hiking on beautiful trails Take a trip or class through OPERS Downtown - restaurants, shops and the Del Mar is a cool movie theater Dances on campus or off campus, 864444=I felt safe on campus, the only incidents that occurred in the academic school year 2012-13 were in town., 1043323=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 192333=This year (2013-2014), we do not have guards at the entrances of campus anymore so almost anyone can set foot on campus, however we do have CSO's and escort systems if you're feeling unsafe at night., 491042=First Rain, or the Naked Run, occurs during the first rainfall of the school year. Beginning by the totem pole at Porter College, students gather together in the nude and run throughout campus. In the rain. Naked. While the rules for First Rain are debated each year, in truth, the naked people decide when it happens. 4/20, an unsanctioned event not at all supported by the campus, is a large gathering of students in the meadow and the surrounding trees behind Porter College to smoke marijuana each April. Drum circles abound. A police force is present, though, they are mostly there to ensure that people stay safe., 21156=Every year at the first rain, thousands of students begin from the east side of campus and run naked to the west side of campus, ending in the OPERS pool. There are often full moon drum circles at the Porter Meadows as well. April 20th brings thousands of students and non-affiliates to the Porter Meadows for the day and has fun student-run activities such as slacklining competitions. The Rock Garden and the Garden of Eden are seemingly magical places in Pogonip that gathers nature loving students frequently (if you can find them). The amphitheater by the bookstore is also a really cool place. There are tons of secret places around campus that people have found and there are plenty more to be discovered since the campus is located inside a forest., 551777=Besides the rain run that started in the fall and the 4/20 event that happen as well as the protest on May, no nothing out of the ordinary., 705370=in 2011 UCSC won the best Vegan food on a college campus. The food is good for omnivores too. There is a wide variety of dining locations on campus, 5 dining halls and specialty restaurants on campus. With your housing you will have the option of selecting a 7 day unlimited food plan, which means you can enter and eat at any hall as much as you want and whenever you want. The availability of food is as good as the quality., 179234=The First Rain Run is a run that occurs on the first day of the year that it rains the entire day and is still raining at nighttime. It begins at Porter College and runs a loop around the school. Everyone runs naked, though a small handful only partially naked. The run ends in a drum circle in the Porter Meadow, though the end is even less official and tends to end however the runners end up wanting it to. Tree Nine is a massive tree above College Nine with many branches that many students climb their first year at UC Santa Cruz. It's not so much event based, but it has been referred to as a rite of initiation to be a real UCSC student. April 20th, or 4/20 is, as you probably know, a nationwide and possibly worldwide event that is specifically for smoking marijuana, at 4:20 on the dot, though not everyone follows that rule. One of the largest gatherings in the nation for this unofficial holiday occurs in the Porter Meadow. Lots of precautions are taken by campus security to keep illegal activity to a minimum on this day, as well as visitors to campus. A lot of people go and don't even smoke, but the tradition is to be in the meadow and do whatever you decide to do with your friends on this day. Drum circles happen in the various meadows at Santa Cruz, especially at the full moon. Everyone gets together to dance, play music, and be with friends., 67768=UC Santa Cruz is not only a great place to learn and succeed in a higher education, but also a great place to live. In fact, Santa Cruz was voted best campus for it's cleanliness. surrounded by trees, trees, and more trees the campus is nice and shady on warm sunny days and throughout the whole year great weather. May i add that the beach is within a 5-10 minute drive. If you are someone who loves nature Santa Cruz is right for you. i know it was for me. i love the hills and the trees in Santa Cruz., 614046=1) Tango lessons at the Palomar 2) Natural Bridges Beach 3) Seabright Beach 4 ) Trivia night at Woodstocks, 981671=UCSC had the honor of placing first place in PETA's Most Vegan Friendly College in 2011. The dining halls try something new at least once a week, always finding new ways of mixing up the menu., 5140=The professors are amazingly brilliant, and most teach with excellent clarity and enthusiasm. There are a few duds, but you'll find that at any school. Tuition was increased for the 2009-2010 school year, but where in the country hasn't college tuition gone up, with the way the economy is? The only thing that I don't like is that a lot of classes are hard to get into as a first or second year because enrollment times are issued by the number of credits you have. It is disappointing to try to sign up for a class numerous quarters in a row, and still not get in because the class closes before your enrollment time rolls around.}",

Am enjoying being here The campus is absolutely beautiful! Some may complain about climbing the hills to classes, but it's well worth it. Where else can you go to class in the middle of a redwood forest, or wake up to a panoramic view of Monterrey Bay. If you end up at UCSC, be sure to visit Pogonip - the state park that is literally next-door to the campus. Not a huge party school, if that's what you're looking for, but weekends aren't boring either. There's plenty to do down town, and of course, at the beach. Am learning a lot",
