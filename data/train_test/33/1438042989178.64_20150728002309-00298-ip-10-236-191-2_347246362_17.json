Respondents who have a college degree are 1.5 to 2 times more likely to be up-to-date than respondents who do not have a high school degree. Receipt of clinical preventive services is also consistently associated with higher income level for each of the four age and sex groups. Large differences exist between people who have medical insurance and people who do not. People with health insurance or personal physicians have approximately two to three times the rate of clinical preventive service delivery as people without either of them. According to the U.S. Census, 11.1% of whites, 19.6% of blacks, 18.8% of Asians, and 32.7% of Hispanics lacked insurance in 2003 (13). These findings are consistent with those of other studies that have found significant disparities in the delivery of cancer screening (14-16) and adult vaccinations (17,18) when measured by race/ethnic group, education, and income., 355052=Figure 1. Prevalence estimates of adults aged \u226550 years who were up-to-date for cancer screening and vaccinations by age group, sex, and state, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2002. Data from 49 states and the District of Columbia. Results were divided into quartiles, and the middle two quartiles were combined. Illinois data are not included because the state used a split sample for some preventive service questions. [A text description of these maps is also available.], 363589=We used data from the 2002 BRFSS; the BRFSS is an ongoing state-based telephone survey of randomly selected adults and is coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The survey collects data from noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 and older on health practices that are related to the leading causes of death and disability (5). We limited our analysis to data from adults aged 50 and older, including 105,860 respondents in 49 states and the District of Columbia. Illinois data are not reported because approximately half of the female respondents in that state were not asked questions about breast and cervical cancer screening. All results are based on weighted data that account for different probabilities of selection and are adjusted to the total adult population in each state by age and sex or age, race, and sex., 364761=There is currently no index that combines data on the use of all recommended clinical preventive services among adults. In this article, we present a composite measure of cancer screening services and vaccinations obtained by adults aged 50 years and older as a first step toward assessing overall clinical preventive service delivery. We chose to begin our assessment by combining these two sets of interventions because they are universally recommended and data on their use in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are available through the 2002 BRFSS. Composite indices have long been used for the surveillance of childhood vaccinations (4)., 347853=This work builds on the analysis of others (20). The BRFSS has followed state rates for clinical preventive service delivery for more than 20 years, and a recent study has provided a comprehensive overview of trends (21). Combined measurements of mammography, clinical breast exam, and Pap testing have been made using data from the 1990 NHIS of Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (22). A methodology for building a prevention index has also been developed using electronic medical records. This index can serve as a combined quality assessment measure and be compared with consensus measures or with selected Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) scores for health management organizations (23)., 344543=The building blocks of composite measures will change as recommendations for individual interventions evolve. For example, colorectal cancer screening guidelines for Healthy People 2010 objectives have not yet been updated to match USPSTF recommendations.\u00a0(Healthy People 2010 objectives for Pap test, mammography, and adult vaccinations are consistent with USPSTF recommendations for women aged 50 and older.), 357933=The median state response rate for the 2002 BRFSS was 58.3% (range 42.2%\u201382.6%) (11). Results for the individual preventive health services for each of the age and sex groups are presented in Appendix Tables A\u2013D. All other results are for being up-to-date on cancer screening and vaccinations as defined above., 365251=The delivery rates of cancer screenings and adult vaccinations have typically been measured separately through population-based surveys, including the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). Although this approach is well suited for assessing progress toward Healthy People 2010 objectives, it does not measure the extent to which individuals receive the full complement of recommended clinical preventive services., 368210=Suggested citation for this article: Shenson D, Bolen J, Adams M, Seeff L, Blackman D.

We must redouble our efforts to develop more effective approaches to delivering these basic adult clinical preventive services., 367315=Methods We analyzed state data from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which included 105,860 respondents aged 50 and older. We created a composite measure that included colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy within 10 years or a fecal occult blood test in the past year, an influenza vaccination in the past year, a Papanicolaou test within 3 years for women with an intact cervix, a mammogram, and for adults aged 65 and older, a pneumonia vaccination during their lifetime. We performed separate analyses for four age and sex groups: men aged 50 to 64, women aged 50 to 64, men aged 65 and older, and women aged 65 and older., 362714=We analyzed responses to the BRFSS core questions on the use of clinical preventive services recommended by the USPSTF for adults aged 50 and older: colorectal cancer screening, mammography, Papanicolaou (Pap) test, and influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations (Table 1). These questions were asked in all states and territories that participated in the 2002 BRFSS survey. All measures of preventive health services were dichotomized as yes or no based on receipt of the service according to schedules recommended by the USPSTF. The USPSTF recommends influenza vaccination for adults aged 50 and older (6); other agencies support this recommendation (7). We used a 10-year interval for endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) because the BRFSS question did not distinguish between the two interventions. The USPSTF does not recommend intervals for the use of sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy; other national guidelines recommend a 5-year interval for sigmoidoscopy and a 10-year interval for colonoscopy (8-10). For all services, people who had never had the test or had the tests outside the designated schedule were included in the group who answered no. Our analysis excluded respondents with missing values except for respondents missing one colorectal cancer screening value. Because colorectal cancer screening recommendations involve receiving either endoscopy or fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), we did not exclude respondents with missing values for one test if they had the other test within the recommended interval., 340884=Corresponding Author: Douglas Shenson, MD, MPH, MS, 76 Prince St, Newton, MA 02465.
