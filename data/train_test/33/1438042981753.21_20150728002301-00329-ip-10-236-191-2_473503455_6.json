It is to be understood that the above-described embodiment is merely illustrative of some of the many specific embodiments that represent applications of the principles discussed above. Clearly, numerous and other arrangements can be readily devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. A seismic shear wave generator 10 is coupled 41 to the ground 21. A seismic sensor 32 is inserted 42 a short distance into the ground 21. The seismic shear wave generator 10 is caused to repeatedly generate 43 seismic shear waves, and preferably horizontally polarized shear waves, which are transmitted 44 into the ground 21. Using the exemplary rotary actuated seismic shear wave generator 10, the motor 15 is operated to continuously, cause repeated impacts of the spring-accelerated rotatable mass 13 with a striking plate 12 that contacts the ground 21. To achieve this, the spring-accelerated rotatable mass 13 is rotated away from the impact member 12 to store energy, and is then allowed to accelerate with spring assistance to contact the impact member 12. The seismic sensor 32 is continuously inserted 45 into the ground 21 to a greater and greater depth while the seismic shear waves are transmitted 44 into the ground 21, until the sensor 32 reaches the predetermined depth.
