    "textAfterTable": "Third Party Dependencies As per the Policy and Procedure for 3rd Party Dependencies the EclipseLink project has the following works-with dependencies. EclipseLink's pre-req behavior is as documented in the IP Log working with standard data source access APIs and compatible implementations. The following dependencies are optional works-with capabilities available for those users who wish to access advanced features of the Oracle database and therefore have the corresponding libraries available from their database distribution. The functionality that leverages the additional features is isolated within SVN at: /foundation/org.eclipse.persistence.oracle . Both the Eclipse projects and ANT targets provided enable users to build and test EclipseLink without these optional dependencies or if they want to use these they can configure either Eclipse IDE variables or customize ANT properties files to provide the location of their works-with Oracle JDBC libraries.
