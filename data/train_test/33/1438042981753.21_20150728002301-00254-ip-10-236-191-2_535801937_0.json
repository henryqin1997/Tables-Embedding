Participants are welcome to come early at 6:30 p.m. for light refreshments and conversation before the forum begins. The questions to be explored at the forum include items such as: Should the county have a mayor (rather than a council-manager) form of government? Should the county hold partisan elections? Should the county consider changing the structure to elect councilors by defined wards or districts (rather than at large)? Two speakers with background and experience in these issues will present information at the forum, then open the floor to question and answer with the audience moderated by the League of Women Voters. \u00a0 Professor James Svara of Arizona State University\u2019s School of Public Affairs has done extensive research on form of government issues and is the author of several journals and books about leadership by mayors, council members and city managers. He has worked in 12 states and is a top consultant to city governments working on charter revisions involving a change in leadership and management structure.}",
