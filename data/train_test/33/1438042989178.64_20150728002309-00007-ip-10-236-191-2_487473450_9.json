    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33595=To date, serious questions exist about the longevity and reliability of MEMS switches. For example, the longest-living analog MEMS switch survives on the order of one billion switching cycles. Therefore, if any analog MEMS switch could switch quickly enough to switch packets at commercially acceptable rates, it would barely survive one minute before reaching the end of its operating life. Furthermore, MEMS switches are sensitive to shocks and are fragile. Another disadvantage of the current generation of MEMS switches is that they are bulky. For example, a 1152 micro-mirror port switch produced by Xros is purported to occupy 2\ufffd 7-foot bays. The footprint of MEMS switches is likely to decrease in the future., 30896=This appl. claims priority from provisional applications Ser. Nos. 60/232,927, filed Sep. 15, 200, and 60/207,391, filed May 26, 2000}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing discussion discloses and describes merely exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from such discussion, and from the accompanying drawings and claims, that various changes, modifications and variations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. FIG. 5 discloses an emitter array 10 disposed on a substrate 31. Also shown is the relationship between the emitter array 10 and the detection grid 25 as well as a plurality of emitted beams 26 being directed towards the detection array 25. The aluminum focusing block 68 has a plurality of apertures defined therein that are aligned with the apertures of the aperture plate 69 and the cathodes. A second aperture plate 70 is optionally disposed between the aluminum focusing block 68 and the aluminum deflector shield layer 71. The aluminum focusing block 68 functions to focus and accelerate the electron beam toward the aluminum deflector shield layer 71. The aluminum deflector shield layer 71 has a plurality of controllable aiming anodes (not shown) to direct the electron beam produced by the cathode plate 62 to a phosphorus screen or target header 72 disposed at the far end of the vacuum chamber 54. FIG. 4 represents a multi-gun structure of a preferred embodiment of the current invention. Shown is a multi-gun switch 50 disposed within a glass tube chamber 52. The glass tube chamber",
