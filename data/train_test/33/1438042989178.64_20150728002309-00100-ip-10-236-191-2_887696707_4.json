    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 You should be working with KDE 4 (either 4.3.2 or newer is best or SVN trunk) for testing these bugs. To test bugs noticed with Amarok, we strongly suggest aou have either Amarok 2.2.0 or 2.2-git Be sure to join #kde-bugs on irc.freenode.net, as this is where the bug-day will be coordinated. (You can even join now!) The goal of this bug-day is to check for: simple step-by-step instructions, reproducibility, and most of all, come up with test-cases for reproducing the bugs. This will enable the Phonon developers to deal with bugs more easily, and so have more time left to actually fix them. When you have added step-by-step instructions for the reproduction of a bug, please list it in the appropriate section below, so that a second triager can see if they can get your instructions/test-case to work correctly. This page has useful information on how to not mis-mark bugs. In particular, \"duplicates are hard\". and Phonon currently has a lot of duplicate reports. The other tricky thing is that you will need to test with various applications like Amarok or Dragonplayer, since many KDE applications use Phonon for sound. Please make sure to double check them with someone else, preferably one of the developers before marking/closing.We especially don't want to create more work for developers! This bug",
