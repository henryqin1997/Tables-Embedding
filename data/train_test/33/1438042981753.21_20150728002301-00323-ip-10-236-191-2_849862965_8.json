Schabarum, annoyed at the cutbacks of bus service by the SCRTD, wanted to secede from the larger agency and form his own transit agency. Schabarum, who hated the influence of trade unions, chose to use contractors to operate the service, and Foothill executives made the service essentially strike-proof by insisting that two different companies operate the two bus yards, even if it would cost more in the short term. However, due to bus industry consolidation, First Transit had operated both yards from 2001 to mid-2007. Currently, both Foothill Transit yards are represented by unions (Arcadia by the Amalgamated Transit Union and Pomona by the Teamsters Union), but past strikes at the agency have been less than successful due to the ability of one yard to operate the other yards' service. In addition, wages are less at Foothill than at other transit operators in the region., 10429=All service operated as of June 1, 2014 with notes on upcoming service changes where indicated., 8694=All of Foothill Transit operations are contracted out. Bus service is operated by First Transit at Pomona and Arcadia/Irwindale. Effective July 1, 2013, due to expiration of the existing management services contract and continuing conflicts of interest between the executive director, staff, and board, Foothill Transit transitioned to in house management. Executive Director Doran Barnes became a direct Foothill employee, as well as planning, procurement, and other administrative functions. Veolia staff continues to operate the transit stores and maintain bus shelters.[3], 35071=Fares as of October 1, 2012, 9437=In 2002, Foothill Transit began purchasing Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) powered buses. By 2013, Foothill Transit will have a 100 percent CNG fleet., 34364=On June 26, 2006, Foothill Transit installed wireless Internet hubs on six 1200-series Orion V buses (F1208, F1236, F1237, F1258, F1260, and F1262) that were exclusively assigned to Line 699. Downstream bandwidth of 300 kbit/s was available on each bus. The test program was discontinued and wi-fi service was installed on the Silver Streak until it was discontinued there in Late March 2009., 31336=Services operate weekdays only.

    "textBeforeTable": "Active[edit] Bus Fleet[edit] All Foothill Transit passes are now sold on TAP cards only. Discount Silver Streak passes can be purchased by students, seniors, the disabled, and Medicare card holders. If the pass is used on Line 481, or Line 690, the difference must be paid in cash. A 31-Day Pass' lifespan starts when the pass is first used, not necessarily at the beginning of the month, unless the pass was first used at the beginning of the month. For example, if the pass is bought on March 6, but first used on March 12, the expiration date of the pass is April 12 at midnight, 31 days after it was first used. Transfers can be purchased for $0.50 using cash or a TAP card with a cash purse loaded (a TAP card is required either way for Foothill-to-Foothill connections). The transfer is then loaded onto the TAP card and is good for up to two hours. The transfer on the TAP card can also be counted as base fare for any TAP enabled transit agency as well. Paper transfers may be requested for connections to agencies that do not use TAP. They can be counted as base fare for any transit agency to which Foothill Transit connects that accepts transfers. Commuter Express fares apply to Lines 493, 497, 498, 499, and 699. Metrolink Tickets are not accepted; only the",
