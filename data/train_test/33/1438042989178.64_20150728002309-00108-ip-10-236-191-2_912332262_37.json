            "Well, you can get in campus pretty easily if you have something that somewhat resembles an ID. :P But I'd say the campus is very safe. I've left all my possessions out multiple times and nothing was ever stolen.",
            "They aren't well advertised, but there are plenty! There's Streetlight, SALT, Spanish Club, Way in the Wilderness, and many more. You just have to ask around and take the initiative.",
            "People who are following God. Business majors. Vocal majors. People who want to stay in ministry their wholes lives.",
            "Couples paint the rock when they get engaged.",
            "It's expensive. It's not the most well-known Christian school, but it's perfect for some people. God will provide if this is where He wants you.",
            "Hall events, Coffee shops, Talent shows, Ministries (Do them!!), Enjoy the lake, Go to Target (haha)",
            "The food is really, really good. There's usually a lot of variety, and there are always the basics (pizza, burgers, salads, soups, subs) if you can't find anything else.",
            "It all depends on your hall. The dorms are exceptionally nice. The main dorms have kitchens and bathrooms in each dorm room, which is really great. I feel like hall and dorm activities aren't as well attended as they should be, but that doesn't necessarily stop you from making friends and having good times. Get to know your RA and MP's and attend events!",
            "Coming graduating in the top of my class from a very rigorous, private Christian school, I was not challenged much by my classes. I had barely any work and it was not as demanding or thought-provoking as in high school. However, most of the people around me seemed challenged and like they were learning a lot (so it may just be me). Try the Honors program if you have a similar academic profile as mine.",
            "Ask LOTS of questions. Make sure you know what you're getting into. You don't want to regret your decision, so pray and ask for God's will to be done. No worries, though, because God is greater :)",
            "Northwestern is small school that tries to focus on glorifying the Lord. The people are generally caring and helpful. The academics are sufficient."

Wausau, WI 10/12/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 6 out of 6 people found this review useful. 3 of 53 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Ready to be challenged Committed to Jesus Education majors : ) Tips for prospective students I would urge prospective students to come visit NWC! It really has a culture of its own and is not like other schools. Also, it is a place where your faith in Jesus has the opportunity to stretch and grow, so if you are considering coming here, be committed to your faith. Overall, NWC is a great place to grow academically, spiritually, socially, emotionally, and vocationally. I love it here! Bang for the buck While NWC is an expensive school, I feel like it will be worth the money in the long run. As an education major, I will come out of NWC with a major and two minors (Spanish and Bible) in four years. That does not happen at other schools! I know that education majors get so",
