    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{60148=3/6/14: Give the Avs a lot of credit this season. It was just 12 months ago that the Avs were among the worst teams in the NHL and even had the first overall pick in the draft last June. Now they are among the best teams in the league, so a lot of credit has to go to GM Joe Sakic and head coach Patrick Roy. Colorado is in third place in the Central Division, with a 10 point lead over Minnesota. With about 20 games left, they are almost assured of an automatic playoff spot. They can even move up. They trail both Chicago and St. Louis by just three points, so there still is plenty of time to improve their playoff position., 75291=8/28/14: Give Avalanche President of Hockey Operations Joe Sakic credit - he has almost all of his roster business finished already, and there is still some time before training camps open. The Avs have only one remaining restricted free agent to take care of and that is defenseman Tyson Barrie. Barrie had a great season in 2013-14. He scored 13 goals and 38 points in 64 games. And he is only 23 years old. Sakic is confident that a deal will get done soon, and they figure Barrie will have an even bigger role this coming season., 71139=7/10/14: After a year and a half, Jerome Iginla is back in the Western Conference. The Avs signed the future Hall-of-Famers to a three year deal worth $16 million. Iginla may be 37 now, but he can still score - he led the Boston Bruins in goals with 30 last season. Iginla made the Stanley Cup Finals in 2004 with the Calgary Flames, but is still searching for his first Cup win. The Bruins wanted him back, but could not afford him. He is expected to fill some of the void created when Paul Statsny left the Avalanche in free agency for Central Division rival St. Louis., 74127=8/14/14: The Avalanche enjoyed easily the best rebound campaign of any NHL team last season. While they were considered among the dregs of the league in 2012-2013, they vaulted to an impressive 52-22-8 record last season - good enough to win the hyper-competitive Central Division in the Western Conference (ahead of both the St. Louis Blues and Chicago Blackhawks). They return most of their core players and should be just as competitive again. Actually, they may be much better because captain Gabrial Landeskog and second year sniper Nathan McKinnon each have another year of experience under their belts., 61317=3/20/14: There is good news and bad news for the Avs. The good news is that they have won eight of their past 11 games and have moved into second place in the Central Division. Actually, capturing the division title from St. Louis is not that far-fetched. The bad news is that both Paul Statsny and P.A. Parenteau are out with injury so how long is this hot streak sustainable? But this is certainly a different team than a year ago, and no one is playing out the string and making vacation plans in May this time around., 85812=2/11/15: Whether it is true or just a perception, there is a thought that even star players need to drop the gloves every now and then. The Colorado Avalanche's Nathan MacKinnon joined the ranks of those who have fought in the NHL when he squared off against Jonathan Ericsson of the Detroit Red Wing last week. It was the first fight for the number one draft pick in 2013, and he was out of his weight class. Colorado is scrambling to overcome their terrible start to the season and needs every point they can get - and not for MacKinnon to get hurt in a fight. The Avs are still four points out of a playoff spot, but luckily there is still time in the season., 82701=1/7/15: As one would expect from a last place team, the Colorado Avalanche have had a tough time keeping the puck out of their net. Through the end of the 2014 calendar year, they had allowed 112 goals. Only Dallas, at 118 goals against, has allowed more. To compare, the Nashville Predators lead the division with 78 goals against. Allowing three goals per game is a recipe for losses. The good news is that Semyon Varlamov is back from injury, and he has shown that he is a top goaltender. Calvin Pickard played well in his absence, but was sent back to the AHL so he could play on a regular basis., 63883=4/17/14: It has been quite a while since a goalie was given the Hart Trophy by the NHL for the most valuable player. In fact, it has not happened in a dozen years when Jose Theodore won it when he was with the Montreal Canadiens in 2002. That alone seems odd as the goalie is the only player on the ice the entire game. Regardless, Avs goaltender Semyon Varlamov is garnering some attention for the award this season. The Avs have ridden his strong play all season, and may end up winning the NHL's Central Division. The Penguins' Sidney Crosby is probably the favorite, but at least Varlamov is in the conversation., 84530=1/28/15: The Colorado Avalanche are getting back to par after a terribly rough start to the NHL season. The reigning Central Division champs have been moving up the standings and now sit in fifth place in the division, having passed Dallas and Minnesota just before the All Star break. They are only three points out of a playoff spot now and have a good chance to return to the postseason. In other news, the NHL announced that the Avalanche will host former rival Detroit Red Wings in a Stadium Series outdoor game next season. The game will be at Coors Field on February 27, 2016., 69330=6/19/14: The Avs, like many other teams, want to host an outdoor game. They will likely get their chance one day, but it will not be in the 2014-15 season. The Avs really want to host the Winter Classic, which is the premier outdoor game. The others are part of the Coors Stadium Series. The Winter Classic will be in Washington next season. But there is a very good chance that they could get the game in 2016. A great matchup would be against the Detroit Red Wings, whom the Avs had a strong rivalry with several years ago and are sure to draw a big TV crowd., 76474=9/24/14: It seems kind of hard to believe, but the Colorado Avalanche had attendance last season that was among the lowest in the league. Granted, they were coming off of a dismal 2012-13 campaign, but clearly established themselves in the elite of the Western Conference throughout the year. GM Joe Sakic is not worried about that. He has the green light to spend and win the Stanley Cup. The team did acquire Jerome Iginla in the offseason and has a developing Nathan McKinnon, and are a good bet to make the playoffs again, possibly winning the whole thing., 62584=4/3/14: Get your playoff tickets, Avs fans! The Colorado Avalanche clinched their first playoff birth since 2010 over weekend by beating the red-hot San Jose Sharks. The Avs got off to a hot start, which many people thought may be an anomaly. But the team has held it together under first year head coach Patrick Roy. They may have a tough time catching the St. Louis Blues for the top spot in the Central Division, but could beat out the Chicago Blackhawks for second place. Considering the remarkable turnaround (the Avs were among the worst teams in the league last season), Roy has to be considered for Coach of the Year., 47621=10/24/13: Not many people outside of Avs head coach Patrick Roy saw the team's ultra hot start coming. Colorado was easily the worst team in the Western Conference last year and among the worst in the league - they even had the number one pick thanks to their futility in the 2013 shortened season. That is all in the past now. The Avs are 6-1, finally losing in their seventh game (to long-time rival Detroit). Though the season is still very young, they may be the best team in the league at this moment. Roy has instilled confidence and pride in this team, and that should be expected to continue. Consider them a playoff contender until further notice., 86395=2/18/15: After last season's improbable run to the top of the Central Division, it is sad to see the Colorado Avalanche struggling so much this season. Many expected a regression this season, but no one expected them to fall so far behind. Their standing will probably make the Avs sellers at the trade deadline this season. They have a few pending unrestricted free agents that are not likely to return next year, such as defenseman Jan Hejda and forward Danny Briere, so picking up a prospect or draft pick now would be better than letting them walk for nothing., 52726=12/19/13: The Avalanche are getting a bit of better news out of the Alex Tanguay hip injury. The original diagnosis was very harsh, but things seem to be getting better. Tanguay suffered the injury while rehabbing a knee injury - possibly by overcompensating for the knee soreness. That knee injury came on November 2nd, so this is a relatively new injury. Tanguay is 34 years old, so these type of injuries can be tough to deal with. The Avs have clawed their way back into the top three in the Central Division, behind Chicago and St. Louis - though they still need to fend off Winnipeg for a few more months., 57632=2/6/14: The Avs won a game they probably should not have against the Devils last week, but that is what good teams have to do. Head coach Patrick Roy was facing a 1-0 deficit and pulled the goalie with a full 2:30 left to go. The Avs scored to force overtime, then won quickly with a PA Parenteau goal. The Avs remain hot with their fourth consecutive win and 13th in their last 17 games. If this keeps up, then there will be an epic finish to the regular season in the Central Division, as both Chicago and St. Louis are also in the mix.}",
