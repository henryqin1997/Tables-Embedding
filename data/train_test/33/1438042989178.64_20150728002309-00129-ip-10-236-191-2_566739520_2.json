New York: Basic Books, 1958., 20152=The perspective of reviewers was inferred from their association with a journal which has been very energetic in advocating the refinement and expansion of applied behavioristic psychology-the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis . Seventy-five referees were selected from the journal's list of guest reviewers for 1974. After random assignment to groups, they were invited to referee a brief research article purportedly submitted for publication in a compendium volume on \"Current Issues in Behavior Modification.\" In those groups where manuscript components were absent, referees were told that these parts were in preparation and, due to a tight deadline, would be evaluated separately by the editor when they were received. Referees given partial manuscripts were asked to evaluate the merits of the article in its inchoate state. All reviewers were asked to use the evaluation criteria explicitly outlined by the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis., 55894=Deci, E. L. Intrinsic motivation, extrinsic reinforcement, and inequity. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , 1972, 22, 113-130., 52672=Confirmatory bias is not, of course, the only potential source of prejudice in peer review. A recent experimental study has, for example, shown that citing your own ''in press'' publications may significantly enhance your chances of earning a reviewer's approval (Mahoney, Kazdin, & Kenigsberg, 1975). The ironic feature of confirmatory bias is the fact that it is fundamentally illogical. Positive-result and negative-result experiments are not equivalent in their logical implications. In fact, while they have unquestionable bearing on the subjective aspects of belief, successful experiments have no necessary logical bearing on the truth status of their source (i.e., a theory or hypothesis). As counterintuitive as this may seem, it is a clear consequence of logical analysis (cf. Popper, 1972; Weimer, 1977; Mahoney, 1976). It is only negative-result (contrary-to-prediction) experiments that carry logical implications. The reasons for this are simple and are outlined in the above-mentioned sources. Despite this clear mandate from logic, however, our research programs and publications policies continue in their dogmatically confirmatory tradition. They offer ample testimony to Bacon's (1621/1960) astute observation that \"the human intellect . . . is more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives., 54976=Adams, J. A. Human memory .

New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1967., 21152=The manuscript employed was a brief report of a study examining the effects of extrinsic reinforcement on intrinsic interest. This topic has recently become very controversial in psychology (Deci, 1971, 1972; Lepper, Greene, & Nisbett, 1973; Levine & Fasnacht, 1974). A group of psychologists has argued that the popular behavioristic strategy of reinforcement may have serious negative side effects. According to their argument, rewarding an individual for some behavior may sometimes cause him to devalue its intrinsic merits and thereby undermine his interest in it after reinforcement incentives have been terminated. Thus, the currently popular practice of rewarding a child for classroom performances may lead to a devaluation of academic tasks. Behaviorists have responded to these allegations with energetic and almost uniform denial, arguing that reward often enhances rather than undermines intrinsic interest., 8692=Cognitive Therapy and Research, Vol. 1, No. 2, 1977, PP. 161-1 75, 57008=1974., 56346=Lakatos, t., & Musgrave, A.

Social theory and social structure . New York: Free Press, 1968., 56242=Kintsch, W. Learning, memory, and conceptual processes . New York: Wiley, 1970., 11583=The tragic effects of confirmatory bias are not, however, restricted to clinical disorders. In fact, as has been argued elsewhere (Mahoney, 1976), the most costly expression of this tendency may well be among scientists themselves. To the extent that researchers display this bias, our adequate understanding of the processes and parameters of human adaptation may be seriously jeopardized. If we selectively \"find\" or communicate only those data that support a given model of behavior, then our inquiry efforts will hardly be optimally effective. Despite the fact that confirmatory bias in scientists was first noted by Francis Bacon (1621/1960) over three centuries ago, precious little research has been devoted to the topic and the few extant studies have hardly challenged Bacon's observations. One study found that the vast majority of scientists drawn from a national sample showed a strong preference for \"confirmatory\" experiments (Mahoney & Kimper, 1976). Over half of these scientists did not even recognize disconfirmation ( modus tollens ) as a valid reasoning form! In another study the logical reasoning skills of 30 scientists were compared to those of 15 relatively uneducated Protestant ministers (Mahoney & DeMonbreun, 1977). Where there were performance differences, they tended to favor the ministers. Confirmatory bias was prevalent in both groups, but the ministers used disconfirmatory logic almost twice as often as the scientists did., 58554=Zuckerman, H. Stratification in American science.

    "textBeforeTable": "Referees showed relatively modest agreement with one another in their component ratings and summary recommendations. On topic relevance, average interrater agreement across all five groups was a meager -.07 (intraclass correlation coefficient (a)). Likewise, their evaluations of methodology showed little consensus (a .03). Ratings of data presentation, scientific contribution, and summary recommendation showed somewhat higher inter-referee agreement, but were again modest (all 3 a = .30). In the last two groups, evaluations of the discussion section showed little consensus (a = .01). A post-experiment questionnaire asked referees to predict their degree of reliability with other reviewers on the various items. Their average predictions-contrasted with the obtained values-were as follows: Although direction of influence cannot be identified, correlations among the major dependent variables revealed some interesting relationships. Referees who read positive or negative-result manuscripts showed a marked covariation between their methodology ratings and summary recommendations (r = .94). Evaluations of the data section were also positively correlated with recommendations (r = .56) and, most interestingly, referees' data ratings were apparently related to their methodology ratings (r = .60). Taken together, these correlations suggest the possibility of a \"halo effect\" in which manuscript components share a common valence rather than being rated independently. An unplanned dependent variable was made possible by an overlooked typographical error in the experimental manuscript. Although the method section stated that subjects had been randomly divided into triads, it mistakenly contended that a total of eight subjects were employed. Since eight is not evenly divisible by",
    "textAfterTable": "The difference between self-predicted and obtained reliabilities is striking. In addition to their standard rating form, referees were invited to submit comments and suggestions for the author. It should be noted that many of the reviewers spent considerable time and effort in executing their task. Several sent relevant bibliographies for the hypothetical author's use, two forwarded related reprints and thesis abstracts, and one referee submitted a hand-calculated analysis of variance on the fabricated data. Moreover, their reviews were frequently constructive-even when critical-and most reflected considerable examination. They were often several pages in length, with one almost 2,000 words long. Representative referee comments are presented in Table III. Several patterns are apparent. First, wide variability was again encountered both within and between groups. Looking only at the comments, one would hardly think that very similar or even identical manuscripts were being evaluated. A second pattern was the frequent feelings of awkwardness reported by referees who received incomplete manuscripts. They often complained about the handicap of missing components and qualified their remarks by such phrases as \"assuming that the Discussion is reasonable.\" Finally, the emphasis placed on data content is again reflected in referee comments. Ambiguous data are explicitly devalued as lacking scientific contribution. Table III. Representative Referee Comments Group Referee Comments (1) Positive results \"A very fine",
