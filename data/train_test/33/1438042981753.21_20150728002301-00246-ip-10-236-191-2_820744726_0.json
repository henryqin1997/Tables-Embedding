The speech topics ranged the gamut for 4th and 5th graders at Williston Elementary School at the recent\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4-H/Tropicana Speech Contest. Fifth grade teacher Carol Glass sent the speech information to all the 4th and 5th grade teachers, who coached their students. The students were responsible for writing their own speeches. \u00a0Next, each class held a speech contest to determine who would go to the grade-level contest; classroom teachers used the rubric provided for the contest. Each class sent a certain number of contestants to the competition. Speech chairman Glass recruited judges for the grade-level contests. Next, the 4th grade winners \u2013 Hailey Fugate, Annie Hopping and Kami McCormick \u2013 joined the 5th grade winners \u2013 Torie Hill, Ashleigh Sisti, Katie Taylor and Lexi Zapata \u2013 in front of an all-new panel of judges. The results? Placing third was Kami with her speech about the BP oil spill. Fifth grader Lexi placed second with her speech about her \u201cfurry family,\u201d a menagerie of pets. With her speech entitled \u201cFaith,\u201d 5th grader Katie Taylor brought home the gold. Traditionally, the GFWC Williston Woman\u2019s Club honors the winners with monetary awards. The next step for Katie was the county-level contest on Dec. 2, where she placed second in the elementary level competition. \u00a0, 38581=Copyright \u00a9 2015}",
