            "The Cerebrum enemy from Mother 1. Another one of my favorite pieces, mostly because it's so close to what was in my mind before my digital pen touched my Wacom tablet. Maybe it's just my neuropsychology background at work, but I thought that the Cerebrum to be one of the cooler, more fitting of the \"campy\" enemy ideas in EB0. I mean, he's a brain, on a glass-domed platter with legs sticking out the bottom! How awesome is that! The legs on the original didn't look quite so human, so I decided to have them look human-ish, but not quite.",
            "Having made my first Shambler attempt look more shaggy than wooly (see?), I messed around a bit with it for a quick, filtered fix. Well, even though I got better results than I expected with a \"fur\" filter, I thought he looked \"fluffy\" more than anything, like he'd just been put into a clothes dryer and came out all cozy and warm. :) A fun experiment though!",
            "A skateboarding Shark, just hangin' out. Somehow, I picture him standing at the top of a halfpipe, second away from hopping on his board and skating it.",
            "A Wooly Shambler (actually my first attempt at a Wooly Shambler -- My Wild N Wooly Shambler was actually drawn after this one, and turned out looking a lot woolier. See: here). With this one, I really tried to preserve the pink and straw colour scheme that the original sprite had, and tried to do so by using a pink light source. And since I love drawing glowing eyes, I like how those turned out, too. Even though it's not got the \"wooly\" look, I think that the shaggy fur and slimish body looked pretty cool together.",
