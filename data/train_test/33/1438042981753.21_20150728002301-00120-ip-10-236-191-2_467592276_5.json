The encoded protein binds to a region of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein that is frequently mutated in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an X-linked recessive disorder. Impairment of the interaction between these two proteins may contribute to the disease. Two transcript variants encoding the same protein have been identified for this gene.
