    "textBeforeTable": "Vancouver Whitecaps FC announced today the signings of midfielder Vicente Arze and striker Andrew Wheeler, pending international clearance. Arze and Wheeler have both agreed to one-year contracts, plus an option. Arze, 22, joins the Whitecaps after four years at NCAA Division I school Mercer University in Macon, Georgia. The five-foot-ten, 170-pound, midfielder finished his university career ranked seventh all-time with 21 career goals, second all-time with 19 assists and tied for sixth with 61 points in 68 career matches with the Bears. He has also earned two first-team and two second-team all-conference honours. Arze, who was the All-Atlantic Sun Freshman-of-the-Year in 2004, is scheduled to graduate this May with a business degree in marketing. The native of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, played youth soccer for Bolivia\u2019s Club Blooming before transferring to Argentina\u2019s highly acclaimed Club Atl\u00e9tico Newell's Old Boys in 2000. During his time with Newell, he represented his native country at the FIFA U-20 World Cup qualifying tournament in 2003. gigya.socialize.showShareBarUI(showShareBarUI_params); }; deviceType: 'auto' onShareButtonClicked: OnShareButtonClickedHandler, userAction: userAction, showCounts: 'none', shareButtons: [{provider: 'facebook', tooltip: 'Like this on Facebook', action: 'like', font: 'arial', iconImgUp:'http://www.whitecapsfc.com/sites/all/themes/mp7/images/share_facebook.png', iconOnly: true },{provider: 'twitter', defaultText: 'Whitecaps sign Arze and Wheeler ', tooltip: 'Share on twitter', related:'', iconImgUp:'http://www.whitecapsfc.com/sites/all/themes/mp7/images/share_twitter.png', iconOnly: true },{provider: 'googleplus', tooltip: '+1 on Google+', iconImgUp:'http://www.whitecapsfc.com/sites/all/themes/mp7/images/share_googleplus.png', iconOnly: true },{provider: 'Reddit', tooltip: 'Share this on Reddit', iconImgUp:'http://www.whitecapsfc.com/sites/all/themes/mp7/images/share_reddit.png', iconOnly: true },{provider: 'email', tooltip: 'Email this', iconImgUp:'http://www.whitecapsfc.com/sites/all/themes/mp7/images/share_email.png',",
    "textAfterTable": "Wheeler, 21, arrives in Vancouver after attending NCAA Division III school York College of Pennsylvania since 2005. The six-foot-three, 185-pound striker was a potent offensive force for the Spartans, leaving the program ranked second all-time in goals with 45, and points with 116. He is also third in career assists with 26. Wheeler was twice named to the All-Capital Athletic Conference (CAC) first team and last year he was named the CAC Player-of-the-Year. Last summer, the native of Baltimore, Maryland, played for the Hampton Road Piranhas of the United Soccer Leagues Premier Development League (PDL). In 16 regular season games with the Piranhas, Wheeler tallied 14 goals, including seven game winners, and added five assists. For his efforts, Wheeler was named to the PDL All-Conference team and was a finalist for league MVP honours. Wheeler\u2019s Piranhas finished the season undefeated with the league\u2019s best record of 14 wins and two draws. YEAR TEAM LEAGUE GP GS MIN G A PTS GW SH SG F C E",
