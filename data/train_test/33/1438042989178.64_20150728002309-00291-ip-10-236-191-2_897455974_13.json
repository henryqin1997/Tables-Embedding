            "Berkeley College is very secure. The security guards are always there and you must have an ID in order to access the campus buildings. There aren't any random people floating around it's really like being surrounded by family. Especially at the Brooklyn, NY campus",
            "There are honor societies here and at least one for respected fields of majors. As for regular Greek Clubs I haven't participated as of yet, so I can't comment on that.",
            "Student Government and Campus Life really make Berkeley students feel at home. In the SAC there are always information and gatherings. They really cater to our needs whether it be movies and popcorn or just discussions.",
            "Overall any type of student can attend but if you've completed an associates or have transfer credits. Berkeley College is great with awarding assistance for just about any situation. Also they are great with applying your credits to your degree so you don't repeat courses. I love the quarter system because we get four sessions per year spring/summer/fall/winter and though we give up down time. We finish first and without using up to much financial aid credits.",
            "Berkeley College offers tuition freeze meaning whatever you start with is what you will maintain. They even give you one quarter to be off after completely two quarters. So in case you need a break after two quarters you can and come back to the same tuition. Also they allow up to 12- 16 credits to be considered full time without increase. So if you're a transfer student like myself you can get in and get out!",
            "I participate in student life and activities. There is always something to do on campus and plenty of things going on during the day that you drop in on. There are even online clubs and discussion boards for the people who can't physically be on site.",
            "There are always food vending machines and the campuses are located in the best spots around NYC. I have plenty of restaurants, food carts and fast foods around to chose from. Some of them even offer discounts to the students. Its great!",
            "I live off campus so no comment. I have heard that the dorms in New Jersery and Westchester are really nice.",
            "The course work isn't boring at all its all challenging. I have friends in different majors and we all agree that the coursework is very well balanced since we attend schools by quarter rather than semester. You will work but you will graduate faster.",
            "Apply for financial aid early and work closely with your financial aid counselor. Berkeley College has their own grants they will award you in addition to any Federal/State your eligible for; as long as you meet the requirements. Stay abreast of deadlines and you will have a smooth entry.",
            "Berkeley College is a great institution the campuses are easily accessed. The faculty are very knowledgeable professionals in their fields and are very involved with your educational goals. Berkeley College career counselors are very proactive in helping you find a career during school and after you graduate."

It's great for those who would like the feel of a small city with the option of easily traveling to the Big City at any given moment. There are a lot of employment opportunities in the area so if you are a student looking to work during your college years, Berkeley is a good choice. Tips for prospective students Visit the school first and see how you feel. It is not a typical college campus because the city of White Plains IS the campus. Be prepared to make a few trips to the school prior to the start of term because there are a lot of things that get left to the last minute or come up after you think you have covered all of your bases. Berkeley has a lot to offer if you seek it out so do not be shy and get to know the faculty, they will",
