Nearly everything closes at 3:00 on Fridays, so students better eat early or take lunch for themselves., 485284=UTEP is #1 in student affordability with an average semester cost of less than $2500. It is much more than worth the cost., 446017=Theres an engineering march that goes around but i honestly havent experienced anything unusual...yet., 563631=My tuition was about $2250, which is pretty decent considering I'm an engineering major., 451832=UTEP is known for its engineering program. There is a tradition for engineering students that is near St Patrick's day in which students learn about the history of the university and do chants and walk all over campus. At the end they paint the letter M on the mountains which is for college of mine. UTEP was originally a mining school back in 1914., 5642=UTEP isn't incredibly expensive. I haven't had a problem covering the expenses. I had a grant for 1000 and a loan, and I was covered. The Food Courts are expensive to me, though. I prefer eating out of campus. There's some cool restaurants around UTEP., 247895=The city of El Paso was rated the safest city in the United States in 2010, making this one of the safest Universities in the country.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students It's great for anyone, really. It's a well rounded college that will satisfy the needs of your specific character. The classes are good learning-wise. It depends on your major. The Engineering program is supposed to be one of the best, and the Music Program (from my perspective) is pretty good. The Music Department is growing more and more. Just search up your major, and see if UTEP has the best to offer for it. :) Tips for prospective students Have fun, and enjoy it. UTEP is great for learning, and connecting to those around you. Bang for the buck UTEP isn't incredibly expensive. I haven't had a problem covering the expenses. I had a grant for 1000 and a loan, and I was covered. The Food Courts are expensive to me, though. I prefer eating out of campus. There's some cool restaurants around UTEP. Am enjoying being here Campus life is packed with activities. There are many clubs and events to go to, so it's hard to be bored. Since the community of students isn't that huge, you will be able to meet and connect to many people. I'm a music major, and I've",
