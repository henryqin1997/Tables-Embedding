The mechanical shoe provides additional functions without greatly increasing the space on the casino table top used by a conventional, simple dealing shoe. The detailed construction of an exemplary mechanized shoe can be found in co-pending applications Ser. No. 10/622,321, filed Jul. 17, 2003, in application Ser. No. 10/915,914 and application Ser.

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{53393=In addition to the numerous advances in data acquisition and card handling for table games, there are a number of prior art patents that illustrate various methods of extracting gaming related data from images captured with a video camera. For example, Fishbine U.S. Pat. No. 5,781,647 describes a method of collecting images of a stack of chips on a gaming table, and Lindquist U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,781,647 and 6,532,297 describe techniques for extracting chip number and value information from video images of chip stacks. Similarly, there exists commercially available \u201cmachine vision\u201d software that has been used in the past to extract data from digital image files. This technique is described for use in a card-reading device within a card shuffler, in commonly assigned co-pending application Ser. No. 10/954,029, filed Sep. 29, 2004 entitled Multiple Mode Card Shuffler and Card Reading Device (the content hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety) that can be purchased an adapted to extract rank and suit data from images of card faces captured with a video camera or other similar optical device capable of capturing two dimensional images., 52286=A number of techniques are known for processing data from an imager. Published U.S. Patent Application No. 20010036231 (Easkar) discloses an in-camera two-stage data compression process that reduces the latency between snapshots to a fraction of that otherwise required by other systems. Other known systems either process complete compression following each snapshot or incorporate heavy, bulky, and expensive RAM hardware capable of maintaining several raw luminosity records (unprocessed file containing a digital image). In the first stage compression, the raw luminosity record is quickly, yet partially, compressed to available RAM buffer space to allow a user to expeditiously capture a succeeding image. When the higher-priority processes, the user shooting pictures, and stage one compression subside, a second stage compression, which is slower but more effective, decompresses the earlier partially-compressed images, and re-compresses them for saving in flash memory until they are distributed to a remote platform to be finally converted to the JPEG2000 format., 29567=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/915,914, filed Aug. 10, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,264,241, which is a continuation-in-part application of both U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/622,321, filed Jul. 17, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,029,009 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/880,408, filed Jun. 28, 2004., 80629=Upon initial triggering of the spaced scan line sensor, the scanning may continue on a timed, measured distance or sensed distance (e.g., distance or speed of movement of the card, degree of variation in the signal from the line sensor, etc.) basis. To compensate for any motion of the card taking place during a scan, a fast scan time is used such as 1/1000 of a second or less. In the preferred and most simplified system, the card scanning system is incorporated into a card reading shoe, and all cards are drawn by dealer manually, so the speed of each drawn card varies with every scan, and the cards are being scanned while they are being withdrawn from the shoe. A position sensing device would therefore be more appropriate, rather than a timed sensor., 42285=WO 00/51076 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,629,894 (DOLPHIN ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES PTY. LTD.) disclose a card inspection device that includes a first loading area adapted to receive one or more decks of playing cards. A drive roller is located adjacent the loading area and positioned to impinge on a card if a card were present in the loading area. The loading area has an exit through which cards are urged, one at a time, by a feed roller. A transport path extends from the loading area exit to a card accumulation area. The transport path is further defined by two pairs of transport rollers, one roller of each pair above the transport path and one roller of each pair below the transport path. A camera is located between the two pairs of transport rollers, and a processor governs the operation of a digital camera and the rollers. A printer produces a record of the device's operation based on an output of the processor, and a portion of the transport path is illuminated by one or more blue LED's.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations These latter systems, unless they are completely electronic without any physical implementation (such as physical playing cards, dice, spinning wheel, drop ball, etc.) will need sensing and/or reading equipment (e.g., card reading for suits and/or rank, bet reading sensors, ball position sensors, dice reading sensors, player card readers, dealer input sensors, player input systems, and the like). These would be the peripherals in the table systems. Also, newer capabilities are enabled such as moisture detection (e.g., for spilled drinks), smoke detection, infrared ink detection (to avoid card marking), shuffler operation, dealer shoe operation, discard rack operation, jackpot meters, side bet detectors, and the like. Particularly in games where batch shuffling is used, such as poker or even single deck blackjack, the signal could also be originated by cards being placed in a shuffler and a shuffling process initiated, the shuffler sending a start-shuffling signal to the date stamping component on the table. The dealer could even activate or press a button provided on the table, but this would tend to leave the results under the control of the dealer, who could manipulate the game to improve results, or who could suffer from forgetfulness. A sensor can be placed on the table over which the dealer's cards are placed. It is preferred that this sensor not be as movement limiting as the sensor described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,803,808, where cards appear to have",
