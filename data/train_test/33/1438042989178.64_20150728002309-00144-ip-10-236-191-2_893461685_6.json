    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38738=12/19/13: There is no way to deny that 2013 was a disappointing season for the Nationals. They had the most wins in 2012 and easily won the NL East. Last season, they got off to a slow start and had to learn to battle through adversity. That may have been a painful lesson to learn - one they seem to start learning at the end of the season with a late push. But that may serve them well in 2014. They have a growing rivalry with the Braves, and those two teams are considered to be the best in the division. By learning about losing, they may be ready to win., 34479=2/6/14: The Nationals may be getting into the professional hockey business soon. Actually, it would be the city of Washington DC, as the rumors are flowing that that Nationals Park will be the site of the NHL's Winter Classic next year. The Winter Classic is the annual outdoor hockey game staged on January 1. This year (Jan 1, 2014), it was staged at Michigan Stadium at the University of Michigan - better known as \"The Big House\". All indications point to the 2015 game being played at the home of the Nationals (though, it could go to another local venue)., 60736=3/21/13: Great news for Washington Nationals fans who have been pining for baseball to return since the St. Louis Cardinals eliminated the team in National League Divisional Series last October. Bryce Harper is in mid season form. He is hitting .400 in spring training (20 for 40) with 12 RBIs. He had four RBIs today against the Miami Marlins, then promptly left the building. Literally. Harper and Jason Werth got in a private car and went back to the Nationals complex in Vero Beach. Yep, they are ready for the regular season and defend their NL East crown., 67862=Adam LaRoche has been a surprise contributor so far this season for the surprising NL East-leading Washington Nationals. LaRoche has already appeared in more games for the Nationals this year (50) than he did all of last season (43). LaRoche's 39 RBIs are enough for fifth in the National League and his 29 walks are sixth best. Along with RBIs, LaRoche also leads the team in home runs (9) and OPS (.861). LaRoche is currently fifth in voting for National League first basmen for the 2012 MLB All-Star Game according to the first numbers that have been revealed by MLB., 29386=4/3/14: The Nationals are not going to get caught unprepared this season. They had a dominant 2012 season and made it to the NLDS before losing to St. Louis. Last year, they did not play with much urgency until late in the season and never could catch the Atlanta Braves, and therefore, missed the playoffs. They are ready this year and the bats are already at work. The Nats beat the New York Mets on Opening Day, 9-7. Bryce Harper took a leg to the head and was shaken up, but never left the game. That is good, because the Nats need him to produce this season and be a leader on the team., 43708=10/24/13: Word leaked out last week that former Reds, Giants and Cubs manager Dusty Baker contacted the Washington Nationals about their managerial opening. Baker was most recently with the Reds where he had several good seasons (including 2012 where they won the NL Central by 9.5 games), but could never advance in the playoffs. Apparently the Nats are not interested in Baker and the rumor is that they are searching for a 'non-veteran' manager. That may make sense because they have so much youth on their roster, though they probably could benefit from somebody who can instill a sense of urgency in the team., 68450=Despite being towards the bottom of the league in runs and batting average, the Washington Nationals still find themselves at 29-21 and in first place in the NL East going into June. Beginning on Friday night, the Nationals will open up a weekend series with the division-rival Atlanta Braves and will put 5-1 Stephen Strasburg on the mound. Even with Strasburg's strong start though, the real surprise in the Nationals' rotation thus far has been Gio Gonzalez who has posted a 7-1 record and a stingy 2.04 ERA and has helped Washington to this strong start., 61982=9/20/12 ? Ross Detwiler threw six strong innings to send the Washington Nationals to the playoffs for their first postseason berth since moving from Montreal. For the city of Washington it will be their first chance to watch postseason baseball since 1933. With 30,359 fans on their feet, Drew Storen struck out Los Angeles infielder Hanley Ramirez to end the game. Detwiler struck out five and allowed one earned run and Nationals third baseman Ryan Zimmerman had an RBI double and scored on a wild pitch in the 4-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Nationals will have at least one of the two wild card spots in the National League. Washington?s magic number to win the NL East is now eight., 29995=3/27/14: It is unfortunate how this played out, but the Washington Nationals should be considered the prohibitive favorites in the NL East this season. In 2013, the Atlanta Braves stormed out to an early lead in the division and never looked back. The Nats were lackluster throughout the season, even though they probably had more talent on the roster. Washington made a strong play at the end of the season to get back to the playoffs, but it was too little, too late. However, with the major injuries to the Braves' pitching, the Nats are looking like the team to beat. They will utilize Stephen Strasburg as their opening day starter., 38180=12/26/13: The Nationals cannot win the World Series in the offseason, but they have used the time off to upgrade team and to try to win back the NL East from the Atlanta Braves. Washington said goodbye to fourth starter Dan Haren and brought in Doug Fister. The Nats also managed to add outfielder Nate McLouth and lefty reliever Jerry Blevins for next to nothing. If these guys can simply live up to expectations (and the Nats do not play themselves out of contention early in the season), then this could be your NL East champion in 2014., 69943=This might be the best month in sports. March certainly has a case, thanks to March Madness, the NBA and the NHL. And don't forget June every four years, when the World Cup, Wimbledon and the NBA and NHL Finals come together for a Super Month. Still, October is special, thanks to major college football\u2026, 41767=11/14/13: The Nationals acquired Denard Span from the Twins last offseason as they wanted a new lead off hitter and everyday center fielder. However, it looks like that move may be short-lived as the Nats are apparently willing to trade Span after one year. Span had a strong second half and posted respectable numbers: .279/.327/.380 with four homers, 47 RBIs, and 20 stolen bases in 153 games. The Nationals may be gearing up to make an offer to free agent Jacoby Ellsbury. Span has one year left on his contract for $6.5 million and a club option for 2015 for $9 million. Considering his second half, there may be a market for him., 32529=2/27/14: The Nationals have quite a roster, one that is capable of winning the World Series. Stars such as ace Steven Strasburg and Bryce Harper get most of the press, but there is a deep list of talent aside from them. Starting pitcher Jordan Zimmerman is among them. He ranks sixth in ERA for pitchers with at least 400 innings since 2011. He recently signed a two year extension with the Nats to avoid arbitration and focus on playing. For his part, he is not concerned about signing a big long-term contract, and figures that will work itself out in time. Good to see a ball player using common sense to keep developing and let the big numbers take care of themselves., 65426=The surging Washington Nationals now own the best record in the majors, after Thursday night's 8-2 win over the Milwaukee Brewers. Edwin Jackson threw 7 scoreless innings for the Nationals as they improved to 59-39, tied with the New York Yankees for the best mark in the league. Their record marks the first time in 79 years that a Washington-based team is at least 20 games over .500. The last time came in 1933 when the Washington Senators finished the regular season with a record of 99-53 and lost to the New York Giants in the World Series., 31912=3/6/14: With spring training well underway and the start of the 2014 MLB season just a few weeks out, it is time again for baseball card sets to be sent out. Normally, these cards are fairly routine and monotonous, though there have been some interesting ones like the famous Billy Ripkin card with an expletive written on his bat. Topps has a different look for Jason Werth and he is not happy with it. It is a photo of him pointing, but other players Anthony Rendon and Ian Desmond are clearly visible on the card. That probably will not make it a sought after card, but did get Werth's attention., 24403=5/29/14: There is an interesting article making the rounds about how the Nationals' Jayson Werth has been unlucky since signing a big deal with the Nats in 2009. The article points to Werth's hitting, which has always been good. This season he is hitting .277 - quite respectable. The article then makes the case that he has been robbed of home runs by big parks and great catches on line drives. It is an interesting look at luck in baseball. At the same time, Werth has been on the receiving end of luck in his career, most notably getting that monster contract from the Nationals after one very good year and hitting the free agent market at the right time., 23791=6/6/14: A little good news for the Washington Nationals as they try to catch both the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins. Starting pitcher Gio Gonzalez had zero problems from a 35 pitch bullpen session. It is hoped that he will be cleared for a minor league rehab assignment as early as next week. Gio has been out of action since May 18 due to shoulder inflammation. If all goes according to plan, and that is still an 'if' and not a 'when', Gio would be on track for a mid-June return to the team. He was not great before the injury, but perhaps will be back to his old self when fully healthy., 37530=1/2/14: Next season, 2014, is a chance for the Nationals to redeem themselves. The franchise spent a few years developing prospects and getting high draft picks. They broke through in 2012 by winning not only the NL East but earning the most wins in the National League. They were upset in the playoffs by the Cardinals, but looked poised to establish themselves as an elite team for several years. The Nats underachieved and were complacent last season, but it looks like they have a new attitude. An attitude that could propel them back to the top of the division and one that should serve them well in their rivalry with Atlanta., 50893=8/1/13: Every week it seems to be the same story with the Nationals - what is wrong with this team. They have the best talent on paper and cruised through the 2012 season. Most experts expected the same thing this time around, but they find themselves three games under .500 and 8.5 games behind the division leading Atlanta Braves. Only pitcher Jordan Zimmerman has been as good as expected in the rotation, while the other stars have struggled. They have had significant injuries this year, but their position in the playoff chase is very unexpected at this point., 40562=11/28/13: Nationals fans are well aware of closer Drew Storen's late season turn-around. After August 16, he had an ERA of 1.40 and did not allow a single home run. Coincidentally, that coincided with the Nationals making a late run at a wild card spot (though they fell short to the Reds). Storen recently recounted meeting former Yankees' closer and future hall of famer Mariano Rivera and asked Mo for some professional advice. According to Storen, Rivera told him that he did not need Mo's famous cutter, but that he had enough in his own toolkit to be successful. Great advice from the best closer to ever play the game., 25081=5/22/14: Going into the season, the expectation was that the Nationals learned their lesson last season and have to play with more urgency in the current campaign. They have not let Atlanta run away with the NL East early, like in 2013, but still have to make up some ground. It seems like the biggest problem has been on defense. The Nats have made the second most errors in all of MLB with 35 already. At the same time, their bullpen has been excellent so far. Closer Rafael Soriano is 8 of 9 in save opportunities and the team has a collective 2.32 ERA., 61315=10/2/12 ? The Washington Nationals lost to the Philadelphia Phillies 2-0, but they were still celebrating in the locker room after the game. At the bottom of the ninth inning, in front of their home crowd, the game between Atlanta and the Pittsburgh Pirates flashed a 2-1 final score on the scoreboard in favor of the Pirates. This meant that the Washington Nationals are NL East Champions for the second time in franchise history. The last time they won the division crown was in 1981 as the Montreal Expos. Washington, in first place since May 22, awaits the winner of the Wild Card playoff game between the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals., 35069=1/30/14: Where does the time go? It seems like yesterday that Livan Hernandez was a rookie pitching lights out in the biggest baseball championship in world. That was well over a decade ago and Hernandez is now 39 years old. And, it is all but finalized that he will be at Nationals spring training. Not as a pitcher, but as an instructor. He last pitched professionally in 2012, both for the Braves and Brewers (out of the bull pen - and not effectively at all). However, he does have a lot of experience and could be an asset for the relatively young Nats rotation., 41205=11/21/13: The Nationals seem to want any left handed bullpen free agent available these days. The latest possible target is Oliver Perez. Perez was a starter who converted to the bullpen last year with the Mariners and was surprisingly effective. He was terrible in 2009 and 2010, and out of baseball in 2011. Funny thing is that he was with the Nats double A affiliate a couple years ago and was released. Now that he has been 'reborn' the Nats want him back to pick up a few middle to late innings, where he has now shown he can be effective., 59035=5/2/13: Through one month of the season, the Nationals have not yet shown that they are near the team that many expected them to be. Washington was expected to coast through the regular season, putting up great stats and a lot of wins as they prepared for the playoffs in October. So far, however, they trail Atlanta Braves who have gotten off to a strong start behind the hottest player in the game, Justin Upton. The Nats have a few problems. Ryan Zimmerman has been on the DL and ace pitcher Steven Strasberg just has not shown the great form he had last season., 58483=5/9/13: Congrats to Bryce Harper for continuing and building on his historic rookie season. Harper was obviously the Nat's MVP for April. The team is just above .500 right now, and would be a whole lot worse if not for the young outfielder. He finished April second in slugging (.740) and home runs (nine), and fourth in batting average (.344). He is maturing rapidly as a hitter, as both his walk and strikeout rates have improved over last season. This bodes well for the Nats for many years to come since Harper is not yet even 21., 69026=Despite being towards the bottom of the league in runs and batting average, the Washington Nationals still find themselves at 29-21 and in first place in the NL East going into June. Beginning on Friday night, the Nationals will open up a weekend series with the division-rival Atlanta Braves and will put 5-1 Stephen Strasburg on the mound. Even with Strasburg's strong start though, the real surprise in the Nationals' rotation thus far has been Gio Gonzalez who has posted a 7-1 record and a stingy 2.04 ERA and has helped Washington to this strong start. Adam LaRoche has been a surprise contributor so far this season for the surpri, 44340=10/17/13: The search is on in Washington for the next manager of the Nationals. Manager Davey Johnson is retiring, so someone has to step in and fill the void. Johnson did a pretty admirable job in 2012 by guiding the team to the best record in baseball, but they were eliminated by the St. Louis Cardinals in the playoffs. The Nats were reportedly interested in Yankees' skipper Joe Girardi, but he opted to stay in New York. Dusty Baker is available, and that would be a fine selection if the team wants to have a great regular season and lose in the playoffs., 39316=12/12/13: The Washington Nationals have one of the better rotations in the major leagues as they are stacked with Stephen Strasburg, Gio Gonzalez, and Jordan Zimmerman. The Nats just got stronger by trading with the Detroit Tigers for Doug Fister. Washington tried to fill that fourth rotation spot in the past with Edwin Jackson and Dan Haren - two accomplished pitchers that fizzled in D.C. Fister had a career year in 2013 with 14 wins and a career best 159 strikeouts. Jackson and Haren both won 10 games in the fourth spot, setting the bar for Fister., 60177=4/4/13: The Nats dream season cam to a crashing halt last October when the St. Louis Cardinals beat them in the playoffs and advanced to the National League Championship Series. The Cardinals were the second wild card team last season and shocked everyone by taking down Washington with relative ease. The Nats are back and Bryce Harper started off with a bang. He homered in his first at bat. Then homered again in his second at bat. Both were solo shots, and provided enough offense as the Nats beat the Marlins on opening day 2-0 at home., 15347=9/24/14: Not surprising in the least, but the Washington Nationals are the National League East champions for 2014. The Nats were involved in a bitter battle with the Atlanta Braves for much of the season, but pulled ahead for good over the last several weeks. Of course, this means that Washington will be in the playoffs, but even more importantly, it means that they will not have to play in a one game play-in game (and use a top pitcher). The Nats now get the chance to enjoy their division win and let the rest of the league play out before figuring out who they play in the first round., 49751=8/15/13: A year ago, the Nats were simply cruising to the NL East title and the best record in baseball. The team made the controversial decision to shelve ace pitcher Steven Strasburg, meaning he was unavailable for the playoffs. The thinking was that there are plenty more years. Not this year. The Braves have a seemingly insurmountable 15.5 game lead on Washington with about six weeks left in the season, and are simply the best team in baseball right now. Washington never got their act together in 2013, but hopefully they will learn about resiliency and missed opportunities in 2014., 28152=4/17/14: It has been a pretty tough start to the 2014 season for Nationals' third baseman Ryan Zimmerman. Even though the season is only two weeks old, he has already been dealing with an arthritic shoulder, which may be limiting his effectiveness. Things got worse for Zimmerman last Saturday when he jammed his thumb while diving back to second base on a pick off play. There was blood visible and Zimmerman left the game. That caused a bit of a shake up in the field, as Anthony Rendon moved to third base and Danny Espinosa entered the game to play second., 10186=2/18/15: In a sports world that is far too often the arena for crimes, useless social media wars and real hatred, it is good to see someone making light of everything. Credit the Washington Nationals for bringing fun back into the games by announcing a Jayson Werth Chia Pet night. Werth has a famous (or infamous) mop of facial hair. On Wednesday, August 5, 2015, when the Nats host the Arizona Diamondbacks, the team will honor that beard as a Chia Pet - to be given away to fans in a promotional event. This is one of the more original fan give-aways, and certainly beats a generic poster that is 90 percent filled with sponsor logos., 53202=7/4/13: Washington is hoping to gain some ground on the NL East leading Braves in the next few weeks. Bryce Harper should return from his injury soon, and that will give the offense a boost that it has been lacking. It is not a stretch to say that the team has not achieved the success that was expected this year. At the same time, they are not out of the playoff race by any means. Should the Nats go on a nice win streak, and perhaps the Braves fall back a bit, then this is a team that will be dangerous in October. That being said, they do have to get back on track and show us all that they are as good as they were last season.}",
