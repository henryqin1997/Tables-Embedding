Below are the suppliers that impact the Patagonia Men's Regular Fit Jeans - Reg View our supply chain The Footprint Chronicles\u00ae To ensure we are buying cotton that is organic as defined by the USDA\u2019s National Organic Program, we require numerous certificates issued by an accredited third-party certification body for every step of the supply chain, from farm to factories. The quality of organic cotton is equal to or better than conventionally grown cotton, yet organically grown methods support biodiversity and healthy ecosystems, improve the quality of soil and often use less water. Growing organically takes more time, requires more knowledge and skill, and, for now, costs more. But it\u2019s worth it. In",
