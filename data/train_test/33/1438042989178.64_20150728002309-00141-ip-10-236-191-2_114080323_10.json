W3C liability, trademark and document use rules apply., 603463=A week consists of a week-year number and a week number representing a seven day period. Each week-year in this calendaring system has either 52 weeks or 53 weeks, as defined below. A week is a seven-day period. The week starting on the Gregorian date Monday December 29th 1969 (1969-12-29) is defined as week number 1 in week-year 1970. Consecutive weeks are numbered sequentially. The week before the number 1 week in a week-year is the last week in the previous week-year, and vice versa. [GREGORIAN], 625862=This includes such encodings as Shift_JIS and variants of ISO-2022, even though it is possible in these encodings for bytes like 0x70 to be part of longer sequences that are unrelated to their interpretation as ASCII. It excludes such encodings as UTF-7, UTF-16, HZ-GB-2312, GSM03.38, and EBCDIC variants., 602871=A week-year with a number year has 53 weeks if it corresponds to either a year year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar that has a Thursday as its first day (January 1st), or a year year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar that has a Wednesday as its first day (January 1st) and where year is a number divisible by 400, or a number divisible by 4 but not by 100. All other week-years have 52 weeks., 660610=In early 2004, some of the principles that underlie this effort, as well as an early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera at a workshop discussing the future of Web Applications on the Web. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web's evolution., 239785=Returns a Date object representing the time component of the element's value, on 1970-01-01 in the UTC time zone., 633863=Unless otherwise stated, all elements defined or mentioned in this specification are in the http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml namespace, and all attributes defined or mentioned in this specification have no namespace (they are in the per-element partition)., 605774=This format allows for time zone offsets from -23:59 to +23:59. In practice, however, the range of actual time zones is -12:00 to +14:00, and the minutes component of actual time zones is always either 00, 30, or 45., 513871=In HTML, the xmlns attribute has absolutely no effect. It is basically a talisman. It is allowed merely to make migration to and from XHTML mildly easier. When parsed by an HTML parser, the attribute ends up in no namespace, not the \"http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/\" namespace like namespace declaration attributes in XML do., 634669=A string is a valid MIME type if it matches the media-type token defined in section 3.7 \"Media Types\" of RFC 2616. [HTTP], 238580=The timezone DOM attribute must return null if the time zone is unknown, and otherwise must return the time corresponding to 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC in the given time zone, with the time zone set to UTC (i.e. the time corresponding to 1970-01-01 at 00:00 UTC plus the offset corresponding to the time zone)., 514196=In HTML documents, elements in the HTML namespace may have an xmlns attribute specified, if, and only if, it has the exact value \"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\". This does not apply to XML documents., 661110=Work on HTML\u00a05 originally started in late 2003, as a proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML\u00a04's forms to provide many of the features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages. At this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software's copyright., 238903=The time DOM attribute must return null if the time is unknown, and otherwise must return the time corresponding to the given time of 1970-01-01, with the time zone UTC., 733895=The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119. For readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification. [RFC2119], 659883=In 2006, the W3C expressed interest in the specification, and created a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML\u00a05 specifications. The working group opened in 2007. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specifications under the W3C copyright, while keeping versions with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site., 723197=This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy., 634349=To ease migration from HTML to XHTML, UAs conforming to this specification will place elements in HTML in the http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml namespace, at least for the purposes of the DOM and CSS. The term \"elements in the HTML namespace\", or \"HTML elements\" for short, when used in this specification, thus refers to both HTML and XHTML elements., 239454=Returns a Date object representing the time corresponding to 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC in the time zone given by the element's value., 305323=Note that changing the order of the list does not change the meaning of the document.
