I tried Inkjetfly's pigment CIS on my 1400 about a year ago but could not get rid of the \"pizza wheel\" tracks, and eventually switched back to my dye ink CIS. Print quality was good though. I still have alot of pigment 1400 ink left. Because of my experience on the 1400 I'm leary of trying pigment again on a dye printer., 5725=Just wondering if anybody here has tried the little Epson Artisan 50 with a set of pigment inks? Several of the popular sellers (InkRepublic, Inkjetfly) are offering pigment ink sets for this printer, and I'm tempted to pick one up and try it as I've given up on my old R2400.}",
