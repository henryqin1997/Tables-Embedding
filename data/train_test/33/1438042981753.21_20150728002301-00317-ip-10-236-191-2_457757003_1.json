Players will captain an arsenal of faithfully recreated U.S. Naval submarines against enemy warship assaults both above and below the water's surface. In Naval Assault: The Killing Tide, players will need a healthy dose of stealth and cunning as well as sharp-shooting deck gun and torpedo skills to successfully destroy the enemy fleets in the 30 missions throughout the game.
