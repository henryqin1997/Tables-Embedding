I wanted to love this book; the artwork is pretty good, and it is clear that the author put a LOT of research and hard work into the project and that he is very passionate about the topic, but... the story itself is so thin and too philosophical. It could have been sooooo much more, but a single page or two for major turning points in the story just isn't enough. Again, I have to give the author credit for putting so much work into it, but I was kind of put off by the section at the end where the author includes notes on the story/illustrations; it felt a lot like the author doesn't trust the reader to fully appreciate his talent and hard work. I felt a bit offended by this arrogance. However, one very cool part of this book though is that the author has assembled a soundtrack for the book--each page lists the song that would be listened to for that part of the story, but I did not download it because the book was so short I didn't feel like it would really be worth the trouble. ...more",

I picked it up and couldn't put it down... just barely made it through without bawling. I can't say that I really liked it because the topic is so sad, but the presentation in graphic novel format is very moving and thought provoking.
