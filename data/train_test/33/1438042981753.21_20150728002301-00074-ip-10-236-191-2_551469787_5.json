Graphic Drivers I am using xf86-video-intel-git on the AUR, and it's working nicely. I recommend disabling the 310m card by following the recommendations on this forum. It will improve battery life. Suspend/hibernate Suspend doesn\u2019t work out of the box because of a problem with the USB buses, we need to disable them before going to sleep. We also need to switch the nvidia card back on before suspending, or it becomes impossible to switch it off with acpi_call after two suspend cycles. Create a file named /etc/pm/sleep.d/20_custom-asus-u35jc and paste this script: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=TLzrmJHg (as stated on the forum link above).",
