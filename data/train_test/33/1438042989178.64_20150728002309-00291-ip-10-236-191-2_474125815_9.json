    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34893=ANSI/ISEA-107-1999 specifies requirements for apparel capable of signaling the wearer's presence visually and intended to provide conspicuity of the wearer in hazardous situations under any light conditions by day, and under illumination by vehicle headlights in darkness. As used herein, and as defined in ANSI/ISEA-107, \u201cconspicuity\u201d refers to the characteristics of an object which determine the likelihood that it will come to the attention of an observer, especially in a complex environment which has competing foreground and background objects. Conspicuity is enhanced by high contrast between the clothing and the background against which it is seen. The ANSI standard specifies performance requirements for color, luminance, and reflective area. Three different colors for background and combined performance are defined in the standard. The color selected should provide the maximum contrast with the anticipated background for use of the apparel. Several combinations are described in the standard depending upon the intended use. For example, the ANSI standard describes three classes of conspicuity. For utility workers, the apparel would meet either Class 2 or Class 3 (Appendix B of ANSI 107-1999)., 53246=NFPA 70E uses the electrical arc testing data to define electrical safety requirements for employee workplaces involving electrical conductor installations. As such, this standard specifies that protective clothing must have an arc thermal performance exposure value (ATPV) of at least 5 cal/cm2 when the clothing is intended for use as fire resistant outerwear. As shown in Table II, each of the fabric constructions A-D exceeds the minimum requirement of NFPA 70E by about 30 percent. Further, each of the samples has a heat attenuation factor exceeding 60%. As used herein, \u201cheat attenuation factor\u201d refers to the percentage of incident energy which is blocked by a material at a level equal to the arc thermal performance value. Notably, and as also shown in Table II, none of the constructions exhibited any measurable afterflame burning. The acceptance criteria for afterflame burning duration, in accordance with ASTM F 1506, is a maximum of 5 seconds., 30335=This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/851,888, filed May 9, 2001, now U.S. Pat No. 6,706,650 Mar. 16, 2004 the content of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety., 49009=In addition to each of these exemplary constructions meeting the acceptance criteria for luminescence and vertical flame exposure, the following Table II illustrates the results of arc testing conducted in accordance with ASTM F 1959., 39737=In an exemplary embodiment, fabric constructed according to the present invention is formed from yarns that are a blend of modacrylic fibers and poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide fibers that are spun in accordance with conventionally known techniques. It has been found that fabrics formed from such blended yarns, wherein the modacrylic fibers used to form the yarns provide a flame-resistance rating that meets at least the vertical flame burn test minimum criteria for safety apparel. The blended poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide fibers provide strength and energy absorption to meet at least the minimum ATPV for safety apparel. The fabric may be either woven or knit. The inherently flame resistant material is dyed in conventional fashion in a jet dye machine with cationic, or basic, dyestuff compositions to obtain International Yellow or International Orange hues that will meet the luminescence and chromacity requirements of ANSI/ISEA-107-1999., 57187=The pretreated fabric is then ready for dyeing and finishing. The dyeing is formed in a jet dye machine such as a Model Mark IV manufactured by Gaston County Machine Company of Stanley, N.C. The specific dyes used to color the fabric of the present invention are basic, or cationic, dyestuffs. The cationic dyes are known for their acceptability in dyeing polyesters, nylons, acrylics, and modacrylics. However, it has heretofor not been known that these dyes could be formulated to dye modacrylic material in order to meet the luminance and chromacity criteria for safety apparel according to ANSI/SEA-107 and the fire resistant criteria of ASTM F 1506. Two dye formulations have been found to meet the high visibility criteria for ANSI/ISEA-107. A dye formulation for International Yellow comprises basic Flavine Yellow, available from Dundee Color of Shelby, N.C. as color number 10GFF. It has been found that this dyestuff applied at between about 2 to 2\ufffd percent of fabric weight successfully achieves the ANSI criteria. A dye formulation for International Orange may be formed from Blue and Red cationic dyestuffs, available from Yorkshire America in Rock Hill, S.C., as color numbers Sevron Blue 5GMF and Sevron Brilliant Red 4G and applied at percentages sufficient to meet the ANSI/ISEA-107 shade requirements., 41994=Modacrylics are polymers that have between 35 percent and 85 percent acrylonitrile units, modified by other chemical modifiers such as vinyl chloride. All modacrylics have a flame-resistant character to some extent, however, it has been found that fabrics formed from modacrylic yarns having at least about 50 percent by weight of acrylonitrile units will provide excellent flame resistance. That is, they will not melt and drip, or continue to burn when a source of ignition is removed. Although other modacrylic fibers could be used to form the yarn and fabric of the present invention, the yarn and fabric of the present invention is formed from short staple fibers of Kanecaron\ufffd SYS. Kanecaron\ufffd SYS is a 1.7 denier, 2 inch modacrylic staple fiber manufactured by Kaneka Corporation, Osaka, Japan. Kanecaron\ufffd SYS fiber has a tenacity of about 3 grams/denier, a Young's Modulus of about 270 kg/mm2, a dull luster, and has been found to meet the structural requirements of both ANSI/ISEA-107-1999 and ASTM F 1506. Modacrylic fibers having tenacities of at least about 2 grams/denier are also suitable to form the yarn and fabric of the present invention., 32257=Similarly, and in related fashion, certain of the above-mentioned occupations also require safety apparel that is flame resistant or electric arc resistant. For example, electric utility workers who may be exposed to flammable situations or to momentary electrical arc require apparel that is flame and/or arc resistant. In the United States, there is a nationally-recognized standard providing a performance specification for flame resistant textile materials for safety apparel, referred to as the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), standard F 1506. This standard provides performance properties for textile materials used in apparel that represent minimum requirements for worker protection. One component of this standard is the vertical flame test which measures whether an apparel will melt or drip when subjected to a flame, or continue to burn after the flame is removed. A second component of flame resistance is arc thermal performance which is tested in accordance with ASTM standard F 1959 to meet acceptance criteria found in National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA) Standard 70E., 34168=The present invention is directed to a yarn, fabric, and apparel formed therefrom, that meets the minimum guidelines laid out in ANSI/ISEA-107-1999, \u201cAmerican National Standard for High-Visibility Safety Apparel\u201d, the vertical flame test of ASTM F 1506, \u201cStandard Performance Specification for Flame Resistant Textile Materials for Wearing Apparel for Use by Electrical Workers Exposed to Momentary Electric Arc and Related Thermal Hazards\u201d, and the electric arc thermal performance criteria of NFPA 70E, \u201cElectrical Safety Requirements for Employee Workplaces\u201d when tested in accordance with ASTM F 1959, \u201cStandard Test Method for Determining the Arc Thermal Performance Value of Materials for Clothing\u201d., 36126=ASTM F 1506 provides a performance specification that may be used to evaluate the properties of fabrics or materials in response to heat and flame under controlled laboratory conditions. For exposure to an open flame, a fabric or apparel must not melt, drip, or continue to burn after the flame is removed. The properties of material for basic protection level wearing apparel should conform to the minimum requirements for woven or knitted fabrics with respect to breaking load, tear resistance, seam slippage, colorfastness, flammability before and after laundering, and arc testing. ASTM F 1506 specifies these performance characteristics based on fabric weight ranges, expressed in ounces per square yard. ASTM F 1506 establishes that an afterflame may not persist for more than 5 seconds when subjected to the arc testing of ASTM F 1959, discussed below., 37005=ASTM F 1959 provides a test method for measuring the arc thermal performance value of materials intended for use as flame resistant clothing for workers exposed to electric arcs of the magnitude that would generate heat flux rates from between 2 and 600 cal/cm2s. The arc thermal performance value (ATPV) is the incident energy on a fabric or material that results in sufficient heat transfer through the fabric or material to cause the onset of second-degree bums. Incident energy is the total heat energy received at a surface as a direct result of an electric arc. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the higher the ATPV, the more protective the apparel., 43180=While the modacrylic staple fibers provide highly satisfactory flame resistance and an affinity for luminescent, cationic dyestuffs, the blended yarn containing the aramid fibers provides the added strength and energy absorption needed to meet the arc thermal performance standards of ASTM F 1506 and NFPA 70E.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Certain modifications and improvements will occur to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the foregoing description. It should be understood that all such modifications and improvements have been deleted herein for the sake of conciseness and readability but are properly within the scope of the following claims. The finished fabric may be used to construct an unlimited number of types of safety apparel. The most common types are shirts or vests, and trousers or coveralls. The final constructed garments are designed and formed to meet the design, structural, and fastening criteria of the ANSI and ASTM standards. Either of the dyestuffs described above are added to the jet dye machine. The Ph of the bath is established at between about 3 and 4, with acid used to adjust the Ph as required. The bath temperature in the jet dyer is raised at about 1\ufffd C. per minute to a temperature of about 80\ufffd C., where the temperature is held for approximately 10 minutes. The temperature is then raised approximately 0.5\ufffd C. per minute to a temperature of 98\ufffd C. and held for approximately 60 minutes. The bath is then cooled at about 2\ufffd C. per minute to 60\ufffd C. At that point, the bath is emptied and rinsing with water at 60\ufffd C. occurs until the dye stuff residue in the jet dyer is removed. At this point, the dyeing cycle is complete.",
