These matrix quantities are used to map the R,G,B density information into the C,M,Y color space, and are described in some detail in a paper by F.R. Clapper entitled \"An Empirical Determination of Halftone Color-Reproduction Requirements\", Technical Association of the Graphics Arts, Thirteenth Annual Meeting, June 12-14, 1961, pp. 31-41, incorporated herein by reference. Clapper describes how to map the R,G,B density information into the C,M,Y color space by the construction of either a set of linear or polynomial equations and by solving the coefficients thereof explicitly. However, this approach has the limitation that the number of equations and the number of coefficients (either linear or polynomial) must be matched. Hence, for a large number of color patches, this process will generate an unrealistically high order of equations, and the solution of the coefficients thereof may be very sensitive to the color patches being chosen., 33347=The output of the C-Y-M color conversion stage 14 is a digital data stream which is applied to the error diffusion and pixel assignment stage 16, and the latter stage 16 in turn drives a color printer 18, preferably a thermal ink jet color printer. The general functional arrangement of the image scanning and color reproduction system of FIG. 1 is well known in the image processing art. The image processing operation and capability of such a system is described, for example, in the March 1987 issue of BYTE Magazine in an article by B. M. Dawson entitled \"Introduction To Image Processing Algorithms\" at page 169 et seq. Such image processing capability and corresponding system operation is also described in a publication by Gary Dispoto et al entitled Designer's Guide to Raster Image Printer Algorithms, First Edition, December 1986, Copyrighted by and available from the Hewlett-Packard Company in Palo Alto, Calif. Both of these latter references are incorporated herein by reference.}",

For example, it is not necessary that the computers represented as 62 and 88 in FIG. 4 be separate computers and instead these units 62 and 88 may both be part of single more complex computer. This approach is known in the art as the least square minimization process, and is described, for example, in a well known classical textbook authored by Richard Bellman and entitled Introduction To Matrix Analysis, McGraw Hill Book Company Inc. 1960, incorporated herein by reference. The outline of obtaining H in equation (1) is as follows: Given TPin, TPout and the functional relationship for H, the task is to obtain a value for H such that the overall sum of squares of the error is minimized: ##EQU1## Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, all of these equations were cast into a \"least square error\" problem whose advantage is that it is not now necessary to match the number of unknown polynomial coefficients with the number of equations which are a function of the number of color patches scanned. Thus, we are now free to choose the type of mapping relationship to be used, and this least square solution is accomplished as indicated below: The conversion factors F & H are matrix quantities defined by a plurality of polynomials representative of C, Y and",
