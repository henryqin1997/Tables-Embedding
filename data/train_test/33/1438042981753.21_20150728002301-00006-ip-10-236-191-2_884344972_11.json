            "Small school, big on security there is at least two security guards on duty all the time. The local police also spend a good amount of time patrolling so you can sleep soundly at night!",
            "Only two fraternities so is not the best choice if thats what your looking for.",
            "The school is definitely lacking in clubs, but good news is you can always start your own!",
            "Good for athletes, seems alot of students are here for some sort of sports.",
            "Nothing out of the ordinary.",
            "Its a cheap, new school that's expected to grow so if you get in early you can enjoy all the perks of smaller schools with the benefits of larger ones.",
            "Most of the fun events take place on campus, plenty of sports facilities and lots of friendly people. Shouldn't have a hard time finding anything to do.",
            "The cooks are awesome and friendly and will make pretty much whatever you want, food taste great another plus for this school.",
            "Phenomenal dorms, like living in a little apartment. The dorms are half the reason i went to this school to begin with!",
            "Classes dont fill up too quick, and with the number of students in classes being small teachers can better work with you as an individual.",
            "If your looking for a smaller university with a local atmosphere this is definitely worth checking out, and its only growing so hopefully it will improve soon!",
            "A relatively small school, with an open atmosphere. Growing in numbers, improvements being made. Could have better facilities."
