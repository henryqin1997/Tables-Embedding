    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6638=FIG. 18 illustrates a system with self-calibration. Once every minute the system queries each check point 1802. This results in a distance measurement being sent to the check point 1802 where the check point receiver adds the code offset measurements and sends the contents of the location file to the processor 1804 where the received file is compared with a file that contains the correct measurements. If the difference exceeds the threshold, the processor 1804 calculates the changes in delay that are required to bring the measurements within tolerance and passes the correction to the controller. The controller maintains a file that includes the variable delay 1806 to be inserted for each antenna. The controller changes the delay entry in the file and a new measurement is taken to validate the calibration. Changes that require significant changes in delay are unlikely, but if this should happen the controller would not initiate any measurements that include the leg that is under recalibration. Thus, the position location capability also provides a service for the communication system. Self calibration results in a significant reduction in installation cost and allows the use of more economical system components.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{90508=In the reverse direction, the analog audio input to analog to digital converter 1322, which also includes a digital compression algorithm, provides a data packet to buffer 1320. During time slot T3 the CDMA transmitter 1318 encodes the contents of buffer 1320 for transmission as a CDMA signal on antenna 1300., 138657=Location related communications between the antenna devices and the subscriber terminal can be broken into several different links. The functions that are performed by these different links are: 1, distance measurement (requires a two way link, but no traffic); 2, sending measurement information to subscriber terminal (one way data link, except for possible retransmission requests); 3, measuring code offset (only requires user terminal to listen, no data is transferred); 4, Transmit location file to location center or communication processor 1804 (data links can be either one way or two way). Distance measurement can only be performed by the system and since it requires a two way link it can be done while a normal conversation channel has been established or if the terminal is in the listening mode the system has to establish a short round trip connection., 89672=In the forward direction, CDMA receiver 1304 receives three identical data packets placing one of the data packets during time slot T1 in buffer 1306, a second of the data packets during time slot T2 in memory buffer 1308, and a third data packet received during time slot T4 in memory buffer 1310. The combiner 1314 selects one or more of the contents of the memory buffers to be combined or selected as the best received data to be converted to an analog audio output of the digital to analog converter 1316. By using three time and space diversity data packets, the present system is less susceptible to fading and since the same receiver is used to demodulate all three samples, no complex signal strength balancing process is required., 32318=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/539,276; filed Oct. 4, 1995 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,366,568; which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/301,230; filed Sep. 6, 1994, which issued on Mar. 25, 1997 as U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,914, which applications are incorporated herein by reference., 123558=In particular, continuing the above example, the signal 2302 transmitted at antenna A represents a range of 25.5 chips from antenna A to user terminal antenna U. Signal 2304 received at antenna U from antenna A is used as a reference to measure the relative time of arrival of signals from antennas B and C, adjusted for the different time slots in which these signals are placed., 96266=The time slot assignment for multiplexing 12 simultaneous calls is shown in FIG. lOB. Time slot assignments for transmission 1006 and for reception 1008 are illustrated. During time slot 1, antenna A transmits T1 to user 1 and T7 to user 7, antenna B transmits T6 to user 6, and T12 to user 12, and antenna C transmits T4 to user 4 and T10 to user 10. At the same time, antennas A, B and C receive R5 from user 5, and R11 from user 11., 80191=In operation, the transfer station receives TDMA signals on antenna T, 1200 which are demodulated in TDMA receiver 1204, and demultiplexed in demultiplexer 1206 for placement in time slot buffers 1208. The data packets in time slot buffers 1208 are transmitted on antenna A during time slot 1. Towards this end, time multiplexer 1210, CDMA encoders 1212 and the CDMA transmitter 1214 retrieve the respective data packets from time slot buffers 1208 and encode the appropriate data packet in a CDMA encoded signal on antenna A. On the return path, CDMA receiver 1226 receives signals on antenna A during all time slots. The received data packets are demodulated by respective PN codes, and placed in time slot combiner buffers 1224, each time slot assigned to a different user. Thereafter, data packets are time multiplexed in multiplexer 1222 for transmission by the TDMA transmitter 1220 through the transmit receive switch 1202 on antenna 1200., 136469=The calibration process could be easily automated. Automation could be implemented in two ways. The first approach is to scan the check points every minute and determine any error that has developed. If this error reaches a significant level the communication system contacts the location center and provides the center with the corrections that need to be factored into the position location calculations. The latter approach requires close coordination between the communication system and the position location center. A more autonomous approach would be desirable. The communication system itself could maintain the proper \u201czero\u201d state by scanning the check points, as described above, and by having the ability to insert or remove delay 1806 in the path to the antenna., 79428=Antenna A 1228 also operates to receive CDMA signals. Towards this end, a CDMA receiver 1226 is coupled to antenna A, 1228, through diplexer 1218 to provide received data packets in combiner and time slot buffers 1224. A time multiplexer 1222 takes the data packets in time slot buffers 1224 and composes a time multiplex signal to TDMA transmitter 1220 which is coupled through transmit receive switch 1202 to antenna 1200. The operation of the transfer station is controlled by a synchronization and control apparatus 1216 which also includes unique location identification (ID) for this particular transfer station, and call setup control parameters.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes . The network can be a circuit switched network or a packet switched network. A packet switched network is adequate and economical for this type of application. FIG. 19 Now that the necessary information is available in the user terminal location file, it may be made available to any authorized requester. Location services may be provided by the communications operator or by a competitive independent service provider. In addition, there will also be large private location centers operated by owners of large fleets. The location center 1902 receives the location files over the public switched network, see Additional entries, greater than three, in the location file are available using the normal search mode that the user terminal radio uses to identify potential candidates for handoff. The user terminal radio searches the pilot codes emanating from nearby antennas to determine if any of these antennas have better signals than one of the three that are currently being used. If so, the user terminal notifies the system that a good candidate is available. The process of searching starts at the state of the PN signal coming in from time slot number one and if nothing is found at that state the radio adds a chip to the path length and integrates again. The radio keeps adding chips until it finds a signal or exceeds a range threshold. If it exceeds the range threshold",
