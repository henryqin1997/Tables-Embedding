Similar modifications may also be made at other positions on nucleosides and oligomers, particularly the 3\u2032 position of the sugar on the 3\u2032 terminal nucleoside or at a 3\u2032-position of a nucleoside that has a linkage from the 2\u2032-position such as a 2\u2032-5\u2032 linked oligomer and at the 5\u2032 position of a 5\u2032 terminal nucleoside. Oligomers may also have sugar mimetics such as cyclobutyl moieties in place of the pentofuranosyl sugar. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such modified sugars structures include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,981,957; 5,118,800; 5,319,080; 5,359,044; 5,393,878; 5,446,137; 5,466,786; 5,514,785; 5,519,134; 5,567,811; 5,576,427; 5,591,722; 5,597,909; 5,610,300; 5,627,0531 5,639,873; 5,646,265; 5,658,873; 5,670,633; and 5,700,920, and commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/468,037, filed on Jun. 5, 1995., 77149=RNA exists in what has been termed \u201cA Form\u201d geometry while DNA exists in \u201cB Form\u201d geometry. In general, RNA:RNA duplexes are more stable, or have higher melting temperatures (Tm) than DNA:DNA duplexes (Sanger et al., Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, 1984, Springer-Verlag; New York, N.Y.; Lesnik et al., Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 10807\u201310815; Conte et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1997, 25, 2627\u20132634). The increased stability of RNA has been attributed to several structural features, most notably the improved base stacking interactions that result from an A-form geometry (Searle et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1993, 21, 2051\u20132056). The presence of the 2\u2032 hydroxyl in RNA biases the sugar toward a C3\u2032 endo pucker, i.e., also designated as Northern pucker, which causes the duplex to favor the A-form geometry. On the other hand, deoxy nucleic acids prefer a C2\u2032 endo sugar pucker, i.e., also known as Southern pucker, which is thought to impart a less stable B-form geometry (Sanger, W. (1984) Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, Springer-Verlag, New York, N.Y.). In addition, the 2\u2032 hydroxyl groups of RNA can form a network of water mediated hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the RNA duplex (Egli et al., Biochemistry, 1996, 35, 8489\u20138494)., 122439=Examples of the synthesis of particular modified oligonucleotides may be found in the following U.S. patents or pending patent applications, each of which is commonly assigned with this application: U.S. Pat.

Biotechnol., 2000, 80, 143\u201357), subtractive RNA fingerprinting (SuRF) (Fuchs, et al., Anal.

Damha et. al., J.A.C.S., 1998, 120, 12976\u201312977; and Damha et. al., Bioconjugate Chem., 1999, 10, 299\u2013305., 135234=Further support media amenable to the present invention include without limitation PEPS support a polyethylene (PE) film with pendant long-chain polystyrene (PS) grafts (molecular weight on the order of 106, (see Berg, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1989, 111, 8024 and International Patent Application WO 90/02749),). The loading capacity of the film is as high as that of a beaded matrix with the additional flexibility to accommodate multiple syntheses simultaneously. The PEPS film may be fashioned in the form of discrete, labeled sheets, each serving as an individual compartment. During all the identical steps of the synthetic cycles, the sheets are kept together in a single reaction vessel to permit concurrent preparation of a multitude of peptides at a rate close to that of a single peptide by conventional methods. Also, experiments with other geometries of the PEPS polymer such as, for example, non-woven felt, knitted net, sticks or microwell plates have not indicated any limitations of the synthetic efficacy., 73754=Representative guanidino substituent groups that are shown in formula III and IV are disclosed in co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/349,040, entitled \u201cFunctionalized Oligomers\u201d, filed Jul. 7, 1999., 73995=Representative acetamido substituent groups are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,147,200. Representative dimethylaminoethyloxyethyl substituent groups are disclosed in International Patent Application PCT/US99/17895, entitled \u201c2\u2032-O-Dimethylaminoethyloxyethyl-Modified Oligonucleotides\u201d, filed Aug. 6, 1999. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2\u2032, 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. The respective ends of this linear polymeric structure can be joined to form a circular structure by hybridization or by formation of a covalent bond, however, open linear structures are generally preferred. Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside linkages of the oligonucleotide. The normal internucleoside linkage of RNA and DNA is a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 phosphodiester linkage., 137428=Other support media amenable to the present invention include without limitation a composite of a resin and another material that is also substantially inert to the organic synthesis reaction conditions employed. One exemplary composite (see Scott, et al., J. Chrom. Sci., 1971, 9, 577) utilizes glass particles coated with a hydrophobic, cross-linked styrene polymer containing reactive chloromethyl groups, and is supplied by Northgate Laboratories, Inc., of Hamden, Conn., USA. Another exemplary composite contains a core of fluorinated ethylene polymer onto which has been grafted polystyrene (see Kent and Merrifield, Israel J. Chem. 1978, 17, 243 and van Rietschoten in Peptides 1974, Y. Wolman, Ed., Wiley and Sons, New York, 1975, pp. 113\u2013116). Contiguous solid supports other than PEPS, such as cotton sheets (Lebl and Eichler, Peptide Res. 1989, 2, 232) and hydroxypropylacrylate-coated polypropylene membranes (Daniels, et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 4345).

USA, 1984, 81, 3998). A \u201ctea bag\u201d containing traditionally-used polymer beads. (Houghten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1985, 82, 5131). Simultaneous use of two different supports with different densities (Tregear, Chemistry and Biology of Peptides, J. Meienhofer, ed., Ann Arbor Sci. Publ., Ann Arbor, 1972 pp. 175\u2013178). Combining of reaction vessels via a manifold (Gorman, Anal. Biochem., 1984, 136, 397). Multicolumn solid-phase synthesis (e.g., Krchnak, et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 1989, 33, 209), and Holm and Meldal, in \u201cProceedings of the 20th European Peptide Symposium\u201d, G. Jung and E. Bayer, eds., Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin, 1989 pp. 208\u2013210). Cellulose paper (Eichler, et al., Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 1989, 54, 1746). Support mediated synthesis of peptides have also been reported (see, Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide, Gregory A. Grant, Ed. Oxford University Press 1992; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,415,732; 4,458,066; 4,500,707; 4,668,777; 4,973,679; 5,132,418; 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069.), 94929=Further tricyclic heterocyclic compounds and methods of using them that are amenable to the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,028,183, which issued on May 22, 2000, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,007,992, which issued on Dec. 28, 1999. Such compounds include those having the formula:, 26769=As antisense molecules have become accepted as therapeutic and diagnostic agents, the need to produce oligonucleotides in large quantities, at higher purity, and at decreased per unit cost has increased as well. The most commonly used antisense compounds to date have been phosphodiester oligonucleotides, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and second generation oligonucleotides having one or more modified ribosyl sugar units, and more recently, ribosyl sugar units. The methods for making these three types of antisense oligomers are roughly similar, and include the phosphotriester method, as described by Reese, Tetrahedron 1978, 34, 3143; the phosphoramidite method, as described by Beaucage, in Methods in Molecular Biology: Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs; Agrawal, ed.; Humana Press: Totowa, 1993, Vol. 20, 33\u201361; and the H-phosphonate method, as described by Froehler in Methods in Molecular Biology: Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs Agrawal, ed.; Humana Press: Totowa, 1993, Vol. 20, 63\u201380. Of these three methods, the phosphoramidite method has become a de facto standard in the industry., 70140=Representative substituents groups of Formula I are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/130,973, filed Aug. 7, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,209, entitled \u201cCapped 2\u2032-Oxyethoxy Oligonucleotides.\u201d Representative cyclic substituent groups of Formula II are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/123,108, filed Jul. 27, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,271,358, entitled \u201cRNA Targeted 2\u2032-Modified Oligonucleotides that are Conformationally Preorganized.\u201d, 167219=An antisense compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target DNA or RNA to cause a loss of activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid nonspecific binding of the antisense compound to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are performed. It is preferred that the antisense compounds of the present invention comprise at least 80% sequence complementarity with the target nucleic acid, more that they comprise 90% sequence complementarity and even more comprise 95% sequence complementarity with the target nucleic acid sequence to which they are targeted. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using basic local alignment search tools (BLAST programs) (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403\u2013410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649\u2013656)., 60891=Suitable 2\u2032-substituents corresponding to R2\u2032 include: F, O-alkyl (e.g. O-methyl), S-alkyl, N-alkyl, O-alkenyl, S-alkenyl, N-alkenyl; O-alkynyl, S-alkynyl, N-alkynyl; O-alkyl-O-alkyl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl may be substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C10 alkyl or C2 to C10 alkenyl or alkynyl, respectively. Particularly preferred are O[(CH2)gO]hCH3, O(CH2)gOCH3, O(CH2)gNH2, O(CH2)gCH3, O(CH2)gONH2, and O(CH2)gON[(CH2)gCH3]2, where g and h are from 1 to about 10. Other preferred oligonucleotides comprise one of the following at the 2\u2032 position: C1 to C10 lower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, O-alkaryl or O-aralkyl, SH, SCH3, OCN, Cl, Br, CN, CF3, OCF3, SOCH3, SO2CH3, SO2CH3, ONO2, NO2, N3, NH2, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkaryl, aminoalkylamino, polyalkylamino, substituted silyl, an RNA cleaving group, a reporter group, an intercalator, a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an oligonucleotide, or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an oligonucleotide, and other substituents having similar properties. A preferred 2\u2032-modification is 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-methoxyethoxy (2\u2032-O\u2014CH2CH2OCH3, also known as 2\u2032-O-(2-methoxyethyl) or 2\u2032-MOE ribosyl) (Martin et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1995, 78, 486\u2013504). Other preferred modifications include 2\u2032-dimethylaminooxyethoxy, i.e., a O(CH2)2ON(CH3)2 group, also known as 2\u2032-DMAOE, and 2\u2032-dimethylaminoethoxyethoxy (also known in the art as 2\u2032-O-dimethyl-amino-ethoxy-ethyl or 2\u2032-DMAEOE), i.e., 2\u2032-O\u2014CH2\u2014O\u2014CH2\u2014N(CH3)2., 78469=DNA:RNA hybrid duplexes, however, are usually less stable than pure RNA:RNA duplexes, and depending on their sequence may be either more or less stable than DNA:DNA duplexes (Searle et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1993, 21, 2051\u20132056). The structure of a hybrid duplex is intermediate between A- and B-form geometries, which may result in poor stacking interactions (Lane et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 1993, 215, 297\u2013306; Fedoroff et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1993, 233, 509\u2013523; Gonzalez et al., Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 4969\u20134982; Horton et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1996, 264, 521\u2013533). The stability of a DNA:RNA hybrid is central to antisense therapies as the mechanism requires the binding of a modified DNA strand to a mRNA strand. To effectively inhibit the mRNA, the antisense DNA should have a very high binding affinity with the mRNA. Otherwise the desired interaction between the DNA and target mRNA strand will occur infrequently, thereby decreasing the efficacy of the antisense oligonucleotide., 132587=Oligonucleotides are generally prepared, as described above, on a support medium (support), e.g. a solid support medium. In general a first synthon (e.g. a monomer, such as a nucleoside) is first attached to a support medium, and the oligonucleotide is then synthesized by sequentially coupling monomers to the support-bound synthon. This iterative elongation eventually results in a final oligomeric compound or other polymer such as a polypeptide. Suitable support media can be soluble or insoluble, or may possess variable solubility in different solvents to allow the growing support bound polymer to be either in or out of solution as desired. Traditional support media such as solid supports are for the most part insoluble and are routinely placed in reaction vessels while reagents and solvents react with and/or wash the growing chain until the oligomer has reached the target length, after which it is cleaved from the support and, if necessary further worked up to produce the final polymeric compound. More recent approaches have introduced soluble supports including soluble polymer supports to allow precipitating and dissolving the iteratively synthesized product at desired points in the synthesis (Gravert et al., Chem. Rev., 1997, 97, 489\u2013510)., 71102=Some preferred oligomeric compounds of the invention contain at least one nucleoside having one of the following substituent groups: C1 to C10 lower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, O-alkaryl or O-aralkyl, SH, SCH3, OCN, Cl, Br, CN, CF3, OCF3, SOCH3, SO2CH3, ONO2, NO2, N3, NH2, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkaryl, aminoalkylamino, polyalkylamino, substituted silyl, an RNA cleaving group, a reporter group, an intercalator, a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an oligomeric compound, or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an oligomeric compound, and other substituents having similar properties. A preferred modification includes 2\u2032-methoxyethoxy [2\u2032-O\u2014CH2CH2OCH3, also known as 2\u2032-O-(2-methoxyethyl) or 2\u2032-MOE] (Martin et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1995, 78, 486), i.e., an alkoxyalkoxy group. A further preferred modification is 2\u2032-dimethylaminooxyethoxy, i.e., a O(CH2)2ON(CH3)2 group, also known as 2\u2032-DMAOE. Representative aminooxy substituent groups are described in co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/344,260, filed Jun. 25, 1999, entitled \u201cAminooxy-Functionalized Oligomers\u201d; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/370,541, filed Aug. 9, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,639,062, entitled \u201cAminooxy-Functionalized Oligomers and Methods for Making Same.\u201d, 93623=Further helix-stabilizing properties have been observed when a cytosine analog/substitute has an aminoethoxy moiety attached to the rigid 1,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-one scaffold (R10=O, R11=\u2014O\u2014(CH2)2\u2014NH2, R12-14=H) [Lin, K.-Y.; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 8531\u20138532]. Binding studies demonstrated that a single incorporation could enhance the binding affinity of a model oligonucleotide to its complementary target DNA or RNA with a\u0394Tm of up to 18\ufffd relative to 5-methyl cytosine (dC5me), which is the highest known affinity enhancement for a single modification, yet. On the other hand, the gain in helical stability does not compromise the specificity of the oligonucleotides. The Tm data indicate an even greater discrimination between the perfect match and mismatched sequences compared to dC5me. It was suggested that the tethered amino group serves as an additional hydrogen bond donor to interact with the Hoogsteen face, namely the O6, of a complementary guanine thereby forming 4 hydrogen bonds. This means that the increased affinity of G-clamp is mediated by the combination of extended base stacking and additional specific hydrogen bonding., 100583=The enhanced binding affinity of the phenoxazine derivatives together with their uncompromised sequence specificity makes them valuable nucleobase analogs for the development of more potent antisense-based drugs. In fact, promising data have been derived from in vitro experiments demonstrating that heptanucleotides containing phenoxazine substitutions are capable to activate RNaseH, enhance cellular uptake and exhibit an increased antisense activity [Lin, K.-Y.; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 8531\u20138532]. The activity enhancement was even more pronounced in case of G-clamp, as a single substitution was shown to significantly improve the in vitro potency of a 20 mer 2\u2032-deoxyphosphorothioate oligonucleotides [Flanagan, W. M.; Wolf, J. J.; Olson, P.; Grant, D.; Lin, K.-Y.; Wagner, R. W.; Matteucci, M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1999, 96, 3513\u20133518]. Nevertheless, to optimize oligonucleotide design and to better understand the impact of these heterocyclic modifications on the biological activity, it is important to evaluate their effect on the nuclease stability of the oligomers., 133882=The term support media (support) is intended to include supports known to the person skilled in the art to for the synthesis of oligomeric compounds and related compounds such as peptides. Some representative support media that are amenable to the methods of the present invention include but are not limited to the following: controlled pore glass (CPG); oxalyl-controlled pore glass (see, e.g., Alul, et al., Nucleic Acids Research 1991, 19, 1527); silica-containing particles, such as porous glass beads and silica gel such as that formed by the reaction of trichloro-[3-(4-chloromethyl)phenyl]propylsilane and porous glass beads (see Parr and Grohmann, Angew. Chem. Internal. Ed. 1972, 11, 314, sold under the trademark \u201cPORASIL E\u201d by Waters Associates, Framingham, Mass., USA); the mono ester of 1,4-dihydroxymethylbenzene and silica (see Bayer and Jung, Tetrahedron Lett., 1970, 4503, sold under the trademark \u201cBIOPAK\u201d by Waters Associates); TENTAGEL (see, e.g., Wright, et al., Tetrahedron Letters 1993, 34, 3373); cross-linked styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer beaded matrix or POROS, a copolymer of polystyrene/divinylbenzene (available from Perceptive Biosystems); soluble support media, polyethylene glycol PEG's (see Bonora et al., Organic Process Research & Development, 2000, 4, 225\u2013231)., 171256=The ability of oligonucleotides to bind to their complementary target strands is compared by determining the melting temperature (Tm) of the hybridization complex of the oligonucleotide and its complementary strand. The melting temperature (Tm), a characteristic physical property of double helices, denotes the temperature (in degrees centigrade) at which 50% helical (hybridized) versus coil (unhybridized) forms are present. Tm is measured by using the UV spectrum to determine the formation and breakdown (melting) of the hybridization complex. Base stacking, which occurs during hybridization, is accompanied by a reduction in UV absorption (hypochromicity). Consequently, a reduction in UV absorption indicates a higher Tm. The higher the Tm, the greater the strength of the bonds between the strands. The structure-stability relationships of a large number of nucleic acid modifications have been reviewed (Freier and Altmann, Nucl. Acids Research, 1997, 25, 4429\u2013443)., 80219=One synthetic 2\u2032-modification that imparts increased nuclease resistance and a very high binding affinity to nucleotides is the 2\u2032-methoxyethoxy (MOE, 2\u2032-OCH2CH2OCH3) side chain (Baker et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 11944\u201312000; Freier et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1997, 25, 4429\u20134443). One of the immediate advantages of the MOE substitution is the improvement in binding affinity, which is greater than many similar 2\u2032 modifications such as O-methyl, O-propyl, and O-aminopropyl (Freier and Altmann, Nucleic Acids Research, (1997) 25:4429\u20134443). 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl-substituted oligonucleotides also have been shown to be antisense inhibitors of gene expression with promising features for in vivo use (Martin, P., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1995, 78, 486\u2013504; Altmann et al., Chimia, 1996, 50, 168\u2013176; Altmann et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans., 1996, 24, 630\u2013637; and Altmann et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides, 1997, 16, 917\u2013926). Relative to DNA, they display improved RNA affinity and higher nuclease resistance. Chimeric oligonucleotides with 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl-ribonucleoside wings and a central DNA-phosphorothioate window also have been shown to effectively reduce the growth of tumors in animal models at low doses. MOE substituted oligonucleotides have shown outstanding promise as antisense agents in several disease states. One such MOE substituted oligonucleotide is presently being investigated in clinical trials for the treatment of CMV retinitis., 79525=Various synthetic modifications have been proposed to increase nuclease resistance, or to enhance the affinity of the antisense strand for its target mRNA (Crooke et al., Med. Res. Rev., 1996, 16, 319\u2013344; De Mesmaeker et al., Acc. Chem. Res., 1995, 28, 366\u2013374). A variety of modified phosphorus-containing linkages have been studied as replacements for the natural, readily cleaved phosphodiester linkage in oligonucleotides. In general, most of them, such as the phosphorothioate, phosphoramidates, phosphonates and phosphorodithioates all result in oligonucleotides with reduced binding to complementary targets and decreased hybrid stability., 89179=Certain of these nucleobases are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of the oligomeric compounds of the invention. These include 5-substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and O-6 substituted purines, including 2-aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynylcytosine. 5-methylcytosine substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6\u20131.2\ufffd C. (Sanghvi, Y. S., Crooke, S. T. and Lebleu, B., eds., Antisense Research and Applications, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993, pp. 276\u2013278) and are presently preferred base substitutions, even more particularly when combined with 2\u2032-O-methoxyethyl sugar modifications., 92344=Representative cytosine analogs that make 3 hydrogen bonds with a guanosine in a second strand include 1,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-one (R10=O, R11\u2013R14=H) [Kurchavov, et al., Nucleosides and Nucleotides, 1997, 16, 1837\u20131846], 1,3-diazaphenothiazine-2-one (R10=S, R11\u2013R14=H), [Lin, K.-Y.; Jones, R. J.; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 3873\u20133874] and 6,7,8,9-tetrafluoro-1,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-one (R10=O, R11\u2013R14=F) [Wang, J.; Lin, K.-Y., Matteucci, M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 8385\u20138388]. Incorporated into oligonucleotides these base modifications were shown to hybridize with complementary guanine and the latter was also shown to hybridize with adenine and to enhance helical thermal stability by extended stacking interactions (also see U.S. patent application entitled \u201cModified Peptide Nucleic Acids\u201d filed May 24, 2002, Ser.

No. 2003-0158403 A1., 82629=LNAs in which the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group is linked to the 4\u2032 carbon atom of the sugar ring thereby forming a 2\u2032-C,4\u2032-C-oxymethylene linkage thereby forming a bicyclic sugar moiety. The linkage is preferably an alkylene ((\u2014CH2\u2014)n) group bridging the 2\u2032 oxygen atom and the 4\u2032 carbon atom wherein n is 1 or 2 (Singh et al., Chem. Commun., 1998, 4, 455\u2013456). LNA and LNA analogs display very high duplex thermal stabilities with complementary DNA and RNA (Tm=+3 to +10 C), stability towards 3\u2032-exonucleolytic degradation and good solubility properties. Other preferred bridge groups include the 2\u2032-CH2OCH2-4\u2032 bridge., 136309=Further support media amenable to the present invention include without limitation particles based upon copolymers of dimethylacrylamide cross-linked with N,N\u2032-bisacryloylethylenediamine, including a known amount of N-tertbutoxycarbonyl-beta-alanyl-N,N\u2032-acryloylhexamethylenediamine. Several spacer molecules are typically added via the beta alanyl group, followed thereafter by the amino acid residue subunits. Also, the beta alanyl-containing monomer can be replaced with an acryloyl safcosine monomer during polymerization to form resin beads. The polymerization is followed by reaction of the beads with ethylenediamine to form resin particles that contain primary amines as the covalently linked functionality. The polyacrylamide-based supports are relatively more hydrophilic than are the polystyrene-based supports and are usually used with polar aprotic solvents including dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and the like (see Atherton, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1975, 97, 6584, Bioorg. Chem. 1979, 8, 351, and J. C. S. Perkin I 538 (1981))., 57456=The person skilled in the art will recognize that when R2\u2032 is in the down configuration and q\u2032 is 1, the ring is a ribosyl ring, whereas when R2\u2032 is in the up configuration and q\u2032 is 1, the ring is an arabinosyl ring. Likewise, when q\u2032 is 0 and R2\u2032 is in the down configuration, the ring is an erythrosyl ring. When R2\u2032 and R4\u2032 are joined to form a bridge, the ring is called a locked nucleic acid (LNA), as described in greater detail herein. In some embodiments, the bridge formed by R2\u2032 and R4\u2032 is R2\u2032\u2014O\u2014(CH2)r\u2014R4\u2032 (wherein r is 1 or 2) or R2\u2032\u2014CH2\u2014O\u2014CH2\u2014R4\u2032 (the use of R2\u2032 and R4\u2032 in the sub-formulae indicating the points of attachment.) LNA may be present in either \u03b1-L- or \u03b2-D-conformation.

Each of these analogs possesses a number of useful characteristics, including resistance to exonuclease activity, induction if endonuclease activity (e.g. by RNAse H, the RISC complex, etc.) and modulation of hybridization., 86842=As used herein, \u201cunmodified\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d nucleobases mean the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U). Modified nucleobases (nucleobase analogs) include other synthetic and natural nucleobases such as 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C), 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2-thiocytosine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl (\u2014C\u2261C\u2014CH3) uracil and cytosine and other alkynyl derivatives of pyrimidine bases, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 8-halo, 8-amino, 8-thiol, 8-thioalkyl, 8-hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 2-F-adenine, 2-amino-adenine, 8-azaguanine and 8-azaadenine, 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine, 7-propynyl-7-deaza-8-azaguanine, 7-propynyl-7-deaza-8-azaadenine.
