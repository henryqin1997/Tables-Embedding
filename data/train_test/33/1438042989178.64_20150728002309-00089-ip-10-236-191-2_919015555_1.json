            "Students who like small classes and a small campus; who want a relationship with their professors and faculty that will help with communication and future recommendation letters; who want to study abroad; in particular, business students.",
            "Apply early and apply for scholarships such as Dean and Cornell. Also, the financial advisors are incredibly nice and very willing to help so setting up an appointment with one of them would be in your best interest. They are looking for ways for you to save money, not ways for them to benefit.",
            "Although Rollins is a private liberal arts college, it offers many scholarships and grants. I, in particular, received a free ride to Rollins with a little bit of help from outside scholarships. The benefits of paying more for an education at Rollins are outstanding: as mentioned previously, there is easier access to faculty; better relationships with teachers who will know the student individually; increased student involvement in the classes due to conversation-based curriculum; meal-plan that offers five different dining options that are a-la carte; dorm options that are both clean and modern while friendly and homy at the same time and on or very close to campus; and most importantly, an education that can not be found elsewhere.",
            "I had a great time at Rollins. Not only did I meet great friends, but I had the opportunity to already go abroad with Rollins before I even set foot on campus: I did a nine day field-study in Costa Rica on ecotourism. It was an amazing trip that changed my life and I met some of my best friends there. My dorm was incredibly clean and friendly, and I was placed with other students who come from different backgrounds yet have a lot in common with me. Also, there are many dining options which helped me not become sick of the food, and there was coffee always available for late night study sessions. The library offers a vast array of periodicals and other resources, along with quiet study rooms and technology assistance. I took full advantage of the gym and free yoga and pilates classes, along with the post office. Although Rollins is a small campus, this does offer many benefits. These include a close relationship with all professors who will be able to view you as an individual, not just another student; close proximity to classes which helps with tardiness and allows comprehensive understanding of the entire campus; and accessibility with faculty who are ready to help. Professors also do not lecture; instead, they do conversation-based classes that increase student involvement in the subject.",
            "Due to being in the International Baccalaureate Program in high school, I found that some courses were rather simplistic at Rollins. For those who have taken many years of comprehensive Spanish, the foreign language department will be a breeze until the 300 level. At Rollins, every freshman must take a RCC (Rollins Conference Course) that helps the student adjust to his first year. The teacher of this course is the student's advisor, and there are many field trips or presentations that must be attended to bring the student closer to the Rollins community. While this may be a great idea, it is not greatly executed, and I did not learn any new material during the field trips. I did, however, learn a lot of new material in my Intro to Politics class and RCC Immigration and Poverty Course. Both these classes gave a lot of readings but offered in-depth discussion during class. I found these classes to be the only ones I studied for and consistently stayed up doing their homework. Overall, I believe that Rollins offers a lot of great courses taught by wonderful professors who do a great job ensuring that you learn the material--my personal problem was that I was placed in classes that were below the level I should have been placed in, such as Spanish 210."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{87989=Rollins is a beautiful campus that feels like paradise. Its small enough so it is easy to get around but large enough so it's not crowded. Students make many friends. Because of the small class size, students get to know their classmates very well. The student population is about 1800 so everyone gets to know everyone pretty well. The dorms are for the most part nice and safe. The campus food is good too. There are many events on campus that are open to all students which are a great way to have fun with friends and to meet new people., 212188=Fox Day: A free random day off from school... sometime in April., 356529=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 110293=Fox Day is one day in March or April when the President (P-Dunc) wakes up at 5 or 6 am, puts the statue of the Fox on Mills Lawn and all classes are cancelled for that day. Students go to the beach, to theme parks, and just relax, then come back to school for a huge bbq on the lawn., 30022=Okay, fine, you don't have to look Fox Day up - didn't see this box before. Fox Day happens every year in the spring, usually the first or second week of April. It's when the president picks a random day that is supposed to have beautiful weather, and doesn't tell anyone (literally), and at like 5:30am on that day, he goes out to the lawn and puts this big statue of a fox by the flagpole, and that means that class is canceled for the day! It has become such a huge deal, especially in the past few years. People play Fox Day Roulette weeks before it might happen, people place bets on when they think it will be, people won't do their homework/study for tests that are supposed to be on the day that they think Fox Day will be (which is stupid, btw), etc. And people legit camp out all night on the lawn if they think it's gonna be fox day, and when he finally does bring the fox out, people start running around like crazy at 6 in the morning screaming IT'S FOX DAYYY! and posting facebook statuses and calling their friends to wake them up and make sure they know, and then everyone goes and eats free breakfast in the cafeteria, and then goes and does whatever they want. Beach, Disney World, Universal (we sell discount tickets for all the theme parks), chill on campus by the pool, sleep, or Rollins always has some activities on campus for people who don't want to go anywhere, like slip and slides, giant inflatable twister, and so on. Then everyone comes back to campus by like 5:30 and there's more free food for the fox day barbecue! And then everyone goes and gets ready to come back to the real world for class the next day, cause Fox Day is ALWAYS in the middle of the week. Cruel, I know. But it's our own little holiday, and we get real excited about it.}",

The location of Rollins is very close to clubs and bars, so that's where the majority of the students here can be found on Thursday and Saturday nights. Of course, there is a minority of students who don't take part in those activities. The school is great if you're looking for chances to study abroad and if you like to participate in community service activities. If you want to play football you're in tough luck because Rollins has no football team. Tips for prospective students I really advise prospective students to apply early because that will give them a better chance to receive scholarships from the school. Scholarships can range from $8000 to full tuition if you have the grades and SAT scores. Bang",
