The Poo Say signs appear on campus every Tuesday morning and occasionally comment on campus political life and student life. The Poo Say signs are nailed to the trees on campus and most are designed to promote school spirit. Purple Poo members appear in public dressed in costume to conceal their identity. Many members un-mask at the Leadership and Service Awards Ceremony each April while others choose to have their pictures appear in the Grassburr. At commencement, graduating members will pass a purple pig to the university president as they pass across the stage., 367252=Has amazing professors. Has a lot of country people and cowboys.

The environment, teachers, school spirit, and community feel makes it one of the best schools to go to and make the cost seem like a steal. I've made so many close friends within my first semester and learned so much in subjects I wasn't expecting to like and I've really enjoyed the whole experience. Am enjoying being here I love the campus and love the people I've met there. Being with people that are striving for a similar goal to your own really helps you concentrate and pull your grades to where you want them. There is also a lot of organizations and activities on campus that are a lot of fun to partake in. Am learning a lot There is a wealth of knowledge at Tarleton State University. There is a huge variety of classes ranging from mathematics courses to musical courses to theatre courses. There are honors programs available, which I am a part of. The teachers at Tarleton care about the individual student if that student cares about his or her education. I feel so much more intelligent just being on campus and interacting with others",
