            "If you are an independent soul who isn't quite sure what they want to do, DMACC is a great option for getting your general education out of the way and discovering a potential career and intended major.",
            "Going to the local Mexican restaurant Rancho Grande, and ordering a soda with the free chips and salsa are the best way to get the most bang for your buck.",
            "In Carroll there is a bowling alley, many fun restaurants, a skate park, a local coffee shop, and many other options for fun.",
            "With many options in Carroll, there is always somewhere new and interesting to eat.",
            "There are no local dorms specifically local for DMACC's Carroll campus, but there are local apartments that can suffice perfectly.",
            "The professors are more than happy to help you keep up with your schoolwork, as long as you are willing to put in the effort.",
            "The only helpful concepts I can stress to students is do your best, and try not to get behind. I also understand that attending class whether you feel like it or not is key. It is much more difficult to have to play catch-up and juggle all the responsibilities of being a student, than to have kept up with homework and classes in the first place.",
            "DMACC is a very well-organized and goal-oriented college that focuses on student success at a palatable cost. This school enables students to have the option of being involved on-campus and helping with community service off-campus, but nothing is forced on students."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students If you are unsure of what you would like to major in, I highly suggest going to this college. It's a great way to get your generals done and by taking a variety of classes, maybe you can narrow down your decision by seeing what you like/dislike. If you are thinking about transferring to a four year college after going to a two year, DMACC offers a few 2+2 programs that will help make a smooth transfer. It will also be cheaper than many other colleges. Tips for prospective students There are many resources that are offered for students, so use them to your advantage. If you ever are struggling in a certain class, seek out some extra help. The Academic Achievement Center at DMACC can help out with a lot of different subject areas including math, writing, science, and other areas. Also, do the best you can. It's easy to slack off sometimes, but if you put your all into it, you'll get the most out of your education and be able to use what you have learned beyond the classroom. Bang for the buck Definitely worth the money. Tuition is much cheaper than many colleges, which is awesome. Don't think that you won't get a good education because it's a cheap community college.",
