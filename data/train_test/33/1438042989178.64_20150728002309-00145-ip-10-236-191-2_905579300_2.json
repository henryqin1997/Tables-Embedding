            "Any students that want to go to a well-respected school that teachers will promise to know your name in the first few weeks of school. It holds about 6,000 undergraduate students and every semester I have had all of my teachers know my name. Also, if you want to live in a big city with great night life but want to be far away from it that it will be quiet and mellow at night if you stay on campus, this is perfect for you. Also, just because it is a Catholic school does not mean that every student is religious and you will not be forced to see any religious view if you do not wish to. However, I do know that if you went to a Catholic high school you get a decent discount.",
            "If I can give you any advice, I would definitely recommend eating at Options as much as you can. Out of all the food places and cafeterias on campus that you can use your meal plan for - Options is the best. It's the closest to home cooking and the staff workers are always super friendly. Also, Starbucks accepts flex only during evening hours... but remember that usually the last 2 weeks of school they accept it any time of the day! And trust me it will be needed during finals week.",
            "As I mentioned previously, it is a prestigious school and it definitely will leave a dent in your wallet. The school offers plenty of jobs for students, activities, internships and more. Also, unlike larger colleges, the majority of classes will consist of about 30 students and teachers will learn your name quickly. Which is nice to have because they get to know you personally rather than just be a name on their attendance sheet. So it may be more expensive than some public or other private schools but you will end up paying for it in the end.",
            "This university is practically in the heart of Pittsburgh, however, it has it's own little environment. Unlike the crowded, busy hustle of the streets of Pittsburgh, Duquesne offers a laid-back environment. In the warm seasons the campus constantly is being trimmed and having flowers planted. Walking to class you're almost guaranteed to see a squirrel or two run across your path. It honestly is the best of both worlds. Also, Duquesne has the a weekly newsletter emailed out to all students every week updating everyone on the events that happens daily. Last year I remember talent shows, carnivals, free food, caricature paintings, and so much more that is always free. And if none of that floats your boat, you're only a 10 minute bus ride from Oakland or the Southside works.",
            "Duquesne University is a very prestigious school that has an entire melting pot of students. You will find an interesting mix of people from all different races, religions, and ethnicities. Also, teachers are absolutely great. I am going to be a sophomore and I must say that the teachers I met in my freshman year were exceptional. I am a psychology major and I feel like I had a great relationship with my psych teachers. One teacher offered me advice and told me that I could use her as a reference anytime. I feel that the professors at Duquesne actually care about their students and are not solely there for a paycheck."
