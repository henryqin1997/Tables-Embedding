But here is a little help: At skiresorts-test.com, around 3,000 users from all over Europe have chosen their favorite ski resorts in North America. We are more than happy to present the ten most favored skiing areas: Canada: A dream for winter sports enthusiasts According to our users, the best ski resort in North America is Lake Louise in Canada. Covering a surface of 1,700ha, it is also one of the largest ski areas of North America. There are 145 slopes awaiting skiers and snowboarders in Alberta, where Lake Louise is located. We recommend the gentle slopes in the Larch Arena for all beginners. But generally, beginners can stroll around and discover the entire area as well. An easy slope starts at almost every lift. More advanced skiers won\u00b4t be bored, either. At Lake Louise, you will find the most difficult parts of the Rocky Mountains to ski on if you\u00b4re up for this extra bit of challenge. A third of all pistes are powder bowls. It means these slopes are not prepared. Martin Bauer, an experienced ski resort tester, understands the users\u00b4 voting totally:",
