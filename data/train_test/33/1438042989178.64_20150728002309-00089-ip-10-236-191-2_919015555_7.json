            "We might be a very small school, but campus security takes their job very seriously. I never feel unsafe while on campus and I know that if I don't want to walk across campus at night by myself back to my dorm, I can call campo and they'll escort me there.",
            "While I'm not part of Greek life, I do know a bit about it. Rush isn't done until the spring semester and there's no hazing. You can still have a social life if you don't join a sorority or fraternity, and there's presence on campus isn't obnoxious like at some other schools I've visited.",
            "There's something for everyone. From serious academic clubs to athletic clubs to political organizations, there's just about everything. There's even Quidditch and, from what I hear, they're starting up the Laughing Club again (they meet at designated times and literally just laugh about nothing for a few minutes).",
            "I'd like to think that Rollins is great for any time of student. If you want a large school with most classes in large lecture halls where professors will most likely never know you by name, then Rollins isn't for you. Otherwise, come on down for a visit and see for yourself!",
            "Fox Day! During the spring semester, a day is chosen (the students won't know until the day arrives). On this day, a statue of a fox is rolled onto Mills Lawn at about 5 in the morning and classes are cancelled for the day. There's also a huge cookout and generally just a bunch of fun stuff. A great Rollins tradition!",
            "Rollins has one of the highest tuition rates in the country, but the level of education, experiences provided and the generosity of the college with their scholarship money make it worth the price tag.",
            "It's fun to attend plays and other events on campus. When there's not much going on, however, there's plenty to do in the area. Because Winter Park is basically in Orlando's backyard, there are tons of places to go within a reasonable driving distance.",
            "I LOVE the food at Rollins. There's tons of options and I never feel like I have to resort to unhealthy options because there's nothing else I want to eat. Also, if you don't feel like dining on campus, there's Park Ave right off of campus with tons of great dining options.",
            "I like my dorm, but as with most schools, there's a few really obnoxious people that can take away from the experience. I also live on one of the nicest dorms on campus (Ward Hall).",
            "At Rollins, I always feel challenged in the classroom but never pushed to the brink of my sanity. There's good balance in most everything.",
            "While Rollins is sometimes called the Harvard of the South, it doesn't mean we lack personality. My essay for Rollins was humorous and far from dry like the essays that so many of my friends were writing. Good grades and scores are important but are also not everything; I think they'd like to see long-term commitment to an extracurricular or two. If you visit the campus, ask good questions and be polite, but don't be one of those kids who thinks that sucking up to the tour guide will improve your chances of getting in if you haven't already.",
            "I feel I made a great choice in picking Rollins College. I'm treated as a person, not a number, and amazing one-on-one interactions with professors. I'm proud to be a Tar (even though most people have to Google what a Tar is : )"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{87989=Rollins is a beautiful campus that feels like paradise. Its small enough so it is easy to get around but large enough so it's not crowded. Students make many friends. Because of the small class size, students get to know their classmates very well. The student population is about 1800 so everyone gets to know everyone pretty well. The dorms are for the most part nice and safe. The campus food is good too. There are many events on campus that are open to all students which are a great way to have fun with friends and to meet new people., 212188=Fox Day: A free random day off from school... sometime in April., 356529=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 110293=Fox Day is one day in March or April when the President (P-Dunc) wakes up at 5 or 6 am, puts the statue of the Fox on Mills Lawn and all classes are cancelled for that day. Students go to the beach, to theme parks, and just relax, then come back to school for a huge bbq on the lawn., 30022=Okay, fine, you don't have to look Fox Day up - didn't see this box before. Fox Day happens every year in the spring, usually the first or second week of April. It's when the president picks a random day that is supposed to have beautiful weather, and doesn't tell anyone (literally), and at like 5:30am on that day, he goes out to the lawn and puts this big statue of a fox by the flagpole, and that means that class is canceled for the day! It has become such a huge deal, especially in the past few years. People play Fox Day Roulette weeks before it might happen, people place bets on when they think it will be, people won't do their homework/study for tests that are supposed to be on the day that they think Fox Day will be (which is stupid, btw), etc. And people legit camp out all night on the lawn if they think it's gonna be fox day, and when he finally does bring the fox out, people start running around like crazy at 6 in the morning screaming IT'S FOX DAYYY! and posting facebook statuses and calling their friends to wake them up and make sure they know, and then everyone goes and eats free breakfast in the cafeteria, and then goes and does whatever they want. Beach, Disney World, Universal (we sell discount tickets for all the theme parks), chill on campus by the pool, sleep, or Rollins always has some activities on campus for people who don't want to go anywhere, like slip and slides, giant inflatable twister, and so on. Then everyone comes back to campus by like 5:30 and there's more free food for the fox day barbecue! And then everyone goes and gets ready to come back to the real world for class the next day, cause Fox Day is ALWAYS in the middle of the week. Cruel, I know. But it's our own little holiday, and we get real excited about it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The teachers at Rollins are really great and they're all so unique and wonderful in their own ways. If you do poorly on an assignment or a test, the teachers will encourage you to meet with them and help you find a way to study better and find ways to improve your writing to ensure you get a better grade the next time. The lectures are exciting and the classroom is really engaging, which I would have to give credit to the small classes, which are around 15 people at most. If you need extra help, there's free tutoring which I would really encourage people to take advantage of. The library is open 24/7, so you always have access to computers, books, and other research materials. All in all, it's just up to you as a student to make the most of your learning experiences and Rollins really gives students the chance to do that.
