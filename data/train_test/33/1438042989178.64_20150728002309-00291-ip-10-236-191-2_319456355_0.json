Tree management by crown reduction or thinning may be better than removal because it will maintain a stable soil moisture profile Do not plant potentially large trees next to the house ensure foundations of new constructions or extensions are designed for the shrinkable clay soil conditions that are present seek expert advice before planting trees near to the house The safe planting distance will depend on the tree species, type of house foundation and soil composition. consider the effect of laying impermeable drives, paths, hard standing on the rainfall reaching the soil below and changing its moisture content take specialist advice before starting major building work If active clay shrinkage/swelling is not affecting your property but the area has a potential for shrink\u2013swell clay being present this should be taken into account before starting new buildings or changes in land use: If active clay shrinkage/swelling appears to be affecting your property, inform your insurance company, mortgage lender or landlord. Get specialist advice from a suitably qualified expert such as a structural surveyor, geotechnical engineer or chartered engineering geologist. Shrink\u2013swell \u2014 property hazard information",
