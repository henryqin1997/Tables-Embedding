In the illustrated embodiment, the time axis (X-axis) is scaled to one of five pre-set maximum durations, depending upon the set target duration. For example, if the target duration is 0 to 3 minutes, the maximum time scale is 3:30 minutes. If the target duration is 3 to 6 minutes, the maximum time scale is 6:30 seconds, and so on., 44026=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser.

If the tip temperature is below the prescribed maximum (e.g., 100 degrees C.), the box B1/oval O1 is colored, e.g., green. If the tip temperature is exceeds the prescribed maximum, the box border thickens and the color of the box B1/oval O1 changes, e.g., to red. If the impedance is within prescribed bounds (e.g., between 25 ohms and 1000 ohms), the box B3/oval O3 is colored, e.g., grey.

Other details of the GUI during operation of a given device 26 a/26 b can be found in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

The housing 400 can carry an integrated printer, or can be coupled through the I/O device 54 to an external printer. The printer prints a procedure log in real time, as the procedure takes place. In this circumstance, the UPDATE function 526 causes the controller 52 to generate the EXCHANGE prompt 516. As previously described, the EXCHANGE prompt 516 (see FIG. 16) requires the operator to replace the existing device 26 and its key card 200 with a new device 26 and its associated key card 200. The controller 52 includes an UPDATE function 526 (see FIG. 15). The UPDATE function 526 registers the time period during which radio frequency energy is applied using the device 26 a/26 b. The time is entered into the time record 218 of the use table 216 maintained by the controller 52. After a prescribed maximum period of use is registered (e.g., sixty minutes), the UPDATE function 526 interrupts application of radio frequency energy to the electrodes 66, and prevents further delivery by the generator",
