            "I'm safe when I'm parking my vehicle. Anything other than that check the regular DPS alerts from TSU Police you get in your student mail.",
            "Cool frat's parties, crazy drinks!!! There is a lot of sororities and fraternities here.",
            "I'm not in any at the moment, but i do know they cost $50-100 to join some organizations for the Science Department.",
            "You're basic everyday black female/male not really caring about their education, or just wanting to dip their toe into it. Just look at the retention and graduation rate for this school.",
            "Kind of cool hump day's, or any gatherings they have are kind of live if a lot of people attend ad the weather permits.",
            "Yes, it is affordable but not for the living experience if your going to live on campus. I DO NOT RECOMMEND LIVING ON CAMPUS as a freshmen where ever you go for your first year, but especially here. People let loose when there exposed to new things and their by themselves without parents. I've witnessed people turn for good straight A students to poppin' mollys on a friday! It's mind blowing. Everyone looks the sames dreads, weave, leggins, broke down cars, just basic. You see the same stuff everyday! It gets old quick. It costs around $22K for a year including housing and tuition for a biology major.",
            "Parties, shopping downtown at the galleria it's huge!! Hookah, downtown life since your basically downtown, there's a lot of parties posted on instagram if you follow people. Plus there's always someone passing out flyers for something around campus.",
            "Dining Hall is okay. Normally soul food. Fried fish Fridays or Fried chicken Wednesday's. There's other fast-food or to go options here as well, like A&W or some wings place upstairs. It's okay. I would recommend if your a freshmen not to get the most expensive meal plan because it gives you less points to eat out besides the dining hall. For example, you would have to use your meal points to eat at the Einsteins bagels in the Science building or the A&W. The less your meal plan is the more money you get for your meal points.",
            "If I could give this a negative number I really would. Out of all my friends, I believe that this is the biggest downfall of TSU. I've literally had the WORST experience ever with this. I do not live in a dorm I lived in UAV. I have no idea where to start. First, when you do the roommate application to find out which roommate is compatible with you don't even bother, why? because they didn't even look at it because they received the information about the people living here too late, and they just had to pair people up yes that is what someone had told me in the UAV office. This is another negative on the school's behalf because they are never in touch with one another. Well on my behalf, i got paired up with the craziest roommate anyone who can ever imagine. I'm not going into detail and i'm not being be dramatic about it, but it involved her being escorted out of the apartment with TSU police. The dorm's if you're planning to live there have been there since WWII(If you don't know what that is I don't think you should even been attending college) there's two dorms out of the WHOLE campus, on the same side of the campus. Only TWO. Crazy I know. The Coed dorms with the designated female floor still has urinals in the community bathrooms. Besides that its a basic dorm.",
            "I major in Biology, the biology building is amazing. They really went to work on the architectural concept for the biology. I believe the teacher assistants in labs do a waaaay better job then the teachers who do lectures. Most of the lecture teachers are foreign and hard to understand. None the less, the teachers I had no problem making time for me for office hours. Always go to teachers during their office hours for anything they are there to help you and tell you where you stand during that semester. If you really put in the work you will receive what you deserve when it comes to grades.",
            "If you are not from Houston or familiar with being around a predominately black school I wouldn't recommend attending here. I was in for a rude awakening when I arrived on campus for move in day. Living on campus is crazy itself, if you're not hearing fire sirens or people banging on your door or someone else's door you every night you are not on the right campus and you're reading the wrong review. The parties never really happen in the dorms, it's usually at UAV or fraternities parties. If you enjoy being around an environment that has other students caring more about their appearances than their grades this is the right school for you.",
            "Ghetto, Lazy, and Old. This school puts forward no effort in resolving their own problems they relay on students because they couldn't get it right the first time. Do not attend if you want a college that will help you out without having to go out of your way every-time you need help, literally. Transferring after this semester because I got locked in with a lease for a year."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Looking for a HBC and want to live in an urban environment. Tips for prospective students JUST STAY FOCUSED! Get as much money possible. Bang for the buck You know its nice the residential living is way to high for the conditions they are in. For example, in my dorm the windows had damage, the restrooms were horrible and they received about $3000 dollars out of my money! Am enjoying being here I LOVE TSU!!! I knew it was the school for me. I wanted to go to HBC and that is what TSU gave me! They provide a lot of activities and offer a lot of clubs to join. Am learning a lot I love TSU the teachers are very helpful and they take things slow! I made it with ease and passed all my classes. The students in class can be a little annoying but that's in ANY class!! Login to rate or flag the reviews Shelby from Cedar",
