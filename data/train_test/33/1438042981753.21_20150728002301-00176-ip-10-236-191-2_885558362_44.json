            "Campus safety at UNLV is excellent. Your rarely hear about any type of criminal activity as there are emergency callboxes every few yards and a heavy police presence around campus at all times. The only drawback is that a few parts of campus are not very well lit at night. Still, I always feel completely safe walking around campus and I don't know of any other students or faculty who don't feel the same way.",
            "There are frats and sororities representing every possible nationality and religion at UNLV. Only a few of them such as TKE have houses near campus however. If you want to join they have greek weeks at the start of every semester but if you're hesitant to commit you can simply attend some of the parties they put together so you can see if going greek would be a good fit.",
            "Every possible activity in every possible permutation is available at UNLV. The school has a directory of clubs on one of its websites so it's not too difficult to find one that suits your interests. The options are truly endless. You want a club that watches anime? They got it. A club that sits around discusses politics. They've got that. You want a club that cheers the basketball team? Join the rebellion. Just don't go crazy and join too many. Your grades will suffer.",
            "Do you want a college education without years of debt? This is the school for you. It's also a great choice if you want to become involved in the gaming industry or or hotel management. They have programs specifically for that and deep ties with many of the local casinos.",
            "We have a huge flashlight art piece that sits on campus. The university was going to shine the light in the sky as a beacon of awesomeness but the FAA didn't like that idea so now flashlight sits upside down and shines into the ground. That's right we have a two story flashlight that shines into the ground. Beat that, Princeton!",
            "Any time a website or newspaper puts out a list of the best value universities, UNLV comes out near the top. There are cheaper schools but not by much and those that are cheaper are usually in BFE (nowhere).",
            "Drink. The campus is located less than a mile from the famous las vegas strip and there are dozens of bars that surround it. If you're more into outdoor activities you gotta be careful. In the summertime it gets so hot that it becomes dangerous to be in the sun for very long.",
            "There's gotta be like fifty dining options within a short walking distance from campus. You've got every from In and Out burgers to healthy choices like pita pit. If you want to eat on campus there a bunch of subway restaurants and Einstein bagels. There's also a student union which has a food court on the first floor. Another option to consider is buffet in the DC building. You can get a meal plan to eat there for really cheap and the food can be very healthy depending on what you choose. Don't worry about dining options at UNLV, there's plenty to choose from. I would worry about getting fat though; don't eat too much.",
            "This is one of the few drawbacks of the school. Few students live in the dorms and those that do don't typically stay after their sophomore year. The dorms are a lot more expensive that apartments around campus and there aren't dorms specifically for grad students. Some of the newer ones are really nice though so if want to live in a dorm you can be quite comfortable.",
            "It is difficult to predict how difficult will be classes at UNLV. Some classes are tougher and others are easier then you may expect. For instance, ESL class I took was tough because teachers drilling materials and give bunch of home work assignments. ENG101E and F are easy, you'll be required to write only 2 essays for each of those classes.",
            "When you first start , take a bunch of pre-reqs and maybe just one class that's required for your major. That way you won't worry about wasting too much time if you want to switch majors (everybody switches).",
            "It's a cheap state school that's in Las Vegas. There's always something to do and there something like a hundred majors to choose from. We also have a pretty good basketball team."

For example, there are a lot of scholarships that can pay for most, if not all, of your tuition. Talk to the financial aid office about grants offered by the school as well as other scholarships awarded by the program you're majoring in. Either way, you will be able to have at least some of your tuition paid off at UNLV., 1058196=Excited to be joining UNLV to study hospitality management with a concentration in PGA Golf. Attended an excellent and well organized orientation in June., 82008=Here is UNLV's shining area. It is cheap. No, it is dirt cheap. That is, if you went to high school in Las Vegas. If you are an out of state student, avoid this school like the plague. However, if you go to a Las Vegas high school and qualify for the Guinn Millennium Scholarship, you will pay only 1500-2500 dollars per semester, which is far below average. In other words, if you are local, have that scholarship, and only care about getting a degree so you can go to grad school, this is the place. But don't expect to have a exceptional learning environment., 27451=I am already enrolled at UNLV to begin my first semester in the Spring of 2011. I have many friends who attended UNLV for the Fall semester & from what I have heard, the classes are packed full of learning experiences. They require much work, focus & concentration. The professors are very knowledgeable on the subjects which they teach, & they are willing help if you get lost. Overall, students at UNLV undoubtedly learn a lot in their time spent at the university., 470645=I feel that they do not support their Geology program very well, There on-campus housing needs to be remodeled. They do not treat everyone equally I know this as I worked in the Enrollment and Student Services office and I was able to see what goes on behind the scenes. I rate them a 4 out of 10 I am currenlty finishing my last semester with UNLV online this fall and starting with Metropolitan College of Denver Spring 2013, 217404=If you are a commuter and willing to stay on campus until 6:30 PM for a meeting, once a month, then I would say the clubs are a great thing. To those living on campus it is definitely more convenient because they are within walking distance., 1060679=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 1023468=There's plenty of people on campus throughout the whole entire day. I have a class that doesn't end until 7:30 at night and there's still plenty of other students walking around campus. However, if there isn't a lot of people around, there are security guards constantly patrolling the campus, and there are emergency call boxes on every corner for students to pick up and it will notify campus police that they need help.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Everyone knows college isn't gonna be easy, its a challenge. There are going to be teachers that only go over the general information in the lecture, leaving it up to you to learn the concepts through the book. But reading the book is required in all classes. There will also be teachers that go more in depth in the lectures, giving you a full understanding of the material before you study on your own. But all courses will offer a study group or tutoring, which is helpful when you don't get anything. Some teachers may have really thick accents, but that will just be another obstacle to overcome. So before you decide on your schedule, I recommend you look up the professor on ratemyprofessor.com, the reviews are usually straight on. Overall, you will learn a lot here, but you're going to have to put the time and effort in.
