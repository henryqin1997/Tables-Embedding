He reached junior provincial level in cricket, rugby, tennis and hockey, and earned South African under-16 hockey colours. Van Wyk was a member of the South African squad in the 1998 Under-19 World Cup, having represented his country against England at the same level in 1997-98. A naturally attacking player, he opened the batting for Free State in limited-overs matches and earned respect beyond his years at first-class level. Van Wyk is a manufactured rather than a born gloveman, but his natural ball-skills enabled Free State to use him as their regular wicketkeeper in both formats of the game in 2002-03., 49624=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 41588=The Cricket Monthly: Firdose Moonda on the joys, and complexities, of cricket commentary in Xhosa TCM July issue, 23013=With AB de Villiers now being given a chance with the gloves, and Van Wyk the wrong side of 30, his hopes of a full international career are fading but he remains a regular in the South Africa A team, having captained the 2010 team to a tournament win with an unbeaten hundred in the final against Sri Lanka, while at home scores prolifically for the Knights in all three formats of the game. Neil Manthorp and ESPNcricinfo staff, 22371=His versatility undoubtedly contributed to his selection in South Africa's one-day squad to play in the triangular series in England in 2003. He made his one-day international debut in the final, against England at Lord's, in which South Africa were thumped by seven wickets. However, despite being earmarked as Mark Boucher's long-term replacement his opportunities were limited. He made is Twenty20 international debut against Pakistan in 2007 in which he did not bat and played one further T20 International against West Indies at the end of 2007, a match that South Africa was bowled out for 58.}",
