            "Campus safety is a really good thing here. At any time you feel unsafe you can call the direct police number and be escorted to where ever you need to go. Unfortunately things do happen but from what has been reported the university is doing its best to make sure that all its students are safe. There are polices on every corner the university police, state, and city police.",
            "I do not participate.",
            "I do not have the time to participate.",
            "For anyone wanting to come out of your shell Georgia State is a great university for that. They are really big on Law and sciences so if that interest you do apply.",
            "Every Tuesday and Thursday at 12-1 pm there are no classes on campus. This is when everybody goes to the court yard to enjoy other student music and activities. It is always fun and something different.",
            "I choose this university because I wanted to leave home and experience something new. It was not far away but far enough from home that I felt a sense of independence. The campus is great for where it is located. There are so many things and opportunities for students here that you can not get at many other traditional schools. We do have a new football team that plays at the Georgia Dome and it is a great place to meet new people.",
            "There are several clubs and organizations you can be apart of. I am a working student so I do not participate in many things. They have shows, a movie theater, and occasional concerts and student outing events including the zoo and six flags.",
            "The food for the most part is decent. There are a lot of different choices to choose from on campus. Since it is in the middle of downtown you have even more choices right outside of campus to choose from if campus food is not what you like.",
            "It is hard to get a room on campus and I honestly was never able to do so. Please look into this way ahead of time and explore the near by places to live if you are not able to live on campus as I did. The rooms are nice though from what Ive seen and the students are able to meet friends easier this way.",
            "The academics of the university is very high. They hold you at high expectations some studies more than others. They also require a lot from their students because they are trying to prepare you for life after college.",
            "Any students looking to attend this university should make sure they explore all of their options. It is important to have an idea of what exactly you want to do because you do not want to apply to schools that do not tend to your needs. This university has a lot of different subjects of study. Classes definitely fill up quickly and some are even overcrowded and you may not get in that semester. Be prepared for financial aid issues. Be on top of your aid at all times because for someone reason everybody goes through it at least onetime during their career here. I personally have gone through financial problems for two years.",
            "Georgia State University is a beautiful urban campus in the middle of downtown Atlanta, Ga. It is right near the Marta stations which is the largest form of transportation in Atlanta. It is very nontraditional and diverse."

I'd give them a 10 out of 10, so far., 604684=There are several different on campus eateries for students. Secondly, by being in the city your food choices are limitless. There is a man strip of food restaurants that most students eat at by the Aderhold building but all of them close at 6:00 for some reason., 201908=Every year in September, Dragon-con goes on a few blocks from the university, so for all those comicbook, sci-fi and anime fans, that's the place to be. There is a growing number of homeless people that hang around the campus. As disheartening as it may be, don't hesitate to report those who may become physical or violent., 731303=There are two official dining halls in the dorming communities at Georgia State, one in the freshmen dorms and one in the Piedmont North dorms. Both can be a bit pricey unless you have a meal plan, which is a little over $1000. In addition to the dining halls, there are many independently-owned & ethnic restaurants scattered among the well-known franchises such as Moe's and Tin Drum. Essentially, the dining atmosphere is almost as diverse as the student population., 191844=I like GSU because it's a nice school regardless of not having a traditional campus per se. I really enjoyed the atmosphere when I visited and am planning on attending for Fall 2012. The only thing that makes me a bit nervous is the intercity location and Atlanta isn't the safest, but no major city is., 1108673=Georgia State University is located downtown Atlanta! GSU has Greek Life! I pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc at GSU fall of 1979. GSU is a great school to attend!, 1087681=The campus is very safe. There are police boxes everywhere in case you need an escort around the campus. There are also police surveying the campus at all times. Like i said, the campus police do have an escort system as well. GSU escort: 404-413-2100, 164857=georgia state university has raised its tuition a lot since i started learning there in 2005, but compared to a private university it is still affordable with student loans., 269535=They have raised everything since I've started attending in Fall 2010, but you do get what you pay for. Although, you won't use it all. The fees here are huge, especially since we got a new football team last year. The housing is great for being right on campus in the middle of Atlanta, housing is always putting on events and such., 295120=- Go to Incept (orientation) - Register for your math and chem placement test before you go to incept so you can take the classes you want - Apply for Hope and other loans around January (that's when most money comes out) - Look for scholarships (they help a lot) - If you need a job, campus jobs are great to have - Go to ratemyprofessors when registering for classes - Join a club or go greek! Be involved at your school!, 284672=It is a very good school for financial aid and it is one of the least expensive research universities in the area. Between university grants, assistantships, scholarships, and the HOPE scholarship, all but $1000 of my tuition, housing, and supply costs are covered., 1076034=I'm a business major and this school is one of the best business school in Georgia! Thus, the fact that GSU is located in the heart of Atlanta there's a lot of internship opportunities. I'm an incoming freshman so I will experience the level of difficulty when classes start Aug. 26., 319142=Recently, GSU raised the cost of al of their student fees. I pay about $1500 per semester just in student fees and I think that is pretty ridiculous. It still cost less than a lot of universities, but the student fees are so bad., 10248=There is a huge contrast between college and high school curriculum-wise. At Georgia State University, and probably any college, the classes you take are like finishing a years work of a high school class in just one semester. Like any school every professor is different in how they teach the material. Some are funny and exciting, while others make students wish they'd stay in bed that morning. I've had both kinds of professors this past semester, and I must say that I've had days where it was fun learning something new about muscles for example in my Biology 1110 Lab. There were also days in my Bio Lecture when I had to fight to keep my eyes open, and my mind focused. Regardless of each situation, I've learned more than what I thought I could learn in one semester. My professors all had my best interest in mind which was to succeed in their classes. If I ever brought up a subject that I was unclear about, they all helped me in any way they could., 987881=Well, it's not unusual, but on Tuesdays and Thursdays there's is plaza time at 12:15 pm in the courtyard. Step shows and music are some of the things that happen.}",

Tips for prospective students I have just finished my first semester at Georgia State University. As a freshman, I joined a Freshman Learning Community (FLC), a program that introduces freshmen to the college community, and helps students meet new people. An FLC consists of about 24 students who have similar majors or career",
