If you are transfer student make sure you are determined and ready to face the challenges awaiting you. Overall it is a great school but they will not accept just any math transfer credits, they make it difficult for incoming students."

Broadway plays in Times Square or hop by the theatre on 23rd. Retail therapy is available in Union Square or by Penn Station (34th & Lexington)., 76074=As an out of state student, I feel like I could get a better education somewhere else for the price I am paying. Once I get in-state-residency rate come Fall of 2013 (which is considerably lower than out-of-state), I hopefully won't feel like I wasted time and money here., 256098=There came across a small mice inside the classroom in one of my classes in the year 2011.
