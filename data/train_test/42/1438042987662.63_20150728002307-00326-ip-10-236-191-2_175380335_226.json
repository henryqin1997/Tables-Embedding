The campus is filled with various beautiful trees and scenery., 992495=The dorm life is amazing!I had several friends that attended Sac State in 2008 so when I'd visit them I got to experience some of that life and it was extremely fun., 77556=The grass wasn't grass but mud, even in May. It smelled awful. It felt like a high school campus with lockers everywhere., 1001993=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 668851=A nice campus that has a ton of resources for students to use. There's friendly staff and students. The food there are so good and during the start of Fall 2013 Sac State will be opening a Starbucks!, 858485=I really like the food that we are provided with. Many times the school will give us the same type of food but I go trying out all the food there is and it is actually really good. There are hamburgers, pizza, beans, rice, lasagna, pasta, steak, and many more. What I do not like about our Dining is that they close pretty early. During the weekdays it closes at 8:00PM and in the weekends around 6:00PM., 633998=I know that there is a lot of things offered, from the aquatic center to things at the WELL (the gym on campus) if you are into that type of stuff. Some clubs like the ballroom dancing club offer things as well. Then there is Unique and they bring different things on campus so the students can enjoy, like this March they had a Taiko group performing., 663458=If you stay in the dorms, you have a meal plan. The courtyard market has some good sandwiches and pizza. The dining commons has good food but you get tired of it easily. It's buffet style so it's easy to gain Freshman 15. Starbucks will be opening Fall 2013., 61903=I haven't experienced dorm life yet, but will be experiencing in 2013}",
