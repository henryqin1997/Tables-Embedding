            "The campus is very safe! In case of any emergency, little blue kiosks can be found around campus, and with the touch of a button, will offer service from the nearest police officer!",
            "Many Fraternities and Sororities can be found around campus. Joining a frat or sorority can help you meet tons of new people!",
            "There are TONS of clubs offered here on campus (over 400!!). They offer clubs that will interest any student!",
            "I feel as though UNR is perfect for any type of student, but if you really hate cold weather, you might want to stay away!",
            "Do not wear anything associated with UNLV (University of Nevada, Las Vegas). There is a vary intense rivalry here and anything associated with UNLV will be frowned upon! :)",
            "For the price, the University of Nevada is perfect! I really feel as though the University of Nevada has become my home away from home!",
            "I personally love to go to the gym! They offer several different classes for anyone interested in getting a quick, or intense workout! The campus hosts several different activities to keep the students active, the most recent being a concert performed by Big Sean! Also not to far away is Tahoe, which offers various snow activities and a chance to visit beautiful hiking places and a gorgeous lake for when it gets warm!",
            "The food here is good, but it can be quite unhealthy. They offer a variety of choices in the buffet here on campus, and other franchises such as Panda express, Port of Subs, and Eienstein's Bagels can be found on campus.",
            "I definitely recommend living in the dorms for at least one of your college years! The dorms here are really nice and you get to meet a lot of new people!",
            "The classes here can be challenging! However, the professors really take their jobs seriously and strive to provide the students with a tier 1 education. Be prepared to do some studying!",
            "If you are not used to cold weather, be prepared for a wake-up call. Reno gets very cold, so I definitely recommend bringing heavy jackets intended for snowy days. The food here is good, but definitely get a Lombardi (on-campus gym) membership because the freshman 15 is real!",
            "University of Nevada, the preferred name of the school, is AWESOME! I would highly recommend this school; The education is tier 1 at an affordable price! I would rate this university a 8/10!"

He was one of the big four that in 1873 founded over 400 million dollars in ore and donated a lot of it to the university! One of the funniest traditions we have involves our statue of John Mackay. During finals week, students provide offerings to Mackay as good luck on their exams. You'll see him wearing sunglasses, boxer briefs, a bow tie, and other shenanigans. He was even painted blue during business week!, 145861=unr is a cheap college to begin with, but it also has many scholarships. for example, for incoming freshmen there is a scholarship matrix that awards a range of $1000-$2500 to each student depending on gpa and sat/act scores., 43197=If you are in the WUE program, this is a great school to go to. You save money and earn a degree at the same time. For financial aid such as a free ride for four years, do your research because this university offers that and apply really early whether or not you are sure you want to go to this school. Better safe than sorry. Because after that, financial aid is limited, you can get, a scholarship ranging from 1000 to 5000 base on your SAT, ACT Scores and GPA. If you qualify you can get a states grant and pell grant. Aside from that, you have to come up the rest out of your own pocket. Dont forget to budget some money for books, air fare or gas and personal needs when you move in either the dorms or an apartment. For books they have cheggs, you can rent your books there and the school also offers new and reused books, an option for you to choose from., 773013=There are several different residence halls to choose from and they all have unique features to them. I'm glad to be staying in the newest halls, The Living Learning Communities, they were built in 2012., 820497=The University of Nevada-Reno has been the foundation of my upper level education which has not only motivated me for even more education but also pursuing all opportunities that have been presented to me. It's a wonderful institution with encouraging professors who are academically supportive. I am proud to say I attend this university and it will be a triumphant day, this coming May, that I hold my degree in Biological Sciences from this university., 880868=The University of Nevada, Reno residential life, housing, and food service department has not been fair in its practices. I told the office over the phone that I had a family emergency where my sister had a roommate suddenly leave and she couldn't afford to live there without me moving in since the aforementioned roommate was paying for half of everything. The office informed me that I would not be refunded my $125 deposit and that I would owe 25% of the $2635 charge for the semester in the dorm, which means I'll lose $783.75 even though the move-in date isn't until this Sunday, January 19th. They offered to transfer my license agreement to the 2014-2015 academic year; however, I explained to them that this option wouldn't work since I begin pharmacy school in Colorado in August. Also, I spoke with the student I was assigned to live with, and she decided she no longer wanted a roommate. In other words, she chose to have the room all to herself, which means UNR won't be losing money because she'll be paying much more to be alone. Despite her filling this vacancy, UNR still expects me to pay the above-mentioned amount. I have no choice in paying because any financial aid covers UNR charges before I'm issued a refund check to use for food, gas, and other living expenses. Even if the student I was assigned to live with had still wanted a roommate, I believe this policy is unfair for students and the cancellation fee is ridiculously high. Moreover, this policy is not written on the housing application, but referenced in one sentence on the bottom of the last page in conveniently smaller font. Interestingly, I couldn't find this information anywhere on their website, but succeeded with an Internet search. Additionally, the Parking Services department informed me that there was a waiting list for the dorm garage because the faculty garage was full and some faculty were parking in the dorm garage now. This garage, meant for Sierra Hall dorm students, has 6 people on its wait list thanks to this situation. Finally, I'd like to provide a link that discusses issues students have had with meal plans, which are supervised by the same department that controls the dorms (http://unrforliberty.com/2008/06/lets-talk-about-greed-unr-housing-and_25.html). Please note that the article was written on June 25th, 2008 and demonstrates how long this problem has been around. I think at least hundreds of students, if not more, have been affected because 2440 students lived in the dorms for the 2012-2013 academic year. I wouldn't be surprised if many were forced to stay because they couldn't afford losing almost $800. I have contacted all local news stations with the hope that they will make the public aware of how this university mistreats its students because I don't see any other way for a significant change to manifest itself., 159765=reno is well known for its proximity to lake tahoe and the many ski resorts that are nearby. reno also is great place for hiking, biking, kayaking, and riding motorcycles or quads on our vast amount of public land. there are also numerous festivals and events that are world famous. hot august nights for those that are car fans, burning man for the more free spirit, and so many more. don't forget that we get quite warm in the summer so there are many activities that involve swimming, water sports, and camping. for those that are more into staying indoors there are many art museums, movie theaters, or performing art performances. reno offers so much more than the cliche spirits and gaming. we even have a rock wall that stretches dozens of feet above downtown reno looking over our biggest little city arch. reno also has the great feeling of being in a large city but really have the benefits of not being too big and there are many organized events downtown monthly such as pub crawls and wine walks., 42036=Apply early, especially your admission application process; you can start as early as Nov, second quarter of your senior year. There is also a living learning communities for students who are in nursing, engineering women and much more. If you want to be a part of it, do your research and apply early because spaces are limited. There is a honors programs, as well as a Trio scholars program. For meal plan I recommend Premium C or D, you would not need that many swipes a week. The DC cafe has good variety of food available to choose from. Don't buy your books early, wait until you went to your classes for a week. Student usually will change their minds, whether they like the class or not and would often drop and switch to another class. Some class would not require you to need your book. Look for good deals for books, there is a lot out there, such as amazon., 100621=The best dorms on campus are Argenta Hall, Canada Hall and Sierra Hall. I currently live in Argenta Hall and I love it. The room is spacious and it comes with a full bathroom inside. Argenta Hall is majority for Freshman, while Canada Hall and Sierra are for upperclassman. The best thing about Argenta is how the dining hall on the first floor of the building so you don't even have to leave the building to go get food. UNR is currently building new residence halls for the semester of Fall 2012. Overall, dorm life at UNR is more than what I had expected., 564258=I am part of Greek life on campus and I love it. It is a way for me to get involved and develop relationships with wonderful women in college. It's my home away from home and I love it. Also going to college in the city of Reno is great, there are always events going on and things to go to like the rib cook off, hot august night, street vibrations and so much more., 371453=There are so many cool traditions since the University has been around since 1874. I love providing offerings to the Mackay statue before finals and watching the Wolf pack beat the Rebels each fall for the Freemont cannon., 503204=Every year a group of students march up to the N and re-paint it., 986263=The rigor can vary depending on how many classes you take per semester. I took 5 classes for the past fall 2014 semester and it was definitely too much. Each class really will demand your time and effort to do well and retain the material! I would not suggest doing more than 4 classes (full-time) per semester; with four it is easier to have a balanced schedule and not feel so overwhelmed, especially if you work!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Though many of the introductory courses are large lecture classes, the vast majority are taught by faculty, not teaching assistants. Professors are generally very accessible and constantly encourage students to come to office hours. Unless of course you prefer to remain anonymous, in this way, it is possible to get to know all of your professors, which in my opinion greatly enriches the learning experience. For those wishing to challenge themselves academically, the university has an honors program, which offers smaller, more demanding classes for highly motivated students. In addition, UNR is considered one of the top research institutions in the country. For those with an interest in doing undergraduate research, most science faculty are eager to share their research and are more than willing to welcome undergraduates into their labs.
