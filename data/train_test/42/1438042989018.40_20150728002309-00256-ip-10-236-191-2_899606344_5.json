Professors don't know how to get it across and become frustrated what part of 3 days missed, or don't turn in your work do people not understand. If you are not up for the challenge don't waste your parents money.",

The dorms look like a resort with furnished kitchens and living room and bedrooms. There is a pool and jacuzzi and bbq grills to use, also a fire pit for bonfires. There is even a gym for dorm residents. The dorms are not in the campus but a 5 min walk away. The school is working on dorm on campus; they will be built by 2016}",

    "textAfterTable": "The best art school one can get their BFA at. Otis cranks out geniuses and the next leaders in their fields. Graduates are currently employed at Vera Wang, Anthropologie, Armani Exchange, basically everything in the design field will have an Otis Alumni behind the wheel. It is worth the extensive amount of torture and pain the student will inevitably go through. What to do for fun What is fun? Food and Dining Food is overpriced. 'Nuff said. The cafeteria owner takes full advantage of the fact that no Otis student has time to even cook. Although the food there is very unhealthy, it is hearty and wholesome and will probably be the only place your money will go. And will probably be your only meal of the day, unless you are fortunate enough to live at home. Dorm Life Not the traditional dorm life. People will treasure their sleep, so please be quiet. Dorms is in the Five star luxury complex called Playa Del Oro. Comes with a 24hour fully equipped gym, sauna, lockers, jacuzzi, pool, basically everything you will never have the chance to use due to the academic rigor Otis demands of its students. RA's will demolish any hopes of partying,",
