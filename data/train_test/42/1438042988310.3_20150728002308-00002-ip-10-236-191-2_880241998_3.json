In their place, the team signed Sergio P\u00e9rez fresh from McLaren, whilst H\u00fclkenberg returned from a year out at Sauber. Results were consistent but not stellar during the year, leaving the team with a healthy points haul but a disappointing championship finish. Force India retained their driver lineup for 2015, hoping for a stronger season to come., 3658=The team made a habit of running a driver for a year before promoting him to the test driver seat, with Paul di Resta arriving in 2011 and Nico H\u00fclkenberg in 2012. Di Resta drove for them for three years, partnered initially with Adrian Sutil, then Nico, then Sutil again in 2013. Performance has gradually improved from the wrong end of the field towards the midfield, and the team have been close to picking up their first podium on several occasions., 2146=The Force India team can trace its origins all the way back to Jordan, the strikingly yellow-liveried outfit founded by Eddie Jordan. From 1991 to 2005, Jordan Grand Prix participated in Formula One, taking a couple of victories at the hands of Damon Hill and Heinz-Harald Frentzen. In their later years, Giancarlo Fisichella took Jordan to a surprise victory in Brazil., 12834=Hans-Joachim Stuck picked up his first trophy in Germany, 1977 - but how many did he collect altogether?, 21916=\u00a9 Copyright 2006-2015 Christine Blachford. All rights reserved., 1690=Force India have seen a period of stability in their current guise, having been sold from one owner to the next until Vijay Mallya took control. A gradual improvement in results has also been seen, with the team pushing at the higher end of the midfield results. For 2014 onwards, they saw Nico H\u00fclkenberg return to them after a year out, and Sergio P\u00e9rez arriving after a disappointing stint at McLaren., 3230=Indian entrepreneur Vijay Mallya and Dutch businessman Michiel Mol formed a consortium that bought the team, and for the 2008 season, they renamed it Force India. Towards the end of 2011, the Sahara India company bought a significant stake in the team, equalling Mallya\u2019s 42.5% with Mol\u2019s stake reduced to 15%. The team was then rebranded as Sahara Force India, with the two logos combining on the side of the car., 2530=When the finances began to get tight, and their engine deal fell through, Jordan sold the team to the Midland Group. They raced as Jordan for 2005, but were rebranded Midland MF1 Racing for the following season. Midland only participated in one season, picking up zero points, before the team were sold on again.}",
