The New Zealander\u2019s last F1 WC win, at the 1968 Belgium GP, was the first F1 WC victory for a McLaren car., 63848=(The youngest driver to start was Jaime Alguersuari, 19-plus-125-days old, at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. Michael Schumacher will be 42 in January.), 87405=Ferrari have started the last 456 races. McLaren started the last 449 races since failing to qualify for the 1983 Monaco GP. Williams have started the last 466 since joining in the boycott of the 1982 San Marino GP, which is the last race McLaren skipped deliberately. (The teams that withdrew from the 2005 USA GP count as having retired, not as DNSs.), 28772=Ludovico Scarfiotti\u00a0\u00a0The Italian had been driving in F1 since 1963. Scarfiotti was killed on the 8th of June, 1968, at a hillclimb event in the German Alps., 26002=Graham Hill\u00a0\u00a0Norman Graham Hill drove in F1 from 1958 to 1975. A very bad crash at the 1969 USA GP in a Lotus-Ford mangled his legs, such that his return to F1 was an amazing achievement, but he was never to return to full competitiveness. He died in November, 1975, crashing the plane he was attempting to land in foggy conditions., 87773=Ferrari Constructors titles were won in 1961, 1964, 1975 to 1977, 1979, 1982, 1983, 1999 to 2004, 2007 and 2008., 73940=The dispute rumbled on into 1965, with the cars back in scarlet but entered (as Scuderia Ferrari) by team manager, Eugenio Dragoni, in the first race in South Africa (held on 1st January with second round, Monaco, not until May 30th). NART-entered Ferraris appeared again in the USA and Mexico at the end of the \u201965 season, this time to run Pedro Rodriguez on Firestone tyres, bypassing the contract with Dunlop. Lorenzo Bandini led the \u2018official\u2019 team., 59199=In 2009, he finished third for Peugeot in the Monte Carlo Rally, fourth in 2010 (both were rounds of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge). St\u00e9phane has been driving for Peugeot in their diesel-fueled Le Mans prototypes since 2007, winning, with Pedro Lamy, the 2007 Le Mans series, and getting second places in the 2007 and 2009 Le Mans 24 Hours., 60563=However, this is not the best performance by a driver in both Monte Carlo events. Louis Chiron in 1931 became the only Monaco-born driver to win the Monaco Grand Prix, and won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1954., 58391=The World Rally Championship was only a manufacturers\u2019 championship until for its seventh season, in 1979, the World Rally Championship for Drivers was introduced. The first ex-Formula One driver to score points was Frenchman, St\u00e9phane Sarrazin. His F1 racing career consisted of substituting for Luca Badoer with Minardi at the 1999 Brazilian GP, resulting in a retirement. He was test-driver with Prost \u201999 to \u201901, and with Toyota in 2002., 84534=All the rounds since Ferrari have competed in, with Michael Schumacher winning five titles 2000 to 2004, plus Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in 2007., 87899=(It was Dima (thank you) in the comments that pointed out I had missed that Scuderia Ferrari withdrew from the 1950 French GP and that only a private Ferrari started. I have since given this article a partial rewrite after the Ferrari Market Letter showed an interest in publishing the post.), 33036=Huge credit must go to Jackie Stewart for campaigning for an end to often senseless and avoidable deaths in a time when many criticised him thinking danger was part of the show, and that no one was forcing drivers to drive. It took bravery to race, and it took bravery to speak out even if called a coward. Much as it pains me to admit it, Max Mosley did much to improve safety, but only after the deaths of Ratzenberger and Senna, followed by Wendlinger\u2019s life-threatening crash at Monaco a fortnight later, made the issue so obvious. The question is has safety gone too far? I certainly do not want F1 returned to a blood-sport but the acres of run-off we see today are too forgiving. It is good to see races like Monaco or Suzuka where drivers making mistakes result in a damaged or stranded car, not just a quick detour over a car-park\u2019s worth of asphalt. Jacques Villeneuve was castigated for complaining about the over-reaction to Olivier Panis breaking his legs at Montreal in 1997, pointing out people break their legs skiing. (Panis was asked about this when he became Villeneuve\u2019s team-mate at BAR and pointed out that when he was in hospital, the only driver to phone him to ask how he was doing was Villeneuve.), 24660=Jim Clark\u00a0\u00a0Clark was killed in a wet F2 race at Hockenheim on the 7th April, 1968. He had already won the opening GP in South Africa plus the last two of the 1967 season with Lotus., 20777=After Button\u2019s wins earlier this season, Lewis made a comment that Jenson\u2019s approach was giving him easier results whilst he was doing it the hard way, and needed to take that on board. Hamilton has since led two McLaren one-twos and does seem to have hemmed in his naturally aggressive approach. Today, it did not pay. His first-lap attempt to pass Vettel seemed indecisive, the sort of move to either totally go for it or do not, whereas Lewis went half up the inside and unsurprisingly was chopped. His hesitation over if to pass the medical car caused the offence. If he had kept his foot in, he would have reached the relevent line first. Back in 2007 when rookie, Hamilton, was given the drive at McLaren, he told how it was conditional on 1000 hours on the simulator, a heavy gym regime, and learning all the rules thoroughly. He really should have known the rule without thinking to push for the line without hesitation, ready to fall back straight away if not over it soon enough., 27650=Denny Hulme\u00a0\u00a0He raced in F1 from 1965 to 1974. In 1970, his team-mate, friend and fellow Kiwi, Bruce McLaren, was killed, and Hulme had his hands and feet badly burned after an accident in practice for the Indianapolis 500. Subsequently, he toned down his aggressive approach unless victory was in the offing. He took to Australian touring cars in the 1980s, suffering a heart attack during the 1992 Bathurst 1000. Denny was able to pull the car over but died before reaching hospital., 62762=Chiron sustained serious burns in a Maserati-Plat\u00e9 at the non-championship Syracuse GP, missing all the 1952 WC races. In the second year of the World Championship being run to F2 rules, he entered a private O.S.C.A. in four rounds, not starting twice, and a best of tenth., 40562=With S\u00e9bastien Buemi leading at the end of lap 14, by dint of staying out of the pits for longer than everyone in front, he became the first Swiss driver to lead a Grand Prix since Clay Regazzoni at the 1979 British Grand Prix. That race at Silverstone marked the very first win for the Williams team, with Alan Jones leading until his water pump failed, giving victory to his team-mate. It was Regazzoni\u2019s last win after four earlier victories for Ferrari. In 1980, he was paralysed from the waist down after a crash in an Ensign at Long Beach., 71409=That there was a USA Grand Prix in 1961, given to Watkins Glen at a few weeks notice to replace a scheduled Formula Libre race, had much to do with American driver, Phil Hill\u2019s success in that year\u2019s title-chase. Hill won the round before at Monza, tragically clinching the title due to his team-mate, Wolfgang von Trips, being killed in the race in an accident that took the lives of fourteen spectators. Ferrari declined increased offers of starting money, and Phil Hill attended as Grand Marshall but could not race. Enzo Ferrari probably would have been more than happy to take the cash but the shockwaves in Italy over the deaths at Monza left little choice but to not attend., 63696=After retirement, Chiron was asked to run the Monte Carlo Rally and the Monaco Grand Prix, which he did until 1979, the year of his death., 29976=Jackie Oliver\u00a0\u00a0Jackie drove in F1 from 1967 to 1973 and in 1977. He won Le Mans and the Can-Am championship, but is probably best known for running the Arrows team for many years., 83431=Tambay remained the sole Ferrari driver for Austria and Switzerland (held at Dijon, France). At the latter weekend, he had a trapped nerve in his back and had to withdraw. Mario Andretti joined the team for Monza and took pole. Rene Arnoux had been signed to drive the scarlet cars in 1983 and the Tifosi had already taken him to their hearts, perhaps because of the famous battle for second between Arnoux and Villeneuve at the 1979 GP. So when Arnoux won for Renault with Tambay and Andretti second and third, instead of being disappointed, the Tifosi just treated it as a Ferrari 1-2-3!, 27207=Jackie Stewart\u00a0\u00a0Stewart drove in 99 F1 WC races, from 1965 to 1973, winning 27 rounds and three titles. He withdrew from his last event, the USA GP, after the death of his Tyrrell team-mate, Fran\u00e7ois Cevert (not included in this list as his F1 career began in 1970). In the 1966 Belgium GP, a first lap crash saw him trapped in his car soaked in fuel, after which he became an outspoken safety campaigner., 63566=Louis Chiron had a terrible time at Le Mans, entering nine times between 1928 and 1953, failing to finish each time., 14536=Johnny Herbert had signed a five-year contract with Team Lotus, racing for them from 1991 to face the years of their decline. Flavio Briatori was running Benetton, and owned 85% of Ligier, when Lotus sold Herbert\u2019s contract to him as a late act of financial desperation. Johnny switched to driving for Ligier for the European GP at Jerez, before switching the next race to Benetton to partner Michael Schumacher for the last two rounds, through to the end of 1995. The deal was done with such haste that Frenchman, \u00c9ric Bernard, only found out he was out of his drive after arriving at the Spanish circuit. However, Lotus had not had time to find a replacement, so Bernard, in what proved to be his last F1 race, unexpectedly found himself subbing for the Norwich team, explaining to the media that they were very nice to him., 28166=Chris Irwin\u00a0\u00a0In May of 1968, London-born driver, Irwin, lost control of the unpredictable Ford P68 sports prototype avoiding a hare in practice for the 1000km N\u00fcrburgring. He suffered horrific head injuries and never drove again. He was disfigured and lost his memory of his family life before the accident. Chris broke up with his wife, disappearing from his family and any racing connections, only re-emerging slightly in recent years. Irwin made an appearance at Thruxton\u2019s 40th anniversary celebrations in April 2008, giving a short interview to Motorsport magazine., 34273=The incident that enraged me was that after Kubica\u2019s violent Canada crash in 2007, he traveled two weeks later to Indianapolis, was medically examined, given the all-clear, and he was still told that he could not race! Why the hell did they have him go all that way to be examined if however well he seemed, he was still not to be excluded? Surely, the logical extension of being that precautionary is no one races? Even if it makes me sound like an old fart, I do not want F1 drivers, or any adult, subjected to that level of nannying., 72746=The reason cited for non-attendance in France was industrial action. Ferrari did not have any drivers in contention so skipped the last two rounds. It was quite a spread of dates with Monza on 16th September, Watkins Glen on 7th October, and the title-decider between Graham Hill and Jim Clark (East London, first GP in South Africa), not until 29th December., 75624=Ferrari driver, Lorenzo Bandini, had been killed at Monaco in horrific circumstances during the 1967 race. He had gone wide after clipping the chicane following the tunnel (then more a bridge than a tunnel), hit a post on the harbour-side barely protected by a straw-bale, and the car crashed to the other side of the track upside-down with the ruptured tank turning it into a fireball. The marshals took an age to do anything not having the clothing to approach the inferno or suitable extinguishers, and between the noise of the passing cars racing unabated, Bandini could be heard screaming. Eventually, charred and smashed, he was dragged out to die three days later in hospital. The death of von Trips had drawn censure from the Italian government and the Vatican, and Bandini\u2019s death caused another national uproar of flak in Ferrari\u2019s direction. Safety standards were reported to be the reason Ferrari did not attend Monaco in \u201968, but the Commodore never seemed to consider driver-safety a priority. Drivers were often goaded into pushing harder by being berated for not trying, or having their car turn up late for practice if out of favour within the team, despite the deaths this contributed to. Had they gone to Monaco in \u201968 and had another tragedy, the Italian backlash might have been unsustainable, so it was about the safety of the team, not the drivers., 62357=In the first year of the World Championship Louis drove for Maserati, retiring at Silverstone, and his only points finish being a third at his home-race, Monaco. In 1951, he struggled on with customer-car teams finishing seventh in a Maserati in round one in Switzerland, and a sixth place (points only went down to fifth) the only non-retirement in a Talbot-Lago for the rest of the season., 61953=Post-war, it seemed to slip the Mon\u00e9gasque\u2019s mind he had retired in 1938, and there was a shortage of drivers and racing machinery (the F1 World Championship was not won by a driver that started his racing post-war until Mike Hawthorn in 1958). Louis Chiron won the French Grand Prix for Talbot-Lago in 1947 and 1949, setting what was then a record of winning that event four times., 23373=I was reading the May edition of Motorsport magazine, which was the 60th F1 World Championship anniversary edition. It included a quote from Jackie Stewart, \u201cKeep in mind the statistics at the time, between \u201968 and \u201973 for example, provided a driver like myself with a one-in-three chance of living and a two-in-three chance of being killed.\u201d I have heard and read statistics for that period of that shocking nature before, and wondered how they calculated them, and how accurate the figures were. Thus this quote has persuaded me to do my own analysis., 19610=Misery-guts Alonso did get on my nerves. He had a point about Hamilton essentially getting away with over-taking the medical car but also manages to believe there was nothing undeserving about his Singapore win in 2008. I would love to have been a fly on the wall when he was told the nine drivers punished for exceeding their delta-times were given mere five-second penalties. It is obviously very difficult for the stewards and race-director to be on top of everything with such a plethora of information from a high-speed event, but surely there are ways to streamline this? One would think that a computer could be programmed to automatically log the aforementioned safety-car period violations. With modern telecommunications, a group of assigned observers based anywhere in the developed world could sort through data and video-footage, not making decisions but quickly assembling the relevent evidence for the decision-makers to judge on. Where the heck did these five-second penalties come from? Previous information, such as after Monaco, was that the only available punishment post-race was a drive-through translated into a 25-second penalty., 43570=For those that do not know, \u201cThe Wall of Champions\u201d, was christened thus after the 1999 Canadian GP. In the race, World Champions Ricardo Zonta (BAR), Damon Hill (Jordan), Michael Schumacher (Ferrari) and Jacques Villeneuve (BAR) all retired from the race after hitting that wall. Zonta, with Klaus Ludwig (AMG Mercedes), had won the 1998 FIA GT World Championship. The reigning F1, and only other, World Champion, Mika Hakkinen, went and spoilt it by winning the race., 25519=Jackie Ickx\u00a0\u00a0Ickx raced in F1 from 1967 to 1979 with eight wins and 2nd in the title-chase in \u201969 and \u201970. He retired from sportscar racing in 1985 having won six times at Le Mans. His worst accident was in an Ensign in the 1976 USA GP when he hurt his ankles and legs., 31026=This all amounts to a depressing catalogue of death and injury. Oddly, no one on the list survived the period in question to be killed in a racing-car accident later. Out of eighteen drivers, ten died in accidents, and Irwin had such a bad crash he never raced again, whilst Hill was never fully competitive again. Not quite a two-thirds fatality rate but most drivers would have raced for more than six years, so it stands as a representative figure (not driving for Lotus improved the odds). Of course, not all the tragedies were in F1-cars, but in those days racing in other disciplines was part of the career plan, and probably the contract. Three on the list died in F1 cars in this period, plus three not on the list. The worst spell was April to July, 1968, when Clark, Spence, Scarfiotti, and Schlesser were lost, as well as Irwin\u2019s terrible smash. McLaren and Courage both lost their lives in June, 1970., 63056=Paired with Swiss driver, Ciro Basadonna, Chiron won the 1954 Monte Carlo Rally in a Lancia Aurelia GT. He made a Grand Prix return in 1955 at Monaco, in what was to be his last start. In a factory Lancia D50 he finished sixth in front of his home crowd. This makes Louis Chiron, then aged 55-plus-292-days, the oldest driver to start a World Championship race. He made two more entries in customer Maseratis for Monaco, but in \u201956 he withdrew after the engine blew, and in \u201958 failed to qualify., 56152=(Addendum: It is red-faced I have to correct this entry with the information that Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was not the first driver to score World Championship points in both Formula One and Rallying, Carlos Reutemann was. I cast my eye down all the WRC driver-points lists from 1979 onwards looking for familiar F1-names, so that I missed Carlos not once but twice is very embarrassing. Carlos Reutemann, from Argentina, raced in Formula One from 1972 to 1982. He drove for Brabham, Ferrari, Lotus and Williams, winning 12 Grands Prix, beaten by a single point by Nelson Piquet for the 1981 World Championship. He entered just two rounds of the WRC, the 1980 Rally Argentina in a Fiat 131 Abarth, and the 1985 Rally Argentina in a Peugeot 205, very impressively finishing third in both, so remains the only driver with podiums in F1 and WRC. I include a longer profile of Reutemann here, with this link also at the end of this entry.), 81862=He never did. In the final burst of qualifying at the next event in Belgium at Zolder, Gilles went out on qualifying tyres that he had already had the best of to make up a tenth of a second on Didier. He came across Jochen Mass\u2019s March who tried to get out the way. Mass went to the left as Villeneuve did, then Jochen pulled to the right just as Villeneuve decided to go right, flying over the March right-rear wheel launching him into a bank. The front of the car was smashed away, Villeneuve was thrown out and killed. The team withdrew from the race., 30186=Lucien Bianchi\u00a0\u00a0The Belgium had driven in F1, 1959 to 1965, returning with a regular drive for most races in 1968 with Cooper. He had a fatal accident in an Alfa Romeo in testing for Le Mans in March, 1969., 26365=Jo Siffert\u00a0\u00a0Siffert was killed on the 24th October, 1971, in the last non-Championship F1 race of the year, the Rothmans Victory Race at Brands Hatch. His front suspension was damaged in a first lap incident and later failed, throwing his car into a bank. The Swiss driver was trapped in the wreckage and asphyxiated from the fire. This lead to on-board fire extinguishers becoming mandatory, as well as an emergency piped-air supply for drivers., 25819=Chris Amon\u00a0\u00a0The New Zealand driver famed in F1 history for how many times he led WC races only for something to go wrong, drove in F1 from 1963 to 1976., 77258=In 1968, Enzo Ferrari had secured the future of the marque by selling Ferrari to FIAT in a deal that guaranteed him control of the racing team. 1969 was a restructuring year in which only Chris Amon raced for the team until the British Grand Prix. There he was joined by Pedro Rodr\u00edguez, the team skipped Germany at short notice, and Amon had left by the next round at Monza. Rodr\u00edguez was entered in Canada, USA and Mexico by Luigi Chinetti\u2019s North American Racing Team. Only an older car, not used since the second round at Spain, was sent over, attended to by Chinetti\u2019s mechanics, in what seems to have been a cheap way to collect on the large starting and prize money for the American events., 30424=Others that were occasional F1 drivers or became regulars during this period were also killed. Schlesser\u2019s death on 7th July, 1968, has already been mentioned. Mois\u00e9s Solana competed in six Mexico GPs and two USA GPs from 1963 to 1968, dieing in July, 1969, in a hill-climb. Italian, Ignazio Giunti did four races for Ferrari in 1970, driving a Maranello machine when cut down in January, 1971, in the 1000 km Buenos Aires. Roger Williamson was killed at Zandvoort in July, 1973, in only the Brit\u2019s second GP for March. Cervert was killed at Watkins Glen at the last round of \u201973., 31954=Certainly, this was one of Formula One\u2019s most dangerous times, as was \u201957 to \u201960. For 1961 to 1965, F1 engines were lower powered 1\u00b75 litre capacity, and many teams struggled to find suitable three-litre units in \u201966 and \u201967 before the Ford Cosworth DFV became available to all. Nine drivers were killed in F1-related accidents 1974 to 1982, which averages out at one a year, so safety improvements were pegging the increases in speed. The introduction of carbon-fibre and safety improvements after 1982, when Gilles Villeneuve and Riccardo Paletti were killed as well as Didier Pironi suffering career-ending leg-injuries, made a big difference. Subsequently, Elio de Angelis\u2019s demise, testing for Brabham in \u201986, was the only fatality until the fateful weekend in May 1994, when Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna died at Imola. That was sixteen years ago and safety has improved much since then, but the death of Henry Surtees in F2, and Felipe Massa\u2019s near-miss last year in Hungary, show us the next driver-fatality is only a matter of time and bad luck., 69043=In 1957, the Pescara Grand Prix (about halfway down the East coast of Italy) was held for the only time, which at 15.89 miles remains the longest ever circuit used. For some reason, Ferrari only sent one car for Luigi Musso. It should also be noted that all entries in \u201956 and \u201957 were Lancia-Ferraris, after at the end of 1955, Lancia had withdrawn and handed their cars and designer to Scuderia Ferrari. Juan Manuel Fangio won the World Championship for the team in 1956., 23940=The first thing is to compile a list of drivers that were regular competitors in Formula One from 1968 to 1973. I have excluded, for example, Jack Brabham and John Surtees as both retired before the end of this period. I have also excluded Jo Schlesser, killed in the early laps of the wet 1968 French GP in the experimental air-cooled Honda, as he was not a regular F1 driver, his only earlier starts being in the F2 class in \u201966 and \u201967 at the German GPs at the N\u00fcrburgring. Drivers that joined anything but soon after the start of \u201968 have also not been included. This leaves me with a list of eighteen drivers who either competed throughout these six years, or might have if not killed or injured., 41128=It was the second race in a row that Hamilton led Button home. The last time there were two consecutive 1-2s for British drivers (or indeed for drivers of any single nation) was in 1999. David Coulthard (McLaren-Mercedes) beat Eddie Irvine (Ferrari) to second at the British Grand Prix, with Irvine besting Coulthard the following race in Austria. The last English one-two before this season was Monaco 1968, when Graham Hill, in a Lotus-Ford Cosworth, beat Richard Attwood\u2019s BRM., 67095=Since the World Championship only otherwise had European races for several years, the Indianapolis 500 was officially included from 1950 to 1960 to make the series look more intercontinental. The only notable crossover was in 1952, when Alberto Ascari missed the first-round Swiss Grand Prix to compete for Ferrari at Indianapolis. Piero Taruffi won for the team at Bremgarten; Ascari managed only 40 laps before retiring with a wheel problem at the Brickyard, but returned to Europe to win all six remaining European rounds (with only the best four scores counting). So Ferrari became the first team to compete in all rounds in a season of the World Championship. However, none were Formula One as in 1952 and 1953, Formula Two rules were adopted to generate better fields. Ascari then won the first three F2 rounds in \u201953 on the way to a second title. This was nine wins-in-a-row, or seven as round-two at Indianapolis \u201953 was missed., 28959=Jean-Pierre Beltoise\u00a0\u00a0This Paris-born driver won eleven national motorcycle titles before his F1 career from 1966 to 1974. Beltoise then raced in French touring cars until the \u2018eighties. He still ice-races. He had a horrible crash at the 1964 Reims 12-hour race, breaking his arms and legs in sixteen places, with the result that movement in one of his arms was thereafter restricted., 73119=Ferrari managed full attendance in 1963 and John Surtees won the title for the team in 1964, but not in a scarlet Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari had a huge row with the Automobile Club d\u2019Italia when they would not back him over his dispute with FIA over homologation of the Ferrari 250LM for sports-car racing, relinquished his Italian entrants licence, and swore his cars would never race in red again. The ACI did not bend so the Ferraris were entered in the last two rounds by Luigi Chinetti, a successful dealer for the marque in America, under the North American Racing Team banner, with the cars in USA racing colours of blue-and-white., 79476=Nicki Lauda was still critically ill in hospital after his fiery N\u00fcrburgring accident. Enzo Ferrari threw a tantrum over James Hunt having his Spanish win reinstated on appeal, and announced he was withdrawing from the World Championship, almost leading to the cancellation of Austria. They were back with Regazzoni the round after. Lauda returned for Italy, annoyed Reuterman had already been signed to replace him for 1977, in which year Lauda won his second title for Ferrari. Jody Scheckter won the team\u2019s next drivers\u2019 title in 1979., 60783=Born in 1899, Chiron\u2019s career spanned the Second World War. He won his first local race in 1926. By 1928, he was driving for Bugatti and won the Spanish Grand Prix. In 1929, he came seventh in a Delage in the Indianapolis 500. The first European Drivers Championship was in 1931 featuring only three rounds, Louis winning the French Grand Prix in a shared drive with Achille Varzi. He competed again for Bugatti in 1932, finishing fifth-equal in the title-chase. The European Championship did not reappear until 1935, in which he was ninth driving for Scuderia Ferrari (then running Alfa Romeos). He then gave his services to Mercedes, but in 1936 they only entered Chiron in two \u2018Championship races, netting two retirements, and they did not keep him for long. Chiron had won over a dozen major non-Championship Grands Prix, but after 1934, his career seemed to peter out with his only subsequent semi-notable pre-war victory being the 1937 French GP in a Talbot-Lago, which that year was held for sportscars without a strong field., 29622=Piers Courage\u00a0\u00a0Eton-educated Courage lost his life on the 21st June, 1970, at the wheel of a Frank Williams-entered De Tomaso, crashing in the Dutch GP at Zandvoort. With magnesium parts, the car burned so fiercely that nearby trees were incinerated but his death was probably due to being hit by a wheel during the impact., 25222=Mike Spence\u00a0\u00a0After Clark\u2019s death in April, Spence took over his Lotus for the Indianapolis 500. The Englishman was killed when he took a team-mate\u2019s car out for a few shakedown laps, losing control and hitting the wall. He died a few days later on the 7th May, 1968., 41622=The Canadian result also puts the McLaren drivers first and second in the title-chase. McLaren were last in this enviable position after the China Grand Prix in 2007, with Hamilton ahead of Alonso, before R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen pinched the title in Brazil. We have to go back to 1969 for the previous time British drivers were first and second in the points-standing. Jackie Stewart (Matra-Ford Cosworth) dominated the season giving him his first of three titles, but otherwise it was a very open year. Graham Hill for Lotus finished second to Stewart at the first race in South Africa, and won the third in Monaco (his last F1 WC podium). This gave him enough points to hang on to second for Holland and France, before Bruce McLaren overhauled him in Britain. It was that year in the USA GP that Hill had the accident that smashed his legs, from which he never fully recovered., 27066=Jo Bonnier\u00a0\u00a0The Swedish driver was killed driving a yellow Lola in the 1972 Le Mans 24 Hours on the 11th June., 78777=Phil Hill and John Surtees had both found out when they joined Ferrari that the main emphasis was often on Le Mans, back in the \u2018sixties a bigger event than any Grand Prix, and success there selling more cars to raise money for Enzo Ferrari\u2019s racing. After 1973, works involvement in sports-cars ended to concentrate on Formula One. Thus Ferrari were back in force challenging for the title in 1974, with Nicki Lauda winning it in \u201975., 29374=Pedro Rodr\u00edguez\u00a0\u00a0One of two racing brothers, Ricardo was killed in the non-championship 1962 Mexican GP. Pedro died in an Interserie sportscar race at the Norisring, Germany, on 11 July 1971, driving a Ferrari., 59567=Stirling Moss, subsequently winner of 16 World Championship Formula One races and World Championship runner-up four times, finished second in the 1952 Monte Carlo Rally, driving a Sunbeam-Talbot in a one-off appearance. (His sister, Pat Moss, a winner of international rallies, only managed a best of third in 1967.) The modern WRC events centre around the Special Stages, that is fast timed runs on closed stages. Old rallies featured long runs on public roads, and arduous hours, over several days. Often this featured timing-points that the competitors had to reach at set times as well as speed-test stages. With Moss\u2019s experience in events such as the Mille Miglia, an open-road endurance event he had first entered for Jaguar the year before, doing the blue riband rally probably did not seem so different. Stirling went on to win the Monaco Grand Prix three times., 84691=It is often the case that F1 statistics depend on how one counts them. I have chosen to include the five races that featured North American Racing Team entries but no Scuderia Ferrari entries, as they were surely on behalf of the official team. With twenty-eight races missed, I still make it one race premature that Scuderia Ferrari celebrated the eight-hundred at the 2010 Turkey Grand Prix, but Whitehead\u2019s private-entry at Reims in 1950 does give them 800 as constructors. This would still only be 799 Grands Prix as the 1952 Indy 500 was not a GP. Fifteen of the races in \u201952 and \u201953 were Formula Two (so Ascari never was Formula One World Champion). The fourteen races in 1956 and 1957 were with Lancia cars, but entered as Lancia Ferraris. This would only be 764 F1 World Championship Grands Prix that Scuderia Ferrari had at least one pure Ferrari in, but what the heck, let us not rain on the parade and call it eight-hundred., 13392=Congratulations to Lotus Racing on their ninth race. Not only are they not Team Lotus but even their connection to Group Lotus (who make the road-cars) seems tenuous. I do not want to seem too disparaging as they look to be the most promising of the new teams, with no reason why the years should not bring success. Statistically, I do not think their figures should be lumped together with those for Team Lotus anymore than would happen with the two entirely separate ATS teams (one a 1963 spin-off of disgruntled ex-Ferrari personnel including Phil Hill, and the other racing in F1 from 1978 to 1984 to promote the German wheel-manufacturer that owned the team). Lotus Racing are not the first to re-use the Lotus name to aid sponsorship. The descent of the once great Team Lotus to its F1-extinction after the 1994 season was itself ignominious enough. The Pacific team had entered F1 in 1994, and despite success in every other series they had contested, notched up 22 DNQs, 3 DNSs, and 7 DNFs. In 1995, they did a deal to become, \u201cPacific Team Lotus\u201d, in the hope it would generate income; they were out of business by 1996., 58853=Sarrazin tried three WRC events in 2004 in a Subaru Imprezza, finishing 9th, 6th and 4th, leading to selected drives as a tarmac specialist, by the works team for the following two years. He did not live up to his early promise with another fourth his best result, and 20 points from his total 15 starts (10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 scoring)., 24872=Jochen Rindt\u00a0\u00a0Austrian, Rindt had won five rounds with Lotus-Ford in the 1970 World Championship when he was killed in practice for the Italian GP on the 5th September, 1970. The 45 points this gave him, despite missing the last four events, were still enough to win the title, making him F1\u2019s only posthumous champion.}",

It proves once again that the work led by the FIA in terms of safety is absolutely vital and it is clear that one should never get complacent about this element of the sport.\u201d Many have suggested that in Mosley\u2019s day, a driver making allegations against FIA, as Alonso did last weekend, would have been in trouble. With Max, he would have made a public issue of it, and required public humiliation of the perpetrator. The sulky Spaniard is not a man to back",

Alonso has fallen more than a win behind the leader in all three schemes. Fernando is making Massa look a bit ordinary, and neither are making this year\u2019s Ferrari look extraordinary. Some suggest Felipe is still recovering from his accident which he vehemently denies, as he would if still effected or not. Mark Webber failed to score real points, his retirement being the first time this season he did not finish top-nine. Kubica has jumped ahead of Rosberg.
