            "Never heard of any ongoing problems regarding campus safety. Any school no matter where you go is going to have a few occasional incidents with minor issues, but Stockton has a great police force who protects the campus and community.",
            "There are tons of fraternities and sororities at Stockton, and one for everyone, so if you're interested you should have no problem finding one that is a good fit for you!",
            "There is literally a club for ANYTHING and everything you could be interested in. And by the mere chance that there isn't already, you can ALWAYS easily start up your own club!",
            "I really think that you get your money's worth with Stockton. It isn't extremely expensive and you get a good education and experience for what you're paying.",
            "Atlantic City is only ten/fifteen minutes from Stockton so you can always go visit there! If you're 21 there's the casinos and bars and stuff, and if you're under 21 there's still fun things to do like go to an aquarium or a concert! The cape may zoo is only 20 minutes away, smithville (an adorable place with cute shops and places to eat) is right by the school, and then of course there are always things to do ON campus. Movie nights every thursday, zumba and kickboxing classes different days of the week, open mic coffee houses every month....there's lots to do on campus!",
            "The on campus dining is pretty good; there is a buffet style cafeteria which is not amazing but it's alright. And then there is a campus center food court with Johnny Rockets, Chick-fil-A, a pizzeria, sub place, and a homestyle-cooking place. It's actually really good. And then of course when all fails, there's a dunkin donuts right in the campus center as well. If you want to venture off campus, there is literally almost everything. Subway, Applebees, TGI Fridays, Wawa (always delicious), Sushi places, Wendy's, Taco Bell, Fro-yo shops, etc. You will never go hungry.",
            "The dorms are very nice for the most part; always clean bathrooms and common areas, and they just put new furniture in!",
            "Make sure you go see your preceptor/advisor before scheduling your classes. They are only as helpful as you allow them to be, so if you go to them with your questions they will be more than willing to help you out with whatever you need!",
            "So far my experiences at Stockton have all been positive. I've met so many amazing people and have learned so much in various different and interesting classes. Although it's very small, it seems to be a good fit so far."

It will help you explore many areas of study and you'll have a great time doing so. Recently in 2011, Stockton opened up a new campus center which is great to hang out in with friends to play games, study, relax and watch t.v., or get some food.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I would definitely recommend on going to the SOAR program the weekend before school starts. I met three of my best friends during that program. I would also recommend going to all the activities they have during the first week of school. It really helps you feel more comfortable in your new surroundings. Take classes you think you will enjoy, but also take classes you've never really heard of. College is all about experiencing new things, and Stockton definitely gives every student that opportunity. Bang for the buck Although Stockton is a state school, it is still extremely expensive. But, on the bright side, it offers many amazing scholarships that aren't too hard to achieve. Am enjoying being here Stockton College gives freshman numerous opportunities through different freshman activities to meet one another. I made many friends within my first few days at Stockton. It is a relatively small school, and the buildings are in ABC order so it is very easy to find your way around. The college offers a variety of clubs, organizations, and sports for anyone to get into. Am learning a lot The professors that I have had so far have been great. Each",
