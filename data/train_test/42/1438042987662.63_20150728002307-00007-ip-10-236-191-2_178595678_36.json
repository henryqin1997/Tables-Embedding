The well rounded academic load is balance by fun excursions to need by Portland, camping/hiking opportunities, or Saint Johns farmers market. Opportunities seem endless and prized like our award wining new paper, The Beacon, or our women's soccer team that housed Olympic mentalists."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The academics here are incredible. The professors really do care about their students. I'm a rather shy person but i feel oddly comfortable around these professors. In fact I actually had my spanish teacher recommend the possibility of a major in communications. In this college its all about where you can go with your skills and interests and how the professors can help you get there.

Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to ask question, whether it be to a neighbor, professor, hall director, etc. Joining clubs and other activities help you to meet other people which make living on campus a lot easier. Take advantage of the free events (ex. movies, coffee, field trips, etc.) because youre paying for the steep tuition.",
