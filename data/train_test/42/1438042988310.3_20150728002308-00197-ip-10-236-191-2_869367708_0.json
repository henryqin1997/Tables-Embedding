It provides nearly the same durability as other Innova premium plastics with a superior grip, even better grip than the already grippy Star plastic.

    "textAfterTable": "\"Of course the Leopard is in my hand for the left to right drives, but I'll also use it on the shorter, low-ceiling holes that are long enough to need the glide advantage of a driver. With a lighter delivery and softer grip, the leopard will take me straight to the bank.\" - Simon Lizotte \"This is my favorite disc ever made!!! I personally carry 3 of them in the bag. Perfect for Mid-Range shots that require low ceiling. I also carry a lighter DX version for rescue shots. The straightness of this disc allows you to throw confident shots in the woods. If you don't have one, you could be costing yourself strokes on the course.\" - Ken Franks If you are looking for a disc with more Fade, try the Cheetah more Turn, try the Kite more Glide, try the Foxbat Other Speed 6 discs include the Cheetah, Gazelle, Viper and Whippet.
