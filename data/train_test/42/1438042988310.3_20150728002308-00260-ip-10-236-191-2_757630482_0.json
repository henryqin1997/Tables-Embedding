While I did well back in 2009 with my stock picks, I can\u2019t say that my crystal ball was clear enough for this year\u2019s contest! I thought it would be fun (and obviously that it would give me an additional edge) to take more risk.

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25429=We are July already! The month of June was quite rough on the market and on the TSX 60. I guess it could be a good timing for dividend stock shopping!, 17978=Because of the favourable tax treatment, an increasing number of Canadian corporations started converting their structures to become \u201cIncome Trusts\u201d. This of course had a major impact on the revenues of the Canadian government as it was an efficient way to diminish taxes paid out. That attracted attention from the government. But when BCE, one of largest telecommunications companies in Canada announced its intention to convert, it became too much for the government. Finance minister John Flaherty announced changes in the treatments of trust units that would be rolled out over 4 years. These changes applied to any company that became a trust unit after 2007 but others had 4 years to adapt to the new rules. As the January 1st 2011 deadline gets closer, many of the Income Trusts are converting to more traditional structures., 78764=The Financial Blogger \u00a9 2009 All Rights Reserved., 8113=Since the credit crunch in 2008, there is a cloud of fear over the head of the US stock market. People seem to think that all companies have the H1N1 virus and we best kept our distance from them., 18924=In 2002, 79% of the money raised in IPOs in Canada was for Income Trusts. All of these corporations would end up paying little to no taxes to the federal government. It is easy to understand why this could not continue for very long. The federal government estimated it had lost $300 million in the previous year in taxes and the amount lost by provincial governments was similar., 25604=We are currently finishing our Market review for the month of June along with our dividend stock review. They will be both available in our next newsletter (to be sent next week). Make sure to register (in the right column) if you want to receive update on the market and dividend stock review., 50005=What can you expect from a good financial stock when the company is being sued by the Federal government? Nothing but a severe plunge! While I still think that Goldman Sachs is a great company and that they will bounce back (I would buy more of them if I had liquidity right now!), I really picked the wrong time to choose it as a good investment pick in 2010 \ud83d\ude09}",

The emerging market showed some strength and this pick is now up by about 10%.

Vanguard Emerging Market ETF (NYSE: VWO) 11.27% Goldman Sachs has had its share of problems in 2010 but I think they are ready to bounce back.

While many investors thing the stock market is sick, I\u2019d say it is just another rough patch to ignore. The good side of things is that our Canadian dollar is still pretty strong (fluctuating between $0.95 and $1.00 US) and the US stock market",
