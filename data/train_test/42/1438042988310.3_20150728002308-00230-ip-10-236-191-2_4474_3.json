Connection to the controller is made by 10-pin flatcable. Low-priority, but nice addition to the project. LED controller the +5V comes from the PSU but the beagle bord does the switching through pin 24 we are using the brown pair for this one pair carrying the signal to the relais (+5 Volt if on, plus ground) we are using the blue pair for this one pair carrying power to the remote (+12 Volt continuous plus ground) On the RJ45 connector is present: the pins on the connector have all been soldered, T568B style.
