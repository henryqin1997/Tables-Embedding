            "The amount of fun you have will depend on the amount of effort you put in to the school and/or your preference. There are some nearby bars or clubs if you are old enough and if you join the greek life and/or club organizations, it can lead you to external events. Networking is a possible way to lead your life into excitement.",
            "The omelets are SO GOOD, but they're only served in the mornings on the weekdays. Even though the eggs are from a carton, the omelet still tastes amazing. Pretty good amount of variety during lunch and dinner wherein they have different food stations, but it will be hard to stay in good physical shape due to all the sugary and fattening foods they have.",
            "Super convenient, but it also depends on what type of dorms you prefer. There are 2x2, 4x2, 5x2, etc. Roommates are selected by random and you usually meet cool people. There is a microwave, a living room that has couches in case you want to lounge, do homework, invite some friends over, etc. The closet is pretty spacious. The bathroom is average, but if you don't maintain it by cleaning it, it can get dirty fast. The beds are pretty comfy and soft. I personally loved the living room with the couches because it was conducive to my studying.",
            "The difficulty of your workload will depend on your major and time management. I am a business major and the semester can get difficult in many ways, such as: if I choose to max out on my units, choosing to work and go to school, commit to clubs/organizations and have classes, attend social events in conjunction with volunteering and classes, and so on. It essentially depends on your preference and how much you want to handle.",
            "1. Network with students and form study groups 2. Communicate with your professors more often than you should 3. Talk to your academic advisors to track your progress and plan your academic future 4. Attend career affairs 5. Join clubs or organizations pertaining to your major or passion. It builds your network and looks good on your resume 6. Use a board to write out what is due, it is a great reminder 7. Have different colored pens and highlighters, that way your notes will be easy to read 8. Buy/Have scantrons ahead of time. You never know when you might need that extra 5-10 minutes it takes to go to the University Store to buy scantrons. 9. Stay hydrated and give yourself enough sleep. 10. Last but not least, do not procrastinate!",
            "The wild night life accommodation may not be as prevalent, but what Sacramento State might lack in the night life it makes up for it through clubs, organizations, greek life, the beautiful men and women of the campus, the fresh outdoor atmosphere, relatively cheap tuition, friendliness, awesome suites, campus activities, and probably a plethora of other things. The professors are also empathetic and they care for their student's success so that's a plus. Overall, it is really dependent on the effort and interest the student exerts; the student will get what they put into it."

The campus is filled with various beautiful trees and scenery., 992495=The dorm life is amazing!I had several friends that attended Sac State in 2008 so when I'd visit them I got to experience some of that life and it was extremely fun., 77556=The grass wasn't grass but mud, even in May. It smelled awful. It felt like a high school campus with lockers everywhere., 1001993=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 668851=A nice campus that has a ton of resources for students to use. There's friendly staff and students. The food there are so good and during the start of Fall 2013 Sac State will be opening a Starbucks!, 858485=I really like the food that we are provided with. Many times the school will give us the same type of food but I go trying out all the food there is and it is actually really good. There are hamburgers, pizza, beans, rice, lasagna, pasta, steak, and many more. What I do not like about our Dining is that they close pretty early. During the weekdays it closes at 8:00PM and in the weekends around 6:00PM., 633998=I know that there is a lot of things offered, from the aquatic center to things at the WELL (the gym on campus) if you are into that type of stuff. Some clubs like the ballroom dancing club offer things as well. Then there is Unique and they bring different things on campus so the students can enjoy, like this March they had a Taiko group performing., 663458=If you stay in the dorms, you have a meal plan. The courtyard market has some good sandwiches and pizza. The dining commons has good food but you get tired of it easily. It's buffet style so it's easy to gain Freshman 15. Starbucks will be opening Fall 2013., 61903=I haven't experienced dorm life yet, but will be experiencing in 2013}",
