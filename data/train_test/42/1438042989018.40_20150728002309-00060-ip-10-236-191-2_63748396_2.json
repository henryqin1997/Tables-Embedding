Each student is required to complete a minimum of 60 clock hours (6 credit hours) of approved elective courses, plus 6 Continuing Education Units (CEUs) in the junior year and 6 CEUs in the senior year. The elective course requirement will be 6 credit hours of course work (equal to 10 clock hours per credit hour). The Continuing Education requirement of 12 CEUs (6 in junior year and 6 in senior year) is equal to 12 clock hours or the equivalent of two full days of CE courses. Requirements Overview of Current Elective Courses Electives are courses designed to allow dental students the opportunity to vary their curriculum according to individual interests. Electives are intended to supplement, not to replace any part of, the core curriculum.
