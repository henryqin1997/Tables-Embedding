            "Campus is very, very safe. Avoid too late classes though, even the safest places seem sketchy in pitch dark. The area around the campus on Pico can be dangerous if you're alone late at night. As long as you're not asking for trouble, it is perfectly safe.",
            "You need to look for clubs online by yourself. They are rarely promoted, but I promise we have tons of clubs/events/activities, you just have to search for them. Don't wait for your second or third semester to take part. If you participate in the first semester, you can run for boards/commitees in the second. That would look fantastic on transcripts. PS. Avoid taking classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 11:15-12:30... That's when most if not all clubs meet, so if you have class then you won't be able to join.",
            "Parking, I hear, is horrendous. Asian people (not the Asian Americans, the international ones) hang out in cliques and don't speak English unless you force a conversation in English. They're nice people, just not great at blending into a wonderfully diverse community.",
            "Just a heads up - 'fun' will probably be limited to the west side of LA if you don't have a car. Not too much of a problem though, the school offers a sticker that lets you ride the Big Blue Bus (Santa Monica bus system) for free, so getting around SM is a breeze, most of the time that is. For fun - 3rd street, SM Pier, beaches, Venice, Westwood, lots and lots of shopping, movies, etc. Hollywood is not too far either, usually a bus ride away I would say. You'll love it, SM is an amazing place to be :)",
            "The cafeteria is pretty good. Not too much, but if you're hungry I guarantee you'll find something for your taste. Some vegan/veggie options. Starbucks is served in the cafeteria and in a small coffee stall on the other side of campus. Around the school - not much, just fast food. It is a short bus ride to 3rd street so if you've got time in between classes or during lunch, definitely go there as you'll have a million food options to choose from.",
            "It's commuter college, so if you want a dorm-ish experience, find students to stay with. Try Craigslist, or the school website has some resources.",
            "Not difficult, if you take the right classes with the right professors. Look them up at ratemyprofessors.com before enrolling. Get your English and Math done earlier, and also get your IGETC requirement plan organized as soon as you get here.",
            "Start taking opportunities in your first semester. Get involved on campus, join clubs, and be social. In LA, who you know and how likable you are among peers definitely counts. Be friendly, use campus resources, be active and you'll stand out.",
            "It's great and has a lot to offer (for a community college) if you make an effort. You will not be spoonfed in this college like you perhaps would be at a four-year university. You need to go out of your way and work hard to be a successful student."

Students are no longer allowed to enter campus once curfew has passed because most of the last classes for the day start from 6 pm to 7:30 pm. We have seen more security roaming around the school and students have the option to have security escort if they feel that it is not safe to walk by themselves around the school or to their car., 355447=You need to look for clubs online by yourself.

That's when most if not all clubs meet, so if you have class then you won't be able to join., 281312=SMC has activity hour from 11:15 to 12:35 every Tuesday and Thursday, in which clubs meet and during which special events are held on the quad, such as Club Row, in which you can check some of said clubs out, and the College Fair, in which prospective students can acquire more info from college reps from institutions like UC Berkeley and USC., 497331=If you're an AS member ( it costs 19.50$/year) you get to join as many clubs as you want form a long list of clubs that get really get funding and that organize a lot of activities. If you're not sure what club to join, wait for clubs week in October or just go to different meetings and see which ones seem fun and interesting to you. Most clubs will organize activities to which everyone can participate and they are usually really fun. SMC also organizes lots of events for students. For instance, August 29th was welcome day; they offered free In N Out to every one who came, they had raffles, workshops, fairs and lots of other things to help students get ready for the semester., 286841=No dorm available on campus. Rent around campus ranges from 500-1200 for a bedroom., 413647=Figure out multiple transportation back-up plans in the event that there is no parking. Which is very common on the main campus. Use RateMyProfessor.com, it is a valuable resource in ensuring that you get the most of your courses. A course is only as good as the professor teaching it. A word of caution: Be objective when using ratemyprofessor if the review is in all text abbreviations, misspelled words, and poor grammar chances are the student doesn't put much effort in their school work to begin with and is just whining. Enroll in the courses you want for the next semester as soon as you can. Courses fill up in the blink of an eye, as do the wait pools for each class., 536444=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I made sure to lookup my professors on ratemyprofessors.com before deciding to stick with the particular professor I chose. Of course everyone has to take it upon themselves to get a good grade, but you still need to make sure you have a professor who is willing to help you when you ask for it and who genuinely loves teaching. Bang for the buck I get financial aid, but I still have to pay for my books, which tend to be worth an arm and a leg. Still, I believe that SMC is one of the best junior colleges in Southern California. The location is amazing, who doesnt like an ocean breeze?, the facility is overall maintained well, many teachers leave a great lasting impression, and the school boasts about being #1 in transfers to UCLA. This definitley is a great school to choose to attend if planning on transferring. Am enjoying being here I do get to see many of my high school friends, but sometimes I wish I could meet more new people. Of course this is something that one has to take upon themselves to accomplish. It was easier in high school to talk to people in class, but not so much in college. Once you are in class",
