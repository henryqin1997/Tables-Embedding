They'll spend nearly a week in the Los Angeles area, playing the Clippers and the Lakers at the Staples Center and then meeting the Lakers a second time in Ontario. After sleeping in their own beds for a night or two, the Warriors will wend their way through Des Moines, Iowa; Kansas City, Mo.; and Hidalgo, Texas, for games. The Warriors aren't going to China as they did a year ago, but they're still going to log plenty of air miles this preseason. #hst-mediumrectangle4 #TMP300_3 { margin-top: 30px; } .perfectPixel { display: block !important; }",
