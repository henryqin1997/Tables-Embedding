            "Our campus police department is very dedicated and determined to keep all residents and off-campus students safe and healthy. The best thing about them is they care more about our safety than they do about arests.",
            "Tons of clubs that are a lot of fun. If the club you want doesn't exist then it's really easy to start your own.",
            "This school is really expensive. The classes are worth it. The dorm and food however is not. And paying for the dorm and food is manditory.",
            "There are tons of clubs and activities here on campus. We have big events sponsered by different organizations every week. Our school works hard to bring the entertainment from Austin to our campus.",
            "The food here would be great except that it's extreamly expensive. Also, it's manditory that all students get a meal plan that's a couple thousand dollars a semster. Also if you don't use all the days on your meal plan every week, you do not get that money back. However, the staff is really nice and the food is good just not worth what we pay for it.",
            "The dorms are nice.",
            "Classes are challenging, writing intensive and more disscussion based rather than lecture based. However, the school may expect alot from you, but the professors here are very willing to help in and out of class.",
            "Don't get a fish tank. It will sound like a great idea at first but come thanksgiving and christmas break, it's nothing but a hassel.",
            "This schools holds a sort of respectful, peacefull atmosphere that is simply unavoidable. Although this school has high standards in terms of academics, it still is the only place I've ever been too where I felt my education was worth more than grade in the class. Through Southwesterns honor code and Pideia program it promotes quality character along with a quality education."

In 2013, Southwestern will also be reviving its football team ('Undefeated Since 1950'), which should be an exciting opportunity for anyone interested in becoming involved with the team or booster club, etc., 17264=Southwestern is great for students who want a personalize education which includes one-on-one time with professors, meetings and study sessions with students and academic advisors, and chances for discussion in the classroom. With less than 1400 students and the average class size of 12, those chances are abundant. The sincere care and concern that abides on this campus is incomparable!, 174267=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 86176=There are NCAA and intramural sports for students to participate in. NCAA will have a football team and a women's lacrosse team added in 2013. As for clubs, there is something for every student, ranging from academic to personal interests, including the option of starting new clubs.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students If you plan on attending Southwestern, I would suggest you have an idea of what you want to accomplish. You don't have to pick your major until your junior year, but it's ideal to have a general direction on which you would like to travel. Join academic clubs, play sports, and participate in intramurals, for these things can help you decide where you want to go in your life and aide in making life-long friendships. Southwestern is a very small school but the experiences you have here will be better than most any other college. As a small school, students are able to have strong one-on-one relationships with professors, easy access to career services, and many friends who will stick by you through thick and thin. If I had to pick one valuable life lesson that I have learned while attending my first year at this University, it would be that who you know out reaches what you know. Don't hesitate to talk to career services or to alumni; they know most about how to succeed in what they do. And most of all, students at Southwestern party hard, play hard, and study hard. We know that stress is not the only key to success. Bang for the buck It is a pretty expensive school. However, the facilities are nice and the professors are excellent.",
