            "Those looking for a lower-priced college. Those looking for better housing accommodations. Those looking to be a person to a professor, not a number. Those looking for a friendly atmosphere. Those looking to be a Cardinal.",
            "Use your resources. If you're struggling or worried about struggling, there are lots of FREE resources such as the Writing Center for help with papers, the Center for Academic Achievement for tutoring in subjects, and so much more! Get involved. It's hard to get the motivation to do it, and can seem pretty scary to do it. But it's a great way to network and develop friendships that will last throughout your college experience. (And it could look good on a resume, too!) Involvement has been my favorite part of the academic experience.",
            "The most inexpensive public university in the state of Michigan! Residential facilities are definitely above and beyond what other universities provide for their students. Although, tuition rates are on a constant rise everywhere now-a-days, if anyone could put a price on the college experience, SVSU has the best value.",
            "First going in I figured a college with 10,000 was huge, but it's really not all that bad. It's the perfect amount of people to where you can network with new people anytime you please. There's lots of organizations of every type of imaginable, and I highly recommend getting involved with at least one of them.",
            "I've had good academics all throughout high school, so I didn't know what to expect at a college level. Although I had to put in more effort and cut back precious sleep to get in some extra study time \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? something I didn't have to do in high school \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? I managed to take a lot from my classes and apply it to real life. I find myself using what I've learned in most classes in real life on a day to day basis. The presentations and papers can be tough at times, but with resources like the Writing Center, you shouldn't have to worry!"

We have Starbucks and Einstein Bagel plus Papa Johns and other eating place. You will never go hungry. There is also a convenience store called the C-Store. With later hours and great food SVSU is a great place. There is also the Ryder Gym center free for students if you are worried about the Freshman 15., 284565=There is a Drag Show every March that a Fraternity takes a part of for a fundraiser. Great time for people to come together. Students are very accepting of all lifestyles., 391415=There a plenty of resources offered so failing is never an option. It is home to the world's best dorms. The incoming freshmen class of 2013 was the largest as of 2013., 25442=I transferred back home after the fall semester of 2009. I enjoyed going to my classes. Although, i am more of a home person and did not enjoy being away from home. Another added stress was my roommates and i did not get along very well., 30029=I am currently in 14 credits and I am signed up to take 15 credits in Winter 2010. I am learning a lot at Saginaw Valley. I am taking classes that are not similar so I am in classses I have never taken before. I have learned a lot about Political Science and Communications. I have improved my writing in my English class and there is the Writing Center which is a great resource., 346601=Most of the classes at the college are the kinds of classes that don't transfer so the bang for your buck is quite irrelevant but for the classes that do transfer it is wise to dual enroll so that your classes cost in the $400 range and not the $1200 range. in all the degree you will get is worth the cost but dual enrollment is the best way to reduce that cost., 165836=Most importantly, make sure you are prepared! If you need to have classes completed before transferring, talk to them about that to make certain you do. If you don't make a lot of money, be sure to get on-top of the scholarships available to you - most are available January - May. Communicate to your instructors if you have back-to-back classes that you may be late or have to leave early because they really appreciate the heads-up. Finally, this isn't like high school - you must actually DO the work in order to get the grade you want. Sure you might be able to skate by and prove me wrong, but for the money you spend, wouldn't you want to actually learn something?, 447662=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 52481=i have been at saginaw valley since 2007 and they have different varieties of food available. they are open at different hours through the night to make it more convenient for students.best school food i have ever had.}",
