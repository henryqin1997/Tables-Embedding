    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations A third specific feature of the present invention is that the clearance of the narrow zone 13 is variable and it is possible to optionally vary the clearance by exchanging the spacer 12. In the case of composite spinning of sheath-and-core type, it has generally been necessary to reduce the clearance of the narrow zone as the viscosity of the sheath component polymer decreases, and to increase the clearance as the viscosity increases. Further, this clearance must have been set to an optimum value on the basis of various spinning conditions such as the kind and combination of polymers used as the core component and the sheath component, spinning temperature, extruding amount, etc.; thus in the case of conventional spinneret assemblies having a fixed clearance of narrow zone, it has been necessary to employ other spinneret assemblies when these conditions are varied. In the spinneret assembly of the present invention, by exchanging the spacer 12 which can be cheaply made, it is possible to easily and optionally adjust the clearance of the narrow zone 13 and it is also possible to cause one spinneret assembly to correspond to various spinning conditions; hence the spinneret assembly of the present invention is very economical. A second specific feature of the present invention is that neither projections nor grooves are provided on the front surface 17 of the second distribution plate 9 and on the back surface 18 of",
