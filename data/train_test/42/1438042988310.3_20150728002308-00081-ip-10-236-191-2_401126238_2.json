The on loan defender suffered a ankle injury in the game and is a doubt. David Healy will once again lead the Rovers attack alongside James Hayter who both scored at the weekend. New signing Dennis Souza is ineligible as the club are still waiting for international clearance for the Brazilian defender. Still missing are Billy Sharp (hamstring), Adam Lockwood (toe), George Friend and Simon Gillett (knee) and Martin Woods (groin). Burnley are waiting on the fitness of Andre Bikey after the defender missed the last three games with a rib injury. Martin Paterson is expected to start again after the striker scored twice at Norwich on Saturday in his first start since injury in September. Long term injured Chris McCann is still on the sidelines for the clarets. Join Vital Doncaster Rovers!
