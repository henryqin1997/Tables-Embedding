As a system administrator, it is your responsibility to ensure that no regular meetings are scheduled before scheduling a Reserve All Ports meeting. Caution! Reserve All Ports meetings prevent the system from scheduling any meetings. Also, during a Reserve All Ports meeting, no prompts are played to alert users to the situation. For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you schedule Reserve All Ports meetings during the lowest usage times. In addition, be sure to cancel any Reserve All Ports meetings that you later determine you do not need. Before You Begin Remember the following information: You cannot extend a scheduled Reserve All Ports meeting, but you can reschedule the meeting. Only one Reserve All Ports meeting can be scheduled at a time (one Reserve All Ports meeting must be finished or deleted before another can be scheduled). If a Reserve All Ports meeting overlaps another scheduled meeting that is then canceled, the Reserve All Ports meeting reserves the ports released by the other meeting. Scheduled Reserve All Ports meetings appear in the server exception log, and any changes",
