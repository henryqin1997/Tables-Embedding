            "The University of Pittsburgh Police are a legitimate police force that go through rigorous training. Their presence is obvious, but not overwhelming. It makes you feel safe. There are also emergency blue light boxes all over campus that you can use to call for help.",

It might not be New York or L.A., but it's pretty close and has just about everything you'd expect from a city., 751244=Put yourself out there as much as you can in your first week. It's a big school and is easy to get lost in, so being involved can really make your experience 1000 times better., 415963=I feel very safe. Especially after the bomb threats during the Spring of 2012 semester., 270404=There's a lot of review in most below-1000-level classes if you've taken a course on it before (in high school, for example) but it's worth it and the teachers do build on it. Once you get to the upper levels it's mostly new knowledge., 170674=At the University of Pittsburgh, there is a large Arena called the Peterson Events Center, otherwise known as the Pete. There is a large field outside right outside there and every year, Univ. of Pittsburgh plans an event for Freshman students to break a world record of some sort. This past year of 2012, Univ. of Pittsburgh Class of 2016 broke the world record of the largest uniformed dance with umbrellas dancing to the Cupid Shuffle for 6 minutes. This field is also known by students to play Ultimate Frisbee, Croquet, Football, Volleyball, Tanning, etc., 526885=Definitely study, study, study. Join as many clubs as you can handle in high school. Keep your GPA above a 3.5, and aim for at least a 1200 on the math and reading section of the SAT, and you will be guaranteed entrance to the University., 1013494=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 601016=The Cathedral of Learning (42 stories, 535 feet tall, 2529 windows) is the largest academic building in the United States. The building is Pitt's landmark and provides wonderful views of campus from the Unversity Honors College on the 35th and 36th floors., 220278=If you're in-state, you're definitely getting a good deal. Pitt is just as good as private schools that charge twice as much. Obviously the out of state tuition is one of the highest in the country, but I still think it's a pretty decent deal. You get so many opportunities that small schools don't offer. The free bus pass alone retails for over $1600.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students My freshman year was one of the most rewarding and trying years of my life. I was lucky enough to join a learning community my first semester and got to know a group of students very well. The diversity of the student and city population is the best part of Pitt and it is reflected in its student group offerings. There is something/someone for EVERYONE if you look for it. The free bus pass with your Pitt ID was the best perk of being a student, however, you have to stay on top of your work. If you let your coursework slip by, you will not be able to catch up. Pitt is the most academic challenging and rewarding state school but I can honestly say I learned more in my first year at the University of Pittsburgh than I have before in my life. My biggest tip is EXPLORE!!! Opportunities, social settings, class selections and the city! You will be better for it. Am enjoying being here The perfect balance of city life and safety for a college student. Less action than other big cities, especially with concerts.
