No. 4,322,851 issued on Mar. 30, 1982, Ian Vance teaches a method of demodulating a binary FSK signal. This technique uses the direction of the phase rotation angle to detect signal polarity. A significant problem with this approach is its inability to demodulate multi-level digital signals., 18827=To overcome this limitation, a Cross-Differentiate-Multiply (CDM) demodulation technique may be employed. This technique is detailed in an article titled \"An FM Detector for low S/N\" written by John Park and published in IEEE T-Comm, Vol. com-18, No. 2, April 1970. This technique is highly complicated and requires two differentiators, four multipliers, one divider and two summers. The number of devices, hence their current drain, used to realize this technique is prohibitive particularly in battery operated portable communication applications.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In summary, a mechanism has been described whereby a multi-level digital signal could be demodulated using zero crossings of i and q signals. A detector detects zero crossings by monitoring the phase rotation. The phase rotation angle is then monitored at each zero crossings for instantaneous phase direction. The instantaneous direction of all the phase rotations are then combined to create an overall phase rotation angle. A bi-directional counter keeps track of all the zero crossings along with their directions in order to estimate the signal. The significance of this method is that it requires significantly fewer components to realize the same conclusions. It is no longer necessary to use analog to digital converters, multipliers, or differentiators. A simple counter and a zero crossing detector is all that is needed to accomplish this task. Similar to the operation of the device 100, the detected zero crossings are used by a phase angle estimator 226 and a decision device 228 to determine the content of the information signal. The information signal is further decoded at a controller 126 which proceeds to present the information to a speaker 128 and/or display 130 in accordance with its contents. A benefit of generating additional zero crossings using the zero crossing generator 216 is the elimination of additional mixers, phase shifters and filters as suggested by the prior art. The elimination of these additional components results in significant current savings which",
