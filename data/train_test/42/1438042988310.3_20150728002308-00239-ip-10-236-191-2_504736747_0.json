For 2012, we are planning to plant half of our corn acres with one particular conventional hybrid, with the remaining half split between five other traited varieties. In our opinion, our industry is already seeing the negative results from overuse of traited corn such as Bt resistance and glyphosate resistance., 11110=We have some bonus coverage from our February 25 Round Table, \"Forage and tillage practices that work for them.\" The dairy producers discuss more on controlling weeds and insects. The four participants hail from Iowa, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. (To read the complete Round Table, check out your February 25 issue, pages 118 to 120 or click here)., 8813=In corn, we incorporate Lumax and Atrazine for season-long weed control. With the rapid shading of the narrow rows, we have had above-average success controlling weeds. However, in the last two years, we have had a few fields with a major breakthrough of late-season giant foxtail. It is a weed that has shown up after scouting ends in mid-June, and by harvest time it is as tall as the corn. Fortunately, it has been isolated to a few acres and edges of fields, but we will be making changes to our 2012 herbicide program to allow for longer residual weed control on annual grasses.}",
