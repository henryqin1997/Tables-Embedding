She's spent many days now half-consciously culling the tunes for that perfect arrangement for the new year's bash that she regrettably agreed to host. 10:40 AM rolls around and some new tune catches her ear, a tune she knows can work well following the jingle-cats rendition of Strawberry Fields. She half jogs over to the stereo and hits the \u201cGoFetch\u201d button. In a few days, shell sit down at the computer and put together the final sound track for the gala evening ahead, her play list dutifully waiting for her shuffling instructions and desired start time., 306029=[0551] It is expected that image input devices will soon become commonplace. The provision of digital cameras as built-in components of certain computers (e.g., the Sony Vaio laptops) is just one manifestation of this trend. Another is camera-on-a-chip systems, as typified by U.S. Pat. No. 5,841,126 and detailed in Nixon et al., \u201c256\ufffd256 CMOS Active Pixel Sensor Camera-on-a-Chip,\u201d IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 31(12), pp. 2046-2051 (1996), and Fossum, \u201cCMOS Image Sensors: Electronic Camera-on-a-Chip,\u201d IEEE Transactions of Electron Devices, vol. 44, No. 10, October 1997. Still another is head-mounted cameras (as are presently used in some computer-augmented vision systems). These and other image input devices are all suitable for use in Bedoop systems., 42864=[0001] This patent application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/476,686, filed Dec. 12, 1999, which claims the benefit of application No. 60/134,782, filed May 19, 1999, attached hereto as Appendix A. This patent application is also a continuation in pa of application Ser. No. 09/343,104, filed Jun. 29, 1999, the majority of which is attached hereto as Appendix B. The Ser. No. 09/343,104 application is also a continuation-in part of application Ser. No. 09/314,648, filed May 19, 1999 (published as US 2003-0050961 A1). The Ser. No. 09/343,104 application also claims the benefit of provisional application 60/134,782 (Appendix A). This application is also a continuation in part of application Ser. No. 10/306,768, filed Nov. 26, 2002 (published as US 2003-0133592 A1), which is a division application of application Ser. No. 09/292,569, filed Apr. 15, 1999., 151960=[0209] (d) purchase rights to use this image in a newsletter having a circulation of under 1000 for $1.25, 129877=[0169] Imagine that the consumer wishes to view the final quarter of a Trailblazer basketball game that aired on television a week ago. (The consumer may have either missed the game, or may have seen it but wants to see the last quarter again.) The user directs a web browser to a web site maintained for such purpose and performs a search to identify the desired program. (Typically, the web site is maintained by the proprietor that holds the copyright in the material, but this need not be the case. Some material may be available at several web sites, e.g., maintained by ABC Sports, the National Basketball Association, and Sports Illustrated.) The search can use any of various known search engines, e.g., Infoseek, Verity, etc., and can permit searching by title terms, keywords, date of airing, copyright owner, etc. By typing in, e.g., the keyword \u2018Trailblazers\u2019 and the date \u2018Apr. 26, 1999,\u2019 the consumer is presented a listing of videos available for download. One, hopefully, is the requested game. With each listing is an indication of an associated nominal charge (e.g. 80 cents)., 123992=[0157] These three examples are but illustrations of many possible techniques for changing the rights associated with a work. Many other techniques are known. See, e.g., the proposals for watermark-based copy control systems for digital video at the Copy Protection Technical Working Group, http://www.dvcc.com dhsg/, from which certain of theforegoing examples are drawn. See also Bloom et al, \u201cCopy Protection for DVD Video,\u201d IEEE Proceedings, Special Issue on Identification and Protection of Multimedia Information, June, 1999., 203979=[0319] (Details of the preferred encoding techniques are further detailed in co-pending applications Ser. No. ______, filed Apr. 15, 1999, entitled METHODS AND DEVICES FOR RECOGNIZING BANKNOTES AND RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY, Ser. No. 09/127,502, filed Jul. 31, 1998, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,862,260.), 155761=[0224] (g) \u201cLink to the web site that tells about the release of this title as a motion picture (presently scheduled to open on Oct. 10, 1999)\u201d, 78537=[0072] For example, GoodNoise is planning to embed a digital signature\u2014termed a multimedia identifier, or MMI\u2014in its MP3 music. MMI will register the song and its author with a licensing number. In addition to providing information about the songwriter and distributor, this digital encoding may also include lyrics, liner notes, and other information. But all of the proposed uses serve only to convey information from the distributor to the consumer; use for \u201ctracking\u201d is actively disclaimed. (Wired News, \u201cGoodNoise Tags MP3 Files,\u201d Feb. 3, 1999.), 155037=[0218] (a) \u201cSee the review of this book published in the New York Times on Apr. 19, 1999\u201d, 85688=[0082] In other embodiments, perceptually adaptive encoding is not used. In some such embodiments, no tailoring of the temporal or spectral characteristics of the watermark signal is employed. In others, the watermark signal is spectrally filtered to emphasize low frequency audio components (e.g. less than 500 hz), high frequency audio components (e.g. higher than 2500 hz), or mid-frequency audio components (500-2500 hz)., 54452=[0024] The infrastructure between the device 10 and delivery of the audio to its ultimate destination can take myriad forms. One is shown in FIG. 4. In this arrangement, some or all of the data received by the relay station 24 is routed through the internet 26 to a server 28. (The server 28 can be a \u201cMediaBridge\u201d server of the type described, e.g., in the assignee's application 60/164,619, filed Nov. 10, 1999, and Ser. No. 09/343,104, filed Jun. 29, 1999.) Server 28 parses the data and routes some or all of it to a data repository 30 at which the audio requested by the user is stored. This repository, in turn, dispatches the audio to the user (e.g., to a computer, media player, storage device, etc.), again through the internet. (Address information detailing the destination 32 of the audio may be included in the data sent from the device 10, or can be retrieved from a database at the server 28 based on a user-ID sent from the device 10.) In some embodiments, the repository 30 (which may be co-located with server 28, or not) includes various data beyond the audio itself. For example, the repository can store a collection of metadata (e.g., XML tags) corresponding with each stored item of audio. This metadata can be transmitted to the user's destination 32, or can be used, e.g., for rights management purposes (to limit the user's reproduction or re-distribution rights for the audio, etc.), to establish a fee for the audio, etc. One suitable metatag standard is that under development by <indecs> (Interoperability of Data in E-Commerce Systems, www.indecs.org)., 179194=[0270] Unless otherwise stated, it should be understood that the digital music, video, and imagery contemplated herein is not of any particular form or format Audio, for example, can be of various forms, both streaming and non-streaming, and of various formats (e.g. MP3, MP4, MS Audio, Windows Media Technologies, RealAudio, *.WAV, MIDI, Csound, Dolby's Advanced Audio Codec (AA C), etc., 238083=[0394] In one exemplary embodiment, the blank magazine page stock is pre-Bedoop-encoded prior to printing. The watermarking can be performed by high speed ink-jet devices, which splatter a fine pattern of essentially imperceptible ink droplets across each page. Each page can be differently watermarked so that, on decoding, page 21 of a magazine can be distinguished from page 22 of the same magazine (and page 106 of the Jun. 21, 1999, issue can be distinguished from page 106 of the Jun. 28, 1999, issue). If desired, each page can be further segregated into regions\u2014either in accordance with the actual boundaries of articles that will later be printed on the pages, or in a grid pattern, e.g., of 3 columns across by 5 rows high. Each region conveys a distinct Bedoop code, permitting different portions of the page to lead to different web data.), 151858=[0208] (c) open in 960\ufffd1280 pixel format for twenty cents;, 64122=[0044] An arrangement like the foregoing may require that the decoded watermark information he interpreted for the user, so that the user is not presented simply a raw binary watermark payload. The interpreted information presented to the user can comprise, e.g., the source (CNN Airport News, WABC Radio, CD-ROM, MTV), the artist (Celine Dion), the title (That's the Way It Is), and/or the time decoded (3:38:02 p.m.), etc., 71119=[0054] Application 60/134,782, filed May 19, 1999, 71656=[0056] Watermarking (or \u201cdigital watermarking\u201d) is a quickly growing field of endeavor, with several different approaches. The present assignee's work is reflected in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,841,978, 5,768,426, 5,748,783, 5,748,763, 5,745,604, 5,710,834, 5,636,292, 5,721,788, and laid-open PCT applications WO97/43736 and WO99/10837. Other work is illustrated by U.S. Pat.

Termed the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI), the program seeks to define a voluntary specification that will assure proper compensation to those who produce and distribute music. One element of the system will likely be a watermarking component. (Dow Jones Newswire, \u201cSpurred By Maverick Technology, Music Industry Eyes Web,\u201d Dec. 31, 1998.), 43783=[0002] The technology detailed in the present application is also related to that detailed in copending application Ser. No. 09/343,104, filed Jun. 29, 1999; Ser. No. 09/292,569, filed Apr. 15, 1999; Ser. No. 09/314,648, filed May 19, 1999; 60/141,763, filed Jun. 30, 1999; 60/158,015, filed Oct. 6, 1999; 60/163,332, filed Nov. 3, 1999; 60/164,619, filed Nov. 10, 1999; Ser. No. 09/452,023, filed Nov. 30, 1999; Ser. No. 09/452,021, filed Nov. 30, 1999; and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,862,260., 180318=[0272] This application is a continuation-in-part of copending application 09/130,624, filed Aug. 6, 1998, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/508,083 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,841,978). This application is also a continuation-in part of copending application Ser. No. 09/314,648, filed May 19, 1999 (published as US 2003-0050961 A1). This application is also a continuation-in-part of copending provisional application 60/134,782, also filed May 19, 1999 (attached, above, as Appendix A)., 79132=[0073] The Genuine Music Coalition\u2014a partnership of various companies in the music distribution business\u2014likewise has announced plans to employ watermarking of MP3 music. The watermarking technology, to be provided by Liquid Audio, will convey data specifying the artist or producer contact, copyright data, and a number to track ownership. The Coalition hopes that the provision of this embedded information will help thwart piracy. Industry observers believe Liquid Audio will next introduce playback technology only plays audio in which its watermark is detected. (Wired News, \u201cLiquefying MP3,\u201d Jan. 23, 1999.), 308619=[0557] The present assignee's prior application Ser. No. 09/127,502, filed Jul. 31, 1998, shows techniques by which very fine lines can be printed on a medium to slightly change the medium's apparent tint, while also conveying digital data. Commonly-owned application Ser. No. 09/074,034, filed May 6, 1998, details how the contours of printed imagery can be adjusted to convey digital data. (That technique can be applied to printed text characters, as well as the line art imagery particularly considered.) The assignee's patent 5,850,481 details how the surface of paper or other media can be textured to convey optically-detectable binary data. The assignee 's U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,841,886 and 5,809,160 detail various techniques for steganographically encoding photographs and other imagery., 142679=[0190] In a related embodiment, the last portion (e.g., 5 seconds, frame, etc.) of the content bears a different \u201cend of content\u201d watermark that triggers issuance of a receipt. Such a watermark can indicate the length of the content, to serve as a cross-check against the periodic watermark polling. (E.g., if periodic sampling at 2 second intervals yields 545 samples corresponding to the same content, and if the \u201cend of content\u201d watermark indicates that the content was 1090 seconds long, then receipt of the entire content can be confirmed.), 223619=[0360] The employer e-mails or otherwise sends the candidate an access code. (The code can be encrypted for transmission.) The code is valid only for a certain time period on a given date (e.g., 9:00 a.m.-11:00 a.m. on Jun. 28, 1999)., 138198=[0182] One alternative approach is to hash each 128-bit number, when issued, to a much smaller key value (e.g. 20 bits). A memory with 1020 locations can be indexed by this key. Each such location can include four data: an issued 128-bit token number that hashes to that value, first and second date fields indicating the date/time on which that token was issued and redeemed, respectively, and a link specifying the address of a next memory location. That next memory location (outside of the original 1020 locations) can include four more data, this time for a second issued-128-hit token number that hashed to the original key value, two date fields, and again with a link to a subsequent storage location, etc.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0581] In view of the many embodiments to which the principles of our invention may be applied, it should be recognized that the detailed embodiments are illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of our invention. Rather, we claim as our invention all such embodiments as fall within the scope and spirit of the following claims, and equivalents thereto. [0580] From the foregoing discussion it can be seen that, rather than replacing paper with electronic media, perhaps the future lies in giving paper digital attributes\u2014hybridizing the physical experience of paper with the technical advantages of digital media. Such an arrangement makes available a great wealth of new functionality, now accessible through familiar paper items, rather than through a \u201ccomputer input peripheral.\u201d [0579] It was once popular to predict that paper documents would be replaced with electronic media. In hindsight, electronic media may be recognized as a poor surrogate for paper. Electronic media conveys information flawlessly, but is lacking in experiential attributes. We can hold paper, stack it, own it, deface it, give it, guard it, etc. It provides an opportunity for physical dominion entirely lacking with electronic media. [0578] While the foregoing embodiments have generally employed planar objects to convey the digital encoding, this need not be the case. Objects of other shapes can likewise be employed. Some shapes present relatively straightforward",
