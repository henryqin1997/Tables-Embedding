Its results always serve to a subsequent, often dynamic, decision making. Decision-making quality is substantially influenced by the mapping used. This simple fact is relatively rarely respected by many elements in the overwhelming arsenal of existing mappings. A complete solution of decision making problems that includes explicitly the discussed mapping are severely limited by computational complexity (labelled as curse of dimensionality).\u00a0 The project contributes to an improvement of this state via i)\u00a0\u00a0 solving general dynamic-decision tasks within a specific Bayesian methodology that uses probabilistic tools\u00a0 both for describing the\u00a0object and strategies of decision making but also its aims and constraints; ii)\u00a0 developing methodology approximating the optimal solution obtained; iii) verifying the developed methodological and algorithmic",
