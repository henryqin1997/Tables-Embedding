Located just off the coast of Columbia, this 2 point 4 acre bit of land is home to a VERY cozy population of 1200. Residents starting invading the island 150 years ago when they realized it was free from mosquitoes. Sounds like they should have kept it a better secret!

Businesses are banned from handing out non-reusable bags, or those made from non-compostable materials. And anyone found breaching the ban COULD be liable for fines of up to 1000 dollars a DAY. Shops will still provide plastic bags for bulk items such as meat, grains or fresh produce. California is reportedly considering a similar move., 18158=Madison showed you the new Mission Impossible movie earlier but did you know the REAL star isn't Tom Cruise. Nope, it's Rebecca Ferguson. She didn't disrobe in Rogue Nation, but she more than makes up for it in the 2013 period drama The White Queen! Rebecca plays a white HOT Queen Elizabeth with a royal body that will drop you to your knees. She sits on more than just the throne in a bevy of boobtastic nude scenes. Long live the queen!, 41536=Friday July 31, 2015}",
