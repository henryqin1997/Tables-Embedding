            "There are always fun events at the DIGS campus center. The theater department is almost always putting on a show. And, the campus arranges shuttles to and from downtown for students convenience to athletic events and other activities.",
            "Winthrop has some of the best selections of food available. I never had to leave campus during the day.",
            "I am a commuter student so I've only been in a few dorms, but they have all been nice.",
            "Be prepared! The work is hard, but not overbearing. Have fun! The professors are all laid back so there is no need to be nervous.",
            "Winthrop University's campus is beautiful and peaceful. The professor's are all very knowledgeable on the subjects they teach, and easy to get along with which is a plus. This is a great place for first time college students to learn and gain responsibility."

The faculty are also top notch and that transcends into the type of students that make up the Winthrop student body. I love to study and get good grades. I fit right in at Winthrop. For this reason, I am hoping I receive this scholarship so that I can continue at Winthrop in Spring 2014., 457291=You really CAN'T beat it. Washington Monthly named Winthrop one of America\u00e2??s \u00e2??Best Bang for the Buck Colleges\u00e2?? in its 2013 College Guide Rankings edition. Nationally, Winthrop was ranked 93rd out of 349 public and private universities and colleges that were named \u00e2??Best Bang for the Buck.\u00e2?? In the master\u00e2??s degree-granting category for the value ranking, Winthrop came in at 37th out of 152 institutions. Both of my parents are working 2 jobs each to try to send me to Winthrop. However, although this is the very best school for the money, I have been unable to secure the funding to continue at Winthrop. Your help would be greatly appreciated., 440378=Ghost Tours in October to share more about Winthrop's History, 289580=Worth the money. Small student body, small student to teacher ratio (about 15:1 at most). Lots to do on and off campus, just about everything you need in walking distance., 506089=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 460996=Winthrop is a GREAT school because of it's student support system at the Student Resource Center. As a result my persistence and their willingness to help me, my first semester grades improved with each exam. For this reason, I am hoping that I obtain this scholarship so that I will be able to continue at Winthrop University in Spring 2014.}",

Am learning a lot I never thought I'd learn so much pursuing a Computer Science degree from a liberal arts college. The classes are small so you receive individual attention from teachers who really care, and are more than willing to meet with you after class to help you with anything.
