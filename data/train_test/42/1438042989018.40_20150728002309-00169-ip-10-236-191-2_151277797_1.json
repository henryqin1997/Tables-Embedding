He's got a college bat that comes with upside. Tremendous power potential.\" The son of a former collegiate catcher, the 20-year-old Choice stands at an even 6-feet tall and weighs in near 215 pounds -- numbers that A's scouting director Eric Kubota say disguise the fact \"he's a very strong man\" with \"average Major League speed, on our scale.\" \"I'm excited,\" Choice said soon after being selected. \"This is definitely one of the happiest times I've ever had in my life. I'm eager to get out there to start playing.\" Several big league teams, including the A's, took notice of the transformation. And on Monday, with the 10th overall pick in the First-Year Player Draft, Oakland acted on it by claiming Choice in the first round. Thus, Choice found himself just 20 minutes away from the home in which he grew up, playing at one of the select number of Division I schools offering him a chance. It was there, at the University of Texas at Arlington, the outfielder cultivated into a solid power hitter with defensive prowess. In fact, his name never came up in the Draft following his senior year at Timberview High in",

In 60 games for the Mavericks this year, he hit .383 to go along with a .568 on-base percentage and .704 slugging mark. He struck out just 54 times while managing 76 walks -- several of which Kubota admittedly said were a result of a rather weak lineup around him. \"He's by far the best player on his team -- gets pitched around a lot, doesn't see a lot of pitches to hit,\" Kubota said. \"He's still selective enough to not swing at pitches in the zone.\" Choice's large dose of power nicely complements his impressive abilities in center field, where he hopes to remain as his professional career begins. \"If he can stay in center and have the power, that would be great for us. We certainly think he's athletic enough to possibly stay there,\" Kubota said. \"We're certainly going to give him every opportunity. At the very worst, we think he's going to be a very good defensive outfielder at the corner, whether it's in left or right. We have reports that say [his arm] is anywhere from average to plus. There are a lot of guys in our room that would say it's a plus.\" Kubota and Co. initially witnessed Choice's talent while the youngster",
