    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{121223=Mount SAC is a very gorgeous campus. I was very surprised when I first came to visit in the summer of 2011. I would give this school a 4/5 in rating., 2626=At Mt. SAC, students truly are aware of the schools mission and that is academic success. We are reputable for being one of the top schools with successful transfer students and graduates. Furthermore, we have one of the most diverse campuses throughout southern California, and, we have one of the best athletic programs in the state. Having such a diverse student body has made the campus ever so exciting. This is because our student body has so many eclectic and active clubs on campus, numerous sports, and so many intelligent and talented students. I myself was part of the political science club called Global Resistance Networks. Considering how large the campus is and how many students attend here, the community still managed to feel like a family. I got to know the student body government, presidents from the different clubs, and the peers who were in my classes that were interested in what I found to be exciting. Furthermore, I got to mingle with football, basketball, and soccer players who were athletes going on a full ride to some of the best universities in the country! During the Budget Cuts on community colleges, we all got together to create a March and Rally against the Budget Cuts against California's Community Colleges. Apart from activism, many events occur here. If its our radio show holding events or colleges visiting our campuses, there is always something going on. We have plenty of nature at our campus. You may either find students napping under a tree or relaxing on the grass eating, studying, or talking to their friends. At Mt. SAC, no doubt you will find that it is a pleasant school to attend., 133159=Sometimes people get mugged in the parking lots/campus at night an incident recently occurred this fall 2012 semester. On top of that someone attempted suicide in the English building area., 500486=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 92374=Sports is a big thing at Mt Sac and one tradition that has been held every year since 1948 is the Mt Sac invite for cross county running and the world famous Mt Sac relays in the spring for track and field athletes. Some of the worlds most famous track athletes have competed at mt sac and it is a tradition celebrated every year., 145513=One should be patient. Transitioning from high school or work can be difficult. The primary struggle one encounters as a starter is attaining classes. Choose early morning classes (7:30 a.m.) or night classes (7:00 p.m.). Also, target the classes less in demand, such as dancing, art, culinary, some foreign languages, and physical education. Although these courses may not directly assist one in acquiring his or her degree, it will get one an earlier registration date that can be used to enroll in important classes such as English and math. I commenced with French and theater. They were not very useful for my major but aided me in getting a good registration date.}",
