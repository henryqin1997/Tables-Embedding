            "There are campus security roaming around the school at all times. They are friendly but they get down to business when needed.",
            "There are posters all around school that promote all kinds of activities. Indoor soccer, basketball to a guitarist for a band. The diversity can be seen through out the hallways on bulletin boards.",
            "It is great for any type of student who wants a college education to enable them to further themselves.",
            "There is a carpool group that has formed that allows people hitch rides with their friends or other people who live near them. It is an awesome way to meet new people and it also decreases the carbon foot print people could produce.",
            "The programs and assistance available range widely. From the Trio program to the counselors, advisors, and academic centers. These are all support centers that have everything you could possible need. Besides your teachers these centers can help you with the subject you are struggling with and they are there when ever you need them!",
            "There are plenty of sport teams available at this college. If sports do not interest you then the theater and music should draw your attention. There are also plenty of events that go on around the campus as well with food and fun!",
            "On campus there is an awesome restaurant that students work. The culinary program at the college is incredible and full of ambitious students that make delicious food!",
            "I do not live in dorms so I cannot comment on the rating of the dorm life.",
            "Each class has a detailed outline that professors follow. They are there to help. teach, and explore their courses.",
            "Students who are looking to attend the College of Southern Nevada should be aware that even though it is not a University it should still be treated as the equivalent to one! Colleges are just as prestigious as Universities. It is just what you make out of them!",
            "The College of Southern Nevada is a place for honest students who want to succeed. The teaching staff, along with the office staff, are there to assist you in any way needed. It has been a pleasant time attending this college and I would rate it a solid 9 out of 10."

The lows at night during these months are on average 80 to 85 degrees, so that means in the daytime expect temps to be around 105 and 115. If you survive the first summer, your a champ, the second summer you sweat through, you are acclimated. Meaning, if temps fall below say, 75 degrees, like in the spring or early winter, you will be freezing and wearing your hoodie. After the 3rd summer you are a professional., 225878=The college is affordable my costs are about 1500 a semester., 619372=I will give this school a 5 out of 5. There are 5 locations plus online courses that can be taken at College of Southern Nevada. I have taken weekend classes, online, and as late as 10:30 pm classes. The instructor's and professors are very thorough and hands on. They usually will go far and beyond to make certain that the information is being received clearly., 466581=Hey I live in Las Vegas, what can I say......there is ALWAYS something to do! The strip is about 20 minutes away from the CHY and CHRL campus. But again, that's not the only place to have fun! Las Vegas is like any other city in the US. Beware of the months between June and October ..... the is the desert. Temps range from 90 to 120 degrees. Some weeks are above 105 daily. The evenings are fantastic though!, 26893=I met some of my best friends for life at CSN! Not to mention the opportunities there are in the school. I was able to intern with Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign through the school as well as find my first ever job., 236570=Try to arrange your schedule in the best way possible; so many new students decide to enroll in a class at 10:00 am and not have another class until noon, the time in between is wasted (unless you do your homework from your first class). Also, there are more than one CSN campus so pay close attention when signing up for classes (you don't want the stress of driving back and forth, campus to campus.) Also, always make extra copies of documents when going to meet with an advisor (they have a habit of losing papers)., 49880=I began attending CSN in Fall 2008 and so far it has been a great school to attend too. Especially a far as community colleges go. I have learned so much with just the few classes I have taken to this point and I'm truly excited to continue on. Teaching methods to differ between teachers, so if you can, talk to the professor and fellow students about the class., 624881=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
