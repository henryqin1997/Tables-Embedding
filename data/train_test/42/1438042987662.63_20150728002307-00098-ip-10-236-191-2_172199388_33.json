            "The campus is very safe (homeland security is even down the street), so public safety is more of an annoyance than anything else.",
            "There is certainly a Greek Life presence at the school, but there are other options if being in a Fraternity or a Sorority isn't really your thing. It's not as if you won't have a social life if you don't go greek, but there are still plenty of options if you do choose greek life.",
            "Everything and anything! There is a rugby club which is really cool, and if there isn't a club that strikes your interest, it's very easy to start one!",
            "International students, bilingual students, and students interested in other cultures! There are also endless opportunities for people interested in the School of Public Affairs, because we live so close to the Capitol.",
            "There is an underground tunnel between the School of International Service and the Library! And the student-run coffee shop (The Dav) has great coffee at even better prices!",
            "To be frank, $50,000 is a lot of money. It is a private school, so the prices are a bit ridiculous. However, they do provide you with quite a few excellent services that you can't find on other campuses.",
            "You're in DC! There are any number of things to do, and if you ever get bored you can just run in to the city and go to museums, the zoo, shopping (up-scale or bargain shopping, plus tons of thrift stores!), or basically whatever else! There are also plenty of clubs to visit and frat parties to attend, so if you're in to that, don't worry! You can still have a good time here even though we're not a state school.",
            "Personally, I have mixed feelings about the food. You can definitely eat more healthily in the cafeteria at American than many other schools, and they provide gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options. However, the food can get a bit old after eating there every day for nine months, and it's a little on the bland side.",
            "A group of about eight people from my floor became like family, so I loved being in a dorm. Yes, sharing showers is obviously annoying (don't forget shower shoes!), but as compared to most colleges the dorms are decently sized, and you get a ton of storage space!",
            "Be ready for hard work! The classes demand dedication, but you really do learn a lot. American University provides you with an excellent education, with fantastic professors; if you are willing to work for it!",
            "Buy a metro card, first of all. You'll be in the city a lot, because there is so much to do there! In addition to that, if you are looking to grocery shop on a budget, go to the Safeway down the street; don't shop at CVS or Whole Foods.",
            "In all honesty, I would not trade my experiences at American for the world. Not only is it an academically excellent school, but American also provides an international student rate of around forty percent that makes the social life there very interesting. I would venture to say that the people, the local environment, and the schooling are some of the best out there."

I think it is a good thing because they ensure that the students have the skills necessary to be successful in advanced classes, especially research. I took some college classes in my high school, and most of the classes transferred and were applied towards my degree., 464237=I went to go look at this school in February of 2013 when I was looking at Maryland CP, GWU, and Georgetown. I got on the campus and was immediately unimpressed, the entire campus was grey and drap and the people were less than friendly. Needless to say, I did not apply here., 243934=The dorms can be pretty cramped, especially as the school's popularity grows. But the campus is expanding starting in 2013 to add more dormitories, which will make dorm life more comfortable., 335901=There is one main dining hall - Terrace Dining Hall (better known as TDR) - with the classic stations of salad, grill, pasta/pizza, and wok. In 2013, there should be implemented several other food options, such as Elevation Burger and Starbucks. They will join the ones already on campus such as Einstein Bros. Bagels, Megabytes, Eagle's Nest, and Tavern (got to get the tenders!)., 106669=The capitol is no NYC, but there's rarely a quiet night downtown. There are plenty of clubs and concerts (a popular small venue is The 9:30 club) where well-known bands and DJs come to play. Tuesday nights there are live poetry readings at Busboys and Poets on K street. If you're not one to travel downtown often, there's plenty happening on campus! Sororities have hosted some dance parties in Mary Graydon Center, movies have been shown before they premier in theaters, local metal/alternative bands have played in the basement of the Kay Spiritual Life Center, a zip line was set up down the length of the quad, as well as a petting zoo! The list goes on for miles., 491298=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
