            "There is active Greek life on campus, many of cultural groups.",
            "SFSU has a club or organization for pretty much any and everything that may, or even may not, be seem as a common interest. Only like 1/4 of the actual clubs and activities are listed on the website, as those are the ones that are school recognized, others may not be recognized by the school but definitely still exist.",
            "Students who want to be exposed to a diverse culture and take self responsibility and initiative in being successful in the classroom.",
            "If you have considered this school i hope you have considered the cost of living in the City, the dorms are expensive and rent at even the cheapest of apartments are upwards of $2100 a month, for one bedrooms and studios. On the other hand, receiving a college education and life experiences a city like San Francisco will put you through are priceless....",
            "Depends on personal preferences but in a city like San Francisco there is something for EVERYONE. The campus also offers tons of events, clubs, and activities.....check out the student recreation page and the clubs on the SFSU site.",
            "There are 3 central spots on campus to get food (that is supported with a meal plan). The lines can sometimes be suuuuuuper long but the food averages to be a solid 8 out of ten. They offer accommodation for pretty much all types of diets, personal or cultural. Meal plans are a bit pricey and are required if living on campus, with the exception of University Park.",
            "I have yet to visit the dorms myself but here, I also get the typical.....crowded, lack of personal space, but a great experience and chance to meet new people and make lifelong friends. Due to the schools location, prices are out of the roof, but if you have a heart for the city of San Francisco and making friends than it is well worth it. Keep in mind, this is a commuter school so living off campus will make it a little more difficult to make friends.",
            "With the feedback I have received from current undergrad students, the academic rigor seems to come out at a pretty high to standard level. I have heard the typical stories and advice that come from all college students, Its not that hard if you apply yourself, Take advantage of office hours, Don't procrastinate, Don't be afraid to ask for help, ETC. One thing that stuck out more than most feedback from students at different universities was the professors willingness to help and care for student success, things can't be too bad with a great foundation support system.",
            "Just like myself, my advice is to research research research, and even try to reach out to current students and faculty. If you come from a certain cultural or social background contact the school and see if they can connect you with students of a similar background and see what their experience at SFSU is like.",
            "After completing VERY thorough research and outreach to the university I feel its diversity makes it a great school for students of all social and cultural backgrounds. On the other hand, it is located in a major city, so if the city environment isn't for you than this may not be your school. A big city also has many benefits, tons of social connections and great opportunities to obtain a leading edge in the work force upon graduation."

College is about exploring and having fun and I cannot stress how much better your college experience will be if you just remember to have fun. When you wake up at 7:59 A.M. for your 8 o'clock morning class, instead of dwelling about it, make the best of it. You only get one real college experience so you might as well make the best of it., 299941=Not that everyone is living in the dorm. It's mostly for freshman, sophomore, and transfers. Still, the dorm is so convenient, fun and quite random. You mostly will find tons of drama with your roommate and random things int he hall way, such as people in costume in the middle of March or people dancing, singing or playing guitar on the small quad. Not a good place for quiet and clean freak people., 172316=If you have considered this school i hope you have considered the cost of living in the City, the dorms are expensive and rent at even the cheapest of apartments are upwards of $2100 a month, for one bedrooms and studios. On the other hand, receiving a college education and life experiences a city like San Francisco will put you through are priceless...., 330779=The food at the college leaves alot to be desired. However, there are many types of foods to choose from...from extremely healthy to extremely fattening. The cafeteria is always full and robust. Get there before 11:50 am. That's when the large crowd begins to fall into the cafeteria and if you have a class at 12:20, you may be pushing it. If all else fails, there are a few cafe type establishments at the head of the school and in the HSS building on the first floor. Plenty of vending machines if you're pressed for time or pack a lunch the night before and bring it with you. Lunch on campus is a little expensive., 111218=Sign up for the dorms before January of the year you are planning on attending., 708894=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 431573=Every October a group of people dressed as zombies attack people., 332392=Some classes can be challenging, especially if some classes are cross-listed. It's all relevant. Just be a sponge and don't fall into the trap of procrastination. You're grade can turn out to be a C when you are clearly A material. There are lots of group projects in upper division and just like any place of employment, there will always be one or two that are 'slackers' or give the bare minimum. Do not let that stop YOUR progress and grade. If you see something needs to be done by another person, just do it yourself or get assistance from others within your group. I had a 'group' that started out with four people and ended up a 'me' project. Everyone had excuses on why they couldn't or didn't do their part. I didn't let that stop me. I did everyone's section and I received an A+. Believe in yourself and your abilities. If you are not sure, seek out a tutor. Remember, this is your life at stake because when it's all said and done, many of these students you may never see again, and it will be only you holding the torch. March to victory, NEVER settle for defeat from merely not trying., 19849=Attend office hours, attend office hours, attend office hours. Professors stay overtime to answer your questions, and most of them want your money to go to actually learning something. Take advantage. Don't miss class. It's tempting to sleep through your morning classes, yes, but don't forget that you're paying for those. Know your sleeping schedule before registering. If it isn't realistic for you to get up at 8:10 every Monday for a Math class, then don't register for that class. Register early.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I personally do not live in the dorms because I save so much money living in an apartment. I have friends at the dorms & I've been to all of the types of dorms at SF State. The Mary Ward Halls (freshmen dorms) are okay. Not much privacy, but you meet tons of people. The Towers & Village are the way to go if you're looking for apartment style living, But they are more expensive than the MW Halls. Tuition at SF is reasonable & being a student here has many advantages: Melting pot, transportation is cheap, & many opportunities for exposure available academically professionally in the city. Am enjoying being here I love the atmosphere of SF State. So much diversity. Find an organization that you're interested in & it will be the best move you'll ever make! Am learning a lot Classes that are offered here at state are interesting. ALL professors here at state are passionate about their discipline and they are very helpful! We have great and supportive departments. I am a Biology major at state with hopes of attending UCSF for med school and they provide a lot of support. The Biology department is one of the best in the CSU",
