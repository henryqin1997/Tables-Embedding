New HUs are built continually, older units are demolished, and the institution of addressing schemes to allow emergency response personnel to find HUs with noncity mailing addresses render many older addresses obsolete. Maintenance of the MAF occurs through a coordinated combination of automated, clerical, and field operations designed to improve existing MAF records and keep up with the nations changing housing stock and associated addresses. With the completion of Census 2000, the Census Bureau implemented several short-term, one-time operations to improve the quality of the MAF. These operations included count question resolution (CQR), MAF/TIGER\u00ae reconciliation, and address corrections from rural directories. For the most part, these operations were implemented to improve the addresses recognized in Census 2000 and their associated characteristics. Some ongoing improvement operations are designed to deal with errors remaining from Census 2000, while others aim to keep pace with post-Census 2000 address development. In the remainder of this section, several ongoing operations are discussed, including DSF updates, Master Address File Geocoding Office Resolution (MAFGOR), ACS nonresponse follow-up updates, and Demographic Area Address Listing (DAAL) updates. We also discuss the Community Address Updating System (CAUS), which has been employed in rural areas.

    "textAfterTable": "Delivery Sequence File back to top The DSF is the USPSs master list of all delivery-point addresses served by postal carriers. The file contains specific data coded for each record, a standardized address and ZIP code, and codes that indicate how the address is served by mail delivery (for example, carrier route and the sequential order in which the address is serviced on that route). The DSF record for a particular address also includes a code for delivery type that indicates whether the address is business or residential. After Census 2000, the DSF became the primary source of new city-style addresses used to update the MAF. DSF addresses are not used for updating non-city style addresses in the MAF because those addresses might provide different (and unmatchable) address representations for HUs whose addresses already exist in the MAF. New versions of the DSF are shared with the Census Bureau twice a year, and updates or refreshes to the MAF are made at those times. When DSF updates do not match an existing MAF record, a new record is created in the MAF. These new records, which could be new HUs, are then compared to the USPS Locatable Address Conversion Service (LACS), which indicates whether the new record is merely an address change or is new housing.
