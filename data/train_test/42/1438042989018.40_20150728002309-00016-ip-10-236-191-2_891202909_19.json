            "For prospective students I would say be ready to work and study. It may seem crazy for a professor to say you should be studying 2 hours for every hour of lecture but it's true. Studying is very important slog with the homework",

Make sure your grades are good and the school will reward you handsomely with a multitude of scholarship opportunities. Although the college lacks a degree of course work vigor, it makes up for the strong network connections to local professionals. Most of the areas businesses hire exclusively or a mainly from Fisher, and because of this, alone, the price to attend is worth it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Outgoing students, education or biology/chemistry majors. People who aren't afraid of having too many student loans. Tips for prospective students Don't be too nervous when you first start. It's really not as bad as you think. I was terrified and there was no reason to be. The peer adviser you get for the first semester and orientation team is really nice, don't be afraid to ask them questions. Don't worry about making a fool of yourself during orientation (especially not Playfair!). Everyone is nervous and if one person can start to make jokes, everyone will be more comfortable. Bang for the buck The meal plan is extremely expensive but the food is amazing. A sandwich station, grill, pizza & pasta bar, stir fry, salad bar, bagel/toast station, deserts, cereal, and 5 places where they have specials of the day... it's well worth the price. There's also cafes around campus that take meal swipes and a late night cafe. The bookstore is more expensive than it should be so try to get your books somewhere else. It's a little pricey, but there are merit scholarships as well as an Honors program and Science Scholars that will give you money if you apply and get in. Am enjoying",
