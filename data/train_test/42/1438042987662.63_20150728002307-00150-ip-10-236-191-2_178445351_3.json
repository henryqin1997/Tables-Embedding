            "Intramurals are popular as is bingo and other small activities planned.",
            "Many Catholic oriented students enjoy going to the Basilica for mass and there are many religious activities one can take part in. There is no pressure to take part in these activities though.",
            "People like to visit sauerkraut tower or the gristmill which have much history. There are monks living on campus and the campus is very old so there are some landmarks that hold history and often ghost stories.",
            "There is an activities programing board that organizes events such as bingo, movie nights, karaoke, etc. There is also intramurals offered.",
            "The cafeteria food, just like any, can get old. On the weekdays there is a special offered for lunch and dinner that spices things up a bit. There is a place called The Shack that makes sandwiches and fried foods offered all hours and accepts meal plan. This is a great alternate option to the cafeteria.",
            "The freshmen dorm building is very socially oriented and it makes it easier to become acquainted with one another. However, it being a catholic school, the pods and floors are gender specific.",
            "The school wants to see their students succeed but the courses are rather challenging. The teachers all have available office hours and tutoring is offered for most classes.",
            "Understand that this is not a big party school, but it is very possible to become involved and find things to do. Classes are small and attendance is required but it all pays off and is very much worth it.",
            "It is a great, small school. The teachers and staff are very personable and actually care about you and your education. It is very easy to be successful at this school."

Am enjoying being here There is always something to do on campus, whether it's a dance, a game or some other activity going on. Am learning a lot The teachers are there to help you if you need help in a class. Most of them are willing to meet with you outside of class to help you understand the course more.
