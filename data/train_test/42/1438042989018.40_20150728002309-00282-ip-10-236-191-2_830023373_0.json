Hear lots of new music from Switzerland, including something from composer/violinist Franziska Baumann, whose sound installation work features the sound of glacial ice movements interspersed with voices. Also, listen to Michele Walther (violin), Matthias Gubler (soprano sax), and Luzian Jenny (accordion) from the vivacious collection of songs, \"Orange Heart.\" Plus, the fun grooves of the Albins Alpin Quartet, whose music incorporates saxophone, accordion, toy piano, tuba and regular old drums. And so much more.
