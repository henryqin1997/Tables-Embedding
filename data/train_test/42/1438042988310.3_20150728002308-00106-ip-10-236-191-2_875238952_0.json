It's like having a rewind button for your campaign. We've already been saving your edits, so if you upgrade now you will have instant access to your previous versions. Plus, you get a 15-day free trial, so there's nothing to lose. I'm ready to Ascend! See All Pages I'm sorry, but we no longer support",
