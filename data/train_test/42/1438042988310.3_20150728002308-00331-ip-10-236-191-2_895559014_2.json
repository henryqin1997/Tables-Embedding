If you want to drive to school, then make sure you always go the speed limit. Have all work turned in the day it's due or you'll lose some points.

            "I am enjoying being here because the tuition is low, you get to work on additional projects for the college, treated more like an adult, and you don't have to get permission to leave the room-EVER.",
            "I am learning many things like Theatre, Reading, Writing, and Math but I later I am going to learn about Philosophy, Computers, Physical Fitness, and Oral Comminications. Anyone can learn a lot here. The teachers are really cool and easy going-especially for freshman."
