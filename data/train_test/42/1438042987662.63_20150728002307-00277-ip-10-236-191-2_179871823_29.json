    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{87989=Rollins is a beautiful campus that feels like paradise. Its small enough so it is easy to get around but large enough so it's not crowded. Students make many friends. Because of the small class size, students get to know their classmates very well. The student population is about 1800 so everyone gets to know everyone pretty well. The dorms are for the most part nice and safe. The campus food is good too. There are many events on campus that are open to all students which are a great way to have fun with friends and to meet new people., 212188=Fox Day: A free random day off from school... sometime in April., 356529=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 110293=Fox Day is one day in March or April when the President (P-Dunc) wakes up at 5 or 6 am, puts the statue of the Fox on Mills Lawn and all classes are cancelled for that day. Students go to the beach, to theme parks, and just relax, then come back to school for a huge bbq on the lawn., 30022=Okay, fine, you don't have to look Fox Day up - didn't see this box before. Fox Day happens every year in the spring, usually the first or second week of April. It's when the president picks a random day that is supposed to have beautiful weather, and doesn't tell anyone (literally), and at like 5:30am on that day, he goes out to the lawn and puts this big statue of a fox by the flagpole, and that means that class is canceled for the day! It has become such a huge deal, especially in the past few years. People play Fox Day Roulette weeks before it might happen, people place bets on when they think it will be, people won't do their homework/study for tests that are supposed to be on the day that they think Fox Day will be (which is stupid, btw), etc. And people legit camp out all night on the lawn if they think it's gonna be fox day, and when he finally does bring the fox out, people start running around like crazy at 6 in the morning screaming IT'S FOX DAYYY! and posting facebook statuses and calling their friends to wake them up and make sure they know, and then everyone goes and eats free breakfast in the cafeteria, and then goes and does whatever they want. Beach, Disney World, Universal (we sell discount tickets for all the theme parks), chill on campus by the pool, sleep, or Rollins always has some activities on campus for people who don't want to go anywhere, like slip and slides, giant inflatable twister, and so on. Then everyone comes back to campus by like 5:30 and there's more free food for the fox day barbecue! And then everyone goes and gets ready to come back to the real world for class the next day, cause Fox Day is ALWAYS in the middle of the week. Cruel, I know. But it's our own little holiday, and we get real excited about it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Rollins is a very expensive school, so if you don't receive the financial aid and scholarships to cover the costs I'd suggest that you find a different school. Am enjoying being here There's not a whole lot of diversity in the school, so it can be hard if you're used to seeing people from many different backgrounds. Am learning a lot The teachers at Rollins are really great and they're all so unique and wonderful in their own ways. If you do poorly on an assignment or a test, the teachers will encourage you to meet with them and help you find a way to study better and find ways to improve your writing to ensure you get a better grade the next time. The lectures are exciting and the classroom is really engaging, which I would have to give credit to the small classes, which are around 15 people at most. If you need extra help, there's free tutoring which I would really encourage people to take advantage of. The library is open 24/7, so you always have access to computers, books, and other research materials. All in all, it's just up to you as a student to make the most of your learning experiences and",
