On the Belmont campus, the only option available in terms of more than snacks from the vending machines, is a Subway. It has been in place for only this fall 2012 semester, having replaced the previous commonplace school cafeteria, upon complaints the food served was not well liked. However, many students have acknowledged they quickly grew tired of Subway every week. Personally, I find it expensive to eat on a regular basis and prefer to bring a more diverse selection from home.}",
