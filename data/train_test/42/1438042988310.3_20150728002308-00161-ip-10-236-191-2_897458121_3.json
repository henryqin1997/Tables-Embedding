    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{49999=1/7/15: It has been a season to forget for the Carolina Hurricanes with the most glaring evidence being their 10-23-4 record through the end of the 2014 calendar year. That puts them at 24 points, or tied with Edmonton for lowest in the league. The good news, if there is any, is that Jordan Staal is finally playing again. He broke his leg in the preseason and the Canes have missed his scoring touch. Indeed, Carolina has only scored 73 goals, or less than two goals per game. The Hurricanes host the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday before heading west and playing at St. Louis on Saturday., 51230=1/28/15: The 2014-15 season has been a bit of a struggle for the Carolina Hurricanes. They entered the All Star break last in the Metropolitan Division with a 16-25-5 record, good for only 37 points. But the Canes ended the first half of the season on a positive note, winning their last two games and going a very respectable 6-3-1 in their last 10. Following the All Star break, the Hurricanes host the St. Louis Blues on Friday, January 30, which is a great chance to see All Stars Vladimir Taresenko and Brian Elliott. That is followed by a road trip to New York, Anaheim and Arizona., 44643=Carolina Hurricanes tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of the rising franchises in the NHL's Eastern Conference. In Raleigh since the team moved from Hartford in 1997, the Hurricanes rewarded their loyal fanbase by winning the Stanley Cup in 2006. The Canes play at the RBC Center in Raleigh, North Carolina., 53893=2/25/15: The Carolina Hurricanes are destined to either be sellers at the trade deadline on March 2nd, or simply sit the whole thing out. The team really does not have many weaknesses that cannot be overcome by better health. They have also told forward Jordan Staal that rumors that he is getting shipped back to Pittsburgh are not true. The Hurricanes acquired Staal three years ago from the Penguins after he rejected a 10 year offer - that kind of sends the signal that he did not want to be there. Pittsburgh could benefit with Staal from the playoffs, but right now, Staal seems to like playing with his brother Eric., 45626=3/13/13: The Canes have been a pleasant surprise in the Eastern Conference through 25 games. Carolina was expected to challenge Washington for the Southeast Division this season, but find themselves leading by three points through Tuesday, March 12. Carolina has relied on some stellar offensive prowess, ranking fifth in the league at 3.2 goals a game. This all comes despite a brutal power play, which has seen only 13.8 percent turn into goals. Captain Eric Stall boasts a sensational plus/minus of 20 with 12 goals and 19 assists, Jiri Tlusty has netted a team-high 13 goals. Newcomer and fellow top lineman Alexander Semin has also produced for the 'Canes with 27 points, most coming via assist with 20. Cam Ward's recent knee injury has forced Carolina to look elsewhere for help, but that has been solid with Dan Ellis and call-up Jason Peters stepping in nicely. The duo is 6-3-0 in their starts., 54514=3/4/15: Hopes for a trip to the playoffs ended early in Carolina this season, though a lot of that was due to major injuries to key players. However, the Hurricanes are looking long term and are preparing for next season and beyond. The team traded away defenseman Tim Gleason to the Washington Capitals for Jack Hillen and a 2015 fourth round draft pick. Gleason is a veteran of the NHL and is known for being a physical defenseman. With the Hurricanes looking to rebuild, they needed to get younger. Hillen will get a chance at regular playing time and could be a key member of the team in the future., 53252=2/18/15: Carolina's story for 2015 has been told many times already. They were severely injured for the first half of the season and that got them too far back in the standings to make a serious push for the playoffs. Since getting healthy, the Hurricanes have played well - a tease to how good they could have been. But they are in a tough situation this season and even GM Ron Francis hopes the team will be active at the trade deadline. There are a few players that the team could move such as defenseman Andrej Sekera or forward Jiri Tlusty., 55151=3/11/15: Unfortunately for the Carolina Hurricanes, they are basically left to play out the string right now. There is little, if any, chance for them to make up about 17 points in the standings to get into the playoffs, but they are well ahead of the dregs of the league to get a decent shot at one of the first two picks in the NHL Draft in June. But they are a fun team to watch, particularly at home where they have a winning record. They are finishing up a five game homestand this week with games against the Dallas Stars on Thursday and the Florida Panthers on Saturday, before heading off to Columbus on Sunday., 44229=The Carolina Hurricanes can attribute much of their newfound success to All- Star and captain, Eric Stall. After being selected second overall in the 2003 NHL entry draft, Staal has matured into a franchise player. A four-time All- Star, Staal acted as captain to the 2011 NHL All-Star game as Raleigh played host to the year's event. With talented newcomer Jeff Skinner providing a surge of new energy, the Carolina Hurricanes should be contenders for years to come., 52689=2/11/15: The Carolina Hurricanes continue to show signs of life, going a solid 5-3-2 in their last 10 games. That means they earned a total of 13 out of a possible 20 points - which is much better than their season average. Of course, they are much improved simply because they are getting healthy. Had they had this type of health all season, then they may be contending for a playoff spot now, rather than be stuck in the cellar of the Metropolitan Division. Carolina has about 30 games left to go to at least get to .500 on the season, and that is reasonable. They have a tough schedule this week: hosting Anaheim on Thursday, then on the road to Minnesota on Saturday, Ottawa on Monday and the New York Islanders on Tuesday, February 17., 51930=2/5/15: The Carolina Panthers continue to show some signs of life, and perhaps they will be able to rally enough in the second half of the season for a respectable final standing. On the ice, Eric Stall recently moved from center to left wing, where he has played most of his career. What that has allowed is for him to play on a line with his younger brother Jordan Staal, who made his season debut on December 29 due to a broken leg. Eric seems to be enjoying the new position and the team is 7-2-2 in January, so there may not be any need to change. Eric may not be long for Carolina though. With the trade deadline approaching he may be an appealing aspect to a contending team.}",
