So, while the MWC 2010 at Barca has been attracting global attention this week, in Vegas - of all places - a show that is less of a marketeer's wet dream but somewhat more down to Earth (no best games awards!) is about to start - IBM's Pulse 2010 Service Management event. I know, I know - the irony of \"pulse\" as in \"racing\" and \"Service Management.}",

The predictor takes a samples of web pages from the site and analyses how much improvement the jetNEXUS ALB-X could make in each case: This might look like a crass bit of marketing to(mfo)olery but since I've tested the jetNEXUS ALB-X product and know how good it is, I recommend you try out this predictor. And, no, I'm not going to tell you how much it said it could improve the Broadband-Testing website by.... http://www.jetnexus.com/predictor/jetnexus.htm Meantime, my mates at jetNEXUS - watch out for the report on the company's Load-Balancer on a stick (or CD) appearing on the Broadband-Testing website any day now - have come up with a really smart little tool for identifying just how much your website performance could be improved: What this kind of product does show is that, in combining successfully with 3rd party products such as Avaya's IP Telephony products, the ProCurve One initiative which might have looked like just another marketing exercise around \"strategic alliances\" has genuine depth. Of course, it has been labelled a Cisco basher. Bring on the 3Com acquisition and that might well be true from an HP perspective. Suddenly the Cisco portfolio is beginning to look a bit \"Dad's Army\" and with more holes than a good slice",
    "textAfterTable": "So in most cases the improvement factor was actually a very significant 60%. On an eCommerce site that's the difference between a one-time customer visit and customer retention. It's useful as well as a bit of fun, but the results are there to be taken seriously. Try it out... It's the weekend, so a quick wine tip/challenge. Try to find/buy/drink a red wine from the Ardeche region of France. I picked up a few en route back from a meeting at HP's EMEA HQ in Grenoble and they have been excellent - light, fruity and great with foods that reds don't normally go with (I'm not going to say which foods exactly- that spoils the fun). \u00ab January 2010 | Main Index | Archives | March 2010 \u00bb Search Subscribe to blog feed Subscribe to blog feed CW blogs Bloor Security Booting the System Cliff Saran\u2019s Enterprise blog Collaboration Technology 2.0",
