When traversing the index, the system employs standard (2K) access technique for the intermediate nodes 1003, as shown. At the level of the leaf nodes 1005, however, the key values stored by the nodes are sorted and, thus, the system can employ large (e.g., 16K) I/O technique. Since the index is non-clustered, the system must still access the individual data pages, shown at 1007. In particular, the data pages are not physically sorted by the index key. Accordingly, the system accesses the data pages (via pointers or references stored at the leaf nodes) using standard (e.g., 2K) access technique.}",

Large I/O 2) Join column not the same as index key. 1) Do not discard if outer is not unique. MRU/ F&D Inner table: For these query scenarios, therefore, the strategy adoped by the Optimizer can be summarized as follows. For the outer table, the Optimizer always adopts the MRU strategy. This is because the system knows that once it scans the records once, it will not scan them again. For determining whether to employ large I/O transfer, the Optimizer relies on the decision which it made for the table individually. Additionally, the Optimizer does not adopt a discard strategy if the join column(s) is not",
