Travelers can choose spring and fall for enjoying street festivals, outdoor entertainment and mild weather. Nonstop holiday partying occupies people in the city from the first of December until New Year's Day, and includes festive holiday window displays, nearby Rockefeller Center's famed Christmas tree, the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, and edgy Lower East Side live musical celebrations on New Year's Eve. Gourmet visitors can find the best tables during July and August, when locals depart the city for their own vacations and long weekends. Bargain hunters find the best prices from January to April, when hotels offer remarkable discounts.}",
