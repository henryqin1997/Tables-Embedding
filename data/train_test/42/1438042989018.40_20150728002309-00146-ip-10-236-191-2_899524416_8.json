            "There is so much available on this campus that many students are unaware of, look and ask around and you'll see there is a lot available.",
            "For what it's worth PSU Brandywine is definitely worth the cost.",
            "PSU Brandywine always has a lot of events going on in the Fall and Spring, be sure to get involved in those, and join clubs! Get into clubs, IM sports, etc. you will make a lot of friends and be able to build your resume.",
            "The food available is surprisingly good and offers a large variety of choices. Many students I feel are aware of this, but if you wander into the newly refinished commons you will be able to find some great food at very reasonable prices.",
            "Dorms are not available at this campus since it is a commuter school.",
            "The academic rigor is challenging enough and definitely a step up from the high school work load. Although it could be more difficult, it helps you transition into the college life and is a great opportunity to get your GPA up.",
            "One of the biggest complaints I hear about PSU Brandywine is that it is boring. This can be true if you do not get involved with what the campus has available. There are many clubs on campus that give you a great opportunity to make friends and school interesting. If you don't put yourself out there and join a group it is going to suffer from the commuter school situation.",
            "Penn State Brandywine is a great start into your college career, especially if you plan to do the 2+2 program and eventually transfer to the University Park campus. The professors there are very intelligent and teach very good intro courses. During my time there I was able to prepare myself for the transition in college, network, and get involved."

Since Brandywine is a small campus, it doesn't seem to have much opportunity for different clubs. However, Great for these types of students Brandywine is great for many types of students. For those who want a more personal relationship with their professors, it's absolutely perfect. For those who want to save money while getting a quality college education, they are able to do so, without accruing large amounts of college debt, even before they reach graduate school. Non-traditional working students find it an easier to adjust to professor's flexibility and campus resources as they manage parts of their lives that typical college students do not face (ie. raising a family). Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus Brandywine can be very beautiful. It's also known as 'B-wine' because in the spring, there are many bees that come to enjoy the variety of plants and flowers that bloom.
