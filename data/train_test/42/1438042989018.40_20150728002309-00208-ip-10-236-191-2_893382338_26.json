            "Locked down tight. Very safe. One of the things I am most happy about. Always secure, security always around, and dorms locked so only students and those who work for Geneva can get in or let people in. I feel safer here than at home.",
            "Community service, sports, mentorships, academic, the list goes on for days. You want it, it is here. If not, you are allowed to make a club.",
            "Looking for a strong education, Christian, and a fun time in college.",
            "The brig and skye are hangout places for students, and then there are all kinds of offices available for you in the student center made for easy access when you want to get something done.",
            "Perfect! We even got some sort of award associated to this. The education you get for your price is 100% worth it. It definitely is worth the price.",
            "Intramurrals, Clubs, Band, Theatre, work, sports events, get off campus in nearby cities, go see a movie, play a pickup basketball game, listen to an influential speaker, longboard, climb trees, joust, play dorm hall soccer, Netflix, go for a run, go to fitness center, go to game nights, play games in your room, have a movie night in your room, order a pizza, go on a date, go bowling, or swimming, go to wal-mart and make it onto people of wal-mart",
            "Lots of options, but after a little bit they will get old. Their are 2 places on campus where you can use your meal plan. One serves good food, and the other has lots of options, and you will be able to find something that you like at any time. Eating there eventually gets old, and you crave a burger from somewhere fast food, but you eventually get used to it, and learn how to eat the good food and what to avoid. If you learn the science to it that is easy to learn, you can have a wonderful food experience.",
            "They can be dirty sometimes, but they are cleaned weekly. Not much to them if you are not in the traditional halls, but many things to do when you are, like ping pong, tv, etc.",
            "You will get the education you are looking for. It is a Christian college, so they speak their faith in the classroom, but the academics are unbeatable. Ask about placement rates, and percentage of how well students do on graduation and graduate tests, because you will be surprised about what they are for your major. Biology will set you far above other grad students for medical type jobs and other, graduate type degrees, making you feel as far as a year ahead.",
            "Visit. There is only a ten minute walk across campus at the most, and it is very nice. Look into your major, and ask lots of questions about it. Engineering and Accounting both have 100% job placement, so definitely ask questions about the other majors too, because many are high as well.",
            "Great home away from home feel; the community is outstanding, and you will get to know many different people. There is only 1400 undergraduate students, so it is nice and small. You get the academics you are looking for, with high job placement rates and a career development office that knows what they are doing, chances are you will have a job or be in grad school when you are done."

Geneva also puts together road trips and athletic rallies. another locational perk for Geneva is that it is only 30 minutes from Pittsburg., 61674=2011 2012 school year had some strange counts of vandalism, but the security is usually on top of things although a bit aged., 31793=The food at Alex's and the Brig is not the best, but Alex's is receiving a complete remodel over the Summer of 2014., 41951=In April, many students on Geneva's campus participate in the event Humans vs. Zombies. For a straight week they run around campus, humans with Nerf guns trying to avoid being tagged by and turned into a zombie, and zombies trying to avoid being shot by a human. Even if you are not playing, it is quite an entertaining sight to see., 135498=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 101239=one cool tradition is Humans vs. Zombies, a week-long game students play every year in April. It makes the campus a little more interesting and wacky as students wearing orange bandannas chase each other around with nerf guns.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Geneva College is great for any student who wants to attend a small, Christian college and meet great people in the process. It is also great for those who may have come from a very small high school or homeschooling setting who are used to more individual attention from instructors. However, it is not a bad choice for those who are used to large institutions either. Tips for prospective students Living on campus, especially in the traditional dorm residence halls, gives an experience like nothing else. I recommend living in a residence hall on campus, you would be surprised at the close friendships that you make. Also, as far as academics go, if you find something difficult, go talk to your professor. They are there to help; and most of them are very helpful and truly enjoy helping you out one-on-one. Bang for the buck Private schools are expensive, but Geneva does give out a lot of financial aid and scholar awards. You will pay a lot to attend Geneva, but if you want to attend a college with people and professors who care about you while getting a good education, then Geneva is the place for you. Am enjoying being here",
