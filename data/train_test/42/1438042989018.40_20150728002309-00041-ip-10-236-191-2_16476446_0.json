I`m not saying we wont beat our total from last year, just pointing out as you have done that to win the league we have to better the rest of the remaining fixtures !. You and quite sensibly, doubt we will win the league this year, so no argument there !. I just have doubts about our mental state when we play the rich trinity !. Hope that is as clear as Arsene`s January Transfer dealings !. Which may I say is a lot clearer than your previous swingometer !. Which I`m sure had the effect of both :shock: and :roll: to most AAers\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..apart from Redders, who probably gets some sexual gratification from it !. In the case of TMHT, he is hugely disappointed in your swingometer as it doesn\u2019t have graphics of a bowl with car keys in it !., 233364=At the moment though he has Giroud, Podolski, Cazorla and Gnabry to hit. Suddenly play becomes more about congested and he has no runners.

Now we have a series of tough games at home The Home of Football. First, Manchester United visit on Wednesday 12 February for a crucial Premier League clash. It seems Boris \u2018taking chum up the Arsenal\u2019 Johnson and Millwall-supporter Bob Crow have cleverly constructed a situation where the Emirates will be populated mainly by the Gooners, with only a handful of goons from the shady North West managing to travel to London to support the (Old) Toilet cleaners. Thank you both. Next, Liverpool step into the lion\u2019s den on Sunday 16 February, fresh from their Arsenal bashing big grins, for a sombre FA Cup tie. Bayern Munich, the Champions of Europe arrive for a key Champions League encounter on Wednesday 19 February. The visit by Sunderland on Saturday 22 February completes a gruelling 4-games-in-11-days killer series at home in the Emirates., 250393=Indeed, our home record is fantastic, and it looks even better when compared against our main title rivals Chelsea and Manchester City. Chelsea drew at home to West Ham on 29 January and to West Brom on 9 November. It would therefore seem likely that Chelsea may drop further points at home to the smaller clubs. Manchester City have been formidable at home. But they lost to Chelsea on 3 February and to Bayern Munich on 2 October., 252701=Arsenal 3-1 Stoke Sun 22 Sep, 48450=\u2014 fumbucker (@fumbucker) February 12, 2014, 252486=Arsenal 1-3 Aston Villa Sat 17 Aug, 172168=You see, the temperature right now (11:15 a.m.) is well below freezing, (about -12C) although it is real sunny, and it is usually pretty cold at night at this time of year too. But it can go as high as +20C during the day too \u2013 quite a swing., 252411=14 wins out of 18. There were 2 draws, against Chelsea and Everton. And there were 2 losses as well, against Dortmund in the Champions League and an opening day blooper against Villa. Only 8 goals conceded at home, and this includes the 3 shocking goals conceded on the opening day. No goals were conceded in the 6 games since the Deulofeu goal at the death against Everton on December 6. 4 points were dropped against Chelsea and Everton, both strong teams, and these were in a run of poor results in December. That, and the opening day Villa game apart, quite formidable., 54067=http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/arsenal/169285/the-black-and-white-years-30-marvelous-vintage-photos-of-arsenals-highbury-stadium-between-1931-1967.html, 164384=Good post.

Talented kid, can\u2019t understand why Moyes wouldn\u2019t play him\u2026\u2026was he really that badly behaved?
