A lot of it comes from the fact that it is in the bay area which is usually expensive to live in, but the quality of education here makes it worth it. There is a lot of financial aid available, so it is easy to come up with the money to pay for it. I'm paying about $1000 for the whole year out of pocket and it is definitely worth it, especially for being the number one public university in the world!, 698157=Holi happens every year in April on campus, it is a huge paint fight put on by the Indian Students Association. The lower plaza of campus become plastered with pink and purple. Of course don't forget the huge production of Big Game Week!!, 506096=My dream school since I was thirteen, and I through hard work I was accepted for the Spring 2013, 49183=Living 30 minutes outside of San Francisco certainly has its benefits. Fisherman's Whart, Alcatraz, Union Square, all a short BART trip away. Berkeley itself, however, can be low on the entertainment. There's a lot of places to eat, but not a lot to do. With a few hiking trails, sunny weekends can be put to good use, but considering that it rains most of the time, that option only exists for August/September., 931855=Best Cal tradition is definitely Berkeley Time. Basically, all classes start 10 minutes after the scheduled time. For example, 8 AMs don't actually begin until 8:10 (sometimes even later if you have a pretty chill professor). You could, theoretically, wake up at 8 for your 8 AM. Though I wouldn't suggest doing that for the first few days of class, especially if you don't know the campus very well., 160154=Berkeley offers a great selection of a variety of subjects -- you're sure to find something that you're interested in, and there are a lot of resources available even to people who are undecided. In fact, you're expected to take all sorts of classes! They truly want you to have a full education here, and not just march through a bunch of courses and come out with a diploma. Even in the large classes, professors are friendly and truly want you to be able to succeed., 918577=Get your SAT and GPA scores up! I scored a 2200 and am still nowhere near the top of their prospective class due to a somewhat subpar 3.85 GPA., 1066887=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 83811=Compared to private school tuition, the tuition at UC Berkeley is considerably affordable for in-state students. (Out-of-state pay 3 times as much as in-state.) That being said, tuition has doubled since I started college in 2009. These tuition hikes by the UC Regents have been causing a stir at all the UC campuses. Many of my lectures have 300-500 people and I have been one of 15 or 20 regulars at a professor\u2019s office hours (the average class size of some small liberal arts colleges). Dorm and apartment living is also pretty expensive, but I wouldn\u2019t expect much less living in the bay area. If you are willing to pay to be taught by some of the world\u2019s leading minds but do not necessarily care about a lot of one-on-one interaction with professors, then you won\u2019t be disappointed.}",

But no matter if you are a crazy overachiever or just a normal student, Berkeley has everything for you. Just know that if you come here, you gotta study sometimes. So it's best for the people who know how to keep a balanced schedule. You are going to want to do a lot and being organized in prioritizing things helps keep you balanced. Tips for prospective students There are so many great things to know about Berkeley that you will experience on your own, but here is just a few things: - Your professors care about you.
