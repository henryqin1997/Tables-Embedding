Rather the scope of the present invention is defined only by the claims, which follow. , it requires significantly less processing power and storage area and hence can be manufactured at considerably lower costs. FIG. 1 It is noted that although two-dimensional system 400 provides less visual information than system 100 of Superimposing processor 416 can add additional information to the super-imposed sequence, such as the location of the surgical tool, above or under the viewed plane. For example, portions of the surgical tool which are located on one side of the viewed plane shall be indicated using red color, portions of the surgical tool which are located on the other side of the viewed plane shall be indicated using blue color, and portions of the surgical tool which are located on viewed plane shall be indicated using red color. MPS sensor 432 1 detects the location and orientation of surgical tool 420. MPS system 408 determines the location and orientation of surgical tool 420 and provides this information to main computer 402, which in turn provides it to super-imposing processor 416. Superimposing processor 416 determines a representation in space, of the surgical tool 420, derives a projection thereof, onto the plane of",
