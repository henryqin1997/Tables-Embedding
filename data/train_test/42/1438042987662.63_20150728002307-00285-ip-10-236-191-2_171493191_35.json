            "Students who love a medium sized university in a college town will feel at home, but really anyone can feel at home. It has the best of both large and small colleges. There is a wide range of people with an even wider range of interests. It is pretty easy to find people with similar interests and that love to hang out.",
            "Definitely talk to students on campus to get an inside scoop. Also ask where the best place for you to live would be. The best place depends on your preferences and personality. Get involved as soon as you arrive on campus. If you put it off, you will keep putting it off.",
            "College is expensive today, but there is no shortage of services and activities at CSU. The campus looks nice, but I don't feel like money is wasted on useless remodeling. CSU also makes it very easy to pay bills which just keeps life simpler.",
            "The community and culture at CSU and in Fort Collins is amazing. From the first day you walk on campus, you feel at home. People are so friendly and there is so much to get involved in from activities and classes at the rec center, to the many clubs on campus, to sports games. You will never find that there is nothing to do. The Fort Collins community is really nice and friendly and complements the campus. There is Horsetooth Reservoir, bike trails, many restaurants, and many other things to do.",
            "College is truly a time to learn. CSU gives you so many opportunities to learn about academics, culture, and other people. Most classes are amazing. As always, there are a few bad professors, but there is an abundance of resources to help you. There are also many amazing professors that love teaching and make it very easy to learn what is being taught."

I was very interested in the Music Therapy courses and practice there., 54611=*A good time to start classes is 10:00 am. This way the latest you usually stay is 3:00pm and you can sleep in! *Do not take the easiest math course out there. Surprisingly, it is the lowest level math that is more challenging because it is math that was not used in high school. *If big classes aren't your thing, just sit in the front of the class. I came to this school knowing I would be in classes of 200+ students. I found that sitting in the front feels no different than a normal class size. *Be social in your classes. It is vital to have a study group (or at least a study partner), especially when it comes to take-home finals. *Bring a bike and a lock. Although you could walk around campus, a bike makes it 10 times faster (really helpful for procrastinators waiting 'til the last minute to leave for class). Just keep an eye out for those bike cops! *Use your meal swipes! Every week your unused swipes are thrown away and you can usually get by with the smallest plan. *Make friends with your hall mates. They come in handy when boredom strikes or when you need a ride. Getting to know them will also help you out later when picking roommates for your apartment., 436776=At the foothills of the Rockies, 3 miles from campus, is a giant, white letter A on the hillside. This dates back to when CSU was an agricultural school. Each August, there is a tradition where students hike up to the A to repaint it., 1073373=You definitely should apply for scholarships (the more money the better) but as an out-of-state student who's flight costs $1000 round trip every year, the price is tight but not undoable. And if you put a lot of effort into your classes, the price is worth what you learn, as well., 86168=Being a student here has many positives. As a freshman living in Braiden Hall on campus, it is nice being in a central location near a majority of my classes. This allows for more sleeping in and more motivation to go to class. Also as a student there are perks such as getting into sporting events free, riding the bus for free, use of the amazing student recreational center which is brand new as of 2010 and with the addition of a new pool which will be ready in the spring (2011) chance to join any of the diverse clubs and organizations, networking with other college students, many job opportunities, free t-shirts and other small things available on campus, lots of help in anything a person does not understand or wants to learn more about. Also Being located in Fort Collins allows for many fun activities to do outside of school work such as going to Old Town for free concerts, many good restaurants, dance clubs, movie theaters and much more!, 643552=Fantastic. Almost all the dorms have been renovated this year (2012-2013) and they have done a fantastic job. Everyone is nice and all together experiencing the same experiences as you. Staff is friendly, rooms are well made and it is a good experience for all., 216833=Do not wait on filling out fafsa and getting your financial aid stuff in asap! march 1 is the deadline and make it!!! Do not settle on one major you might find something you really like that didn't interest you before. people are friendly but Greek life is not for everyone., 41216=In college most instructors do not take attendance, because the classes are so big; but you should still go to class. I know from experience that sleeping through your 8 am class on Monday morning is very easy and tempting, but I soon learned that it is very hard to catch up on work in college compared to high school. If you miss a class you can\u2019t just go up to your professor and ask what you missed on a certain day, because by the next class you are usually about a chapter behind already. The way some people look at is: if you don\u2019t go to class you are wasting $1000 each semester on just one class. So if you skip all of your classes and party every night your aren\u2019t going to do well in you classes, and will end up dropping out and wasting thousands of dollars. Another tip I have is to study. In most classes your grades come from tests, and there is usually no homework. So if you fail one test, the highest grade you can get will be a B. In you classes your professors just highlight the material that you need to know. They leave it up to you to learn everything that you need to know for the test. I know this from experience, so I have started recommending that people start studying right away, and not wait until the week of your tests to start reviewing what you learned in and out of your classes., 1133186=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 803500=I live in Academic Village so I get most of my meals at RamsHorn. I had to adjust my eating schedule a little bit to fit the open times of the upstairs of the hall, unless you fried food or express you have to eat before 7. This was a little different for someone like me used to dinnertime being 7:30 and beyond. But never fear, Braiden, my favorite dining hall on campus, is open later and a great place for lunch since it is close to classes. Sure dinning hall food gets old after awhile and there is no comparing to home cooked meals but compared to many other schools in the nation we have very little to complain about.}",

However it is exceptionally good for a person who loves our environment. CSU is a green campus and is very involved in recycling. This makes a clean campus. Also, CSU is great for science majors. They are specialized in this field so any student who is interested in the science field. Tips for prospective students My first tip would be to take college visit. See the campus and the city. This is definitely help make your decision because the campus is so beautiful. Also, look into every major they have. They do have a wide variety of majors, however, they are specialized in certain ones so if you are thinking about one of these then CSU is a great choice. If you decide to come, come with an open mind and an",
