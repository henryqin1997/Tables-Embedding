My mac Pro was 6 years old & was about worn out. I switced back to a PC & ordered the parts that I thought would be what I need & built my own PC. If you want your PC to blaze away there is much more than memory that need to be addressed. Start with a new motherboard that will handle Ivy bridge & an 1155 CPU Quad core. Get an SSD for your start up hard drive & add a couple of large hard drives for storage. At least 16 GB ram. Add a good GPU for your video & get a good cooler for your CPU to keep it running at a low operating temp when you are processing large files. Throw in a power unit at least 750 watts\u00a0 rated gold or higher. With an OS & new mouse & keyboard you can build this for about 2K. This is a much better system that my Mac pro which cost about 7,500.oo. Took about three hours to build. This is my first build. From turned off to be in a program working takes about 10 seconds. That includes signing on. Your mileage may very.}",
