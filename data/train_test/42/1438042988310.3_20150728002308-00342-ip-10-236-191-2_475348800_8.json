Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications, and variations in the appended claims. The methods described herein can be implemented as computer-readable instructions stored on a computer-readable storage medium that when executed by a computer will perform the methods described herein. are a flow chart of the steps used in a method of cataloging and detecting network faults in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The process starts, step 100, by receiving a plurality of fault messages from a network at step 102. The plurality of fault messages are parsed for an event code and a target at step 104. A target type is determined for the target at step 106. A tally is formed for each instance of the event code, the target type and the target at step 108. A key is formed for each unique combination of the event code, the target type and the target at step 110. An association is calculated for the key at step 112. The tally is stored in a location of an associative database connected with the key at step 114. A threshold is set for a predetermined target type at step 116.",
