            "There is a campus police station, and they seem really good at patrolling the whole campus, so I feel pretty safe.",
            "There are a few bowling places, and some movie theaters (even a discount theater in Santa Maria). There are also some really great hiking trails in multiple locations, that are really awesome. LA is not too far, and Malibu beach is about 30-45 min away.",
            "There is a great place right at the bottom of the hill of campus that has a Subway, McDonalds, Starbucks, Donut and bagel place, Burger express and some pizza/sandwich places. The actual cafeteria at school is all vending machines now, so the bottom of the hill can actually get you more food, fresher food, and at a cheaper price.",
            "There is no housing on campus, it is all off campus. There is a lot of housing right next to campus though, and I know quite a few people that will just walk or ride their bike to class. Moorpark in general has a lot of housing and apartments, and Simi Valley is 6 miles away and also has a lot of housing. It is a little expensive though, so get used to having roommates.",
            "I am in the EATM program at Moorpark, so the academic rigor is very tough. I'm not sure what the classes are like outside of my particular program though, so I don't want to say all the classes are incredibly hard. It might just be the particular program that I'm enrolled in.",
            "Definitely go to the Financial Aid office to see if you are eligible, and if a California Resident, try to see if you qualify for BOG. Also, the bookstore gets swamped as classes start, so pre-order your books early, it saves a lot of hassle. Be familiar with the layout of the campus, some classes are in weird buildings and areas, not on the main part of campus. Also, make sure you get your parking permit early, the lots are patrolled daily and tickets are not fun. Also be sure to get to the campus in enough time to get parking, and sometimes that will take a while.",
            "It is a pretty decent community college. The teachers are pretty good, and they have lots of great sports areas like a nice track, tennis courts, baseball fields, field hockey, golf, etc. The only real negatives so far have been no swimming pool, and the parking is a mess unless you get there by 8:00 am."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students It's great if you have little money or know you want to transfer to the UC/Cal State. Tips for prospective students If you want to save money, GO TO MOORPARK. However, if you plan on transferring to a private school, check their transfer agreements before signing up for classes. Also, know the CRN numbers before the sign-up dats. Do choir; Vail Keck is a wonderful professor. Take a philosophy class with Janic Daurio; brilliant woman. Bang for the buck 15 Units? Less than $1000 dollars. Yes. Bang for the buck, indeed. Am enjoying being here It's in a beautiful area, but I personally don't like the feel of it. It's just a personal things. Nice professors though. Am learning a lot Most of the teachers are quiet knowledgeable and have a good grasp of their subject matter.
