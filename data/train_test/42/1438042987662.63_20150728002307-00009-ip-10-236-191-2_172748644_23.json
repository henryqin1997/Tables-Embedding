            "They have a small cafeteria that only had vending machine. I wish there was more options for those people that have 2 classes a day.",

            "Register early and get your classes set up by an advisor so you know your schedule and you can get your books early enough so you don't have to wait for a book to come in if you go in to late.",
            "I like the fact that if I need extra help the teachers are more than willing to stay after or set up a study group to help you out. The other staff is always there if you need more help or info. Its always nice and clean and in a great spot of town easy access from anywhere and if your close enough you can walk."

Academic Rigor Academic rigor can be tough, but you have to be tougher so you can get the best grades possible to show your serious about your career choice. Study like you believe your life depends on it. Tips for prospective students My tips are this: 1) Be serious about going to school, 2) Have a good idea of where you want to take your career choice, 3) Be ready to study and ask questions when in doubt about something, and 4) Have respect for yourself and others enough to allow for the knowledge to sink in by not being a distraction (even to yourself). In three sentences I like the Kokomo campuses because the staff goes the extra mile to help students in their field choice. Most generally the teachers are very helpful in giving guidance for their classes. I like the fact that a student can do a two year plan, but not be tied down to getting it done in two years should something happen beyond their control.
