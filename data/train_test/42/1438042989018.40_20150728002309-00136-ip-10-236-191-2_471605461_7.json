Generally, the interacting multiple model algorithm 2400 is useful to track either or both maneuvering and non-maneuvering targets with moderate computational complexity, wherein a maneuver is modeled as a switching of the target state model governed by an underlying Markov chain. Different state models can have different structures, and the statistics of the associated process noises of different state models can be different. The interacting multiple model algorithm 2400 performs similar to the exact Bayesian filter, but requires substantially less computational power. Each model has a corresponding filter that is processed by the curvature processor 84 in accordance with the interacting multiple model algorithm 2400.}",
