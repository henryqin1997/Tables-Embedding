Since many variations and embodiments of the invention can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, the invention resides in the claims hereinafter appended. While the preceding description has focused on an expandable, generally split, sleeve 108, the expandable profiling surface can also be achieved through technologies such as air mandrel technology and the like. In addition, the profiling surface may be segmented, as illustrated in FIG. 9A, it also may be formed of a resilient and/or elastic material, such as a deformable, continuous elastomeric o-ring that may be placed upon an expandable sleeve, even a split sleeve, or another deforming device, e.g., a linear compression device. Still other methods of extending the appropriate features on the tooling will be recognized by the ordinarily skilled artisan. Alternatively, the ram could be substantially cylindrical while the sleeve could be tapered in either direction. In yet another arrangement, the sleeve or features on the sleeve, such as the profiling surface and/or the flange may be extendable by means of hydraulics or air pressure. For example, expanding the sleeve is preferably achieved by the interaction of the sleeve and the ram. A ram can have a taper that is arranged and configured such that a proximal end contained within the sleeve has a smaller cross-section than a distal end",
