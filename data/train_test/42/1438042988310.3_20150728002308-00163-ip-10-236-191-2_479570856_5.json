No. 5,311,360, Solid State Sensors and Actuators Workshop, Hilton Head Island, S.C., Jun. 13-16, 1994., 72903=[0110] That surface 13 a of the color resolving diffraction element 13 in FIG. 12 which is adjacent to the light source has a shape similar to that of a one-dimensional brazed diffraction grating, as shown, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-11662., 32363=[0019] As an example, in a high definition television (1920\ufffd1080 pixels, HDTV: High Definition Television), the number of pixels of a two-dimensional image display element and the number of pixels of an image display element made into a one-dimensional array are compared with each other. The two-dimensional image display element has about 2,000,000 pixels, and the GLV made into a one-dimensional array has about 1,000 pixels.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0123] According to each of the above-described embodiments, there can be provided a simple or compact optical scanning apparatus and projecting apparatus. [0122] In the above-described embodiments as well as in the first embodiment, not GLV's but modulating elements of other types can be used as the light modulating means. [0121] In the above-described embodiments, the anamorphic optical system 2 and the telecentric lens 3 may be placed on the optical path of not a white light source but each color light. [0120] Also, in the present invention, use can be made of light modulating means in which two or more pixels are arranged in the sub-scanning direction and a number of groups of these two or more pixels are arranged in the main scanning direction. [0119] In the projecting apparatus of the present invention, the construction of the light source side and the construction of the GLV side may be extracted from the construction in each embodiment and may be arbitrarily combined together and constructed. [0118] While the present embodiment, unlike the aforedescribed embodiments, does not use any means for color combination or color resolving, again this construction can obtain an effect similar to that of each of the aforedescribed embodiments. [0117]FIG. 13 is a schematic view of the essential portions of an eighth embodiment",
