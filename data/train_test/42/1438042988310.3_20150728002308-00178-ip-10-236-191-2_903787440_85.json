            "Very safe, and more importantly, the campus security aren't evil guys in suits, they are chill and respectable. I've had a few good conversations at 3am with some of them.",
            "Not that dominant in the UT lifestyle, but there are sororities and fraternities that are active. If your a die-hard greek, this school is preferably not for you.",
            "Too many to count. Plus it isn't too difficult to make your own, if appropriate, and best of all the school will support you.",
            "If you want to go to school in Florida, you know who you are. This school is for you!",
            "It's Florida, use your imagination!",
            "Mundane and repetitive, but the buffet cafe staff are amazing. Just remember they are people too and therefore you should say please and thank you.",
            "I don't think there is a person on campus who doesn't have a close niche of friends. Dorm life is great, people are friendly, and the college fun exists.",
            "Classes aren't to challenging, but if you want to be challenged you can find professors that will do such.",
            "Understand finances, know how to spend money and more importantly save money. Have time management skills. You are in Florida, the weather is gorgeous, and the lifestyle is exhilarating. You want to get a good grade, just do your homework and show up for class, its literally a few hours of your day, and roughly 15 hours of your entire week. You can manage it. Be wary of taking advice from guidance counselors, they don't always know the best advice. Also be smart about what you do.",
            "This school is perfect for the freshman student curious about the college experience and still willing to excel in his or her educational career. Be wary of distractions, as they will occur. Teachers are willing to communicate with you and help your needs but you must make the effort to go to them."

May be pricey, but well worth the costs., 442214=UT students always participate in the Gasparilla parade that takes place mid-January. It is a great experience, a lot like mardi gras, and a great way to let loosen up a bit half way through the school year., 36862=This university is great for kids who like a more one on one learning experience and like to get to know a variety of different people from a variety of different places, we have over 1000 international students! If you don't wanna take a twenty minute walk to your classes, get to know a lot of people, and have your teacher know who you are The University of Tampa is right for you!, 500214=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 143323=Gasparilla. Every year in January the city of Tampa shuts down its main roads for what is essentially a pirate-themed Mardi Gras. The residence assistants will cook breakfast for each student in their hall and the students start drinking as early as 7am. Then we walk around the city watching the parade and seeing thousands of people. Best time of my life., 114690=The dorms are pretty good except really for Mckay. But, the school keeps accepting way more students than they have room for so some students are put in a hotel off campus but there is a shuttle to get to and from campus. A new dorm is underway and should be up in 2013., 324775=There is an annual event that happens in late January, right after you come back from winter break called Gasparilla, AKA Gatsby. Everybody wakes up at 9 am, puts on a pirate costume, gets drunk, and walks the streets of Tampa. This event is actually a lot of fun and sponsored by the city, there's a huge pirate parade and the pirates give away beads in the parade. It is complete madness and a nightmare if you decide to drive that day, but its ALWAYS better on foot if you're going to be drinking!! But if you're more of a wallflower, its pretty easy to opt out, there's no pressure to party, but a lot of people do. Tampa is actually on a river that is within a park so you can walk up to the river, lay out a towel and sunbathe, study, or take in the view. Its a really beautiful place to just sit and relax. Another cool thing was that we had the Republican National Debate come to UT this last Fall of 2012! We had the Today Show come and visit the campus as well as Senator John McCain stopped by to speak to our business students., 315565=I have heard great things from this school. I am planning to apply in the Fall of 2013. Is a beautiful campus and I hope to visit the campus soon!}",

We have so much here on campus all withing walking distance, you don't have to ride a bike to get from building to building. It's also a great school if you live in Florida as I do, you can live on campus and have the independence, but still not be that far away in case you need something from home. Another plus, no expenses to travel home during breaks. Tips for prospective students Apply here early. Tour the campus, get the full picture. You will love what you see. Bang for the buck I believe I am getting the best education possible. University of Tampa",
