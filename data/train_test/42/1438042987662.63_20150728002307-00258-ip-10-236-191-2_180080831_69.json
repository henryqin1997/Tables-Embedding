            "Campus safety is top notch. The is always a DPS officer within arms reach and there are contact boxes all within view of each other spread all across the campus.",
            "Greek life is a big part of Southeast. If you have never though about joining a fraternity i would say this, you never know unless you try. The greeks love having fun and sharing the almost sibling rivalry kind of relationships. There are lots of school related activities and not school related ones to take part in.",
            "There are a lot of clubs on school grounds and some that meet off campus. There is a great recreation center with everything you could need to have a good time. 2 pools, hot tub, basketball courts and weight rooms, There is also a few parks and fun places to go out and explore in Cape Girardeau.",
            "Food and dining is good there is a lot of choice all around campus. Great restaurants if you get tired of the cafeteria food and want to switch it up or the other way around. All of it is conveniently placed around the campus not just in one place.",
            "Dorm life is good. You meet a lot of new people very rapidly and have chances to get to know them through a lot of school funded activities.",
            "There is something for everyone. There is a wide variety of classes and a variety of different levels of classes. Be it honors classes all the way down to algebra.",
            "There are lots of opportunities to take advantage of and a lot of different activities to be a part of. Try out new things and you might just find something you like.",
            "Southeast is the university of first choice. First choice for students to attend. Also the first choice for employers."

I plan on joining Catholic Campus Ministries, Student Activities Council Residence Hall Association and possibly AFROTC. I am really excited to be a freshman!, 327056=I wouldn't recommend Towers East to any freshmen, because they have too many fire alarms that go off, typically late at night like 1 o'clock, 3 o'clock in the morning which isn't cool. But if by chance that's what you can afford at the moment go for it. Vandiver, Myers, Merick, New Hall, and Towers North are really nice! I highly recommend them!, 70033=There are so many good instructors at SEMO. You will learn quickly who to take from the ratemyinstructor website and also from all your friends you meet here. I plan on entering the competitive nursing program in Spring 2013. Till then, most of the instructors know how strict to be in order to get the important things in your head which will help you and not to worry about the pointless information you don't need. (I didn't take math at SEMO) I highly recommend trying to test out of developmental en classes and the alecs program (math). I've only heard bad things about them, they are a waste of your money because a lot of people who took it failed., 230641=There are tons of student organizations. These organizations have a lot of events too. They even try to raise money for charity. Some of the events I have been too are Halloween party's, Carpe Demi, a masquerade ball, and some charity's include rely for life or march of dimes., 249302=Every year on campus around October, there is a game called Zombie tag. This is a campus wide game and is very fun to play. Also, there is a Dance Marathon every year for charity that is very awarding to participate in., 366304=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students This school is great for students who like to be social and want to learn. Tips for prospective students You should come and visit before you make a decision on any college. Bang for the buck Southeast Missouri State University, in my opinion, is very reasonable about pricing. Their tuition is much cheaper than many other schools in Missouri and their educational program is equal to the other schools. There are also many available majors to chose from. Am enjoying being here I enjoy being here because I like living in the dorms and I like the size of the school. Am learning a lot I am learning a lot from my classes here at SEMO. I am in a Child Psychology class and I feel like I have learned the most from this class. The teacher is really helpful and the course is challenging in a positive way. The same level of difficulty is true for my Elementary Education Math class. Also, I am enrolled in two dance classes, Jazz II and Ballet II. Both of these courses are challenging and productive.",
