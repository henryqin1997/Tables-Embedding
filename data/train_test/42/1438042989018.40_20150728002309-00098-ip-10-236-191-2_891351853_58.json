I know I would love that extra help that Stetson students receive, and it would help in giving me a better learning experience., 480993=Values Day, in September, everyone gets the day off of school to participate in community service. The library gives out milk and cookies during finals week., 508306=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 54839=with student to teacher 11:1 i say you can definitely learn a lot..and the professors are very open., 496032=The Rock is a pile of rocks Stetson paid $30,000 for in the fall of 2014 and has since become a location for students to share their views on the campus and the world. DeLand is affectionately known as the skydive capital of the world and Skydive Deland offers discounts to seniors during Senior Week. On a clear day on campus, you can see people skydiving., 456840=It's a great hands on college where you can connect with other students who have the same interests as you. the classes are a great size with a ration of a bout 1:11 so you can get that extra help and teachers know who you are. The campus is beautiful and serene, you can easily find a nice quiet place to spend your time studying or just to get away., 332915=It's not the best, but we have good coffee. When outside people visit, the food is better. Also, we are completely redoing our food services for the Fall of 2013 so who knows what it will be like}",

Not great for people just looking for a party school. Tips for prospective students Join an on campus organization. If you do so, you will have plenty of friends and never be bored. Also, take advantage of the small class sizes. Classes can be challenging, but the professors are all very willing to help. Bang for the buck The major drawback for me is the cost of attendance.
