The inverting input of comparator 1050 is connected to the inverting input of comparator 1042 so that both comparators 1050 and 1042 receive the same charging signal from capacitor 1034. When the charging signal rises to a level of the reflected light signal on the non-inverting input of comparator 1050, the output of the comparator will switch state and signal the computer that the capacitor 1034 has charged up to the same voltage, or substantially the same voltage, as the reflected light signal., 230691=Input data from the data bus 1110 of the computer interface subassembly 802 is provided to a programmable input/output interface device 1200 through an appropriate connector 1202.

Accordingly, the present invention starts the charging ramp for the analog-to-digital conversion from a negative voltage (i.e., -0.2 times the reference signal voltage), which is more negative than the reflected light signal which is expected, so that capacitor 1034 will charge up through the negative reflected light signal to the zero crossing level.

The operational amplifier 1020 is configured to provide a gain of -1, that is, it merely inverts the signal provided by the reference signal sample-and-hold circuit 1016., 217160=Comparator 1042 is a zero-level comparator. That is, it will compare the rising voltage on charging capacitor 1034 with ground. When the voltage on capacitor 1034 rises above ground, the output of the comparator 1042 will switch states and provide a signal to the computer 850. The signal will be used to start a timer which will be used to determine the voltage of the reflected light signal, as will be explained in greater detail., 246615=When the START signal is generated by the computer, the circuit described above will provide a 250 volt AC signal burst to each fluorescent lamp in order to ionize the gases in the lamps. By alternating which of the two transistor drive circuits are on by using gate 1672, any noise generated when starting up the fluorescent lamps by the circuits which generate the 250 volts AC is minimized. Once the lamps have \"started\", there is no need for this high voltage signal. When gates 1670, 1674 have been disabled (by the short duration pulse on their inputs determined by the values of capacitor 1678 and resistor 1676), their output signals will go to a logic high state. This will turn off transistors 1684, 1688, which in turn will turn off transistors 1694, 1700. The transformers then will no longer provide 250 volts AC to the fluorescent lamps, and the lamps will draw the constant current they need to maintain the ionization of their gases from transistors 1642, 1660., 234358=The signal from the sensor 378 on brush S is provided through a series resistor 1244 to the inverting input of an operational amplifier 1246.

Both transistors 1264 and 1294 preferably remain active during operation of the temperature control circuits. The purpose of keeping transistors 1264 and 1294 active is to provide a greater degree of control in the temperature of the turntable 50 and base plate 48, and also to prevent transient noise on the signals of the circuitry which might result if transistors 1264 and 1294 were continually driven into saturation or cut off., 216882=The output (X) of multiplexer 1038 is connected through a series resistor 1040 to the inverting input of a comparator 1042.

The other inputs of gates 1670, 1674 are connected to a resistor 1676 to ground and to a capacitor 1678, whose other side is connected to the Pin 23 of the input/output circuit 1200. A \"START\" signal is provided by the computer on Pin 23, and is provided to capacitor 1678. Capacitor 1678, in conjunction with resistor 1676, provides a short duration \"on\" pulse to NAND gates 1670, 1674, enabling them and allowing the approximately 30 KHZ signal from the \"Q4\" output of circuit 1600 to pass through. The signals on the output of gate 1670 will be a 30 KHZ burst, of a duration proportional to the RC time constant defined by capacitor 1678 and resistor 1676. The signal on the output of gate 1674 will be the same as that of gate 1670, except opposite in state., 251417=The output of amplifier 1414 is provided to a peak detector and comparator circuit. More specifically, the output of amplifier 1414 is connected to the inverting (-) input of operational amplifier 1424, which acts as a comparator and can be the other half of Part No. LA6802, the anode of diode 1426 and the cathode of diode 1428. The cathode and anode of diodes 1426 and 1428, respectively, are connected together and to a capacitor 1430 to ground. Capacitor 1430 acts as a peak detector by storing the output signal on amplifier 1414, minus the voltage drop (approximately 0.6 volts) across the diodes 1426, 1428., 237722=Amplifier 1278 includes a feedback resistor 1284 connected in parallel with a capacitor 1286, and the non-inverting input of amplifier 1278 is connected to ground.

Transistor 1620 will thus be turned on for 75% of the time, and off for 25%., 216044=When the computer 850 signals to enable multiplexers 998 and 1000, it will also signal multiplexer 1038 to choose the X0-X path, which will effectively short out capacitor 1034. However, a side of capacitor 1034 connected to resistor 1032 will be at -0.2 of the reference signal voltage. Accordingly, capacitor 1034 will charge from this negative voltage level when released by multiplexer 1038., 213193=Because the reflected light multiplexer 998 and the reference multiplexer 1000 are controlled by the computer to allow the respected signals to pass through simultaneously, it is ensured that the reflected light signals and their associated reference signals are received at the same time to charge their respective sample-and-hold capacitors 1010, 1012. This particular configuration will reject noise generated by the ultraviolet lamps 428, 434 by as much as 30 dB., 234928=Potentiometer 1252 is provided to adjust the current output provided to the coils of the heater plate 380. The temperature sensor 378 on the turntable provides a current output signal which is proportional to temperature and which is preferably approximately one microamp of current per degree of temperature. The potentiometer 1254 is preferably a ten turn potentiometer and is adjusted so that when the temperature of the turntable 0 is exactly at 37\ufffd, the output of amplifier 1246 will be at 0 volts., 212221=Connected to the output of each multiplexer 998, 1000 is a capacitor 1010, 1012 to ground, and each capacitor is connected to the non-inverting input of an operational amplifier 1014, 1016, which amplifier acts essentially as a buffer with unity gain. The combination of the capacitor 1010, 1012 with its associated buffer amplifier 1014, 1016 acts as a sample-and-hold circuit so that the output of the amplifiers will correspond to outputs of the multiplexers 998, 1000, but held for the time required to do an analog-to-digital conversion of the signals., 223088=As mentioned previously, the data bus is connected to integrated circuits 1112 through 1116.

More specifically, the output of gate 1674 is provided to a base resistor 1680 of a PNP transistor 1682. Transistor 1682 also has a resistor 1684 connected between its base and emitter, and its emitter is connected to +5 volts. The output of gate 1670 is similarly connected to a base resistor 1686 of a PNP transistor 1688, also having a base-emitter resistor 1690., 216459=When the computer sends an opposite signal to the inhibit inputs (INH) of multiplexers 998 and 1000, and to the \"A\" input of multiplexer 1038, the path between input (X1) and output (X) through the multiplexer is chosen. Capacitor 1034 will now charge positively from the -0.2 reference signal starting point at a constant slope, as current is provided through resistor 1036 to capacitor 1034.}",
