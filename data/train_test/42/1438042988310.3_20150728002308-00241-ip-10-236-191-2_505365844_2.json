Of prime interest is the levels of phosphorous in the samples. Graph D shows that the Golden Spectro Blend and the BMW petroleum SG oils contain the highest levels of phosphorous. The high viscosity Mobil 1 oils are closely grouped at 1050 to 1100 PPM. Note that the to Energy Conserving SJ oils, the Castrol GTX 10W-30 and the Mobil 1 10W-30 are both below 1000 PPM. This is in keeping with the API's 0.10% spec., 18907=For model year 1996 and older engines. Valid when preceded by certain C categories., 19498=For 1988 and older engines., 20284=For 1967 and older engines., 432=By Jeffrey P. DiCarlo September, 1999, 18582=Introduced in the API Service Symbol in 1996. For all automotive engines presently in use., 19225=For model year 1993 and older engines., 11558=Chart C lists the levels of additives in the test oils. The numbers are in parts per million (PPM). Those of you that spent your time in math class doodling pictures of hot bikes will want to know that the 0.10% in the API specification translated to 1000 PPM, 0.12% equals 1200 PPM., 19760=For 1979 and older engines., 20022=For 1971 and older engines., 3503=The American Petroleum Institute is an industry organization that, amongst other things, issues standards for petroleum products including motor oils. Oil companies agree to label their products with the appropriate API standard. This allows your motorcycle manufacturer to tell you that you need, for example, SH oil. Without such standards, they have to say you need an oil that passes ASTM D 2887 volatility test at 700 degrees with less than 18% loss. Imagine trying to compare all those test results while standing in the oil aisle at WalMart!, 4686=Despite the best effort of your piston rings and valve seals, some of your oil gets into the air flowing through your engine. In cars, and some bikes, this leads it straight through a catalytic converter. All those additives that are so great for protecting your engine are not so great for the catalyst. The Environmental Protection Agency has asked for a reduction of the anti-wear additive phosphorous due to its life-shortening effect on catalysts. When the new API oil grade, SJ, was released in 1996, phosphorus levels had been lowered from a maximum of 0.12% down to 0.10%.}",
