    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{3690=The Lakshadweep Islands are covered with coconut trees, which provide the basis of the Laccadive Mappilla's economy. The coconut supplies coir (the husky fiber, which can be used to make ropes or mats) and copra (coconut meat). These products provide the main industries on the islands. Vinegar is also derivative of coconut sap and is sold on the mainland. Breadfruit (an evergreen timber tree with edible fruits) runs a distant second to coconut in economic importance. Other foods that are raised include papayas, plantains (banana-like fruits), yams, sweet potatoes, maize, and beans. Each island has various mosques and one or two schools for religious education. Within the last ten years, the government has made efforts to establish high schools and primary schools for girls. Since 1956, the Laccadive Islands have been a Union Territory with the headquarters of administration at Calicut on the mainland. The local administration of each island is carried out by an Amin, who is appointed by the Administrator of the Laccadive Islands. He is usually selected from the Island Council of Elders, which consists of the heads of lineages. The common matrilineal unit in the islands is called Taravad, in which individuals trace their descent by a common ancestress in the female line. For example, the right to share in property passes through female members. This system began centuries ago when the men were needed to manage negotiations in trade. Their periodic absence from the island facilitated the adoption of matrilineal blood lines. Maintenance of individually owned property was only possible if the women who stayed behind could officially speak for the family on the man's behalf. Monogamy (one husband, one wife) prevails among the Laccadive Mappilla, in spite of the fact that Islam may allow a man to have as many as four wives. Cross cousin marriages are preferred, and marriages usually take place shortly after puberty. The man has true authority over his wife only if he stays with her until after all of her male relatives have died. He is then able to manage her property. A man has little authority over his children. Divorce is easy and common; over half of their marriages end in divorce.}",
