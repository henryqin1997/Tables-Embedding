One thing grossmont knows is that many students are coming from high school, which means they are not used to hard work. Grammar is not a big deal, engagement is not a must, an most difficult classes allow curves which help out on transcripts but not as a student., 84561=the food and dining has changed a lot since i first started. i started school at grossmont college in the fall of 2005. things were not as they are now. they have recently remodeled and constructed a new cafeteria. but more than that, they have created a student center where students are able to go get food and still study. this new student center allows students in the food court to feel like they are home., 70371=As an out of state student tuition is of course a bit more expensive for me; however, I really can not complain. As a Veteran I will pay close to $2500 out of my pocket for 12 credit hours. I feel satisfied with the cost especially with the new campus being built., 262134=For only $1500 a semester, this is an amazing institution to start off at. The professors here are just as good at San Diego State and other big campuses, and a lot of the time work at different universities as well., 501810=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
