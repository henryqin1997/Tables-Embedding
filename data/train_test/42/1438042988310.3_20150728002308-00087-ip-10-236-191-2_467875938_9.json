The instructions to the video DSP 104 are queued in two first in first out (FIFO) devices so that control code running on the processor 102 may execute in parallel with signal processing code running on the video DSP 104. Additionally, the output from the video DSP 104 are also buffered by another FIFO which is read by the processor 102. More details on the interactions between the processor 102 and the video DSP 104 are disclosed in copending, commonly assigned application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been shown and described with reference to one or more embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will understand that the above and other changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the following claims. In the event the techniques are implemented in computer programs executing on programmable computers with a processor, a storage medium readable by the processor (including volatile and nonvolatile memory and/or storage elements), and suitable input and output devices, the program code is applied to data from an input device such as a video camera to perform the functions described and to generate motion estimation output information to be saved on a data storage device or transmitted over a medium. The techniques described here may be implemented in hardware or software, or a combination of the two. Software may include microcode or conventional program implemented in a high level procedural or object-oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the programs can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. Additionally, the common format in commands and results allows the results of the current search to be used as part of the next search command in the sequence of hierarchical search or for motion compensation. The ease of reusing the fields of the current result eliminates unnecessary processing of intermediate search results, thus enhancing performance. Moreover, the",
