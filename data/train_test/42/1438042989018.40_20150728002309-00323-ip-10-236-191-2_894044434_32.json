            "I only lived in the dorms for one semester, but it was not ideal. The living conditions are below average even compared to other dorm rooms. It takes a long time for maintenance requests to be processed and they nickel and dime damages at the end of the year. Feels more like a prison than a dorm room, honestly.",

Capital is great for students who like a personal learning environment and are very studious. Tips for prospective students Submit your housing application early. Make sure to have some extra spending money for weekend meals because the dining hours can be kind of inconvenient. Take advantage of the opportunities during orientation to attend club meetings and meet other students.
