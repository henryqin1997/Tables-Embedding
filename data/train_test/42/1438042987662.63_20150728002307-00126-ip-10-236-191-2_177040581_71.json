            "Anderson University is located close to downtown Anderson, as well as Clemson Boulevard. In these two locations, there are many places to eat and socialize at, as well as shop. There is also bowling and skating on Clemson Boulevard, and Anderson is close to Greenville, which also has many fun things to do.",
            "There are three different restaurants to choose from on campus. The cafeteria, that serves every meal, is my least favorite out of the three. Food for Thought, which is my favorite, offers salads, Mexican, and sandwiches. The Grill, another option, offers hamburgers, hot dogs, and chicken sandwiches.",
            "Though dorm life requires some adjusting, once you spend a week in your dorm with your roommate, things seem to fall into place. You become friends with your roommate, suite mates, and hall mates. Activities are provided in the dorms, as well, to form a sense of community among the residence halls.",
            "Anderson University is recognized for their academic rigor, especially in the Education department. Most classes do require a lot of each student, but once the class is finished, you feel as though you have gained a sufficient amount of knowledge from it. The effort you put into it produces positive results, that reflect in your grade and overall academic self-esteem.",
            "There aren't many tips that I can provide prospective students, other than to apply for as many scholarships as possible, since Anderson University is a private university. Also, upon your arrival, be open to forming relationships with others in your major, in your classes, and in your dorms. Being open to new activities is also necessary during your first semester.",
            "Anderson University is a place that ensures excellence in all areas for students to excel in their field of study. An excess of individual growth occurs here and these areas of growth include academics, social life, and spiritual well-being. Overall, Anderson University is an exceptional school to attend and I am confident in the efforts of my professors and my overall education so that I can achieve my dream of becoming a prepared and outstanding teacher in the future."

During chapel time, there is a time of singing and different speakers who come throughout the year. We are required to attend eight chapels per semester. However, we have speakers and organizations that come that are truly a joy to hear from., 188102=The new girl dorms, the Boulevards, are wonderful. They have community bathrooms and they're great. I was really skeptical of having community bathrooms but it's great once you get used to it. It has a 3:1 girls to bathroom ratio compared to the older girls dorms (Denmark and Pratt) that have a 6:1 bathroom ratio. If you're a guy then you aren't in the best of luck because the guys dorms are not as nice as the girls unless you pay extra to live in your own room in the Village., 361544=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 150005=It is a university of around 2500 students but is 100 years old.}",
