            "SDSU's campus is located in a good part of town and is security-conscious, with campus police, good lighting, call boxes, and a lot of students walking about at almost all hours. They notice and question people who appear lost or out of place. The campus itself is hilly, and its layout can be confusing until you get to know it. If I were a criminal, I'd look for a locale that was easier to navigate.",
            "I'm not a Greek, so I can't comment.",
            "Tons!",
            "People majoring in music, education, languages, fine arts, computer technology or the health sciences will be very happy here. People who are at all athletic will enjoy the wide variety of sports available. The health-conscious will love California's fresh produce and the availability of organic food.",
            "I don't live on campus, so I can't comment. San Diego itself hosts the Rock and Roll Half-Marathon every year, and lots of concerts. The club scene is excellent and local theatre groups are very active.",
            "This school offers a high-quality education at a deal for in-state tuition. Its reputation is growing and its degrees will be increasingly respected. A great plus is Southern California's temperate climate and natural beauty with fantastic hiking nearby. There are no blizzards to contend with here. One of my classmates came from the Northeast on a scholarship, and we all told him he'd wind up relocating here. He seemed dubious at first, but relocating is exactly what he did.",
            "There's a lot to do in San Diego! A cultural feast. Get a copy of the local weekly magazine, The Reader, when you arrive. Balboa Park alone has over 20 museums, biking and jogging paths, huge gardens, Spanish Village with an old California feel and artisans' shops, and hospitality houses from many countries. If you're a foreign student, go there for local information and socializing. The Park also hosts the Earth Fair every April. Movie theatres near campus show an eclectic array of films. The beaches are wonderful for surfing, relaxing and playing with your dog.",
            "The variety on campus is good. The city of San Diego itself has fantastic restaurants and many of them are well within a student's budget. Go online for reviews.",
            "I don't live on campus, so I can't comment here.",
            "Ask your professors what qualities and behaviors most help their students succeed in their field of study. Join professional organizations. Keep up with your work and show interest in the material even outside that particular course's requirements.",
            "SDSU's faculty in my program of study are unusually enthusiastic about teaching. They also take job placement very seriously and bend over backwards to support students and to help them network. Students are friendly and support staff informative and helpful."

The college is full of beautiful nature which includes hundreds of different types of plants, flowers, and trees. In the middle of the school is a coy pond full of fish and turtles, this pond is so relaxing to visit during a break or just to lie down on the grass and take a nap. If you want to go outside the college area there are beaches and parks in very close distance. Students that want or are interested in joining a fraternity or sorority, our Greek system is fantastic",
