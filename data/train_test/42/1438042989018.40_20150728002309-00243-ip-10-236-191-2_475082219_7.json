In addition to this advantage, another advantage of the glue pellet 57 of the subject embodiment is that the temperature range over which the glue pellet 57 can be used is increased. As previously stated, heat must be applied to the prior art glue pellet 157 for a longer duration to completely melt the prior art glue pellet 157 than must be applied to the glue pellet 57 of the subject embodiment to soften the glue pellet 57. However, when heat is applied to the resistor 159 for long periods of time, the field technician must be careful not to overheat and permanently damage the resistor 159. Overheating the resistor 159 becomes especially problematic when the atmospheric temperature is low, such as in the wintertime. When the atmospheric temperature is low, the temperature differential between the steady state temperature of the prior art glue pellet 157 and the melting point temperature of the prior art glue pellet 157 is greater than when the atmospheric temperature is high. As a result, the time required to heat the prior art glue pellet 157 to its melting point and",
