For example, in March carmaker Toyota said it would give its Japan-based workers their biggest pay raise in 21 years. That represented about 0.8 per cent of total monthly pay, the first increase in base wages in six years, according to Reuters., 74354=Published: 08:07 EST, 25 April 2014 | Updated: 09:31 EST, 25 April 2014, 64455=Notably since the start of the year the yen is now down by some 17% against sterling. But it has not all been plain sailing. News that Japan\u2019s economy has expanded by just 0.7% in 2013, down from an initial forecast of 1% coupled with the arrival of an increase in consumption tax from 5% to 8%, has spooked investors and the market has dropped., 69909=A recent change at the top in the so-called land of the rising sun, and a stomping performance from its stockmarket in 2013 has investor interest piqued once again., 63405=Wages are starting to grow, albeit by a tiny 0.1 per cent annually in March, there is very high employment and Japanese investors are being encouraged back into their own stock market, with the advent of the new Nisa \u2013 the Nippon Individual Savings Account., 69657=Over the past twenty years, Japan, which is now the world\u2019s third largest economy after being overtaken by China in 2010, has delivered its fair share of false dawns., 67291=But 2012 ushered in a new era for the Japanese economy, when Shinzo Abe of the LDP party became Prime Minister. His election came on the back of his commitment to reform the economy, ensure long term growth and end deflation via his monetary policy agenda, dubbed \u2018Abenomics\u2019., 65582=Rollercoaster: Baillie Gifford Japan Trust is up substantially since the start of 2013, but the ride has been far from smooth}",
