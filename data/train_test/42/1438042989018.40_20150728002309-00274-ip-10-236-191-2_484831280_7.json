Further, the design conveys a sense of depth to the viewer, giving dimension to the design, making it difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. In addition to protection from manual or mechanical intrusion, the printing process, using interlocking multi colored light reflective materials also provides protection against counterfeiting by photo copying. Protection against photo copying results from the failure of a copy to function. Protection from counterfeiting is provided by the requirement for special knowledge and special equipment and processes to duplicate the process. From the foregoing, it should be appreciated that the improved of the present invention provide a distinctive and effective verification",
