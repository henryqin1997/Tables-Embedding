Seems like a good school., 249654=It depends who your teacher is . Some teachers don't really care about your grades so it your responsibility to ask other people you know at the school such as friends or family members and see if they are good teachers. Also they are trying to change a lot of things for the next incoming freshman's of Fall 2012 which will make it more difficult to receive scholarships. As long as your grades in High School Are Good, Your Straight., 1114968=CSULB has one of the most diverse and well-rounded campuses. For Fall 2014, our university was the #1 most applied to school in California! There are so many clubs, organizations, and opportunities to become involved that you will always feel at home at CSULB., 1063889=I got into every school I applied to, even some Ivy's. I chose CSULB because of its prestige and mainly its cost effectiveness. CSULB has been named among \u00e2??America\u00e2??s Best-Bang-for-the-Buck Colleges\u00e2?? in a new list released Aug. 26 by the Washington Monthly. It does the best job of helping non-wealthy students attain marketable degrees at affordable prices.\u00e2?? CSULB appears at No. 6 on the list of colleges and universities from across the country., 732751=Make sure to have at least a 3.0 gpa and/or 1300 on your SATs this school is one of the harder CSUs to guarantee admission., 25378=The food and dining services at California State University Long Beach provide students with an excellent variety of places to eat at. The Nugget Grill and Pub, located near the Bookstore, is an excellent restaurant that offers popular sport games on a big screen television for all students, it has the best turkey burger and provides students with the perfect social ambiance. During the 2010 FIFA world cup, student flocked The Nugget to watch Spain and Netherlands fight for the gold cup. Then there is The Outpost, a delicious restaurant to attend if you need to grab a quick bite before class. Located near the Engineering and Journalism buildings, it provides students with affordable fast food such as pizza, sandwiches and salad. Adjacent to the Outpost is a small convenient store that has all the necessities a student needs such as food, refreshments, scantrons, pencils, pens, paper, etc. A favorite coffee shop among all students is Starbucks, which is located in the library. Known as one of the best coffee shops around the world, it serves all the students at my university who need a quick wake up before class or even after a long day of studying. Affordable coffee for coffee lover and addicts, it is definitely one of the best places to grab a delicious coffee on campus. I give my university five stars because of the affordable prices, delicious food, and excellent services., 4351=I enjoy CSULB. The students are all pretty chill (for lack of better terms) and there are many diverse food venues. Every Wednesday at noon bands play near the Union Center. There are movie screenings every two weeks and a Student Rec. and Wellness Center will be finished in fall 2010 (rock climbing wall, beach vollyball courts, yoga/fitness classes, pool, indoor track, workout machines, juice bar... yata yata). Plus its close to the beach and downtown Long Beach where there is always something going on., 844368=The academic level seems to be very advanced and the program I'm planning on attending in spring 2014, looks really qualified, so I'm sure that I could become a better psychologist at CSU, compared to the study in Denmark, 540394=Long Beach is very affordable for students paying instate tuition. However budget cuts and the new unit cap for the Fall 2012 semester are a huge impact on the school., 1046324=Common joke around campus: Our football team hasn't been defeated since 1991. That's because we have no football team. Baseball is the biggest sport of choice here. Also, if you are looking for a fun fact about Long Beach, the most popular one is that the school has one of three pyramids in the US., 72134=Be sure to look at the General Education requirements and what classes you need for your major. They're important for you to take in order to graduate. Definitely try to see if a class for your major can be considered for GE. Also, see if you have to apply for your degree. Like for film, you have to apply in the January of your second year., 995639=I was a resident assistant for Spring 2013 of my freshman year. This was one of the best decisions I had made, and would do it again. Definitely a place where housing is good., 1141902=The food is better than first anticipated. They are rebuilding Hillside dining hall, so the food should be better in Spring 2015/Fall 2015 at latest. Parkside and Beachside both have good options constantly., 701263=There are several art installations throughout campus, as well as a bell tower with no bell. It rings unusual tunes, and one is never sure what they'll hear. A student swears up and down he heard the Imperial March from Star Wars once.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students This really is a commuter campus, so the parking sucks. Get dropped off, or take public transportation (city bus free with student ID!) the first week of class. If you live on campus, there's a dandy shuttle system which makes it easy to get around campus. Prospective high school seniors: Apply to the Learning Alliance program- personal councilor for classes, support program and their own lounge. They have helped me through my college course planning and are extremely knowledgeable about the campus staff and classes. Bang for the buck YES! despite the economic status and budget cuts AND rise in tuition everywhere, it is still one of the least expensive universities in California. The campus is still running many programs which have a big outreach for students (psychological services, scholarship center, career development center, student support service program, student life and development, women's resource center intramural sports and wellness and associated students inc.) Plus they offer book rentals which make accessing GE books cheep and easy. Am enjoying being here I enjoy CSULB.
