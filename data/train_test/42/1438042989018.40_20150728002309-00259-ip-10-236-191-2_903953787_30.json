            "the campus safety here is among the best! i recently had a situation where someone hit my car while i was in class. thankfully, gsu police department caught the other driver, who intended on driving away. they obtained all the information i needed, and had my police report available in 3 days! they helped me through the entire process, and i am very grateful.",
            "gsu is perfect for both traditional, and non-traditional students.",
            "there are serveral on, and off campus daily activities. gsu is located near downtown atlanta, so there is always something to do!",
            "the food and dining here is convenient, tasty, and cost efficient. there are multiple choices both on and off campus for food and dining.",
            "i have not had the chance to experience dorm life here at gsu. i live off campus, but not to far. from what i've seen and heard, dorm life is great. the dorms are always clean, and i have yet to hear of any incidents.",
            "i encourage all prospective students to take full advantage of everything gsu has to offer; including scholarships, study abroad, community service opportunities, and extracurricular activities.",
            "i am grateful to be a student at georgia state university. i am a graduate of clark atlanta university. this is my first semester; although it is somewhat different from cau, i look forward to continuing my post secondary education here."

I'd give them a 10 out of 10, so far., 604684=There are several different on campus eateries for students. Secondly, by being in the city your food choices are limitless. There is a man strip of food restaurants that most students eat at by the Aderhold building but all of them close at 6:00 for some reason., 201908=Every year in September, Dragon-con goes on a few blocks from the university, so for all those comicbook, sci-fi and anime fans, that's the place to be. There is a growing number of homeless people that hang around the campus. As disheartening as it may be, don't hesitate to report those who may become physical or violent., 731303=There are two official dining halls in the dorming communities at Georgia State, one in the freshmen dorms and one in the Piedmont North dorms. Both can be a bit pricey unless you have a meal plan, which is a little over $1000. In addition to the dining halls, there are many independently-owned & ethnic restaurants scattered among the well-known franchises such as Moe's and Tin Drum. Essentially, the dining atmosphere is almost as diverse as the student population., 191844=I like GSU because it's a nice school regardless of not having a traditional campus per se. I really enjoyed the atmosphere when I visited and am planning on attending for Fall 2012. The only thing that makes me a bit nervous is the intercity location and Atlanta isn't the safest, but no major city is., 1108673=Georgia State University is located downtown Atlanta! GSU has Greek Life! I pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc at GSU fall of 1979. GSU is a great school to attend!, 1087681=The campus is very safe. There are police boxes everywhere in case you need an escort around the campus. There are also police surveying the campus at all times. Like i said, the campus police do have an escort system as well. GSU escort: 404-413-2100, 164857=georgia state university has raised its tuition a lot since i started learning there in 2005, but compared to a private university it is still affordable with student loans., 269535=They have raised everything since I've started attending in Fall 2010, but you do get what you pay for. Although, you won't use it all. The fees here are huge, especially since we got a new football team last year. The housing is great for being right on campus in the middle of Atlanta, housing is always putting on events and such., 295120=- Go to Incept (orientation) - Register for your math and chem placement test before you go to incept so you can take the classes you want - Apply for Hope and other loans around January (that's when most money comes out) - Look for scholarships (they help a lot) - If you need a job, campus jobs are great to have - Go to ratemyprofessors when registering for classes - Join a club or go greek! Be involved at your school!, 284672=It is a very good school for financial aid and it is one of the least expensive research universities in the area. Between university grants, assistantships, scholarships, and the HOPE scholarship, all but $1000 of my tuition, housing, and supply costs are covered., 1076034=I'm a business major and this school is one of the best business school in Georgia! Thus, the fact that GSU is located in the heart of Atlanta there's a lot of internship opportunities. I'm an incoming freshman so I will experience the level of difficulty when classes start Aug. 26., 319142=Recently, GSU raised the cost of al of their student fees. I pay about $1500 per semester just in student fees and I think that is pretty ridiculous. It still cost less than a lot of universities, but the student fees are so bad., 10248=There is a huge contrast between college and high school curriculum-wise. At Georgia State University, and probably any college, the classes you take are like finishing a years work of a high school class in just one semester. Like any school every professor is different in how they teach the material. Some are funny and exciting, while others make students wish they'd stay in bed that morning. I've had both kinds of professors this past semester, and I must say that I've had days where it was fun learning something new about muscles for example in my Biology 1110 Lab. There were also days in my Bio Lecture when I had to fight to keep my eyes open, and my mind focused. Regardless of each situation, I've learned more than what I thought I could learn in one semester. My professors all had my best interest in mind which was to succeed in their classes. If I ever brought up a subject that I was unclear about, they all helped me in any way they could., 987881=Well, it's not unusual, but on Tuesdays and Thursdays there's is plaza time at 12:15 pm in the courtyard. Step shows and music are some of the things that happen.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students people who love diversity, love the city life, like Georgia weather, want to learn and have fun at the same time. Tips for prospective students Apply early, get extra money so you can have extra money to spend on the weekends, apply for housing as soon as the application is available. Good Luck Bang for the buck Everything penny you pay is worth it. There are so many free events that offer things like free food, prizes, just everything is free. The education is wonderful, and when you buy books the school buys them back when you are done. It is defiantly a bang for the buck!!! Am enjoying being here I LOVE GEORGIA STATE!!! I would not want to be any where else. There is always so much to do on and off of campus. THe fact that the campus is located in downtown Atlanta is a huge plus!!! Am learning a lot The teachers here rally make sure you learn what you are there to learn. If you are falling behind, most of the teachers will give you plenty",
