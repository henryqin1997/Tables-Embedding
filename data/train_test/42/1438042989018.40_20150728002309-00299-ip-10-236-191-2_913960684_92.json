            "UW-Madison has one of the best and safest campuses, because the students make it that way. There is a bus that runs very late into the night for students called a SafeBus which is free, as well as SafeRide, a student taxi service to take you where you need to be, and you get a few free per semester. Lastly, there is the SafeWalk, which is a service that sends 2 students, male and female, to wherever you are, and they will walk you home no matter where you are. Plus on top of all of that, to promote more safety for savvy students, you can sleep in the libraries on campus.",
            "Though I do not plan to participate in Greek life, I have been told that the sororities and fraternities really have a great sense of companionship and service for the city of Madison. You can also participate in the Greek academic clubs without participating in Greek life.",
            "As I have mentioned earlier, there are over 850 student organizations, plenty to get involved in! And if you do not like one, make your own! There are a variety of clubs, sports groups and even a cheese appreciation group, something for everyone in Madison.",
            "Students that are not afraid of a large campus, willing to endure a cold winter, ready to embrace diversity and definitely ambitious to learn!",
            "I have not started my first year yet, but I know that there are some fun traditions involved with badger games, such as singing Varsity and silly superstitions that are involved with the team. There is also a circle, I believe that if you step on, you will not graduate in 4 years. On the flip side, there is a statue of Abraham Lincoln on campus that is supposed to give you luck.",
            "It is the most expensive campus in the UW-System, but how valuable is your education? You may be paying a bit more, but it is not for nothing, You will be graduating from one of the best programs in the area. Getting this type of education, academic and cultural, will help you through life and a career.",
            "There is something for everyone at this campus, there are many, many, opportunity for things to do in the student unions, as well as D1 sports, clubs and inter-mural sports. There are over 850 student organizations and if that is not enough for you, there is also a thriving entertainment basis within the city of madison.",
            "Between restaurants in the area around the campus and the food services, you could never run out of choices. Pizza, wings and spaghetti are a given. But Afghan food? Mediterranean? Right on campus? That perfectly describes Madison's diverse dining and cultural aesthetic.",
            "Though I have not lived in a dorm yet, the dorm I am living in, while small, is very exciting. I have the opportunity to live in a learning community and that opens a lot of doors for special class sections, better tutoring, and a feeling that is consistent through the whole dorm that education is the most important part about college.",
            "Your education at UW-Madison is whatever you make it. In my opinion, the amount of classes that Madison has, gives a range of rigor for any young mind. Madison is one of the best colleges in Wisconsin and the Mid-west, any graduate department would be encouraged by a Madison Diploma.",
            "Apply early! Make sure that you study for your ACT. DO NOT SLACK IN YOUR SENIOR YEAR! Make sure you tour the campus before you decide that its for you. Also, check out the dorms before you move in!",
            "The campus is beautiful and large, but it still has a small town feel with the adorable shops and the art fairs. The classes are challenging, the current students are friendly and helpful. Student life is rumbling with opportunity for clubs, enjoyment, and student orgs for any interest possible."

While not everyone can score tickets (which go on sale every June and sell out within an hour), everywhere you go, you will pass by viewing parties. Other traditions focus on Bascom Hill, the stretch of land that was the original campus. From the 'Battle for Bascom' snowball fights (between Southeast and Lakeshore campus'), Tray sledding, studying under the shade of a tree on the first warm day, or rubbing Abe's foot for good luck, it's the place of tradition., 225606=Madison's cost are reasonable, although I heard that they will be raising tuition by $2000 every year. I didn't really get any financial aid except for an actuarial science scholarship, so I wish I could have gotten a little more help. But through internships and jobs I think the cost is manageable., 1037239=Apply during the first application window! I applied before in September, before the first deadline in October, and knew by early November that I had been accepted. Also, apply for the scholarships through your college in early February., 316538=I can not talk on dorm life as a personal experience, what I can say is my fellow classmates who live in dorms really do not complain much and the new state of the dorm building should be done for fall2012. It will be awesome. Plus plenty of opportunity to live off campus also., 973368=Lots of student orgs to join, may have to look around on the WIN website to find what you are interested in as there are so much and it is hard to find out about them all. May not be as close with the people in your org as you will other friends but that isn't true for all orgs on campus, 1101166=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 94332=Madison has a world-class faculty full of brilliant and interesting (my chemistry professor was in the 1992 Olympics) instructors. Also my first semester instructors were very open about providing help and keeping their office hours to explain any questions. Because it is a very intelligent and motivated student body, students push each other to learn.}",
