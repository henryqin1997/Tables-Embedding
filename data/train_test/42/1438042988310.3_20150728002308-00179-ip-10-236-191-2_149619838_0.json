This may save you some trouble by knowing ahead of time what hardware and software you will need. Requirements Consult the Getting Started with LLVM section for detailed information on configuring and compiling LLVM. See Setting Up Your Environment for tips that simplify working with the GCC front end and LLVM tools. Go to Program Layout to learn about the layout of the source code tree. If you get an \"internal compiler error (ICE)\" see below. gmake -k |& tee gnumake.out \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# this is csh or tcsh syntax Build the LLVM Suite: --enable-spec2000=directory Enable the SPEC2000 benchmarks for testing. The SPEC2000 benchmarks should be available in directory. --with-llvmgccdir=directory Optionally, specify for directory the full pathname of the C/C++ front end installation to use with this LLVM configuration. If not specified, the PATH will be searched. --prefix=directory Specify for directory the full pathname of where you want the LLVM tools and libraries to be installed (default /usr/local). /path/to/llvm/configure [options] Some common options: cd where-you-want-to-build-llvm Configure the LLVM Build Environment gunzip --stdout llvm-test-version.tar.gz | tar -xvf - cd llvm/projects cd where-you-want-llvm-to-live With the distributed files (or",

Download and install bison (excl. M4.exe) and flex in that order. Build binutils-2.15 from source, if necessary. Bison & flex can be also grabbed from GNUWin32 sf.net project. Native code generation exists but is not complete. Binutils up to post-2.17 has bug in bfd/cofflink.c preventing LLVM from building correctly. Several workarounds have been introduced into LLVM build system, but the bug can occur anytime in the future. We highly recommend that you rebuild your current binutils with the patch from Binutils bugzilla, if it wasn't already applied. Note that you will need about 1-3 GB of space for a full LLVM build in Debug mode, depending on the system (it is so large because of all the debugging information and the fact",
