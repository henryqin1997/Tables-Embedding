Alberta News (courtesy Greg Flaaten) The 2000 Provincial Mountain Bike Team was selected this past weekend, following Ridley's Summer Solstice race. This year's team is reflective of the MTB Committee's emphasis on young, developing riders. Selected to the team on points were the following x-country riders: Elite Women - Ann Yew (ERTC/River Valley Cycle) Espoir Men - Roddi Lega (Green Mountain Cycle) Junior Men - Carl Morrison (Sport Shack) Selection of the Mountain Bike Committee were: Junior Men XC - Grant Laird (ERTC/River Valley Cycle) Junior Women XC - Laura Yoisten (Olympic Oval/The Bike Shop) Junior Men DH/Dual - Kyle Biggy (Cafe Racers) The team will compete at the National Mountain Bike Championships, July 21 -23 at Camp Fortune, Quebec, and will be managed by Steve McCarthy and Natasha Ward. The provincial Track Team begins competition next Wednesday, July 5, at Bromont, Quebec. Team Alberta riders include Lori-Anne Muenzer, Lars Madsen, Jim Fisher, Doug Baron, Ryan McKenzie, and Laura Yoisten. Alberta road rider Paul Kelly received some big news recently: Paul will complete the season with Navigators, an American professional team. (Editor's Note: Paul was first contacted by Navigators at GP Beauce. We are glad to see that he has found a North American team to continue his career with). Tour Fantasy League If you have ambitions of being a Tour de France Directeur Sportif, then try your hand at building your own team on this site: www.geocities.com/p_trkman/ La Bicicletta Midweek Club Points Race - Ontario (courtesy Peter McCaffery) Tuesday's La Bicicletta points criterium on the popular Airport Corporate Park circuit was, at seventy-seven kilometers, the longest race in the series' four year history. Over ninety riders started the race, with the handicap group of forty, leaving the line two and a half minutes ahead of the fifty-four -strong scratch group. The strong south east wind slowed the pace and there were no succesful breakaway attempts by the handicappers. Ex national team member, Don Zuck (independent), managed to steal some early points before the scratch group caught the rest of the field at just befoer the halfway point as did sprinter Aubrey Bryce (D'ornellas Bike Shop). Meanwhile, a quartet comprising Jeff Hansen and Andrew Pinfold (Ital Pasta), first year senior Enrico Traini (Mississauga Gears) and last year's series winner, Heath Cockburn (Jet Fuel/Steamwhistle Beer) detached itself from the scratch group and soon had a lead of over half a minute, motoring right through the leaders a couple of laps before the rest of the bunch. This break continued for another four laps before the pace became to much for Traini and Pinfold, who dropped back. At the same time, Sean Kelly (Jet Fuel) and 42 year-old Don Zuck broke away from the main group and joined the duo for a lap. However, with seventeen kilometers to go, all were absorbed by the peloton, leaving Hansen and Cockburn out in front. With eight laps left and the wind dying down, the main group picked up speed and finally caught them, setting the stage for a bunch finish In the final sprint, it was Pinfold just easing out Cockburn to take the chequered flag, with 45 year-old Aubrey Bryce clinching third spot, showing he still has a great sprint. The overall results, shown below, were determined by top three positions in a series of nine intermediate sprints, hence the event's name. Next week, Peter Mazur, the top-ranked junior road racer in the world, will be competing in one of his all-to-rare appearances in Canada. This should be an event well-worth watching. 35 laps, 75 km. Average Speed 41.25 kph (scratch group)}",
