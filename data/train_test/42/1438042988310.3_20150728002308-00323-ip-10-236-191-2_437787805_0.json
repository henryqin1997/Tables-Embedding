            "Working as a project team, this program has a mission. Students will continue to tend and refine habitat and theme areas in the Longhouse Ethnobotanical Garden, including the Sister Garden (patterned after a medicinal garden we created on the Skokomish Indian Reservation) as well as create valuable educational resources that contribute to the Evergreen community, local K-12 schools, local First Nations, and a growing global collective of ethnobotanical gardens that promote environmental and cultural diversity and sustainability. During , we will become acquainted with the garden and its plants, habitats, history, and existing educational materials. We will begin to engage in seasonal garden care and development, learning concepts and skills related to botany, ecology, Indigenous studies, and sustainable medicine. We will also establish goals related to further developing educational materials and activities, including a Web presence. Students will have the opportunity to select and begin specific independent and group projects that include learning knowledge and skills pertinent to their completion. During , we will focus on the garden's \"story\" through continued project work at a more independent level. Students will work intensively on skill development, research, and project planning and implementation. We will also be active during the winter transplant season and will prepare procurement and planting plans for the spring season. During , we will add plants to and care for the garden, wrapping up all of the work we have begun. We will establish opportunities to share the garden and our newly created educational materials, effectively enabling the garden to \"branch out.\" This program requires commitment to a meaningful real-world project and strongly encourages yearlong participation. It also cultivates community within the program by nurturing each member's contributions and growth, and acknowledges the broader contexts of sustainability and global transformation.",
            "During this weeklong intensive, students will spend time in the Longhouse Ethnobotanical Garden at Evergreen learning to identify, care for, and use native, edible, and medicinal plants in late summer. Students will participate in workshops, carry out projects, and engage in daily nature journaling, reading, and writing. Plan to spend much of your time outdoors.",
            "Native American women have been erased from history. It is not that they did not exist; it is that they were , omitted from history. At the same time, stereotypes such as \"squaw\" and \"princess\" have plagued Native women since 1492. Ironically, the history of Native women has reflected a different reality with a long tradition of standing strong for justice. Native women have stood to protect the lands and the natural world, their cultures, languages, the health of their families, and Tribal Sovereignty. But few learn about these Native women, who consistently defied the stereotypes in order to work for the betterment of their peoples and nations. Drawing upon the experiences and writings of such women, we will explore the ways in which leadership is articulated in many Native American communities. We will critique how feminist theory has both served and ignored Native women. Through case studies, autobiography, literature and films, we will analyze how Native women have argued for sovereignty and developed agendas that privilege community over individuality. We will explore the activism of 20th century Native women leaders, particularly in the areas of the environment, the family system and the law.This program will implement decolonizing methodologies to give voice to some of these women, while deconstructing the stereotypes, in order to honor and provide a different way of knowing about these courageous Native American women, past and present. Students will develop skills as writers, researchers and potential advocates by studying scholarly and imaginative works and conducting research. Through extensive reading and writing, dialogue, art, films and possible guest speakers, we will investigate important aspects of the life and times of some of these Native American women across the centuries.",
            "Individual study offers students the opportunity to develop self-direction, to learn how to manage a personal project, to focus on unique combinations of subjects, and to pursue original interdisciplinary projects without the constraints of an external structure. Students interested in a self-directed project, research or internship in Native American Studies, particularly in the areas of history, literature, or public history (including library studies and museum studies) should contact the faculty by email (ackleyk@evergreen.edu). There will be an opportunity for students to work through peer review and present their research with students in the program.",
            "This course is designed to introduce students to a range of poems, stories, essays, declarations, and manifestos written in the landmasses known as \u201cthe Americas.\u201d Our primary focus will be on transcultural contemporary work from North America, but we will consistently attend to earlier materials from the Americas writ large in order to inflect our understandings of the present. What does it mean to live on this land, in these languages? And what kind of leverage can literature afford us as we go about answering such questions? In the course of our reading we will encounter poets such as Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz, Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes, Harryette Mullen, Khaled Mattawa, Fred Moten, Juliana Spahr, and Cathy Park Hong; fiction writers like Ursula Le Guin, Sherman Alexie, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Junot Diaz; and essayists such as James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, and Lewis Hyde. In addition to frequent critical responses to these texts, our writing this term will include focused research projects on particular authors, as well as a repertoire of creative practices that should serve to deepen our sense of the work that literature has done and can still do in a place that Ralph Waldo Emerson once called \u201cthis new yet unapproachable America.\u201d",
            "Maori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith asserts, \u201cOur communities, cultures, languages and social practices\u2014all may be spaces of marginalization, but they have also become spaces of resistance and hope.\u201d In this program we will identify and contextualize these spaces and the politics of indigeneity and settler colonialism. We will use the Pacific Rim broadly as a geographic frame, with a focus on the Pacific Northwest Native nations and the Maori in Aotearoa (New Zealand). A comparative study of the role of treaties in Washington state and New Zealand\u2014in natural resources, governance, the arts, education, etc.\u2014will provide a key framework for the program.By concentrating on a larger region, students will have an opportunity to broaden Indigenous studies beyond the Lower 48 states and explore common processes of Native decolonization in different settler societies. We will be studying decolonization through cultural revitalization and sovereign jurisdiction of First Nations. In order to examine the central role of Indigenous peoples in the region's cultural and environmental survival, we will use the lenses of geography, history, and literature.In fall our focus will be on familiarizing students with the concept of sovereignty, working with local Native nations and preparing to travel to Aotearoa or elsewhere. The concept of sovereignty must be placed within a local, historical, cultural and global context. Through theoretical readings and discussion, we will move from state-building in the U.S. and Canada to Native forms of nationalism. We will stress the complexities and intricacies of colonization and decolonization by concentrating on the First Nations of Western Washington and British Columbia.We will later expand the focus to appreciate the similarities and differences of Indigenous experiences in other areas of the Pacific Rim, such as Native Alaskans, Aboriginal peoples in Australia and South Pacific island peoples. We will emphasize common Pacific Rim concerns such as climate change, tourism and cultural domination.For up to seven weeks spanning the last half of winter quarter and the beginning of spring quarter, many of us will travel to Aotearoa, where we will learn in a respectful and participatory way how the Maori have been engaged in revitalizing their language, art, land and politics, and their still unfolding, changing relationships with the Pakeha (non-Maori) people and society. Students will learn about the ongoing effects of colonization as well as gain a foundation in theories and practices of decolonization. We will take as our basic premise in this program that those wishing to know about the history of a particular Native group should write it with a purpose to be in solidarity with these people today.Students will develop skills as writers and researchers by studying scholarly and imaginative works, by conducting policy research and fieldwork with Native and non-Native communities, and by comparing community and government relationships in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand. Students will be expected to integrate extensive readings, lecture notes, films, interviews and other sources in writing assignments.",
            "When George Washington Bush and Isabella Bush established the settlement of \"New Market,\" now Tumwater, Washington in 1845, it was a direct result of racial discrimination and exclusion. Bush was prohibited from owning land in the Oregon territory due to his African heritage, but the restriction was not enforced north of the Columbia River. In this summer class that links with an archeological dig on the Bush homestead site, students will study the role of race in U.S. history, related specifically to the settlement of the Pacific Northwest. We'll learn how ideas and laws about race and ethnicity shaped NW territories and states socially, economically, and politically. We'll look at the ways members of racialized groups resisted exclusion and contributed to the creation of communities in the Western United States during the period of 1850-1980. The class will focus on Thurston County, specifically history related to George Washington Bush and Isabella Bush in the community of New Market, now Tumwater and related regional Native American History. Students will learn to \"do\" public history by exploring materials available in area government archives and those in digital library collections. The class will learn historical research and writing skills and take weekly field trips to federal, state and county archives and libraries in Olympia, Tacoma and Seattle. The class will work with the Archaeological Field School class and will provide historical research for ongoing work at the New Market dig site.",
            "This program will address historic and contemporary images and misrepresentations of Indians in a variety of media. Indian images from films, photographs, language, mascots, popular culture and commercial interests will be deconstructed and analyzed for meaning, significance, power, representation and issues of authenticity. Colonialism, U.S./Indian history, geo-politics, and economics will be decolonized through the lenses of Native resistance, Native sovereignty and Native political and economic issues. Essential to this exploration will be an investigation of the dynamics of \"self\" and \"other.\"Learning will take place through readings, seminars, lectures, films and workshops. Students will improve their research skills through document review, observations and critical analysis. Students will also have opportunities to improve their writing skills through weekly written assignments. Verbal skills will be improved through small group and whole class seminar discussions, and through individual final project presentations. Options for the final project will be discussed in the syllabus and in class.",
            "This program is intended for students committed to activism and praxis. We\u2019ll study the scholarship of American Indian author Vine Deloria, Jr., who drew attention to Native American issues since the 1960\u2019s. We will focus on some of Deloria's essential questions to guide research, seminars, independent projects, and community service. Students will explore ways in which American Indians have been deprived of land, economic opportunities, treaty rights, natural resources, religious freedom, repatriation, and access to and protection for sacred places. We will conduct ethnographic interviews, historical research, and write a series of plays for tribal schools. During fall quarter we will examine how knowledge becomes a tool of social change. We will pay special attention to the differences between the knowledge bases of indigenous peoples and the dominant European-American model. How do these differences influence the political and economic realities faced by Native communities? How does one \u201cword smith\u201d activism and praxis for young indigenous learners? During fall and winter quarters, we will study U.S. history, critically considering the \u201cdoctrine of discovery\u201d, colonization, and court and government decisions regarding indigenous peoples. Indian activists, tribal leaders, and scholars from the Vine Deloria, Jr. symposium will enrich the work of this program through live appearances and media presentations.Lectures, films, readings, and student-led text-based seminars will compose the primary structures used by this learning community. Quarterly, students will complete an academic project related to the theme of the program and will work in groups to explore shadow liberation theatre for Indigenous youth. Students will have the option to engage in service learning volunteer projects and internships during winter and spring quarters. Participation in this program means practicing accountability to the learning community, other communities, interacting as a respectful guest with other cultures, and engaging in constant communication with co-learners.",
            "Visiting Faculty and Makah master carver Alex McCarty will lead this course on design and woodcarving, focusing on the local cultural perspectives of feast tray and ladle making. Students will explore regional Northwest Native styles and form-line design, and examine feast trays, bowls, and ladles from local traditions as inspiration to their own feast tray and ladle concept designs. Students will carve their own tray and ladle, each one unique to the individual's identity, culture and/or personal creative expression. During the first intensive weekend students will learn basic carving skills making feast ladles, and begin rough shaping their feast trays using both contemporary and traditional Northwest coast carving tools. The second and final intensive weekend students will use their original two-dimensional tray concept designs and transfer them onto their three-dimensional woodcarvings focusing on more advanced carving and finishing skills.",
            "This upper division program teaches from a Native-based perspective within the context of the larger global society and is designed for students who have social, cultural or economic ties to tribes.

During winter quarter, students will learn about , which is an exploration of major ethical theories and their applications to a variety of current issues. Students will explore various Native perspectives on ethics and the ways in which they are manifest in contemporary Native America. Developing analytic skills and critical thinking are a key aspect of this course through, amongst other things, the analysis of cases studies on current issues in Indian communities. In spring, students will be enrolled in , which explores leadership in both mainstream and tribal contexts; students will examine how political and social forces create leaders and make history. There are five curricular elements of the program: Core Course, Integrated Skills, Strands, Integrated Seminar, and Independent Study. The Core Course, taught from a tribal perspective in a global community, is a nine-credit unit within the program taught at all sites at the same time with the same readings and assignments, but allows for faculty/student innovation and site specification. Integrated Skills, including critical thinking and analysis, research and writing, public speaking, collaboration, personal authority, and indigenous knowledge, are taught across the curriculum, integrated into all teaching and learning at the sites and at Saturday classes. Strands, another element, are two-credit courses taught on four Saturdays per quarter, which allow for breadth in the program and make it possible to invite professionals and experts in specific fields to offer courses that otherwise might not be available to students in the program. The Integrated Seminar held on the same four Saturdays as the Strands is called Battlegrounds, and is a one-credit workshop generally built around native case studies. The program also includes student initiated work through Independent Study.",

            "This will be an interdisciplinary ceramic sculpture and art history program that will explore the dynamic artistic traditions of Mexico from ancient times to the present. We will take a thematic approach to our historical studies, exploring Mesoamerican art and spirituality, colonial artistic traditions, Day of the Dead belief and rituals, the Virgin of Guadalupe and the on-going contribution of women to the culture, the post-revolutionary mural and printmaking traditions, and Chicano culture. Moving from theory to practice we will work to deepen our understanding of the ideas we have discussed in seminar through an intense ceramic studio practice. We will focus on drawing and sculpting the human figure/skeleton; developing our sense of the human form, working on abstraction, and creating a Day of the Dead sculpture/altar.",
            "Experience first-hand the waters and cultures of the Salish Sea for ten days as you crew the 133-foot sailing ship among the San Juan Islands. You will read, study, and visit maritime communities and the highly varied environments of this beautiful region with your learning community, while developing your own focus for research and study. Tribal communities, small maritime businesses and local historical sites will help you develop a sense of regional identity, maritime livelihoods, and the status of marine resources in the waters of the Pacific Northwest. After the voyage, you will continue your research and meet routinely with other students to develop your project as a written work and presentation. If you want to join the voyage and participate in shared academic work for the 10-day period without committing to an ongoing project, you should register for variable credit with the program .",
            "This is an introductory program emphasizing studio practice in 3D sculpture, art histories, visual literacy, and artistic research. It is designed to be an engaging learning experience for all who wish to be involved in artistic practice. Students will explore woodcarving, design, art appreciation, art theory, and demonstrate learning through reflective writing and seminar abstract papers. A thematic thread will cover a range of concepts and skills in woodcarving and drawing techniques, Native American design, history, and traditions. Student should be prepared to dedicate at least 40 hours per week on program activities including studio work, group critique, seminars, workshops, and lectures. There will also be a field trip opportunity for a tour of the Burke Museum archives in Seattle Washington. After the tour, students will explore the Burke\u2019s current exhibit , showcasing the dynamic relationship between past and present, collections and creativity, and artists and their ancestors. Throughout this program, students will gain familiarity with the long cultural tradition of creating forms in wood in the Northwest coastal regions. The design portion emphasizes principles of structure and style of art that can be found on many old traditional Northwest Coast boxes and chests, house panels, totems, and figures. Students apply these principles in creating their own full-size concept drawings for each project introduced. Students will learn how to transfer those drawings to their three-dimensional carvings. Students will complete three woodcarving projects during spring quarter: cedar eagle feather, 3D sculpture, and a steam bentwood box. Students will use the wood shop machines to shape out each project and use hand-carving tools to do the finishing work. Students will be provided with access to traditional Northwest coast Native tools to carve the details on their bentwood boxes and 3D sculptures."
