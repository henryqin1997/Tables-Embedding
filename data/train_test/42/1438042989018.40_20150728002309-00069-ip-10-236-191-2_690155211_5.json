Talbot showed excellent command last season, and his ability to throw strikes and get grounders could help a lot of teams. He'll get an extended look in spring training, as the Rays plan to take it easy on their front-line pitchers in March, but his only chance to crack the Rays' staff in 2009 may be in a long-relief role., 45949=2009, 47259=Talbot, who came over from Houston in the Aubrey Huff deal, posted a composite 2.76 ERA and 1.23 WHIP for both the Astros and Rays at Double-A, with 155 K in 156.2 IP. That's a keeper. Look for him to move to Triple-A in 2007 and then compete for a job in the bigs in 2008., 37139=1/23/2013, 38054=12/3/2011, 36183=3/20/2013, 44712=2015, 47207=2007, 42828=8/5/2011, 44858=2011, 46651=This was a bit of a disappointing season for Talbot; the Rays were ready to give him a brief trial in September in preparation for a potential 2008 starting rotation bid, but Talbot's inconsistency this summer led the Rays to the conclusion he wasn't quite ready. He'll still get some high-visibility innings this spring and will get the opportunity to compete for a rotation berth. However, Talbot likely will be back at Triple-A on Opening Day, and more consistency there could lead to a midseason callup., 35018=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Basic Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Split Stats, 41799=9/21/2011}",
