In addition to Docomomo US chapters and partner organizations, we were thrilled to have eight new organizations participating in the event including: Historic New England, The Harry Ransom Center: University of Texas at Austin, Mid Century Modern RI, Schweikher House Preservation Trust, 2020 Omaha, First Presbyterian Church of Stamford, and the prospective Docomomo US chapter in Hawaii. A special thanks to all our partners for making this year a great success., 19386=Published by info on Sun, 2012-11-11 16:37, 19800=With its groovy cylindrical form, its pastel-paneled fa\u00e7ade, its 12th-floor restaurant and cocktail lounge, and its heated roof garden with swimming pool and retractable glass roof, this Owensboro, Ky., hotel \u2014 designed by local architect R. Ben Johnson (1921-2009) for restaurateur and local legend Gabe Fiorella, Sr. (1900-1977)\u00a0 \u2014 was the hippest place in town in the 1960s and \u201870s., 25921=Published by info on Mon, 2012-11-05 15:21, 11348=Published by info on Sun, 2012-11-11 19:12, 15716=Published by info on Sun, 2012-11-11 17:33, 19675=It opened in November 1963 as Gabe's Motor Inn --- but everybody who knows this building calls it Gabe's Tower., 16042=Last month, Michael Kimmelman, the current architectural critic for the New York Times, wrote an article regarding Chicago\u2019s landmark battle over Bertrand Goldberg\u2019s Prentice Women\u2019s Hospital entitled, \u201cA Vision to Avoid Demolition for a 70\u2019s Pioneer.\u201d The vision was Kimmelman\u2019s own invention, preservation with a twist. Northwestern University wants to demolish Goldberg\u2019s Prentice in order to build a new structure designed to accommodate scientific researchers. Kimmelman\u2019s response: \u201cSo here is a suggestion: Build a research tower on top of Prentice.\u201d (NYT, Oct 15, 2012) He solicited architect Jeanne Gang to draw a mockup of what such a structure might look like, the results being a 31-story tower precariously perching over Goldberg\u2019s cloverleaf cantilevered core. Ironically the solution is one very much in vogue in the 1970s a a preservation option for important low-rise structures as evidenced by the hotel behind New York's Villard Houses.}",

Buckminster Fuller Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth, 1969 \u00a9 The Estate of R. Buckminster Fuller. All rights reserved. \u00a0 Many do not know that Southern Illinois University, Carbondale (SIUC) was a hotbed of modernism in the 1960\u2019s. Academics, artists, writers, poets, doers and thinkers found shelter and conversation in the complex landscape of southern Illinois where the hills and forest mediate the confluence of the farming plains and the Mississippi delta. The area is defined by its railroads and river boats, the New Madrid fault and where coal, timber, salt and the river trade developing our country long before the city of Chicago emerged.
