It is intended to cover all of these variations and modifications which fall within the scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims: It will now be appreciated that the present invention relates to a pouch or the like which has a mounting member affixed to its wall which is formed of material which will protect the pouch wall from tearing or wrinkling and at the same time be more compatible with an adhesive to facilitate use of a removable filter assembly. In a first embodiment, the mounting member is annular, having a vent formed when the pouch is fabricated. In a second preferred embodiment, the pouch is provided with a circular mounting member with no vent therein and a punch which is adapted to be utilized to provide a vent through the mounting member and pouch wall. The pouch of the present invention may be utilized with a filter assembly of conventional structure coated with known adhesives. After the punch has formed the vent in the pouch wall and the circular mounting member, the pouch will appear substantially as shown in FIGS. 1 through 5. It may then be utilized with a filter assembly 26 or cover member 28 precisely as described above. As",
