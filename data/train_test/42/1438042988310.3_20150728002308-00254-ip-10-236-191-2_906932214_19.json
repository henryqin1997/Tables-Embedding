            "I always see campus security staff in the parking lot and around campus which makes me feel safe, especially at night.",
            "Catch 22 across the street is a bar/restaurant. There are also many on campus events such as concerts put on by the PVCC band and plays by the theater department, as well as a few film festivals throughout the year.",
            "The staff is pretty friendly in the cafe and the food is standard cafeteria style. Not great, but not bad either with several options available.",
            "No dorms at Pvcc.",
            "It all depends on the professors. I have had some classes (especially Chem & Bio courses) that have been higher level of difficulty. Most of the humanities type courses are fun and easier on your brain!",
            "See a counselor to insure you stay on track with your degree progress. Look into the many transfer programs available through state universities known as the Mapp program.",
            "The campus is clean and neat. There are great professors and guidance counselors available to help you throughout your college studies. There are many opportunities to transfer to a major University through your coursework at PVCC."

I would just keep up to date with deadlines on the schools website and by calling the school to make sure of deadline dates in case there had been changes.
