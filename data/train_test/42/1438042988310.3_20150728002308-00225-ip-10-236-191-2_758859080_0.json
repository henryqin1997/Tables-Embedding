Graham had always admired the house and was excited to learn in 2003 it was to be sold at an auction., 27156=Childhood memories mean a lot to David and Tammy Funderburk. That concept is what the Funderburks focused on when landscaping their yard at 610 W. Shiloh Unity Road. They are hoping that vision goes a long way in helping their children, Holly, 28, and Rod, 21, and grandchildren, Gunnar, Drake and Alyson, build some special memories, too.\u00a0 \u00a0 They had no idea their efforts would get them recognized in the local community. The Lancaster Council of Garden Clubs selected the Funderburks\u2019 yard as\u00a0 Yard of the Month for October., 25758=When Grace and Clyde Steele moved into their home at 1206 Trailstream Drive nine years ago, the 3-acre lot was filled with trees, leaving little space for sunshine to touch the ground. \u00a0That\u2019s the way her daughter, Cindy McDonald, liked it. Cindy previously lived in this home with her husband, Jimmy, and their children. After her family moved to Myrtle Beach, the house stood empty for about six years. \u00a0, 45382=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 28712=There aren\u2019t many people around whose lives haven\u2019t been touched in one way or another by cancer. It is no respecter of person, race, creed or income. Take Cathy Hendrick for instance. She could be the \u201cJob\u201d of our generation. Her life was changed forever on Oct., 20067=Nine years ago, when Ronnie and Crystal Carnes bought their home at 1228 Kent Drive, the contractor made them an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse.\u00a0The price of the new home was reduced if they agreed to do all the landscaping themselves. \u00a0}",
