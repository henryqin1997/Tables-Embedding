            "IPv6 multicast allows a host to send a single data stream to a subset of all hosts simultaneously.",
            "MLD is used by IPv6 routers to discover multicast listeners (nodes that want to receive multicast packets destined for specific multicast addresses) on directly attached links. There are two versions of MLD: MLD version 1 is based on version 2 of the IGMP for IPv4, and MLD version 2 is based on version 3 of the IGMP for IPv4. IPv6 multicast for Cisco IOS software uses both MLD version 2 and MLD version 1.",
            "PIM-SM uses unicast routing to provide reverse-path information for multicast tree building. PIM-SM is used in a multicast network when relatively few routers are involved in each multicast and these routers do not forward multicast packets for a group, unless there is an explicit request for the traffic.",
            "PIM-SSM supports the implementation of SSM and is derived from PIM-SM. The SSM feature forwards datagram traffic to receivers from only those multicast sources that the receivers have explicitly joined, optimizing bandwidth utilization and denying unwanted Internet broadcast traffic.",
            "IPv6 includes support for global and nonglobal addresses. This section describes the usage of IPv6 addresses of different scopes.",
            "The MLD access group provides receiver access control in Cisco IOS IPv6 multicast routers.",
            "The PIM accept register feature is the ability to perform PIM-SM register message filtering at the RP.",
            "Embedded RP support allows the router to learn RP information using the multicast group destination address instead of the statically configured RP.",
            "The RPF flooding of BSR packets enables a Cisco IOS IPv6 router to not disrupt the flow of BSMs.",
            "The routable address hello option adds a PIM hello message option that includes all the addresses on the interface on which the PIM hello message is advertised.",
            "IPv6 static mroutes share the same database as IPv6 static routes and are implemented by extending static route support.",
            "This feature provides multicast BGP extensions for IPv6 and supports the same features and functionality as IPv4 BGP.",
            "This feature allows a router to track the behavior of the hosts within its IPv6 network.",
            "Bidirectional PIM allows multicast routers to keep reduced state information. Bidirectional shared trees convey data from sources to the RP and distribute them from the RP to the receivers.",
            "The MRIB is a protocol-independent repository of multicast routing entries instantiated by multicast routing protocols (routing clients).",
            "The MFIB is a platform-independent and routing-protocol-independent library for IPv6 software.",
            "If an RP becomes unreachable, this feature allows the RP to be detected and the mapping tables modified so that the unreachable RP is no longer used, and the new tables will be rapidly distributed throughout the domain.",
            "Bidirectional BSR support allows bidirectional RPs to be advertised in C-RP messages and bidirectional ranges in the BSM.",
            "",
            "This feature allows deployment of IPv6 SSM with hosts that are incapable of providing MLD version 2 support in their TCP/IP host stack and their IP multicast receiving application.",
            "This feature allows IPv6 multicast routers to be statically configured to announce scope-to-RP mappings directly from the BSR instead of learning them from candidate-RP messages.",
            "The MLD group limits feature provides protection against denial of service (DoS) attacks caused by MLD packets.",
            "Multicast access control provides an interface between multicast and AAA for provisioning, authorizing, and accounting at the last-hop router, receiver access control functions in multicast, and group or channel disabling capability in multicast.",
            "In IPv6 multicast process switching, the Route Processor must examine, rewrite, and forward each packet. IPv6 multicast fast switching allows routers to provide better packet forwarding performance than process switching.",
            "Distributed MFIB dMFIB is used to switch multicast IPv6 packets on distributed platforms.",
            "This feature allows the router to keep from receiving multicast traffic to be received from unauthenticated groups or unauthorized channels.",
            "The bandwidth-based call admission control (CAC) for IPv6 multicast feature implements a method to monitor bandwidth per interface and multicast group avoiding oversubscription due to multicast services.",
            "This feature is supported.",
            "This feature is supported in Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE.",
            "This feature is supported in Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE.",
            "The MLD proxy feature enables a device to learn proxy group membership information, and forward multicast packets based upon that information.",
            "The IPv6 Multicast VRF Lite feature provides IPv6 multicast support for multiple virtual routing/forwarding contexts (VRFs). The scope of these VRFs is limited to the router in which the VRFs are defined."

An IPv6 multicast address is an identifier for a set of interfaces that typically belong to different nodes. A packet sent to a multicast address is delivered to all interfaces identified by the multicast address. The second octet following the prefix defines the lifetime and scope of the multicast address. A permanent multicast address has a lifetime parameter equal to 0; a temporary multicast address has a lifetime parameter equal to 1. A multicast address that has the scope of a node, link, site, or organization, or a global scope has a scope parameter of 1, 2, 5, 8, or E, respectively. For example, a multicast address with the prefix FF02::/16 is a permanent multicast address with a link scope.
