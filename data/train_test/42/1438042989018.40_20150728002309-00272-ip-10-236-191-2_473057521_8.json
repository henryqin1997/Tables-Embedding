Other anticipated enhancements include Subscriber controlled queue slot sizing, music on hold, Subscriber recorded announcements, priority queuing, MIS reports which provide the Subscriber an indication of how many calls are on hold and how long they are waiting by hour, as well as an indicator tone or visual indication which will alert the Subscriber that there are calls holding at the IP. In the event that the lines are still busy, the Caller will remain in queue, at the IP. Announcements may, of course, be placed to the Caller, indicating that the lines are still busy. The Caller will then be provided with the option to exit and leave a message, if the Subscriber has a messaging number. Additional calls that are routed to the IP on a busy condition will be placed in order behind existing calls in queue. If a Subscriber has a messaging number and the Caller presses \"1\", for example, on their touch tone phone, the Caller will be transferred directly to the Subscriber's messaging service. Once the Caller is transferred to the voice messaging system, the call is complete, and the IP will allow the Caller to remain connected until",
