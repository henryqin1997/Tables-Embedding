            "Stockton's campus is very safe. We have our own police department on campus which is patrolled all hours of the night. We have blue light buttons that are placed all over campus which will contact the police to your location if you feel that you need them. I have never felt not safe or in any danger as a girl at Stockton.",
            "There is a club for everyone at Stockton. If there is something your interested in and we don't have it, it is so easy to found one yourself .",
            "Stockton is great for anybody who loves the outdoors. We are surrounded by pinelands and have a huge lake on campus where people like to fish and walk through our nature paths. Stockton is also very close to Ocean City and Atlantic City so if you love the beach Stockton is great for you!",
            "There are many different options on campus for dining. On the academic side of campus there is N-Wing, which is buffet style. Also you have the campus center which is set up to be like a food court. There are many options such as Primo's Pizza, Johnny Rocket's, Chic-fil-a , and a few more healthier options as well where you can get salads and sandwiches for a good price. In the campus center as well there is Dina's Deli which is like a little convenience store. On the other side of campus there is Lakeside Lodge. In there, you have a sub place and Papa Johns. Also another larger convenience store.",
            "The dorm life at Stockton is like a home away from home. All of the freshman are close together in the quad so everyone can get to know each other. There are a lot of activities set up on weekends and during welcome week that let have a chance to relax, hang out, and get to know each other before classes start. The dorms itself are nice and are in walking distance of everything.",
            "Stockton has a lot of great programs to choose from. The staff is always there to help and they really want you to succeed as a student. Classes are challenging and make you think so you can perform to the best of your ability in the classroom.",
            "Stockton was voted one of the best school on the East Coast by the Princeton Review. One of the best decisions I have made so far to come here. It has a great atmosphere, outstanding staff and phenomenal academic standards."

It will help you explore many areas of study and you'll have a great time doing so.

    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students Stockton College is a GREAT science school. It is also a good business school. I would also recommend Stockton for anyone who doesn't want to enter a huge college. Stockton is on the small side, and is very comfortable. It has changed my life, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Tips for prospective students I would definitely recommend on going to the SOAR program the weekend before school starts. I met three of my best friends during that program. I would also recommend going to all the activities they have during the first week of school. It really helps you feel more comfortable in your new surroundings. Take classes you think you will enjoy, but also take classes you've never really heard of. College is all about experiencing new things, and Stockton definitely gives every student that opportunity. Bang for the buck Although Stockton is a state school, it is still extremely expensive. But, on the bright side, it offers many amazing scholarships that aren't too hard to achieve. Am enjoying being here Stockton College gives freshman numerous opportunities through different freshman activities to meet one another. I made many friends within my first few days",
