Participating institution department heads nominate graduate students from their institution by an e-mail to visit@ima.umn.edu with the students' names and e-mail addresses. Those students may then register by filling out the registration form. Places are guaranteed for two graduate students from each participating institution, with additional students accommodated as space allows.}",
