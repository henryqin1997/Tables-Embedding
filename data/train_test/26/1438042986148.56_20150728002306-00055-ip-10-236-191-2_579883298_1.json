Wow, big surprise. The Dutch star, to the dismay of many United fans, left in the summer of 2006 after warming the bench for the biggest chunk of the second part of that season. Since then, he's been through a mini-revival at Real Madrid, very much like what Diego Forlan had enjoyed at Villarreal. United won the league and look stronger than ever so I don't know why they always go back to the issue of Ruud but there you, I'm also writing about it. 'It was not only me leaving, it was the club wanting me to leave,' Ruud told CNN. 'They wanted me to leave because it wasn't working out between me and the manager. We couldn't change that, and myself and the club chose to move on without each other.' Well, we knew that, didn't we? It was quite obvious that Fergie wanted rid of him, as earlier in the case of Paul McGrath, Norman Whiteside, Gordon Strachan, Paul Ince, Jaap Stam, David Beckham... you know what I mean. He and Diego proved two things: an ex-United player can still enjoy some success elsewhere, it's not inevitable that his career would get on a downwards spiral (OK, McGrath is also in this category) and that it's easier to score in Spain than in the Premiership., 13530=Ibrahimovic Staying in Paris (Monday July 27 2015), 13942=Rojos - How Was It Allowed to Happen?
