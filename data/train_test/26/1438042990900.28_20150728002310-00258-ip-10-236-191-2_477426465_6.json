Therefore, unless otherwise such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present invention, they should be construed as being included therein. (8) Although three different kinds of games can be selectively played in the foregoing embodiment, the invention is applicable to a variety of bingo games provided that a specific bingo card is used. (7) Instead of the method for storing the collected balls in 10 circumferentially arranged storing portions, the balls may be stored in one or two lines in a cylindrical container and supplied one by one from the bottom (or top) of the container, or from one of the lines by being pushed by a push-bar, etc. (6) The shooting operation may be performed not by the rotatable hitting arm, but by a reciprocating movement of, e.g. a plunger of a solenoid. Specifically, the ball may be pushed by the leading end of the plunger. This simplifies the construction of the shooting device. (5) Although the first 5 balls and the remaining 5 balls are shot by the different shooting devices 7 in the foregoing embodiment, they may be shot to the left and to the right by a single shooting device so that",
