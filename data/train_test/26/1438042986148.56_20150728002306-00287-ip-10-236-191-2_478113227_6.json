While the present invention has been disclosed above in terms of the preferred embodiment of the invention, the invention should not be appreciated as being limited to the shown embodiment, but includes all possible embodiments and modifications of the embodiment which do not depart from the principle of the invention set out in the appended claims. After this, video image data are scanned, stored, retrieved and reproduced in the same manner as explained with respect to forward tape drive. The only difference is the order of update of the memory selection code, which is the reverse of that in forward tape drive. After completion of the scan of the record area E12, the third switching pulse CH1 or CH2 is produced. The memory selection switching circuit 52 decrements the memory selection code to \"111\" in response to the third switching pulse CH1 or CH2. As a result, the first field memory 13 is designated for storage of image data from the record area O12. At the same time, the second field area, now holding image data from the record area E12, is designated for retrieval. Therefore, the video image reproduced on the video monitor remains unchanged. At this time, however, since the second switching pulse CH1 or CH2 does not change the memory selection code, the image",
