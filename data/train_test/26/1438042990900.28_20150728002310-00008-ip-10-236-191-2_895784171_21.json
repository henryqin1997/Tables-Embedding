            "The school is located in a small rural area, and the campus is small also. The Public Safety patrol is always nearby, and the campus is a very safe and secure place to live.",
            "Greek Life is does not play any extremely big role in campus life, but there are still a great number of sororities and fraternities for students to choose from if they have an interest in pledging.",
            "There are many club and activities for students to join. Whether it be music and art-oriented, sports, cultural diversity, student government, or volunteering. There is something for everyone to get involved with.",
            "This school is a great fit for any student looking for a small campus and many opportunities for success, while still getting individual attention in small classroom settings that is not available at larger schools.",
            "Chicken tender Thursday is a very anticipated lunch special every week. The campus also has Dutchmen Day (a surprise fun day off from classes with inflatables and other activities for students), along with Valleyfest, which is an area wide music and art festival held on campus in the spring.",
            "This school is amazing and well worth the money, but the fact it is so much money makes it almost impossible for a student to pay for it on their own, so anyone with a less than fortunate financial situation at home would most likely not be able to attend.",
            "There's a mall with a movie theater about ten minutes away, along with outlets for shopping an bowling (another very short drive), lots of places to eat, a nature park and a cafe with open mic nights on Mondays, along with regularly scheduled on campus activities.",
            "Not always the best selection, especially for picky eaters, but the food isn't bad, and chicken tender Thursday for lunch every week is really good.",
            "Dorm life is comfortable and students on campus are a dynamic group of people that one would love to meet.",
            "Courses can be very challenging, but are rewarding and enjoyable at the same time. Professors are always willing to help and are very easy to get in contact with.",
            "This school is an absolutely wonderful choice, in regards to campus life and academics. The only problem I have come across is the cost to go there. Financial aid doesn't cover near enough and paying for school is extremely difficult, expect many loans.",
            "This school boasts a small and friendly campus, along with being in a safe area. The faculty and staff are extremely helpful and kind. The student population is a great mix of people, and campus life is very enjoyable."

It's also nice for people who like to sleep a lot, since, unlike large campuses, LVC is about a 3 minute walk to any class. So in case you like to sleep in until 7:55 on a morning when you have an 8:00 class, you can still make it! Also, LVC has a variety of great food choices, so if you like to eat, this is the school for you!}",

Definitely visit each campus twice (with the schools you are definitely interested in) - once with a bigger tour and a second time with a one-on-one session with a student. I did both of these things when I narrowed my choice down and that is ultimately what allowed me to make my decision because I knew LVC felt like the right place for me. Lastly, keep your head up. Looking at colleges is a time consuming, extensive process, but if you put the time into it in high school, you most definitely won't regret it once you've chosen the right school for you! Bang for the buck LVC is relatively expensive compared to state schools, however, when looking at other private institutions, LVC ranks high on the list. LVC gives out a lot of money through scholarships and then",
