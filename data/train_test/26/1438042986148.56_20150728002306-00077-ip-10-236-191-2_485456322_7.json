One possible set of dimensions includes a region dimension, year dimension, and product dimension., 104951=As shown in Table A, the groups of the horizontal axis 330 are obtained by identifying records in the master table 202 that include the following: 1) either a 1995 or 1996 year dimension value, 2) either a VCR, TV, or stereo product dimension value, and 3) a Sales($) measure value. For example, a processing (step 264) of the records identified in the 1995 dimension index record 3201 and VCR dimension index record 3205 shows that master table records Q1:1 and Q1:3 each contain a 1995 dimension value and a VCR dimension value. These records are then designated (step 266) as group 1H, because each record produced by Query 1, as shown in query map record 311 (FIG. 7b), contains a measure value associated with the Sales($) measure., 163148=For each cell 3721-8, the identified records are retrieved from the master table 202 and used to determine a measure result (step 274). Since a summing operation is called for in determining the measure result, the retrieved measure values from each identified record in a cell are summed together. The sum is then loaded into the cell (step 275). For example, a dollar sales measure result of $30,000 is placed in cell 372, as a result of summing the sales dollar measure values in record sets 1 and 5 from Query 3 (Q3:1 and Q3:5) in the master table 202., 159758=For the vertical axis 371, each group of records (1V-4V) includes records that appear in one of the fiscal period dimension index records 32011-14 and include a measure value for the dollar sales measure. Table N shows the identification of each group (1V-4V) for the vertical axis 371., 89664=In addition to identifying a dimension value, each dimension index record 3201-7 identifies the master table records which contain the identified dimension value. Each dimension index record 3201-7 also identifies the query (Q1) that produced the identified records and the dimension that is associated with the dimension value. For example, the dimension index record 3201 for the 1995 dimension value identifies the associated year dimension (Year) and records 1-4 in Query 1 (Q1:1-4), which each contain the 1995 dimension value., 40033=The multi-dimensional record structure 90 in FIG. 1(a) may also be represented in the format of the multi-dimensional record structure 100 shown in FIG. 1(b). Structure 100 provides a two dimensional set of cells 1011-12 containing sales measure values. Each axis of a cell in structure 100 is characterized by a set of dimension values. The horizontal axis 104 of the structure 100 is divided into a set of sections. Each of these sections corresponds to a unique pair of a year dimension value and a product dimension value. The vertical axis 103 of the structure 100 is also divided into a set of sections. Each of these sections corresponds to a unique region dimension value. The upper left hand cell 101, in the structure 100 contains a measure value indicating the sales of VCR's in the East region of the United States in 1995., 90249=In updating the master table index 204 (step 225 (FIG. 6(a)) shown in FIG. 7(c), the record management system 200 performs the sequence of operations shown in FIG. 6(b). For example the index engine 211 selects (240) record one (301, (FIG. 7(a)) from Query 1 in the master table 202. The index engine 211 then selects (241) the 1995 year dimension value in record one 3011. The index engine determines (243) that no dimension index record exists for 1995 in the master table index 204 and creates (245) a dimension index record (320, (FIG. 7(c)) for the 1995 dimension value. As shown in FIG. 7(c), the newly created record 3201 identifies the 1995 dimension value, the Year dimension and record one in Query 1 (Q1:1)., 117432=For each cell 3321-10, the measure value in the identified record for the cell is retrieved from the master table 202 and listed in the cell. For example, in formulating a measure result (step 274) for the first cell 3321, the layout engine 212 identifies (step 273) the set of records listed in both the 1995, VCR group (1H) and the East group (1V). This identification is achieved by taking an intersection of the records in group 1H (Q1:1,3) and the records in group 1V (Q1:1-2,5-7). The identified set of records includes only record 1 from Query 1 (Q1:1). In order to determine the measure result (step 274) for cell 3321, the layout engine 212 retrieves the measure value in record 1 of Query 1 (Q1:1) from the master table 202. The retrieved measure value of $50,000, which also serves as the listed measure result in this example, is then loaded (step 275) into cell 3321., 143266=The updated master table index 204 shown in FIG. 15(c) includes the dimension index records 3201-10 shown in FIG. 10(c) along with new dimension index records 32011-14 for the fiscal period dimension records. Dimension index records 32011-14 are generated for the following fiscal period dimension values: 1) first period (\"P1\"); 2) second period (\"P2\"); 3) third period (\"P3\"); and 4) fourth period (\"P4\"). Each dimension index record 3201-14 identifies the dimension associated with an identified dimension value and the records in the master table 202 that include the identified dimension value., 46072=Forming such a structure is wasteful, if a dimension value associated with one dimension being represented on an axis does not coexist with another dimension value associated with another dimension being represented on the same axis. For example, in FIG. 1(a), stereo cell entries are provided for both 1995 and 1996 in both the East and West regions. If stereos were not an available product in 1995, then the record structure 90 contains two wasted memory locations (cells 913, 916). This is because the 1995 dimension value and stereo dimension value would not coexist in any record to characterize a sales measure value., 160605=As shown in Table N, the vertical axis 371 includes four groups of records (1V-4V). Each group has been identified by taking the records listed in a dimension index record for one of the fiscal period dimension records 32011-14 and determining which records, if any, include a dollar sales measure value. This determination is performed in the same manner as described for Table M., 147029=Records in each group are those which are identified in each of the dimension index records being processed and include either a Sales($) measure value or Sales(U) measure value. For example, group 1H is identified from taking the intersection of the records listed in each of the 1995 and Pi dimension index records, and then determining which of the resulting intersection records includes either a Sales($) measure value or a Sales(U) measure value. As a result of these operations, records Q3:1 and Q3:5 are identified as the group records that are in horizontal axis group 1H., 134406=The master table 202, query map 203, and master table index 204 are all in the same state as described above in FIGS. 10(a), 10(b), and 10(c), respectively. The record management system has determined that a new view is to be generated (step 226, FIG. 6(a)). The record management system 200 has gathered formatting information about the view (step 227) indicating that it is to have a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The horizontal axis is to include the 1995 year dimension value and the product dimension. The vertical axis is to include the region dimension. The dollar sales measure is to be represented in the cells by the listing of measure values., 38651=FIG. 1(a) illustrates a traditional multi-dimensional record structure 90 characterizing the company's sales with respect to the region, year, and product dimensions. The record structure 90 is formed so that cells 911-12 in the structure 90 are filled with sales measure values, which are retrieved from a database or other source of records such as a data file. The x-axis 92 of the structure 90 is sectioned into regions that correspond to a set of product dimension values, namely, video cassette recorder (\"VCR\"), television (\"TV\"), and stereo. The y-axis 93 of the structure 90 is sectioned into regions that correspond to a set of region dimension values, namely East and West. The z-axis 94 of the structure 90 is sectioned into regions that correspond to a set of year dimension values, namely, 1995 and 1996., 82569=1995 and 1996 are dimension values associated with the year dimension. Video cassette recorder (\"VCR\"), television (\"TV\"), and stereo are dimension values associated with the product dimension, and East and West are dimension values associated with the region dimension. The dollar amount in each record 3011-10 is a measure value associated with the Sales($) measure., 82988=As shown in the records 3011-10 from Query 1, the database 214 contained dollar sales measure values for the years 1995 and 1996 in the East and West regions of the United States. Dollar sales measure values are available for video cassette recorders and televisions in each region in both 1995 and 1996, but dollar sales measure values are available for stereos only in 1996 in both the East region and West region. No dollar sales measure values for stereos exist for 1995., 105729=The same processing (step 264) is made for each combination of a year dimension value and a product dimension value. A group designation (step 266) operation is then performed on records identified in each processing to determine which records, if any, will be designated in a group. Since no common records are listed in the 1995 dimension index record 3201 and stereo dimension index record 3207, no group is designated for the combination of the 1995 and stereo dimension values. Each processing in Table A is performed by making a comparison in which an intersection (\"\u2229\") is taken of the records listed in each of the dimension index records being processed., 124422=As seen in FIG. 10(c), the updated master table index 204 includes new dimension index records for the following sales office dimension values: 1) New York 3208 ; 2) Boston 3209 ; and 3) Philadelphia 32010. FIG. 10(c) also shows that each dimension index record 3201-10 identifies all master table 202 records from both Query 1 and Query 2 that include a corresponding dimension value. Additionally, each dimension index record 3201-10 identifies a dimension that is associated with a dimension value in the index record., 127594=As shown in Table D, an intersection is taken of the records listed in a year dimension index record in FIG. 10(c) and the records listed in a product dimension index record in FIG. 10(c). For each record in the resulting intersection, the query that produced the record is evaluated to determine if the record contains a Sales($) measure value. By referring to query map records 311 and 312 (FIG. 10(b)) it is seen that each record that was produced by either Query 1 or Query 2 contains a Sales($) measure value. The intersection and query evaluation are performed for each combination of a year dimension value and a product dimension value. For example, group 1H is identified to include records 1 and 3 from Query 1 (Q1:1, 3) and records 1 and 2 from Query 2 (Q2:1,2). Each of these records is listed in both the dimension index record for 1995 3201 (FIG. 10(c)) and the dimension index record for VCR 3205 (FIG. 10(c)), and includes a measure value associated with the Sales($) measure., 162856=For the dollar sales measure in the first cell 3721, the intersection is taken of the records identified in the 1995 group (1H) and the P1 group (1V). The resulting set of records consists of records 1 and 5 from Query 3 (Q3:1 and Q3:5) in the master table 202., 108024=For instance, a traditional record structure would have contained a set of cell memory locations for the sales of stereos in 1995 in both the East and West region. This designation of cells would be made regardless of the fact that the 1995 and stereo dimension values do not coexist in any record. In accordance with the present invention, no group is designated on the horizontal axis for the combination of the 1995 and stereo dimension values (see Table A). Accordingly, a layout mapping generated by record management system 200 will not wastefully designate cells for the 1995 sales of stereos in either the East or West., 118365=In addition to loading measure results into each of the cells 3321-10 shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, a horizontal axis 333 display and vertical axis 334 display are prepared. The horizontal axis 333 display includes segments for each of the following groups: 1) 1995, VCR (1H); 2) 1995, TV (2H); 3) 1996, VCR (3H); 4) 1996, TV (4H); and 5) 1996, Stereo (5H). The vertical axis 334 display includes segments for each of the following groups: 1) East (1V); and 2) West (2V)., 39520=Each sales measure value residing in a cell 911-12 is characterized by the combination of a product dimension value, a region dimension value, and a year dimension value. The measure value in the front upper left hand cell 911 is characterized by the VCR product dimension value, East region dimension value, and 1995 year dimension value. Accordingly, the measure value in cell 911 indicates the sales of VCR's in the East region of the United States in 1995., 46716=The East and West cell entries for stereo sales in 1995 (cells 913, 916) could therefore be eliminated, but there is no mechanism in a traditional record management system 110 to provide for such an elimination of cells. Although wasted memory due to the inclusion of two extraneous cells may not appear significant, the amount of wasted memory locations in the record structure can quickly multiply as the number of dimensions and dimension values increases., 155338=For the dollar sales measure in the first cell 3621, the intersection is taken of the records identified in the 1995, P1 group (1H) and the East group (1V). The resulting record is Q3:1 The query map record 313 for Query 3 indicates that Query 3 called for the Sales($) measure. Accordingly, Q3:1 may be employed to determine a measure result for the cell in cell set 362, that corresponds to the Sales ($) measure. As shown in Table L, the Sales(U) measure cell in the first cell set 362, also has record Q3:1 identified for determining a measure result.}",
