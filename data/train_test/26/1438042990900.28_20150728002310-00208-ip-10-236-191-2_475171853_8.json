    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32307=Systems consistent with the present invention address shortcomings of the prior art and provide a dynamic distributed computing system used over a network of server computers. This dynamic distributed computing system is particularly useful in heterogenous computer networks having computers with different processors, different operating systems, and combinations thereof. Such a system allows a client application to select a server computer at runtime to execute a particular task. In method and systems consistent with the present invention, the task is an object having a particular type or class definition. The server can generally defer knowing the actual class definition until the parameters and data associated with the object task are received on the server. Consequently, the particular type is downloaded by the server if it is not available on the server. For example, if an object instance of an unknown class is transmitted to the server, the server downloads the unknown class. The server then uses this class to process the object. This late association of a class definition to an object increases the flexibility in processing complex tasks over a network of server computers. Further, the present design facilitates this flexibility with minimal additional overhead by utilizing features in existing remote procedure call subsystems such as the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) subsystem developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. of Mountain View, Calif. For more information on Remote Method Invocation (RMI) see co-pending U.S. Patent Application, \u201cSystem and Method For Facilitating Loading of \u201cStub\u201d Information to Enable a Program Operating in One Address Space to Invoke Processing of a Remote Method or Procedure in Another Address Space\u201d having Ser. No. 08/636,706, filed Apr. 23, 1996 by Ann M. Wollrath, James Waldo, and Roger Riggs, assigned to a common assignee and hereby incorporated by reference. Also, RMI is also described in further detail in the RMI specification on the JavaSoft WebPage at FTP://ftpjavasoft.com/docs/jdk1.2/rmi-spec-jdk1.2.ps, which is also hereby incorporated by reference.}",
