            "While I have had some teachers not expect much from you at all and others that keep you challenged but not over worked I have also had teachers that treat you like you are premed and should know everything. I don't find it fair for those teachers to make you feel like a leper for asking a question. But over all I've had a nice experience with my teachers.",
            "The first month of fall and spring you will not find parking but you should try under the bridge behind taco bell. It has a little bit more of a walk but you are more likely to find parking there than anywhere else. There are always lines for the elevators in the hartford building. Be at least 5 minutes ahead of schedule if you need to use them. The VTI building has food in the basement :)",
            "I really like this school because it isn't expensive, large, or over crowded.... Most the time. I do wish it was cleaner and had better security at night. I appreciate how they continue to try and fix problems for us... If only they could make the financial aid office more helpful."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Jefferson Community and Technical College has a wide range of students and is great for anyone. Different personalities and interests will not effect the relationships that you develop on campus, nor the things that you learn. Tips for prospective students Do not be afraid to speak to those around you. Jefferson is not similar to other schools in that you do not have all of these traditional students around judging you for the person that you are. Friends can be found in a variety of walks of life if only you open up a little. Also, do not be afraid to talk to your professors about problems that you are having. Most of them have taught at other schools and are at Jefferson for the friendly, community feel. They really are there to help you, not just as the cliche used for every school declares. Bang for the buck The cost is $125 per credit hour, and there is no housing so there is no cost for that as well as food. You can take as many credit hours as you desire, so you yourself can determine how much you pay. There is also great financial aid available that makes it even easier to go to school here. Am enjoying being here",
