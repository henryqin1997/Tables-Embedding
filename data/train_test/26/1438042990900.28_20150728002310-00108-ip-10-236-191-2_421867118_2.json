The 1983 sample included all buildings that had been selected for the 1979 CBECS, as well as a sample of new buildings constructed since the 1979 CBECS. File 4 includes the 1979 values for buildings that participated in both the 1979 and 1983 CBECS.

These 15 smaller files make it easier to manipulate the data. Several variables are frequently used in the analysis of commercial energy data. These core variables are included in each group of variables: BLDGID4: building identifier, which is the link between files; ADJWT4: adjusted sampling weight; STRATUM4 and PAIR4: variance stratum and pair member which can be used for calculating variances; REGION4 and CENDIV4: Census region and division; SQFT4 and SQFTC4: square footage, both exact and category; PBA4: principal building activity; YRCONC4: year constructed category; and ELSUPL4, NGSUPL4, FKSUPL4, STSUPL4, HWSUPL4: a set of variables indicating whether electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, district steam or district hot water were used in the building. For each group of variables, there are two items: a layout file and a data file. The layout file is a text file which gives, for each variable on a file: the variable name, a description, the position on the file, and the corresponding format. The data file is a comma separated value file. To determine what the different values for each variable represent, use the text file provided of all the format codes (alternatively, there is also a PDF document containing all the layout files and format codes).
