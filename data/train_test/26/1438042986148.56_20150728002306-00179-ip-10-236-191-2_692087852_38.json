Others must be legal residents of the area that they would like to represent. For each state or province that has at least one active rated player, up to 10 top players are listed by current rating. Active players are those who have played in at least one fully-rated tournament in the past twelve ratings months. States and provinces are listed according to the average rating of their top ten players. Areas with fewer than ten active players listed are assumed to have additional players rated 500 for the purposes of computing their average.
