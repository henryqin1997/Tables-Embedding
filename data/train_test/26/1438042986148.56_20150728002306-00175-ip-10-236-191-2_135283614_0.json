That may not seem like a lot, but that\u2019s a 348% rise from last weekend and a per-theater total of $55,152. The film is already looking to replicate the sleeper success of director Wes Anderson\u2019s \u2018Moonrise Kingdom,\u2019 which quietly became a massive hit back in 2012.}",

    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Why would \u2018Need For Speed\u2019 open in third place with a mediocre $17 million when other car-related films open so much bigger? It could be because audiences already have their fill of car crash mayhem from other movies. It could be because Aaron Paul, despite being so good on \u2018Breaking Bad,\u2019 just isn\u2019t a movie star. If there\u2019s a silver lining here, it\u2019s that \u2018Need For Speed\u2019 wasn\u2019t as expensive as some of its blockbuster counterparts and it may have a shot at scraping itself into the black at the end of the day. The big victor of the week is actually a bit of a surprise. Despite opening in second place last week, \u2018Mr. Peabody and Sherman\u2018 jumped to the number one spot this weekend, dropping only 34% for $21 million (and a $63 million weekend). \u2018300: Rise of an Empire\u2018 suffered a larger drop, but with a $19 million weekend and $78 million total, there\u2019s nothing to scoff at here. In fourth place, \u2018Non-Stop\u2018 kept on trucking, grossing $10 million for a $68 million total. Not \u2018Taken\u2019 good, but pretty good for a mid-budget action movie released in the first quarter of the year. In fifth place, \u2018The Single Moms Club\u2018 bombed with $8 million, making it the rare Tyler Perry joint to not even leave a dent at the box office. In sixth place, \u2018The LEGO Movie\u2018 grossed another $7 million,",
