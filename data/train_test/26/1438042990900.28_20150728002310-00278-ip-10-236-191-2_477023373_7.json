That is, the membrane should have high structural strength, toughness, abrasion and chemical resistance to remain functional under extremes of temperature and differential pressure. In this regard such membranes are often required to operate in pressure differentials across the membrane of at least 2100 or 3500 KPa or higher, for instance up to 13,800 KPa or even higher. In general, operation environments require membrane material which is resistant to hydrocarbons, ammonia, water, and acid gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide and the like. Such chemicals may have a tendency to dissolve or plasticize the material of the gas separation membranes resulting in deterioration of the membrane or densification of an otherwise asymmetric structure., 40383=In practice, the separation factor with respect to a given pair of gases for a given membrane can be determined employing numerous techniques which provide sufficient information for calculation of permeability constants or permeabilities for each of the pair of gases. Several of the many techniques available for determining permeability constants, permeabilities, and separation factors are disclosed by Hwang et al, Techniques of Chemistry, Vomume VII, Membranes in Separations, John Wiley & Sons, 1975 (herein incorporated by reference) at Chapter 12, pages 296 to 322.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The foregoing description of the several embodiments of this invention as described above is not intended as limiting of this invention. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the inventive concepts set forth herein can find many applications in the art of membrane gas separations and many variations on and modifications to the embodiments described herein may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. The hydrohaloacid treatment of asymmetric gas separation hollow fiber membranes is a very simple and productive way of significantly improving the selectivity of uncoated fibers. The uncoated asymmetric polysulfone, brominated PPO, and SAN hollow fibers with selectivities comparable to or higher than that of silicone coated fibers have been reproducibly produced by the methodology of the invention. The acid treated uncoated asymmetric gas separation membranes were stable under test conditions. Optimization of any particular polymer and Br nsted-Lowry acid will provide significantly improved separation factors for preformed asymmetric gas separation membranes which have exhibited selectivities for at least one gas from a mixture of gases which is in accordance with the present invention. The summary data of Table 12 demonstrates that the separation factor for hydrogen over CO for the hydrohaloacid treated polysulfone asymmetric separation membrane is approximately equal to or greater than the intrinsic separation factor for hydrogen over CO for dense polymeric polysulfone. The separation factor for hydrogen over methane in",
