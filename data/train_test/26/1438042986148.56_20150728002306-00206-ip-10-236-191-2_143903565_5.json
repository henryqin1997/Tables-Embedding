K-Mart filed for bankruptcy in 2001/2 and closed stores, then after successfully wiping out it\u2019s debts with the bankruptcy. Emerging with a big bundle of cash, it bought Sears because the K-Mart brand name was now trashed, so it used Sears as a front. The mode of operations became \u2013 use the Sears good name to unload crap. Sears was raped.
