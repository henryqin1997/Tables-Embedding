The preproprotein is processed to a short mature form which functions as a ligand for the endothelin receptors that initiate intracellular signaling events. This gene product is involved in a wide range of biological processes, such as hypertension and ovulation. Altered expression of this gene is implicated in tumorigenesis. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2014]}",
