    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor Some of the best teachers are here in Grayslake, they always have office hours on the syllabus, as well as outside their office. All professors are mandatory to have office hours, and most go beyond to try and make time for your schedule. A lot of professors take attendance to get you ready for your future university. Tips for prospective students If you know your 4-yr school make sure you go off their requirements and not so much CLC's. The problem most students have is that their credits transfer however they don't fit in to the curriculum of their proceeding college. The credits then become electives instead of going towards their degree. Another important rule of thumb is going to class and communicating with professors. Now that you're out of high school some teachers don't make attendance mandatory, however if you don't show up, you will miss out on a lot, and usually there is no make-up.
