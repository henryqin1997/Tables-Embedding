No. 08/645,355, filed May 13, 1996, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein., 65739=The remaining details of the preferred flexible neck assembly of the stapling instrument of this invention are shown in FIGS. 22 and 24-27. The flexible neck assembly is preferably composed of a rigid thermoplastic polyurethane sold commercially as ISOPLAST grade 2510 by the Dow Chemical Company. The flexible neck assembly 32 has the first and second flexible neck portions, 33 and 34. These neck portions are separated by a central longitudinal rib 94. The neck portions each have a plurality of neck ribs 95 configured essentially as semi-circular disks. Each neck rib has an interior plate 96 which is substantially perpendicular to the central longitudinal rib and parallel to an adjacent interior plate. Each neck rib also has a concave exterior dish 97 extending from its interior plate. As such, the flexible neck portions together generally form a cylindrical configuration. Separating the neck ribs are a plurality of kerfs 98. A side slot 99 extends through each of the neck ribs to provide a passage through the first and second flexible neck portions for receiving the interior articulation bands and exterior reinforcement band portions of the flexible bands. In a similar fashion, the central longitudinal rib separating the first and second flexible neck portions has a central longitudinal slot 100 for providing a passage to receive the stapler actuating members and if desired, a knife blade for cutting the tissue between the staple lines during or after firing., 52432=Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the preferred articulating stapler 20 has an articulation transmission assembly 31 coupling the frame 22 to the elongated endoscopic shaft 30 of the stapler. When the articulation transmission assembly is rotated, it causes the remote articulation of the surgical fastening assembly 27 of the stapler. The elongated endoscopic shaft contains a flexible neck assembly 32 enabling the articulation of the surgical fastening assembly 27 of the stapler. The flexible neck assembly has first and second flexible neck portions, 33 and 34, which receive first and second elongated flexible transmission band assemblies, 35 and 36. Upon rotation of the articulation transmission assembly, one of the first and second flexible transmission band assemblies is moved forwardly and the other band assembly is moved rearwardly. In response to the reciprocating movement of the band assemblies within the first and second flexible neck portions of the flexible neck assembly, the flexible neck assembly bends to provide articulation. A further description of the flexible neck in an articulating endoscopic stapler is described in parent patent application Ser. No. 08/539,107, filed Dec. 19, 1994, and in the detailed description provided below., 51641=The preferred actuation assembly within the frame of the stapler for remotely clamping tissue and firing staples into the clamped tissue in response to pivotal counterclockwise rotation of the clamping and firing triggers is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,895 and commonly assigned, co-pending application Ser. No. 08/431,105, filed Apr. 28, 1995, both of which are incorporated into this specification by reference. The preferred clamping mechanism within the surgical fastening assembly to urge the anvil from a first position spaced from the elongated channel to a second position adjacent the channel is described in commonly assigned, co-pending application Ser. No. 08/530,931, filed Sep. 19, 1995, which is also incorporated into this specification by reference., 29156=Another critical feature of certain endoscopic instruments is the ability to pivot the end effector so that the end effector is positioned at an \"articulated\" position relative to the long axis of the shaft. Consequently, endoscopic instruments often include an articulation knob or dial on or near the frame for remotely articulating the end effector for precise positioning of the end effector within the endoscopic surgical site. Numerous examples of these articulation mechanisms for endoscopic surgical instruments abound. For example, the reader is encouraged to review U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,728,020; 4,869,414; 5,312,023; 5,326,013; 5,330,502; 5,374,277; 5,381,943; 5,383,888; 5,403,342; 5,405,344; 5,409,498; 5,411,519, 5,417,203 and 5,456,684. Articulating mechanisms for pivoting the end effector are also described in co-pending U.S. Ser. No. 08/259,322, filed Jun. 10, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,224; and Ser. No. 08/442,783, filed May 18, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,587.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although this invention has been described in connection with its most preferred embodiment, numerous additional embodiments will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, although the invention has been described in connection with an articulating endoscopic stapler, the invention is equally applicable to conventional open surgical instruments. Additionally, although the invention has been described in connection with an articulation transmission assembly and flexible neck assembly which provides for remote articulation of a surgical fastening assembly, it is equally applicable to an instrument which provides remote articulation of a different kind of end effector. Accordingly, the preferred embodiment described in connection with this derailed description is intended to illustrate the invention only, and is not in any way intended to limit the scope or spirit of the claimed invention. The proximal end of the cartridge channel (illustrated in FIG. 24) has a pair of band connector ears, 104 and 105. These band connector ears are inserted into and through the connector loops, 92 and 93, respectively, on the distal end of the interior articulation bands. In this manner, the cartridge channel which houses the staple cartridge is coupled to the interior articulation bands of the flexible neck assembly. FIG. 28a and 28b illustrates how the flexible neck assembly provides for the articulation of the end effector of the stapling instrument. Specifically, the reciprocation of the first and second flexible transmission band assemblies in",
