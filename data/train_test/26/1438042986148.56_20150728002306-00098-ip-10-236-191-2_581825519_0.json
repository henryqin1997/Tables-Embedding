    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{124032=Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, and the incidence of this continues to grow, which causes a global public health burden. It is estimated that by 2025, India, China and the United States will possess the largest number of people with diabetes [1]. The more prevalent form, type 2 diabetes, accounts for more than 90% of cases. The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is complex, involving progressive development of insulin resistance and a relative deficiency in insulin secretion, which may lead to overt hyperglycemia [2]. Type 2 diabetes is associated with the metabolic syndrome that comprises a set of alterations that include glucose intolerance, truncal obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia [3]. It has been reported that the metabolic syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of coronary artery disease [4]. The risk of myocardial infarction in patients with diabetes and no history of cardiac disease roughly equates the risk in non-diabetic patients with known cardiac diseases [5]. In addition, diabetes often conspires to cause various complications such as eye diseases. It has been documented that diabetes is the primary reason for loss of vision [6]. Patients with diabetes suffer from great mental and physical pain. Consequently, it is necessary to develop an effective drug for the treatment of this disease. Since hyperglycemia leads to severe microvascular and macrovascular complications, the primary treatment goal is to reduce the glucose level. Several popular classes of oral diabetes therapies on the market include sulfonylureas, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) agonists, metformin and so forth [7,8], which lower glucose by increasing glucose metabolism either via enhanced insulin secretion or improved insulin sensitivity. However, therapies with these drugs still have several drawbacks. For example, sulfonylurea therapy is usually associated with weight gain [9] and metformin therapy is forbidden in patients with renal and hepatic diseases, respiratory insufficiency and alcohol abuse [10]. As a consequence, there is a need for novel, more effective drugs with more safe profiles and fewer side effects to the treatment of diabetes.}",
