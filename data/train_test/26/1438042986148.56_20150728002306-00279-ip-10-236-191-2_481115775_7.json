According to one embodiment, the position information may include distance from the answering remote device to a limited number of remote devices when the number of remote devices in the listening range of the local device 901 is large. Moreover, remote devices may cooperate with one another to ensure that duplicate distance information such as distance D3 and Db is not transmitted to local device 901. These features reduce the amount of data to be processed by processor 205 of the local device 901 and therefore increases the speed at which the local device 901 can display positional updates on the display 213.}",

It is to be understood that the features and benefits of the present invention do not depend on a particular MAC protocol and any of the above named protocols or any other MAC protocol may be used to practice the present invention as will be understood to one of ordinary skill in the art. However, in this embodiment, the MAC protocol provides the capability for local device 301 to establish unique and independent UWB links 312, 313, and 315N with remote devices 302, 303, and 300N respectively as will be discussed with respect to the exemplary protocol of FIG. 5., 42067=At the chip, or wavelet level, embodiments of the present invention produce UWB waveforms. The UWB waveforms are modulated by a variety of techniques including but not limited to: (i) bi-phase modulated signals (+1, \u22121), (ii) multilevel bi-phase signals (+1, \u22121, +a1, \u2212a1, +a2, \u2212a2, . . . , +aN, \u2212aN, (iii) quadrature phase signals (+1, \u22121, +j, \u2212j), (iv) multi-phase signals (1, \u22121, exp(+j\u03c0/N), exp(\u2212j\u03c0/N), exp(+j\u03c02/N), exp(\u2212j\u03c02/N), . . . , exp(+j(N\u22121)/N), exp(\u2212j\u03c0(N\u22121)/N)), (v) multilevel multi-phase signals (ai exp(j2\u03c0\u03b2/N)| a \u2208{1, a1, a2, . . . , aK}, \u03b2\u2208{0, 1, . . . , N\u22121}), (vi) frequency modulated pulses, (vii) pulse position modulation (PPM) signals (possibly same shape pulse transmitted in different candidate time slots), (viii) M-ary modulated waveforms gBi (t) with Bi \u2208{1, . . . , M}, and (ix) any combination of the above waveforms, such as multi-phase channel symbols transmitted according to a chirping signaling scheme. The present invention, however, is applicable to variations of the above modulation schemes and other modulation schemes (e.g., as described in Lathi, \u201cModem Digital and Analog Communications Systems,\u201d Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1998, the entire contents of which is incorporated by reference herein), as will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s)., 171912=In step 1007, the local device 901 receives the answer from each remote device including the reference devices R1-R4, devices X and devices Y, and decodes the positional information of each remote device and stores the distances of the positional information in main memory 207. From the stored distance information, processor 205 of device 901 determines the position of each device using a triangulation process as seen in step 1009. All positions are then displayed on the display 213 of the local device 901 so that the user of the local device can associate each remote device on the screen with a remote device physically located in the conference room 900. According to a preferred embodiment, the local device 901 refers to an internal compass to determine which direction the local device is facing and matches this information with the position information received from the reference devices R1-R4 to ensure that the display 313 of the local device is properly oriented. For example, if the local user is facing north, the local device 901 knows from the information received in step 1007 that the reference marker R1 is on the north wall and orients the positional map such that reference device R1 is at the top of the display 313. If the user then faces east, then the internal compass of the local device indicates that a change in direction has occurred and the local device orients the positional map such that R3 is at the top of the display 313. In this way, the remote devices X and R on the display 313 are always shown as in front of or behind the local device 901 as these remote devices are positioned vis a vis the local user in the real space of conference room 900., 21271=The present document contains subject matter related to that disclosed in commonly owned, co-pending application Ser.
