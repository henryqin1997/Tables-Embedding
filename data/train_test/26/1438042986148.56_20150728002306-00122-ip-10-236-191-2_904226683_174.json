Over 1000 students and a great place to meet great friends and people who truly care. Plus its a campus organization too!, 150980=Dorms are pretty typical. Iowa State is a large campus with lots of housing,they are building a new dorm that should be done by 2017. You can go for traditional housing or suite style, lots of variety but apply early!:), 192522=I'm am loving the campus! I'm starting as a Freshman this August 2011. Though I haven't started, students there for summer classes were helpful and informative, as were the professors at orientation. I can't Wait to attend!, 881032=By the fall of 2014, Iowa State University will officially have the biggest Greek system in the United States.

The application opens up in July,make sure you accept your offer of admission and correctly put in data directly from transcript.

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Prospective engineers, design majors, those pursuing computer-related fields, Iowa residents, and those looking for big opportunities. Tips for prospective students The campus is gorgeous, and feels more like a state park than a college. Definitely go to a football game if you get a chance, but stay away from Welch Avenue afterward. Jimmy John's, Jeff's Pizza, and The Fighting Burrito are located a few feet from campus, have delicious food, good prices, make deliveries, and are all open until around 3 AM. Take your parents to Hickory Park when they visit, you'll be glad you did. First year roommate assignments are usually random, so be prepared. Cyride, the bus system, makes it easy to get anywhere in Ames. The guy to girl ratio is unfavorable for men, but every female in that count is hot enough to be a model. Girls, you'll find every type of man you could imagine, and then some. Take the time to meet some of the international students. There are a lot of them, and you can learn a lot from them. The career fairs are huge and bring big opportunities. Always be in attendance. Bang for the buck Tuition is a hefty load on out-of-staters, and if you're an engineering major, your tuition goes up after two years. There",
