The band has taken full creative control of its music, and kicked off what would become a highly successful tour in 2011 with New Kids On The Block. The tour moniker \u2013 NKOTBSB \u2013 was a marketing gem for both groups, and bringing all five members of Backstreet back together was the proverbial icing on the cake., 3314=The Backstreet Boys came full circle when, in April 2013, they held a 20th anniversary celebration. The group previewed eight new songs during the event, then posted six of them on YouTube the next day. On May 15, the group performed a song from the new album, \"Permanent Stain,\" for the very first time on Good Morning America. A few days later, they embarked on the \"In a World Like This\" tour, which began in China., 4555=In April 2012, the Backstreet Boys announced that Kevin Richardson has rejoined them permanently. Four months later, they made their very first performance as a reunited five-man group, closing out ABC's Good Morning America concert series. And in a way, it felt like the group had never disbanded., 839=Aaron Carter would like to remind you all that he was once a platinum-selling pop star. The blonde-headed brother of a BSB has just announced where and when in the U.S. he\u2019ll be performing\u00a0this year. Carter, who\u2019s currently in the midst of touring Canada, makes it this side of the border on July 18 at\u2026, 4239=If you check your calendar, it's certainly not going to take you back a few decades to when the Backstreet Boys really were \u2026 boys. Not when their newly released eighth studio album, \"In a World Like This\" is brand brand new and flying off the shelves. Not when it's the first album featuring all five original members in six years since Richardson left the group. Not when it's their first independent album since leaving Jive Records in 2010., 1506=Although the Backstreet Boys made the decision to take a break from recording, they returned to the studio in 2005, but did not release another album until 2009, entitled This Is Us. Backstreet Boys tickets immediately began selling for their concert in support of the new album. The Backstreet Boys continue to tour, joined by fellow 'boy band' New Kids On The Block., 2800=The Backstreet Boys formed in Orlando, Florida in 1993. The band's original members where A.J.. McLean, Howie Dorough, Brian Littrell, Nick Carter, and Kevin Richardson, although Richardson left the group in 2006 to pursue other interests. The band came about because Lou Pearlman placed an ad in a 1992 newspaper annoucing open autidions for a boy band. A.J. was the first member selected, and the remaining members were eventually added to round out their sound. The Backstreet Boys first performance was at Walt Disney World in 1993., 5309=Need proof? The guys are in the midst of their second North American run on the World Like This tour now. When it wraps they'll head for their second European run in July. Their tour schedule also includes their very first shows in Israel \u2026 three of them, to be exact. The first sold out in 30 minutes, and the second in just five minutes before a third show was added., 4922=After their tour wraps up, the Boys plan to lay low for the rest of the year before returning to the studio in 2015. They've also got a documentary coming out centering on their rise from childhood stars to pop icons., 2199=The band's first recordings were not well received in the United States, but received much attention in Europe and international markets. In fact, the Backstreet Boys did not gain popularity in the United States until the release of their second album, Backstreet's Back, which included the single 'Quit Playing Games With My Heart' reached number two on the charts, and helped the band gain some American footing. Backstreet Boys tickets began to gain popularity as well. The band's next album, Millennium was met with huge success, entering the Billboard charts at number one in 1999.}",
