That is, when the batt is saturated with urine and severely flexed by the normal body motions of an active child the batt does not ball up or disintegrate easily as a batt which is maintained in planar form. Because of this the batt is capable of more effectively using its available absorbent capacity as well as maintaining a neater overall appearance wet or dry. One simple form of assembly is to have all three components of the same peripheral configuration with the borders of both the facing sheet and backing sheet extending slightly beyond the borders of the batt. As shown in FIG. 1, the facing sheet and backing sheet can then be bonded together around the entire periphery of the batt to provide a neat, sealed construction. Other means of assembly may be used, such as turning over the edges of the backing sheet on top of the facing sheet, or vice versa, and securing these turned-over edge portions in place. It is important that the absorbent batt should also be bonded to at least one of the outer sheets, preferably the backing sheet, in a manner such that when the elastic member contracts the sheet to which the elastic is attached, the batt will also be",
