School bus passenger seats are built to specifications conforming to the safety standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, DOT. These are codified as 49 C.F.R. Ch.V, \ufffd 571.222, Standard No. 222, and require that the seat back bend or deflect forward when a force is applied to the rear of the seat back. The code further specifies that 4000 W inch-pounds of energy must be absorbed within a maximum forward deflection of the seat back of 14 inches and 2800 W inch-pounds be absorbed within a maximum rearward deflection of the seat back of 10 inches where W represents the number of seating positions for which the seat is designed. 49 C.F.R., Ch.V, \ufffd 571.222, S5.1.3-5.1.4. The code specifies a passive restraint system, and does not require any sort of active restraints, such as a two-point passenger restraining lap belt or a three-point passenger restraining lap belt and torso harness combination. Children riding the school bus are protected in head-on collisions by the seat back in front of them deflecting forward and absorbing some of their forward momentum.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only the preferred embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. Many variations are contemplated and included in the present invention. In addition to those described in relation to the above embodiments, the present system contemplates including means for preventing premature forward deployment of the tower member 221 relative to the seatback. For example, the top end of tower 221 may be connected to seat back portion 225 limiting relative motion therebetween until sufficient force breaks the top end of the tower apart from the seat back portion. As in the previous embodiment, restraint system 220 also includes guides 248 connected near the top end 231 of tower member 221. Seat belt retractors 249 (FIG. 5b) are fixedly attached to the two vertical members of tower 221. Each seat belt retractor 249 house a torso belt 250, which connect to a tongue 246 in turn connected to lap belt 245. Restraint system 220 also includes a buckle 247 fixedly attached to seat support portion 224 and adapted to lockingly engage tongue 246. Torso belt 250 is extended upwardly from torso belt retractor 249 through guide 248",
