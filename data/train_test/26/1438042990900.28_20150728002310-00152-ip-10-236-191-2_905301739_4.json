            "The only safety issues are in the woods on and around the campus: we do have legit wildlife here. So watch out for bears and panthers if you're on a trail at dusk and dawn, and don't hike Dead Man's Trail at night alone. Other than that... occasionally this random guy will run around campus with a bigfoot mask.. but he's not really a safety threat.",
            "HA! There is none. No greek here. Unless you're taking New Testament Greek, but.. I don't think that's what the review was getting at.",
            "There are a few clubs on campus (Drama club is great! There's also a martial arts club, an outdoors club, I'm not really sure what else...). The best part, though, are the diverse student ministries.",
            "Great for students who want a small, personal, atmosphere, like the outdoors, and want to authentically grow in their Christian walk.",
            "Umm.. The only one I know about is that when students of the World Missions Department graduate, they walk across the stage barefoot - in reference to Romans 10:15 - And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, 'How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!'",
            "It's about $23,000 but the school does give you some nice scholarships. If you maintain a 3.5 or above, you'll get $7500 a year. There are several other scholarships that you can receive, and frankly, money's not a big deal for God so He will provide if He wants you here. That said, for the quality of teaching, it's not a bad price - and since its a small school, the professors all know you by name and care about your personal life. It's not uncommon for a professor to invite a class to his/her house for a cookout or movie.",
            "Toccoa is a small town, so there's not much of a social scene. I love hiking, so when I have spare time I hike EVERYWHERE. There are supposedly 14 waterfalls on the campus (a large part of the campus is woods; only 1/10 of it is buildings); I have found 5 of these waterfalls. So that's great if you like the outdoors. If you don't like the outdoors... well, we're only 40 minutes from Commerce, which has great shopping, 1.5 hours from Atlanta, which has EVERYTHING, 1 hour from Greenville if you don't like Atlanta, and 30 minutes from Helen, which is a precious german tourist attraction.",
            "I've had worse food, but I've also had better. Our food supplier is Aramark, and they have some really stellar food on occasion - especially good cultural food.. but for the most part it's pretty average.",
            "Every dorm on campus is different. Underclassmen girls live in either Fant or LeTourneau Hall (both of which have their advantages and disadvantages) while guys live in Forrest Hall. Upperclassmen can choose to live in the Terraces and Cottages, which are smaller dorms. The cottages are actual houses - usually reserved for seniors only.",
            "I expected college to be more difficult. It's not necessarily easy, per say, but if you listen in class, take notes, turn in assignments on time, and study for your tests, you'll make A's or B+'s every time. The professors here are great (for the most part) and are very reasonable.",
            "Be authentic. A lot of places will tell you to try to impress the school, but at Toccoa authenticity, sincerity, and integrity is valued. The school seeks to develop character with intellect, but character is the more important of the two.",
            "Toccoa's a great place to get away from the hurry and scurry of life and focus on God, fellowship, and academics. It's only 1.5 hours from Atlanta and an hour from Greenville, SC, so you can still get to civilization when you want it! Great professors, good fellowship, and a beautiful campus tucked into the foothills of the Appalachian mountains make this a great option for college."
