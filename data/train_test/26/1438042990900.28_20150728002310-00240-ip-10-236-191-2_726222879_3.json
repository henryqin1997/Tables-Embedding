            "This is a bit more speculative than it is an investment; it has a very high risk/reward return profile. If the price of gold starts to go up at all, this will certainly prosper from some operating leverage. Right now they are in the position of having a lot of debt and having to dispose of some assets. There are more secure companies to hold in gold than this one. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "He is not a fan of gold. It doesn\u2019t pay a dividend and is more of an emotional item. Supposedly the breakdown in gold is because the Chinese are not buying as much. Also, this company has a lot of debt and are trying to sell off assets. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "He likes the gold sector in general as he thinks the US$ eventually comes off. However, he would not put this company anywhere near the top of his list. They are still paying for their overexpansion of the past decade or so. Having to sell production right now and get the debt down is going to hamper their growth going forward. He would rather buy midsize Canadian producers that are showing production growth, have a clean balance sheet and might get taken out. This company\u2019s balance sheet is still a mess; their production profile is not that good and they still have to sell assets. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Chart shows this has been building a base since 2013. The gold sector, for the 1st time in a while, is starting to look interesting. If you are going to buy into the sector, you are probably better off to just buy the basket through an ETF. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "It is trying to hold the price. It has underperformed the index and especially gold. It is a laggard. Avoid it. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "He doesn\u2019t own any gold stocks. When there are big down days like this, and people are looking for liquidity, everything goes down. Gold is a very difficult product to value, because its marginal costs shift around a lot. This company\u2019s balance sheet is in pretty bad shape. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "People keep asking how gold can be up and this company is just a disaster. The enterprise value was $15 billion and is now $30 billion. However, debt has gone from no debt to $10-$12 billion. In effect the debt owns the gold and you don\u2019t. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "One of his concerns is that there is a lack of growth. Even in a poor market like this, there are still opportunities for companies adding production and cash flow and earnings-per-share. They are in the process of shrinking a bit, looking at asset sales and trying to fix the balance sheet. He prefers Agnico-Eagle (AEM-T) and Goldcorp (G-T). / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Stock vs. Stock. G-T vs. ABX-T. G-T is better run than ABX. ABX-T will have more leverage if you see an immediate increase in gold price, however. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "One of the largest gold producers globally. It has not been a particular favourite. If you believe in gold generally, the big gold producers should do very, very well. As an alternative to this company, he would suggest Yamana Gold (YRI-T) which has an interest in the old Osisko property in Qu\u00e9bec, one of the best in the world right now. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Caller is a big short seller. ABX-T have not done well. If he was going to be short on this one he would offset it with DGC-T or G-T. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Gold stocks are moving \u2018today\u2019. ABX-T has some problems with their mines. Zambian royalties have increased and so they are mothballing the mine. They kept costs down. But he would be looking at bullion or possibly FNV-T or SSL-T. The increase today won\u2019t last in gold. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "Of all of the gold stocks that he follows, this one has the most upside potential. Stock is very cheap. Trading at a slight discount to its BV, and historically that has been a pretty good time to buy it. Right now it has its issues with Pascua Lama, but they have a nice spread of mines and it is earning money, which many gold companies are not. This is a good time to buy. Dividend yield of 1.75%. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "It is incredible how this keeps going down. You keep thinking there is a bottom on this and it just keeps going down and down. Has been disappointing this last few years. He doesn\u2019t think you want to be without gold in your portfolio, given where the US$ is and given the amount of monetary stimulation on a global basis. This is probably not a bad anchor name. He prefers others. / Be the first to comment Tweet finance",
            "This is one that he does not follow, but his company has a target of $17. His issue with the company is that it is big and they are having to shut down at the same time that the price of gold has been down, since the cost of production is so much higher. His strategy is to own companies that can produce at the lowest cost of production. (See Top Picks.) / Be the first to comment Tweet finance"
