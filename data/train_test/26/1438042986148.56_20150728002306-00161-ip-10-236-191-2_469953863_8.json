Typically, air mattresses are made up of a plurality of channels or chambers which have heat seal-type seams and with plastic or plasticized canvas-type material whereby the typical air mattress has a single inflation nozzle and the air is blown into the air mattress so as to inflate all of the chambers. In 1984, U.S. Pat. No. 4,428,087 issued to Friedrich Horn and was directed to a therapeutical air mattress. In this particular air mattress, there was an inflatable hollow body provided with a pair of symmetrically arranged longitudinal air tubes which form an inflatable single chamber system and which almost adjoin one another in a head region and were spaced from one another in a body region so as to satisfy the particular needs of a patient lying in the mattress in such a manner that the mattress could be set in rhythmical vibrations. Typically, this therapeutical air mattress was used to treat people with articular rheumatism and/or with blockages of the vertebrae and articulations., 21129=U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,452 is directed to a prenatal mattress and issued on Dec. 25, 1984 to Jodey Lickert. This patent describes a prenatal mattress enabling a pregnant woman to lie more comfortably and safely on her abdomen during the pregnancy term. The mattress comprises a lower layer of cloth carrying releasable fasteners, a fluid-fillable abdominal cushion, and a fluid-fillable head cushion. An upper layer of cloth is provided so as to seal the cushion and headrest in place. The cushions can be filled to the extent desired with a fluid, placed between the areas and the fasteners can be attached so as to form the mattress. In a preferred embodiment, the cushion has dual indentations to accommodate the breasts of the pregnant woman and a lower indentation to accommodate the thighs or upper leg areas., 17572=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/009,810, filed on Feb. 2, 1987 now U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,999 by Debra A. Halverson, entitled \"Maternity Mattress.\", 20556=U.S. Pat. No. 4,051,566 issued on Oct. 4, 1977 to Lucy Esquivel is directed to a mattress with a modifiable cavity for pregnant women. Basically, this patent teaches a mattress structure which has an insert in a cavity which is movably mounted so that it may be raised or lowered to accommodate a woman who is pregnant in such a fashion that she may lay on the mattress face down with her abdomen in the cavity. Specifically, a hand crank is provided whereby the cavity section with the insert may be cranked so that the insert may be raised or lowered., 19323=In addition to the general state of the art of air mattresses, some patents have been issued which are directed to custom mattresses designed specifically for pregnant women. U.S. Pat. No. 3,840,920 issued on Oct. 15, 1974 to Walter Voelker is directed to an adjustable mattress for pregnant mothers wherein separate compartments were provided in the design with each compartment containing non-resilient flowable material. More specifically, various types of cellular material as well as other choice materials listed in the patent would be used in conjunction with spheres which operated in a thixotropic fashion. The particular structure described in this patent was to be divided into separate chambers including one located in the general enlarged abdominal area of the pregnant woman whereby different flowability characteristics of the flowable material could be maintained or, in the alternative, the flowability of the flowable material in each compartment was continuously or intermittently altered by altering the volume of the envelope, either mechanically or by altering gas pressure or liquid pressure in the compartment, thus causing the slightly elastic envelope to increase or decrease in volume.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. FIG. 7 shows a present invention mattress 111 having a conventional main mattress section 113 with an oval opening 115 shown therein. In this embodiment, five cushions, namely cushion 117 and cushion sections, i.e., half cushions 119, 121, 123 and 125 are removably insertable into opening 115. As shown, the round cushion 117 has an inflation port 127. Half cushions 119, 121, 123 and 125 are all filled non-inflatable, half toroids, e.g. with foam, beads, feather, or the like. Cushion 117 inserts directly and fits snugly into half cushions 119 and 121 and cushion 117 has VELCRO\ufffd flaps 137 and 139 which are attachable to opposite VELCRO\ufffd strips 141 and 143 on cushions 121 and 119 respectively. Likewise, cushions 119 and 121 have VELCRO\ufffd flaps 145 and 147 which are attachable to VELCRO\ufffd strips 149 and 151 on cushions 125 and 123. Concomitantly, cushions 123 and 125 have VELCRO\ufffd flaps 155 and 153 which attach to VELCRO\ufffd strips 157 and 159 on main mattress section 113. In this manner, each of the cushions are attachable to one another and, coupled with a snug fit, will not pop out or move around. Obviously, the attachment means",
