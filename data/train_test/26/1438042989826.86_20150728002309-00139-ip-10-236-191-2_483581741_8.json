    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In light of the foregoing description, it is apparent that a memory controller incorporating the teachings of the present invention can be used to optimize the average multiplexed-address-memory access time on an application-specific basis. It thus constitutes a significant advance in the art. It is well known that a memory access is most likely, in most applications, to be directed to the same page as the previous one. This probability tends to fall with the length of any idle time between these accesses, however, and in many applications the probability falls enough after a certain length of idle time that the precharge-penalty expectation exceeds that of the CAS-only-cycle benefit. When the idle time reaches that level, then, RAS should be dropped, and timer 22 represents a mechanism for doing so. Moreover, since the timer 22 is programmable in the illustrated embodiment, the DURATION value can be changed with application in recognition of the fact that the probability function changes with application, too. The choice of the DURATION value determines the behavior of the system. If DURATION is set to zero, the controller can emulate prior-art controllers of the type that de-assert RAS during any idle periods. Setting DURATION to a value that exceeds the mandatory-refresh period, on the other hand, causes it to emulate prior-art controllers of this type that assert RAS continuously during idle periods. To take advantage of the particular features of the present",
