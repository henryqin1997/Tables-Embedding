There is no doubt that McInnes must be feeling the pressure after the first four months of the season look to have been an utter shambles. Robins are yet again fighting for survival at the bottom of the league, but Innes remains cool, insisting that the club won't be relegated this term but will finish higher that last season's 20th place. And at the moment, that seems to be a promise that is hard to swallow. Speaking to fans at the annual meeting at Ashton Gate, McInnes said: 'I believed at the start of the season that we could do better than last year and I still believe that. 'Concerns are there and justifiably so. But I can assure you; this squad will not be involved in a relegation fight at the end of the season. 'I fully believe we will be okay and that we can end up better off than we were last season. 'I would like to think that when January comes and we bring a couple in and move a couple out, we will be in a better position to show our worth. 'We are not doing as well as we know we can. I know we are better than where we are in the table and I am confident we can prove that.', 18111=Date:Saturday December 8 2012, 12634=No Offers For Freeman Or Any Other Players (Monday June 29 2015), 11617=Elliott Joins City's Coaching Staff (Tuesday June 9 2015)}",
