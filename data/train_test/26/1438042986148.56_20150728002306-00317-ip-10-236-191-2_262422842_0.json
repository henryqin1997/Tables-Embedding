Place tablet between lip and gum above incisors, or between cheek and gum. Translingual: Spray preparation delivers 0.4 mg/metered dose. At onset of attack, spray 1---2 metered doses into oral mucosa; no more than 3 doses/15 min should be used. If pain persists, seek medical attention. May be used prophylactically 5---10 min prior to activity that might precipitate an attack. Transdermal: Apply one pad each day. Titrate to higher doses by using pads that deliver more drug or by applying more than one pad. Initial dose: 1/2 in q8h. Increase by 1/2 inch to achieve desired results. Usual dose is 1---2 inches q8h; up to 4---5 inches q4h have been used. 1 inch = 15 mg nitroglycerin. Topical: Initial:2.5---2.6 mg tid or qid. Titrate upward by 2.5- or 2.6-mg increments until side effects limit the dose. Doses as high as 26 mg given 4 \u00d7 daily have been used. Sustained release (oral): Prophylaxis: Use 5---10 min before activities that might precipitate an attack. Acute attack: Dissolve 1 tablet under tongue or in buccal pouch at first sign of anginal attack; repeat every 5 min until relief is obtained. Do not take more than 3 tablets/15 min. If pain continues or increases, patient should call physician or go to hospital. Sublingual Initial: 5 \u00b5g/min delivered through an infusion pump. Increase by 5-\u00b5g increments every 3---5 min as needed. If no response at 20 \u00b5g,",
