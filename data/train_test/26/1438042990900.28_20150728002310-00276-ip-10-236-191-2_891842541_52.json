            "It's Alaska! If you don't have a sense of being spontaneous and adventurous then this may not be the place for you. It snows, it rains, gets a little windy and the sun comes out, and that's sometimes all in the same day. So go hiking, surfing, biking, kayaking. Think outdoors and you can do it.",
            "When it comes to eating you'll either eat what you make or you'll have to find somewhere in town to eat. This coincides with the fact there are no dorms, therefore no sort of food and dining.",
            "Dorms? That just doesn't exist here at the University of Kodiak. Although many, including myself, wish there was some sort of dorm life considering college and living isn't to shabby here and having dorms would be a nice touch. So when coming here consider the fact you'll need to find an apartment of some kind.",
            "Being that the University is in Alaska, nothing is ever taken too seriously. Anyone coming out of state might actually have a slight break from whatever they may be use to. Professors have a thing for homework and schoolwork; it doesn't usually exist. Just do what you have to and you'll get by fine.",
            "Although many end up being new to the University, the best suggestion would be try to make some friends or at least get to know some other students. It can't get tricky if you're not in the loop and the staff tend to send students to various websites that lead to nowhere for their answers.",
            "The University is suitable for the students who enjoy a home feeling due to the small sized classes and the laid back attitude of the professors. Classmates become friends and are willing to help one another out. While many days end up being a new adventure!"

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Bang for the buck The books are somewhat expensive, but I'm sure everywhere around the 48 states books are same priced as up here in Alaska or lowered 5 - 10 dollars. And as stated the cost of tuition fees would be lowered being a resident. Also being a student at UAA you would be able to use the gym, swimming pool, shutter, and other great places around the campus for free, well not for free because all of the equipments and activities are already included in the tuition fees. And making a wolf card is free with a 10 dollar already included in the wolf card for printing. Am enjoying being here I as a current enroll student, really love it here at UAA. I meet many new people, meet many new challenges, and being a resident in Alaska lowers the tuition fees. Am learning a lot UAA is a great University with a diverse group of many different kind such; Asians/Pacific Islander, Natives, Hispanic, African-American, and Caucasian. With so many different kinds of talents and learning style, students are able to learn many things not only about cultural, but a great built up in students communication skills, creative thinking, critical thinking,",
