            "I was told at orientation that this college is very protective of their students and care very much about campus safety. Not only does the campus provide vehicles to take students to places after a certain time if they feel uncomfortable walking in the dark for a long distance. Our college also provides land line phones all over campus on lamp posts so that a student could call campus security for any concerns or for a ride to their house. The College of Saint Scholastica also provides links on the online website for sexual harassment and violence concerns which helps students to feel safe and comfortable in their environment.",
            "The College of Saint Scholastica is honestly great for any time of student. We offer classes for undergraduate students, graduate students, and even nighttime classes for single moms or anyone who works full time and doesn't have time to go to normal college. We also offer summer classes (which I am taking) which help current students to take more classes and perhaps graduate early. This college emphasizes on taking classes that don't pertain to your major in hopes of finding out what you really love and to pursue your passion in college. The College of Saint Scholastica is great for students have a love of learning, have and want respect, are hospitable, stewardship, and want to belong to a community who will accept them: these are our five Benedictine Values! This college is also great for any student who wants to discover who they are and what they want to do with their lives all while connecting with new people who share the same values and ideals as themselves!",
            "I, myself, am not a Catholic but my college is. Because of this interesting tradition, at events for the student body, a prayer is always said before events begin. This is nice to me and my friends that aren't religious because we are getting a well-rounded view of college and this also provides safety and comfort to me when I get home-sick and miss my family. This college also has a Benedictine Center where nuns and retired elders live. This is interesting to me because in my health-related major, I am able to practice occupational therapy on the citizens of the center and connect with the nuns who work at this college and even teach some classes.",
            "The College of Saint Scholastica is a private, four year college which was scary at first to me because I didn't get many scholarships. But, after completing one year of my undergraduate college career, I have found that in the long run, a degree from this college in my desired job field will pay for itself. I have already made many connections which will be beneficial for my future: this has helped me to take advantage of every opportunity I have here at college and not to worry about all of the loans I have to pay back in the future.",
            "Because The College of Saint Scholastica is in Duluth, I have found that there are many things to do within the proximity of the campus. When I need groceries and necessities, I can walk down to the store in less than 10 minutes. If I get bored on the weekends, my friends and I can take the bus (FREE!) to Canal Park or to Miller Hill Mall to shop or get some coffee. Many things in the area are free and fun to do which is nice when college takes a lot of effort and lack of sleep!",
            "Everyone says that college food is horrible, but I have to disagree. Although some dinners weren't what I would have necessarily been craving or would have had at home, it was edible and did fill me up. I was told going into college that there are many options for food and that is how the freshman 15 happens. I am here to say that is true. Although The College of Saint Scholastica has a gym, I didn't use it and to add to that, I had dessert with every meal because it was offered. The food was good and there were healthy options, vegetarian options, and even dairy-free options, but I chose the fries and cake instead. The food here is varied and cooked well, but I have learned that it is all a matter of choosing what I won't regret eating later.",
            "I was nervous at first to live on my own and to be responsible for my actions, but living in the dorms helped me to connect with like-minded people who shared the same concerns. The only complaint I have about living in the dorms is that my roommate was nothing like me and we didn't get along. Besides that minor negative, I learned a lot about myself, my habits, and how I manage my time. I also believe that putting effort into meeting people in the dorms and connecting with my Residential Adviser has helped me to meet even more people. I also believe that becoming friends with those people, along with having a safe and comfortable place to go, helped me to make friends and therefore talk about my goals, worries, and homework concerns.",
            "The College of Saint Scholastica offers many levels of courses for students to take. I can say from experience that these classes test your abilities, patience, and procrastination. In college, you have a choice to go to class, do your homework, and study for tests. From this college, I have learned that those aren't really options, but a test. If you do study and do your homework, you will succeed as long as you want to get a degree and learn.",
            "During my first year of college, I was told to try everything once, discover what I like to do, and to meet everyone I can. I took this tips to heart and have met many, many good friends and now know what I want to do for the rest of my life because I took risks during college and let down my guard. So, my tips to prospective college students would be to not get so wrapped up in what you want to major in, but instead, focus on what you love to do. If you figure this out, then I assure you that your major will fall into place. My motto is that if you are paying for education, don't waste it on partying, or taking classes in a major that isn't something that you want to do for the rest of your life. I am majoring in Occupational Therapy; even though I have to go to grad school for two years, I know it will be worth it because that is what I am passionate about.",
            "The College of Saint Scholastica has not only helped me to feel confident about my future, but this school has helped me appreciate education, helped me to discover who I am, and helped me see that it is possible to do what I love. After attending one year at this college, I have found a new appreciation for education and have found that if I work hard enough, I can really achieve my dreams and goals. I know I can complete a degree on time here which has helped me to not focus on how many years of schooling I have left, but has helped me to take in the college lifestyle and to take every opportunity I have!"

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Sure its expensive, but I feel the education we are receiving is definitely worth it. Theres a sense of safety, security and pride when you go to CSS. You know you are paying for a brighter and more successful future being there... its not like you're simply paying the school.. you are paying to be a CSS Saint. Am enjoying being here I love the professors, the benedictine value system, and the entire atmosphere. Everyone holds the door open for one another. We all genuinely care for each other. The teachers are very involved and the students are just amazing... best place to learn and make life long friends. Am learning a lot I find the lectures intellectually stimulating. I am learning a lot this semester, along with the last one. I felt the professors were very understanding and they often went above and beyond to help everyone undertand the material to the best of their ability. The homework is a way to reinforce what you learned in class, it never comes across as busy work, I actually find my time in class very enjoyable. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
