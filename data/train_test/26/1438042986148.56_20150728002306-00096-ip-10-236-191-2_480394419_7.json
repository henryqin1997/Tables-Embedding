The multimedia gateway control protocol may be used as the interface between the voice gateway 232 and the call manager 218. For example, call control, signaling, and multimedia data stream, real time protocol (RTP) connections, IP addresses, UDP ports, codec choice etc, may be configured in any suitable manner such as by using a multimedia gateway control protocol. In exemplary embodiments, audio streams may be passed directly between customer premises equipment 102 using real time protocol connections over, for example, a user datagram protocol (UDP). Thus, the multimedia gateway control protocol may be utilized to request the voice gateway 232 to initiate, cancel, and/or otherwise modify connections in order to set up and tear down RTP media streams. A similar procedure may also be utilized to request continuity tests and results.}",
