    "textBeforeTable": "In practical terms, what does 30% or less of calories from fat mean? How Much Fat Should We Eat? Experts do not agree about the ideal level of dietary fat and, in fact, there may not be just one ideal level. A reasonable goal for most people would be to have saturated fat pro-viding no more than 8-10% of calories and a total fat intake between 15 and 30% of total calories. Fat intakes at the higher end of this range, when the fat is monounsaturated fat (nuts, seeds, olive oil, canola oil, avocado), may be a better choice than restriction of all types of dietary fat. Fat should not be limited in children less than 2 years. After 2 years, children should gradually limit dietary fat so that by around age 5, between 20 and 30 per-cent of calories come from fat. This type of diet should be used throughout childhood and adolescence. Saturated fat, cholesterol, fiber \ufffd Does this sound like too much to think about? Try to make food choices that emphasize whole grains, dried beans, vegetables, and fruit. If you do this and follow a vegetarian diet, you'll find that, without much effort, your diet will be low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fiber. Fiber Fiber is found only in plant foods. A vege-tarian diet featuring fruits, vegetables, whole grain breads and cereals, and dried beans will be high in fiber. Oats, carrots, fruits, and beans are",

Soy foods like tofu, tempeh, meat analogs, soy milk, and other products appear to help reduce the risk of heart disease. This may be because of plant estrogens, called isoflavones, found in soy products or may be due to the cholesterol-lowering effect of soy protein. In any case, in-cluding a serving or two of soy products daily can enhance a heart healthy vegetarian diet. Vitamin B12 and Heart Disease Adequacy of vitamin B12 appears to be important in reducing heart disease risk. Vegetarians with low blood vitamin B12 levels appear to have higher levels of a substance called homocysteine, associated with in-creased risk of heart disease. To insure adequate intakes of vitamin B12, vegetarians who eat little or no animal-derived",
