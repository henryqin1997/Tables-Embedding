The temperature of the distillate then raises to l08C and any water drop becomes unrecognized in the distillate.

No; 365,406, 31378=EXAMPLE i In a glass flask equipped with a stirrer, a refluxing cooler and a dropping funnel, there is charged methylisobutylketone (385 parts), and the content is heated to reflux with stirring. Then. a mixture of an aqueous dispersion of PTFE (polymer content, \"/r by weight; Polyflon Dispersion D l manufactured by Daikin Kogyo Co, Ltd.)

The water in the dispersion is azeo tropically distilled out with methylisobutylketone. and the distillate is condensed in the refluxing cooler and lead to a separator where the methylisobutylketone and the water are separated into two layers. The methyliso butylketone of the upper layer is recycled into the glass flask and the water layer of the lower layer is taken out from the bottom of the separator. The temperature of the distillate first shows 1 [6C. i.e. the boiling temperature of methylisobutylketone. but is gradually lowered with addition ofthe dispersion to 89 C. Addition of the dispersion is accomplished in about 1.5 hours. From shortly before accomplishment of the addition. the temperature of the distillate raises gradually. Heating and stirring are continued so that the temperature of the distillate finally reaches to ll6C and any water drop becomes unrecognized in the distillate.

The organosol is admixed with a film-forming material to make a composition for coating, which is applicable on a metal plate to form a film of excellent properties such as adhesiveness, hardness, self lubricating, anti-sticking and wear resistant properties., 49092=21. The organosol according to claim 20, which contains 2571 by weight of the particles of tetrafluoroethylene polymer and particles of tetrafluoroethylenehexafluoropropylene copolymer., 13634=24 Claims, No Drawings FLUOROCARBON POLYMER COMPOSITION AND PRODUCTION AND USE THEREOF This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 56,983. filed July 21, 1970, now abandoned., 49595=24. A process for preparing the composition according to claim 13, which comprises admixing the organosol according to claim 1 with a film-forming material in a proportion of 95:5 to 10:90 by weight.}",
