Washington has won its last three head-to-head match-ups with Lincecum, with the right-hander actually taking the loss the last two times (including April 29 in the District)., 2056=NATIONALS at GIANTS Where: AT&T Park Gametime: 10:15 p.m. TV: MASN2 Radio: WJFK (106.7 FM), WFED (1500 AM), XM 188 Weather: Mostly cloudy, 51 degrees, Wind 10 mph out to CF, 95206=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC.

Look at his last 3 games folks, he is never going to be a #1-2-3 starter but he can be an excellent #4-5. It was weeks ago that natsjack pointed out how most negative comments were by the various anons but I don't see much here in the middle of the 5th. We can still lose the game (that is the beauty of baseball) but I really like how we have been playing lately. I saw a stat that shows since April 29 we have the best defensive stats in the majors. What an amazing turnaround. Now if we can just start to hit. On the draft, I am wondering how a 6 9\" kid with heat can only have a 7-5 record? I realize this is a strength with Rizzo and our staff so I can't wait to see who else falls into our laps. We got a starting pitcher, a 5 tool centerfielder, and perhaps the best hitter in the draft.

Cron is a massive, powerfully built 1B along the lines of an Adam Dunn. Cron is a slow runner and his throwing and fielding tools all indicate a future as a DH or 1B. Perhaps the premier power hitter in the 2011 draft, the right-handed hitting Cron has enjoyed a spectacular 2011 season despite the mandated usage of the dreaded BBCOR bats. One dimensional players with tremendous power can hang on in the majors for a long time (i.e. Matt Stairs), so look for Cron to be a big league power hitter for many years.Rizzo passed on him., 1568=John Lannan starts for the Nationals, and though he's pitched well against the Giants in two previous encounters (1.98 ERA over 13 2/3 innings) he's yet to earn a win. The lefty has been the victim of poor run support \u2014 he took a 2-1 loss to Jonathan Sanchez on April 30.}",
