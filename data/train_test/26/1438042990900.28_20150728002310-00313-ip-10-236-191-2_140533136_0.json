    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 After its massive opening weekend, everyone expected \u2018Despicable Me 2\u2032 to take a big drop and settle into second or third place. Well, we were right about one part of that. The animated movie did take a big drop, but it wasn\u2019t big enough for all of the fresh competition to take over. With another $44 million in the bank and a current total of $229 million, the film is already one of the year\u2019s biggest hits. Expect this one to close out with $300 million at the very least, and \u2018Despicable Me 3\u2032 to get fast-tracked. Of the newcomers, Adam Sandler\u2019s \u2018Grown Ups 2\u2032 fared the best, taking in $42 million. Despite the fact that people of taste generally find his films obnoxious, Sandler has his fans and they turned out in force. The movie will have to have legs if it wants to match the gross of its predecessor, but we imagine that it\u2019ll fare well in the weeks ahead. In third place, Guillermo del Toro\u2018s \u2018Pacific Rim\u2019 opened to a disappointing $38 million, a low gross for a big budget studio release with all kinds of mainstream appeal. Although generally well-liked by film fans, the movie\u2019s \u201cGiant Robots vs. Giant Monsters\u201d premise didn\u2019t seem to catch on with mainstream audiences (especially since it was sold as a \u2018Transformers\u2019 knock-off instead of the goofy family movie that it is). Something could always turn it around \u2014 international grosses, small percentage drops, etc. \u2014 but",
