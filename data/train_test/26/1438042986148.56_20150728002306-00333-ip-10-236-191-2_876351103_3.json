    "textAfterTable": "Detailed Description: A phase I/II, 5 arm, single blind study, comparing five doses of Proellex to matching placebo in healthy adult female subjects of reproductive age. Exposure to study drug will be for up to 10 weeks. In-clinic pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be made on the first day of dosing and on the last day (week 10). Office visits will occur every week to assess liver function and trough blood concentrations for Proellex and primary metabolite. Daily vaginal bleeding diaries will be maintained during the course of the study. A single blind run-in period of up to 56 days will begin the study to assess baseline menstrual patterns will be utilized. Twelve subjects per treatment group (total 60 subjects) will be assigned to each dose. New groups will not begin dosing until the previous dose group has completed. Daily treatments will be either 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, 9 mg, 12 mg Proellex. A single blind run-in period using placebo will be incorporated to establish baseline parameters. \u00a0 Eligibility Ages Eligible for Study: \u00a0 18 Years to 50 Years",
