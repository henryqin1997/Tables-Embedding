    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{19115=After the success of 2002, you?d think that Warriors fans might be vaguely disappointed at falling one step short of another grand-final appearance in 2003. But in truth, after a patchy season, most Warriors fans are delighted about the way the team finished the season., 13782=Both Webb and Villasanti were influential performers in the Warriors first round play-off match against the Bulldogs. The 48-22 score line, and the 5-try performance of Francis Meli will live long in many league fans memories. This performance, more than any other, will ensure that most Warriors fans look back favourably on 2003., 17295=Early in the season, the Warriors looked like they were going to continue right on with their 2002 form. After a disappointing first-up loss to Newcastle, they strung together a succession of victories, capped off with the spectacular 32-12 defeat of Brisbane at ANZ. The form of PJ Marsh and Lance Hohaia in particular was vital to the success, and the mid-season slump in form can probably be attributed in no small way to their loss, through a serious neck injury and an inexplicable patch of poor form respectively. The loss of Marsh was bad enough, but the heart-breaking defeat at the hands of Parramatta in the same match was a devastating blow, especially as moments before the unbelievable late capitulation, the Warriors had played perhaps their best football of the season to that point. A pair of hammerings at the hands of Penrith doesn?t look so bad now that the Panthers have swept aside all challengers to take the NRL title, but at the time they were major dents to confidence. The Cake Tin curse struck again as the Warriors suffered defeats in Wellington against both the Bulldogs and Canberra. Unconvincing victories over the Eels at Ericsson, and the struggling Sharks (twice) hardly had fans in raptures, as the Warriors were unable to rack up the big victories they had managed in 2002., 13433=Overall, in 2003 the Warriors proved that they could survive without the influence of Campion and Cleary, although for a large part of the season it looked like the doubters would be proved right. It was a season of transition. Most of the season the Warriors were stuck in second gear, hampered by injuries to Ali Lauiti?iti, Marsh, Hohaia, Jones, Motu Tony, Villasanti, and Toopi, and straight out lethargic performances, but towards the end of the season there was obviously a lot of belief within the team, and certainly no shortage in ability. By retaining the same core of players, the Warriors should hopefully be there or thereabouts at the business end of 2004., 18385=Many pundits suggested that the Warriors would greatly miss the experience of Kevin Campion and Ivan Cleary (in particular, Campion?s defence and Cleary?s goal-kicking). Although they didn?t completely put these predictions to shame, the Warriors of 2003 went a long towards proving that they can succeed predominantly on the back of the relatively young, and predominantly Kiwi talent that has been nurtured by the club for 4 or 5 years now, and particularly over the last 3 under Daniel Anderson. The likes of Clinton Toopi, Francis Meli, Henry Fa?afili, and Wairangi Koopu have been at the club for a number of years now and should be consistent performers, which on the whole they are. Monty Betham did his best to take over the role of Campion, and his leadership and (perhaps more importantly) his performances on the field improved over the course of the season, and like Campion he was possibly the team?s best defender. The goal-kicking woes were not really fixed, but perhaps more by good luck than good management they didn?t have too much effect on the season., 14460=Warriors? fans will also be looking forward to 2004 for the performances of the teams remaining two Australian stars in 2003 (Mark Tookey, Justin Murphy and John Carlaw were relegated to bit parts), Brent Webb and Villasanti. After some patchy early performances at fullback, Webb blossomed to become one of the back lines most dangerous weapons, and although it seems almost sacrilege to say it, was clearly more effective than Stacey Jones as both a playmaker and ball runner late in the season. Villasanti?s form has been rewarded with a place in the Kangaroo squad, while his huge hits seem certain to inspire fear in opposition forwards for years to come.}",
