            "Like every campus, there are dangers. Mostly those come from poor choices made while intoxicated. However, the campus police are vigilant in their duties and caring towards the students.",
            "Pretty minimal. There are a few frats and sororities but they don't have an noticeably influential hand in campus life for the most part",
            "Clubs vary anywhere from hiking to LARP to debating and singing. The list is quite diverse and anyone can find at least one to join.",
            "The more go with the flow you are the better however anyone will fit in here because that is the basic mindset of the students. We are a really laid back bunch.",
            "There are a few ponds on campus that the students fondly refer to as the gunks. These ponds are home to fish, some turtles, and flock of ducks. Every Spring, duckings hatch and it is always a big event on campus.",
            "The school offers a good education for a fraction of private school costs.",
            "There are a lot of good clubs on campus and the town is really nice at anytime of the year. Also, the school is located right in the middle of the Catskills so there are many hiking, rock-climbing, biking and outdoor activity opportunities.",
            "The student union building offers decent food. it's pretty expensive but so is food anywhere else. The dining hall is less that gourmet, though, I suppose that is to be expect of a state facility.",
            "Asbestos aside, the dorm life is not bad. The buildings are clean and the people (as far as I have experienced) are more or less respectful of others, especially during stressful testing weeks.",
            "It really depends on the class. Some teachers are very strict and rigorous in their coursework while others are very lax.",
            "It's a big hippie school with a lot of free love among other things. The good news is that you don't need to follow those belief to fit in and make friends. Everyone is accepted for whoever they might be.",
            "It's an incredibly accepting school where anyone of any faith, sexual-orientation, gender-orientation, and style will find a place to fit in. Both students and staff are liberal in their thinking and that is apparent as one walks through campus and attends classes. There is a niche here for everyone."

There are great tours, and if you apply and get accepted there is an accepted students tour in April (which I attended last year and where I fell in love with the school)., 9679=I am enjoying New Paltz, for the most part. However, being a transfer student is a very unpleasant experience. First of all, there is no on campus housing if you transfer from another school. You have to find your own apartment or commute from home if you live close enough. Second, making my schedule at orientation was a nightmare. The majority of the classes had filled and there was no one on one advising. It was hard to know exactly what you needed to take, and even if you did know, the class probably was full. They were able to put me in some full classes, but they will not do that for certain courses, such as Psychology courses. Also, parking for commuters is much further than parking for residents and faculty/staff. The people here are very friendly, and there is a 2:1 ratio of residents to commuters, so fitting in is not extremely hard. The professors and staff are also very helpful., 264864=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 76433=VISIT!!! I know way too many people who just signed up to attend a school for 4 years without knowing what they were signing up for. these are often the people who end up needing to transfer or don't get what they want or need out of their college experience. This is your life. Be as involved in the process as you can afford to be. And something more specific to New Paltz is APPLY EARLY TO AVOID BEING TRIPLED. I applied in October for Early Action, which is non binding. This guaranteed that I would only have to share a room with one other person, as opposed to being tripled, which is when they have 3 people living in a room intended for 2 people (Theres 3 beds though! and it costs less money)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot This is my first semester at New Paltz and I do feel like I am learning a lot. It's a liberal arts college, so there is a great variety of choices of classes to suit you. My professors are all very intelligent and have great styles of teaching, so it's not just sitting in a lecture an hour every day. For my art class we actually take field trips to local museums. There is a lot of hand on work, not just listening to a lecture, which, in my opinion, makes for a better learning experience.
