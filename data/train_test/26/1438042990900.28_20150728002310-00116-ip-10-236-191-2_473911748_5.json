With this model, part data is stored in a hierarchical manner, and 3-D points in space define vertices. Two vertices define an edge, and a minimum of three edges define a face. The centerpiece of the data structure is the Edge List. This list stores information which relates the edges and faces to one another. The data structure is traversed by sequentially stepping through a Face List and retrieving information about each face from the Edge List.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The Undo function allows designers to sequentially undo previously performed design operations. At the start of every design operation, the entire Winged-Edge data structure is loaded onto a stack of a specified length. In addition to the sheet metal data structure, 3-D position and orientation information about the virtual input device is also pushed onto the Undo stack. Successive closings of the Undo button pop the stored data models off the stack and load them into the winged-Edge data structure for display. Depending on the stack length and complexity of the part, this method of implementing the Undo feature can consume large volumes of space in memory. Undo Function The Lock function allows designers to view the virtual sheet metal part from any orientation. Three dimensional information provided by the Polhemus sensor is used to build a transformation matrix which transforms every point in the data base incrementally from its old position and orientation, to its new. A general form of this transformation matrix is shown below: ##EQU4## where \u03c8, \u0398 and \u03c8 are the azimuth, elevation and roll edges, respectively, and Xtrans, Ytrans and Ztrans are translations along the three principle axes. The above 3\ufffd3 rotation matrix, shown in brackets, is actually the product of three 3\ufffd3 rotation transformation matrices--one for each simple rotation about the three axes. PHIGS builds this matrix by multiplying three rotation matrices in the following order: Z rotation,",
