Your LeopardBoard 365 now contains the UBL, uboot, kernel, and file system that was originally shipped on LeopardBoard 365 boards.  2.

LeopardBoard 365 GStreamer Pipelines contains instructions showing examples to demonstrate the hardware is working. Before running a capture pipeline you must be sure you have chained the video previewer, that could be done in two ways: Currently the v4l2src element has a build in property called chain-ipipe which by default is set to true. If you are not using v4l2src or you have disabled its chain-ipipe property you can chain it by using the ipiped application. Video initialization When you boot your board the RidgeRun logo will be displayed, in order to display video the following commands must be executed:  fbset -disable Output volume modification To increase/decrease the volume for audio playback (or other audio options) type  alsamixer and modify as desired. Using ipiped and AEW library Ipiped is a D-Bus server for controlling and configuring the camera sensor, the dm365 video processor and the aew library. It usually works together with the auto white balance and auto exposure (aew) library in order to give a better control of the quality of the image captured. You can find a Demo version",
