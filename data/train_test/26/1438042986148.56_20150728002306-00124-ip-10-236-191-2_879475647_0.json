    "textAfterTable": "19 Songs Album Review Westlife's debut album was like an appetizer at Jean-Georgs, compared to the fast-food boy band music shoveled out on 99-cent menus. Their sophomore album, Coast to Coast, brings about that feeling of being overstuffed by a fancy main course and being offered dessert. At that point the quality of food doesn't matter as much; you're ready for the check. Even the Mariah Carey duet sounds rehashed \u2014 is the best she would offer them a remake of her own remake of Phil Collins' \"Against All Odds\"? As was the case on their first album, the production quality is spectacular, so crystal clear that it makes the immaculate production of pop albums from just the last few years sound murky. The vocal talent here is powerful too \u2014 bet your life savings that when the group fades into oblivion at least one of them will be jolted to higher fame. It is a familiar sight \u2014 the trend that began with Take That, then shifted to Boyzone, then grasped by Westlife (who were mentored by Boyzone's Ronan Keating). It is as if the same group just keeps being reincarnated, but their age stays the same \u2014 perhaps this is the United Kingdom's version of Menudo. While the money-minders of the record labels may not have a vision",
