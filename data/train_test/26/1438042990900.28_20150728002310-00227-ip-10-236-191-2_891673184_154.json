While not everyone can score tickets (which go on sale every June and sell out within an hour), everywhere you go, you will pass by viewing parties. Other traditions focus on Bascom Hill, the stretch of land that was the original campus. From the 'Battle for Bascom' snowball fights (between Southeast and Lakeshore campus'), Tray sledding, studying under the shade of a tree on the first warm day, or rubbing Abe's foot for good luck, it's the place of tradition., 225606=Madison's cost are reasonable, although I heard that they will be raising tuition by $2000 every year. I didn't really get any financial aid except for an actuarial science scholarship, so I wish I could have gotten a little more help. But through internships and jobs I think the cost is manageable., 1037239=Apply during the first application window! I applied before in September, before the first deadline in October, and knew by early November that I had been accepted. Also, apply for the scholarships through your college in early February., 316538=I can not talk on dorm life as a personal experience, what I can say is my fellow classmates who live in dorms really do not complain much and the new state of the dorm building should be done for fall2012. It will be awesome. Plus plenty of opportunity to live off campus also., 973368=Lots of student orgs to join, may have to look around on the WIN website to find what you are interested in as there are so much and it is hard to find out about them all. May not be as close with the people in your org as you will other friends but that isn't true for all orgs on campus, 1101166=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 94332=Madison has a world-class faculty full of brilliant and interesting (my chemistry professor was in the 1992 Olympics) instructors. Also my first semester instructors were very open about providing help and keeping their office hours to explain any questions. Because it is a very intelligent and motivated student body, students push each other to learn.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Hannah from Andover, MN 07/07/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 27 out of 29 people found this review useful. 2 of 237 Categories Comments Great for these types of students I think this school is great for people who want to work hard to get into a good school and continue to work hard in college. I would not recommend this school for people who can get distracted easily. Tips for prospective students Apply early, I really believe this will increase your chances of getting accepted and will get you a response a lot faster so you can make your decision. Really work to get a high ACT score and writing a good admissions essay. Bang for the buck Although this school is rather pricey for a public school I feel that it is definitely worth it. People are always impressed when they hear that I go to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, so I know that a degree from here will get me a great career. Am enjoying",
