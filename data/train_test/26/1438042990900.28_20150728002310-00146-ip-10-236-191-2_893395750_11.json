            "Public Safety is there for you on the go. They really are fast and will in fact drive you to anywhere in the neighborhood late at night if you feel unsafe.",
            "GO OUT ON THE LAWN AND PARTICIPATE! It really is a wonderful experience.",
            "Being that Barnard is affiliated with Columbia University, all of the clubs and organizations you can think of exist on campus and it is because of them there is student life on campus.",
            "Midnight Breakfast- Breakfast for all Barnard and Columbia Students on the midnight before the first day of finals during both semesters. Breakfast with music and dancing offered by the President of the College, deans, and Professors.",
            "Go out to the city on weekends and weeknights, go to events on campus and on Columbia's campus.",
            "Hewitt Dining Hall is the only Dining Hall on Campus. This Dining Hall",
            "There are four Dorm buildings in the Quad, which is within the campus and there are several apartments for upperclassmen off campus. In the Quad, there is Sulzberger (the newest building), Reid, Brooks, and Hewitt (single dorms). The bathrooms are big and very clean. The hallways are always clean and very catchy on every floor. You have an RA and leader on every floor who come up with events for the floor every month and make life in the dorms worthwhile.",
            "In terms of the work-load, everything is doable and nothing is impossible. To be honest, it will be quite a transition for you from high school to College, but it will all fall into place. You're first-year experience will be pretty rough in that it will cause you a lot of stress trying to learn how to study for every course and how to manage your time quite well. The reason I rate this as 4 stars is because Barnard is indeed an ivy league and you will be asked to put in all the effort you need to put in to do really well, but with the help of the professors who are literally always there for you to support you. The resources on campus are there for your use, so take advantage of them.",
            "You may be homesick and you may find it difficult to adjust to the college life, however just stay open to everyone on your floor in the dorms and I promise you will have an unforgettable and amazing First-Year experience.",
            "Being part of an all Women's College in NYC provides me with various opportunities in the social aspect. With very enthusiastic women, you are able to get through your worst day with a smile on. The positive atmosphere you get from faculty and professors is your motivation."

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Going to Barnard, I think it is very important to learn how to find a balance between work and play. Academics are demanding, and you are surrounded by what tends to be a very motivated and driven student body. Because of this, students at Barnard sometimes get stressed out, and you need to learn how to handle this stress. Definitely make sure you find time to enjoy yourself and see New York! In three sentences Barnard college is one of the most unique college experiences that exist- partly because of it's location in NYC, partly because of the affiliation with Columbia, and partly because of its existence as a women's college. Being a part of Columbia is fantastic, but by also being part of a close knit liberal arts college, Barnard offers a much more supportive environment for it's students. Also, as a women's college, Barnard surrounds you with an amazing, driven group of extremely successful women- yet, because of the Columbia affiliation, you have the opportunity to have an entirely co-ed social life.
