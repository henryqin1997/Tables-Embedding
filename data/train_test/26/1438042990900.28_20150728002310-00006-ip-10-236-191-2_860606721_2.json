    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{11389=United States: Polygamy is illegal in all 50 states.[28] From about 1847 to 1857, in what is now the state of Utah, many Mormons practiced polygamy in defiance of the widespread view in the rest of the US. The US federal government threatened The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and made polygamy illegal through the enforcement of Acts of Congress such as the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act. The LDS Church formally abolished the practice in 1890, in a document labeled 'The Manifesto'.[29][30] Small splinter groups from the LDS Church, such as Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and the Apostolic United Brethren still practice polygamy and awareness has been increased through television dramas such as Big Love and reality shows such as Sister Wives., 8965=Canada: All forms of polygamy, and some informal multiple sexual relationships, are illegal under Section 293 of the Criminal Code of Canada. Bigamy is banned by Section 290. However, for a long time, the law banning polygamy has not been efficient. As of January 2009, no person had been successfully prosecuted, i.e. convicted, in over sixty years.[30] In 2009, two acquittals prompted the attorney general of British Columbia to ask the Supreme Court of British Columbia whether challenging the law was consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and, if so, under what circumstances people can be legally punished for polygamy.[31], 3180=Swaziland \u2013 While some have thought that current laws could be interpreted to allow for legally recognized polygamous unions, there is no legal recognition, still there are no laws against a man living with more than one woman, so the practice itself is not disallowed and even the king has thirteen spouses in 2010.[35], 19531=Kenya: Polygyny legal under legislation passed in 2014.[21], 7890=In November 2011 the court released its 335 pages long decision, which was that the polygamy abolition law is indeed constitutional, but that it should not be used to persecute minors for having taken part of a polygamous marriage.[32] Chief Justice Robert Bauman conceded that there is a conflict between this law and some civil right principles, but stated that there are other and \"more important\" issues which in this case take precedence. He wrote (as quoted by CBC news[32]):, 21226=Benin: Benin recognized polygamous marriages until 2004 when they were constitutionally outlawed. However, pre-existing marriages are currently still valid in Benin.[19], 26415=The United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand permit some benefits for spouses of polygamous marriages performed in other countries. India[Note 3] and Sri Lanka[10] allow polygamous marriages only among Muslim citizens. Many Indians have converted to Islam in order to bypass such legal restrictions.[11] Predominantly Christian nations usually do not allow polygamy, with a handful of exceptions such as the Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Zambia. Myanmar (also known as Burma) is also the only predominately Buddhist nation to allow for civil polygamous marriages.[12], 21733=Mayotte: Considered to be de facto illegal since a referendum sponsored by France in March 2009, forcing the island to comply with the French laws.[17][18] However, pre-existing Muslim marriages are currently still valid., 29868=Polygyny has been described as a form of human rights abuse. Many international human rights organizations, as well as women's rights groups in many countries, have called for its abolition.[1][2] In 2000, the United Nations Human Rights Committee considered polygamy (probably limited to polygyny) a violation of the internationally binding International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on the grounds that it violates the dignity of women, and recommended it be made illegal in all states.[3][4][5], 1947=In May 5, 2011 long-term cohabitation between non-married persons, in one incident with a man and two women, known as uni\u00e3o est\u00e1vel (\"stable union\"), was recognized as a family entity and granted all 112 rights of married couples \u2013 its only legal difference from marriage is that it does not change individual civil status from single to married. One of them, in Tup\u00e3, S\u00e3o Paulo, was registered as including a man and two women, as reported in August 2012. Doubts were thrown on its legality, as it was unclear whether it is in accordance with Brazilian law,.[37] It has not, however, set any precedence, and higher Brazilian courts have not permitted the practice.}",
