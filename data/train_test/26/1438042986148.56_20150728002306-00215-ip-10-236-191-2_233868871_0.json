            "Darrow1 - #25 Entering the graveyard only leads to bigger frights, but nothing is scarier than an enraged Paula. Unfortunately for Ness, this means being delegated to the \"damsel in distress\" while Paula gets the \"hardened action hero\" spot.",
            "Darrow1 - #26 A brief attempt at progressing through Threed ends in failure. ZOMBIE FAILURE.",
            "Darrow1 - #27 Ness discovers the true female form for the first time and also finds himself smack in the middle of the latest installment of Dateline's To Catch a Predator. The guy in the hat? Totally Chris Hansen.",
            "Darrow1 - #28 Following strangers can be very dangerous and a bad thing, but it can also be a very good thing. I guess what I'm trying to say is, sometimes prostitutes turn out to be members of a zombie army following a pure entity of evil. Tell that one to the police.",
            "Darrow1 - #29 Some people will stop at nothing to get in the spotlight and Jeff is one of those people. Fortunately for Ness and Paula, he's actually on their side and this is simply a plot device for humor's sake that will never be brought up again. It's like a filler episode, but condensed into a single panel!"
