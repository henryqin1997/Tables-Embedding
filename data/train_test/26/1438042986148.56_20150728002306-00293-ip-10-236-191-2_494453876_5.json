In this step, SASD sends the node ID and the real address to KMS who then generates a key ID, a key for use in communicating between the node's KMC and the KMS (\u201ca node key\u201d), and updates, the channel key for use in encrypting traffic on this particular channel (step 710). Additionally, KMS sends the key ID and node key to SASD and distributes the channel key to all KMCs on the channel as a new key because a node has just been added to the channel. SASD receives the key ID and the node key from KMS and returns it to SNlogin (step 712). After receiving the key ID and the node key from SASD, SNlogin starts a KMC for this node and transmits to the KMC the node ID, the key ID, the node key, the address of the VARPD that acts as the server for this Supernet, and the address of KMS (step 714). The KMC then registers with the KMD indicating the node it is associated with, and KMC registers with KMS for key updates (step 716). When registering with KMS, KMC provides its address so that it can receive updates to the channel key via the Versakey protocol. The Versakey protocol is described in greater detail in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communication, Vol. 17, No: 9, 1999, pp. 1614-1631. After registration, the KMC will receive key updates whenever a channel key changes on one of the channels that the node communicates over., 27135=U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/457,895, entitled \u201cCHANNEL-SPECIFIC FILE SYSTEM VIEWS IN A PRIVATE NETWORK USING A PUBLIC NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE,\u201d filed Dec. 10, 1999., 33156=Each address used by the VPN contains implicit information as to the delivery scheme (e.g., broadcast, mutlicast, or unicast) to use. For example, the well-known \u201c224.x.x.x\u201d IP range relates to multicast addresses. Some addresses are even bound to a designated interface. For example, the \u201c127.x.x.x\u201d IP range is bound to a loopback interface on the Internet. Forcing an address to be associated with a delivery method unnecessarily restricts addressing schema. In the example mentioned above, a destination address in the \u201c127.x.x.x\u201d range always refers to the loopback interface and can never be changed. Because of this limitation, it is extremely hard to experiment with new or different addressing schemes on a large scale. For example, IPv6, a new addressing scheme has yet to be fully deployed on the Internet because of the different addressing scheme. IPv6 is described in greater detail in \u201cftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2373.txt\u201d, 26966=U.S. patent application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patentzitate Although the present invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will know of various changes in form and detail which may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims and their full scope of equivalents. CONCLUSION . Each time web client 1102 requests a packet from web server 1104 a, the client requests the virtual address of the web server 1104 a from computer system 1106. If web server 1104 a becomes overloaded (e.g., unable to handle more requests), the overloaded web server spawns new instances of the same web server (web servers 1104 b and 1104 c) and at the same time notifies the computer system 1106. The VARP server of computer 1106 then associates the new instances 1104 b and 1104 c of the web server with web server's 1104 virtual address. As a result, web client 1102 is not notified of the change and continues to use the same virtual address as previously. FIGS. 7A and 7B Web client 1102 has a virtual address obtained from computer system 1106, as described in . A web client 1102 also connects to a computer system 1106 (containing a VARP server) using a network 1108. FIG. 9 illustrates a Supernet system 1100 that contains multiple web servers and a",
