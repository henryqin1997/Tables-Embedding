You can download and install modules to add more features to your Gallery, or you can disable features if you don't want to use them. In order to use a feature, you must install, configure (if necessary) and activate it. If you don't wish to use a feature, you can deactivate it. Modules If you're upgrading from Gallery 2.2.x or older, you should download one of the packages (above) and unpack it on top of your existing version and then open up your Gallery in your web browser. Gallery will prompt you with an interactive web based upgrader which will walk you through the upgrade process. Upgrades Looking for an older release of Gallery 2?
