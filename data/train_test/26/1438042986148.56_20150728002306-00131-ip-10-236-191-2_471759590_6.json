    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{192152=There are two secondary tables resident in shared memory 1202. This allows ACB state machine 311 to use one table while microprocessor 312 builds a second. As described above, a bit in the ACB state machine control register, which is controlled by microprocessor 312, controls which secondary table ACB state machine 311 accesses., 171403=Application control bus 360 is the only communication path between statistical multiplexer 300 and encoders 302-1 to 302-L. Transfer of information on application control bus 360 is divided into packet time intervals, where a packet time interval is defined as the time required to transmit one packet of data over communication channel 330. The time interval between the rising edges of two consecutive pulses 1301 and 1302, i.e., packet strobes, on packet strobe line PS (FIG. 13) defines the packet time interval. In this embodiment, communication channel 330 provides an external clock signal EXCLK. External clock signal EXCLK is divided down by statistical multiplexer 300 to generate the packet strobes on line PS. Hence, a packet strobe is generated by dividing clock ticks on external clock line EXCLK by the number of bits in a packet. Packet strobes are very accurate, very regular pulses., 193741=There are two general communications tables resident in shared memory 1204. This allows ACB state machine 311 to use one table while microprocessor 312 builds a second. A bit in the ACB state machine control register, which is controlled by microprocessor 312, controls which table ACB state machine 311 accesses., 158665=Interlace factor IF in distortion D is used to normalize the effects of interlacing in video sequences. Typical video encoders compress a sequence of pictures without regard to the field/frame structure of the sequence. However, the characteristic of frames originating from a video camera (typically at 50 or 60 fields/second) is different from that originating from a film source and converted to digital format (assuming that any 3:2 pulldown operations have been reversed). The former has what is commonly called \"interlace artifacts\" while the latter does not. Interlace artifacts are nothing more than motion between the two fields of a frame which is introduced because the two fields were captured at different time instants. Such inter-field motion does not exist between the fields of a frame originating from a film sequence because the two fields in this case are captured at the same time instant. It is for this reason that a typical video frame is harder to compress than a typical movie frame., 177429=Application 301-i must drive the number of bytes on bus DATA/ADR as determined by the time interval signal ENABLE is active. This means the enable latency and disable latency must be the same for any application, but the latency time may vary from one application to the next. When ADB time counter 1241 times out following a data transfer, ACB state machine 311 drives the signal on line ENABLE inactive and statistical multiplexer 300 enables the next data transfer by appropriate message cycles. Specifically, statistical multiplexer 300 waits at least time tEAS (FIG. 14 and Table V) before asserting address strobe signal AS., 151827=This process ensures that at no instant is the sum of all the applications' rates greater than the capacity of communication channel 330. However, there is a slight drop in channel utilization during first half interval 1020-1, because some applications may operate at a rate that is lower than the rate at which they would be serviced by statistical multiplexer 300. Specifically, in first half interval 1020-1, the rate for some applications may be decreased, i.e., the encoders for these applications start compressing at a lower rate than the old rate. However, until statistical multiplexer 300 implements the new packet schedule table, statistical multiplexer 300 continues to service the applications with lower rates at their old higher rates. This effect results in some underutilization of communication channel 330., 175885=Application bus clock CLOCK (FIG. 14) runs continuously. ACB state machine 311 asserts and deasserts signal ENABLE (FIGS. 13 and 14) synchronous with application bus clock CLOCK. Signal ENABLE stays active for the number of application control bus clock ticks equal to the number of bytes in a data packet. In this embodiment, ADB time counter 1241 starts to count the number of application control bus clock ticks upon signal ENABLE going active. When ADB time counter 1241 has counted the requisite number of clock ticks, a signal is generated to ACB state machine 311, which in turn drives signal ENABLE inactive., 165360=In one embodiment, statistical multiplexer 300 supports four distinct application control buses through application control bus interface circuit 1210. Multiple application control buses allows redundant applications 301-i to connect to statistical multiplexer 300 over redundant application control buses 360. If one of the redundant applications fails in a mode that corrupts its application control bus, another of the redundant applications can still send data to statistical multiplexer 300 over one of the other three application control buses., 187846=As mentioned above the primary table is kept in DRAM 1207. At the appropriate time, a DMA transfer is used to move the addressed entry in the primary table from memory 1207 to primary FIFO 1201. After the last entry of the primary table is transferred to primary FIFO 1201, the DMA controller is redirected to the first entry of the primary table. This cycle is continued until a new primary table is built in another section of DRAM. The DMA controller is directed to this new primary table when desired., 169524=Bit ComSel defines which general communication table in memory 1204 to use. When ComSel is set low ACB state machine 311 uses general bit communication table one., 166865=ACB state machine 311 is controlled by tables stored in memories 1201 to 1203 and 1207 and registers in state machine 311, both of which are configured by microprocessor 312. Tables used to control ACB state machine 311 include, in one embodiment, a static rate table stored in scratch DRAM 1207, a dynamic rate table stored in dual port memory 1202, and a general communication table stored in dual port memory 1204, each of which are described more completely below. ACB state machine 311 addresses memories 1202 to 1203 using address generator circuits 1222 to 1223 respectively. Of course, those skilled in the art will appreciate that address generator circuits 1222 to 1223 could be included within state machine 311., 169284=Bit NeedSel defines which of the two secondary tables in memory 1202 to use, as described below. When bit NeedSel is set low, ACB state machine 311 bit uses secondary table one., 165930=All four application control buses are driven in parallel with each application control bus having it's own set of drivers. Signals received from all four application control buses are logically \"ORed\" together in interface circuit 1210. Any application control bus can be disabled if a problem occurs with that application control bus., 195860=As indicated in step 401, statistical multiplexer 300 system supervisor tells statistical multiplexer 300 which applications 301-i to 301-L are in the system and how applications 301-2 to 301-L are configured. System supervisor 340 also provides a method of updating statistical multiplexer software. In this embodiment, statistical multiplexer 300 software revisions are downloaded over system supervisor bus to statistical multiplexer 300 and stored in non-volatile flash memory 1206., 179002=Statistical multiplexer 300 counts the number of bytes sent over application control bus 360 with ADB byte counter 1240. In this embodiment, ADB byte counter 1240 is a down counter that generates a signal to ACB state machine 311 if and when the correct number of bytes have been received., 151338=Applications switch rates at the first picture boundary encountered within switching interval 1020. Specifically, all applications whose new rate is lower than the old rate perform the rate switch first over first half interval 1020-1. Then, at the center of the switching interval, statistical multiplexer 300 switches to the new packet schedule. Finally, all applications, whose new rate is higher than the old rate, perform the switch in second half interval 1020-2., 174772=Message cycle time interval ACB is determined by an ACB time counter 1242 (FIG. 12). ACB time counter 1242 is started in response to a packet strobe on line PS. ACB time counter 1242 then counts a predetermined number of application control bus clock ticks, e.g., 40 bus clock ticks, and generates an output signal., 168854=Bit StFIFO is set by microprocessor 312 when the new primary table has been generated, and begun the DMA transfer of this table into FIFO 1201. When bit StFIFO is low, ACB state machine 311 can not perform the primary status message cycles described below, but ABC state machine 311 can perform the other application bus message cycles, described below., 179971=As indicated above, ACB state machine 311 controls application control bus 360 using information stored in tables in memory 311. ACB state machine 311 causes the appropriate address generator 1222 to 1223 to address an entry in the appropriate table that contains information to control operation of application control bus 360 or to enable transfer of information from primary FIFO 1201 to bus 360. Entries in each of the stored tables controls one of the message cycles shown in FIG. 13., 170479=Clearing bit ACBTimeMask disables the interrupt generated when ACB time counter 1242 times out. In this embodiment, this interrupt is not used and so this bit is set low., 79545=P is the channel packet size in bits (1040 bits in one embodiment);, 175107=In response to the output signal of ACB time counter 1242, ACB state machine 311 drives data strobe signal low and sets signal ENABLE active after at least time tDSE (FIG. 14 and Table V). (Note in FIG. 13 signal ENABLE is expanded and lines are used to relate the rising and falling edge of signal ENABLE to time interval ADB on the application bus.) Hence, the data transfer protocol is controlled by the appropriate message cycles and signal ENABLE. A data transfer cycle requires that the selected application was already tasked, through a message cycle, to be the next application to provide packet data. During a message cycle, statistical multiplexer 300 enables an application 301-i to drive data bus DATA/ADR the next time signal ENABLE is asserted., 170362=Clearing bit EmtyFIFOMask disables the interrupt normally generated when FIFO 1201 becomes empty., 164885=A more detailed block diagram of one embodiment of statistical multiplexer 300 is presented in FIG. 12. Statistical multiplexer 300 communicates with encoders 302-1 to 302-L and collects compressed application data for transfer to communication channel 330 using application control bus 360. In this embodiment, memory 313 (FIG. 3) includes a plurality of memories 1201 to 1203 and memories 1205 to 1207, each of which are described more completely below., 154117=FIG. 11 illustrates an alternative implementation with a shorter period 1150. In this embodiment, the encoder and decoder buffer sizes are \"large enough\", that the switching interval contains exactly one picture boundary of each application. The applications perform the switch to a higher or lower rate when they reach their picture boundary and statistical multiplexer 300 switches to the new packet schedule at the center of switching interval 1160. In this case, some applications may switch to a higher rate before the new packet schedule gets switched causing their buffer fullness to increase slightly. However, if the buffer sizes are large enough this should not be a problem, although extreme care needs to be taken to ensure proper tracking of the buffer status., 166296=Application control bus state machine 311 is positioned between application control bus interface circuit 1210 and microprocessor 312. In one embodiment, the functions described below of application control bus state machine 311 are implemented in a programmable gate array. Application control bus state machine 311, hereinafter ACB state machine 311, controls application control bus 360 through interface circuit 1210 and so minimizes the effect of bus operations on microprocessor 312, which in one embodiment is a Motorola 68302 microprocessor., 192502=The last message cycle in message cycle interval ACB of a packet time is for general communications between statistical multiplexer 300 and applications 302-1 to 320-L. This table is built by microprocessor 312 and kept in shared memory 1203., 191212=Hence, the allocation of packets using the primary and secondary tables now becomes a two-tier approach. The flow for this process is illustrated in FIG. 18. ACB state machine 311 in step 1802 first examines the entry in primary FIFO 1201. If the current packet is allocated to a fixed rate application, the packet is offered to that application and the pointer for the primary table is advanced by one (modulo the total number of entries). However, if the packet is allocated to a variable rate application, as indicated by the null code in the primary table, null code check 1803 passes control to step 1805 and ACB state machine 311 checks the secondary table to see which variable rate application is allocated the current packet. After offering the packet to the variable rate application, the pointers for both the primary and secondary tables are advanced by one (modulo their respective total number of entries)., 186468=As explained above, the primary table, which is defined at configuration time and is stored in memory 1207, divides a predetermined time interval into packet times. Each packet time in the predetermined time interval is allocated an entry into the primary table. Each entry in the primary table is an address that specifies which application 301-i is allocated this packet time. Since the primary table allocates bandwidth at a resolution down to one packet per second, the primary table, in one embodiment, has (39 Mbits/sec), the statistical multiplexer output rate, times (1/1024 packet/bits) or 29,297 entries., 153246=Statistical multiplexer 300 operates in a cyclic manner with the events within period 1050 being continually repeated. The length of period, as shown in FIG. 10, is not indicative of any real time performance. Indeed, the only conclusion that should be drawn from this figure (and the next) regarding timing is that the bulk of the time during a statistical multiplexer period is spent in building the packet schedule table and that the other aspects of this invention are executed in a relatively short time. The actual time required to execute each process of this invention is dependent on the computational power available in statistical multiplexer 300. However, note that there is a minimum value beyond which the period cannot be decreased because, at the least, the period should include switching interval 1020, which is 2/29.97 seconds long., 150455=The solution to this problem is not to perform the switch to the new rates of all applications 301-i and to the new packet schedule at the same time instant, but to perform the switch over a non-zero interval of time, referred to as switching interval 1020 (FIG. 10). Switching interval 1020 is chosen such that all applications 301-i are guaranteed to have at least one picture boundary within switching interval 1020. In FIG. 10, tick marks 1001 to 1010 represent frame boundries which in the case of NTSC input have a frequency of 30 Hz, actually 29.97 Hz. Window 1050 starts at arrow 1051 and ends at arrow 1052. Modify rates step 403 is completed over time interval 1060. Build packet table step 404 is completed over time interval 1070 and pass rates step 405 over time interval 1080. The length of switching interval 1020, in this case, is 2/29.97 seconds.}",
