It is a very different reading experience in comparison and reminds me of the gothicy romantic suspense novels I glommed back in the 80s and 90s--Joan Aiken or Frances Murray and other similar authors (but with more sex). The only similarity (so far) from KAs other series seems to be the drinking. But, I'm enjoying the difference and think I will read the rest in the series if they continue to be as enjoyable as this one has been. I usually dislike the inclusion of a ghost element...it just doesn't work for me...but this one is not bothering me so far. ...more",

Being an ocean mad child, I would have loved this book. Great artwork and easily understood illustrations and written material gives a great overview of what (unfortunately not enough) we know about Great Whites.

I have to admit however that I'm not going to share this with my little nieces until they're older. I'm afraid we'd come down on the side of Team Elephant Seal. (Ano Nuevo all the way!)
