            "There's stuff in this town for everyone but especially if you're outdoorsy! Skiing, hiking, biking, camping, snowboarding, and of course the water sports out on the lakes and rivers. It's a blast.",
            "The food, most of it anyway, is delicious! There's not usually very nutritious options but if worst comes to worst you can always have a salad. They always have lots of variety and different things.",
            "I was given the privilege of being in the nicest dorm with the biggest rooms - Hapner Hall. There's so many events and fun things going on all the time. It would be nice if I wasn't scheduled to work during almost every single one! It's always fun and exciting to live here.",
            "It's so academically challenging. The classes are always interesting and fun and the professors are great. They're always ready and willing to help and to answer all of the questions you have.",
            "Make sure you bring a bike or you will never make it to class on time. Study hard! It's not a good feeling when you get online to see your grades and you find out you got a low score on your Exams. Put school above anything else in your life and you won't regret it.",
            "It's an amazing school full of so many great opportunities. This school offers so many things for any different type of student. My only complaint is the ridiculously low amount of parking spaces!"

Students run a 5k race in their underwear every November., 585210=If you love to ski/snowboard, and I mean REALLY love the snow, MSU is the place for you. In my first year here, there has been snow cover since november with temps in the -20s. Great, friendly people, and a great atmosphere for learning with lots of outlets for help in every class., 153188=Bring warm clothes! It's a lot colder starting in September than I would have imagined., 512599=If you like the outdoors, MSU is the place for you! Almost every one here rides a bike, skateboards, hikes, skis, snowboards, or all of the above! Also, MSU has a great engineering program, ranking very high in the US. There will also be a new business college in 2015 that focuses especially on those looking into entrepreneurship!, 543495=Get a good winter coat. Bozeman is sunny and beautiful all through september and most of october but after that the temperature drops rapidly, the snow flies, and the skiers come out of hibernation, 217645=There is an undies run in September where everyone goes running in their underwear even when it's snowing., 11810=If you are looking for great research or internship opportunities this is the place to be. Montana State is within the Nation's top tier for this! If you are a minority this would be a great place to go if interesting in the hard sciences, math, engineering, etc. But I would also like to add that with the past few years MSU lost about 9 million in funding. This is significant because programs across campus have been cut completely, some altered(budget cuts), some merged into other programs, and some may lose all funding in 2012., 20575=No doubt, I am learning a ton! The vacations are longer: Winter break is 17-Jan11 and summer starts May 5. Despite these relatively short semesters, the professors pile on the homework and I think that they truly care about theit students., 82463=They start placing people into the residence halls as soon as March so sign up early for housing in order to get the placement you want. Make sure to ask questions because everyone is willing to answer but they won't really double check to make sure everyone is doing fine. Talk to your professors.}",

And ask questions during your visit. Also, be aware that it gets quite cold here, so you'll want warm clothes, and if you're not a snow and freezing temperatures person, you might not like it here. It is beautiful in the winter though! Bang for the buck MSU is amazing. The classes aren't huge, so it's easier to know a lot or all the people in your class, and it makes the professor and one-on-one time more accessible, which is a big plus. You are also provided with so many resources: the library has a person for pretty much every department who can help you do research or find what you're looking for, there's a Math Learning Center if you need more help in math, there's",
