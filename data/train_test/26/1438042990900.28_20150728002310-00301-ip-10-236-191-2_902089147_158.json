            "Recently there have been some problems with attempted robberies and rapes on campus. But they have increased the security provided on campus during nighttime hours. There are also emergency phones located in various areas on campus. The university sends out text and email alerts if something occurs on campus or close to campus so that the students are aware of it.",
            "Greek life is a big part of UF's campus. The Greek dominated political party is currently the majority of the student government. There are a lot of fraternities and sororities to chose from that offer different things and is a good way to meet people and get involved.",
            "There is a club for everything on uf's campus! If you are outgoing enough to attend club meetings and meet new people, then you will be able to find a club that interests you. Every college also has a student club that can help you build your resume, meet people with similar career goals, and volunteer in your field of interest.",
            "UF is great for students who can find themselves and stand out in a large population. Students should be independent and not afraid to ask for help from professors that teach hundreds of students in one class section. Also ideal for students who want to escape cold climates.",
            "Lake Alice is home to many alligators and at night you can find a bunch of red eyes popping out of the water. The bat house is a popular spot to spend sundown to watch the bats fly out of the house to hunt at night.",
            "Tuition is reasonable for in-state students and many scholarships are available through each college. You get an Ivy League education in Florida by attending UF. Free tutoring is available with alot of other free resources for studs to to utilize to have fun or to study.",
            "The university is known for it's sports and attending football and basketball games are a student must. Midtown and downtown are the most popular nightlife areas featuring a variety of bars, restaurants, and dance clubs. Downtown clubs often have famous DJs guest play. There is also Lake Wauburg, a lake that belongs to the university in which students can paddleboat, kayak, lounge on the beach area, or picnic. They offer equipment for these activities for free with a student ID and each student can bring up to four guests. There are two movie theaters that offer different movies at each and often keep movies in theaters longer than most theaters so you have a longer time period to go see them. Ginnie springs is a popular area to go tubing with friends. And the Accent club often brings in celebrity speakers, free for students to attend.",
            "The food on campus does not offer the healthiest options. Pollo Tropical, Papa Johns, Burger King are among the choices found at the student union and other food spots on campus. There are healthier options such as Subway and Croutons, but these options are the minority. The dining halls offer a variety of different options for all courses and is buffet style so you can take some to go. Sit down restaurants and other food options are in very close proximity to campus.",
            "The university has continually made an effort to update dorms. The newly updated dorms include special services such as massages at the health themed dorm. The older dorms that have not been updated are still quite old. Most dorms have community bathrooms except a select few dorms that are either apartment style or reserved for honors students or athletes.",
            "It is rumored that the coursework is of the hardest difficulty of all universities in Florida. As a UF student I can attest to the challenging exams, labs, and amount of coursework required by professors. The coursework is extremely challenging but there are free tutoring services, teaching assistants, professor office hours, and commercial tutoring services that can help you achieve your desired grade. The professors do expect you to put in a lot of time outside of class to learn the material to pass exams.",
            "When applying, make sure to include all extracurricular activities and volunteer opportunities. They want to accept well-rounded students. If you have already been accepted, make sure to get involved in a club as soon as possible. Getting involved early will help you to make friends with people who share common interests and career goals, make connections with faculty and potential employers, and spend time participating in activities outside of schoolwork.",
            "With over 50,000 students enrolled annually, The University of Florida is a diverse college in consideration of it's students, faculty, and areas of study. With 16 colleges, any student can find something that they want to pursue as a career. It is a great school for students seeking the large university setting."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors. Aim for an SAT and ACT score within their middle 50% (somewhere between a 1900 and 2100 for the SAT and 27-31 for the ACT) or better, and make sure to take many rigorous classes in high school. Also, show a passion for attending UF in your essays or elsewhere on your application., 582346=i guess we're safe... there's blue emergency lights scattered around the campus, a separate police dept for uf, and scan-card dorms, but rapings and suspects with guns have been reported to the students via email and text just in fall 2011. oh and some shots fired... but i haven't seen anything, which is good. just make smart choices. the person who got raped, got in the car for a ride to campus with an elderly male she didn't know., 613241=there is so much to do at the university of florida! in the reitz union there is a game room with a bowling alley which is always a lot of fun. uf also has gator nights every friday night, where students can go to the reitz union for free and partake in a bunch of activities including midnight breakfast. they also show movies in the reitz union on fridays. there are also about 1000 clubs at uf as well as multiple sororities and fraternities. lastly the gator nation is very big on football. there's nothing like being in the swamp cheering on the gators with your gator family., 911913=There are numerous blue light emergency posts everywhere on campus, and guarantee police assistance within 60 seconds of when the button was pushed. A free snap transportation service is provided, which gives students a ride anywhere on campus after 3:00 AM., 49808=UF is one of the top 50 universities in the US and a great education for a tuition of about $4000 a year and housing is about $2000 for each semester is an amazing deal. If you received Bright Futures you really only have to pay for housing (and of course books and food.) UF also has many research opportunities with top-rated professors available for undergraduates., 48916=Apply as early as possible, way before the November 1st deadline. The earlier you apply, the earlier you can apply for housing (if you are planning on living on campus.) I find that living on campus is really convenient, where you can literally wake up ten minutes before your class and still make it. Off campus has it's perks but it costs about the same as on campus housing and you have to take the bus (which are often times always late.) I suggest living on campus for at least your first year. Also, UF seems to emphasize this quite a lot but GET INVOLVED! Try something new! Get new experiences!, 820345=There are over 1000 student organizations, if we don't have the one you are looking for it is extremely easy to create one yourself., 611633=the university of florida has about 1000 clubs with everything from a quidditch team to clubs for intramural sports., 939581=Dorms are not my thing. I stayed in them and sharing a bathroom with many girls is not what I enjoy. A plus for dorms is that you can meet a lot of people and you are right on campus so classes will be closer, as long as your 7:30 class isn't on the opposite side of campus, you will be able to enjoy every second of sleep., 502966=The campus is gorgeous (besides the weather in August and September, but that's horrible everywhere in Florida)! For being such a large university, it's really easy to get involved in organizations., 322695=The French Fries is a favorite sculpture near the Marston Science Library done by artist John Henry that was placed on campus in February 1989. Though the actual name of the piece is Alachua, named for the county which the city of Gainesville calls home, it still remains a notorious landmark often referred to when giving directions to campus visitors and Freshman. Another popular sculpture around campus, The Potato, is located near Turlington Hall and serves as a popular meeting point. Krishna Lunch, a full vegetarian meal, is served daily in the Plaza of the Americas for dirt cheap, and it is delicious!, 246201=Home to almost 1000 campus organizations, UF offers something for every student that attends. From greek life to skydiving to intramurals, almost anything you can think of will probably exist at the University., 172699=Like I previously mentioned, there are almost 1000 clubs and just about anything you can think of. There are tons of intramural sports and workout facilities all over campus!}",
