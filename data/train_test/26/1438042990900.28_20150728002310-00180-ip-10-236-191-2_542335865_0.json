Now that more than a year has gone by, what has been the impact on LGBT older adults? Did discriminatory policies change at the drop of a dime? If not, why not? What challenges remain? And what legal and policy advocacy must still be pursued in\u00a0Windsor\u2018s aftermath? In other words, how can we pair litigation and policy advocacy to improve the lives of those who long fought to improve our lives?, 25435=Even as science and medicine work to reduce the prevalence of HIV in society, HIV-positive individuals continue to face unfair treatment and discrimination. A\u00a02009 Kaiser Family Foundation study\u00a0found that significant portions of the population report they are not comfortable with an HIV-positive co-worker (23%), a child\u2019s teacher (35% of parents), or roommate (42%), and fully half (51%) of adults say they would be uncomfortable having their food prepared by someone who is HIV-positive. As a result of the still-rampant ignorance and prejudice surrounding the disease and its transmission, people living with HIV often must seek out skilled advocates to vindicate their rights in court. From employment discrimination to reproductive health rights to privacy and more, people living with HIV face unique challenges in the courts. A better understanding of the cases and trends in HIV litigation is essential to promoting the effective representation of people living with HIV by current and future litigators., 30158=Saturday, August 23 | 1:30pm \u2013 3:00pm}",
