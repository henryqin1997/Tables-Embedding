            "Campus police are friendly, but strict. They ensure that campus is a safe place to be, and I have never felt in danger in any way while at school.",
            "CSM has countless clubs, everything from Democrat and Republican clubs to bouldering and fencing clubs. Additionally, there are numerous academically rigorous clubs, such as Tau Beta Pi, which is an engineering honor society.",
            "CSM is great for dedicated students who want to make a difference in the world of science and engineering.",
            "During Freshman orientation, students have the option of hiking up lookout mountain to place a rock on the large M on the mountain. This tradition is unique to Mines, and a fun bonding experience for new students.",
            "I believe that CSM is actually ranked number one in the country in this category, with most graduates (greater that 90%) attaining high-paying jobs in their field of study.",
            "There are numerous outdoor activities in Golden, CO for students to participate in. These activities include biking, hiking, rock-climbing, hang-gliding, and tubing down Clear Creek. The night-life in Golden is limited, yet still fun for a small town in the mountains. Also, many ski resorts are close by for weekend getaways to the mountains, which are very popular.",
            "The food at CSM has improved since I was a Freshman, when it was notoriously greasy and unhealthy. I have not been to the dining hall since I was a Freshman, but I know that the school started using a different vendor for food. Since this change has been made, I have heard nothing but positive things about the food and dining options on campus. Additionally, two new coffee shops opened recently on campus, including a Starbucks.",
            "Students are not required to live in the dorms for the first year of college, which is atypical for colleges in Colorado. However, a majority of the students choose to live in the dorms for the first year. This allows students to bond with their classmates and completely immerse themselves in the college environment.",
            "Colorado School of Mines is internationally recognized as one of the best institutions for education in engineering and applied sciences. I believe that the academic rigor exemplifies this. Students are expected to work hard in order to be the intelligent and forward-thinking scientists of the next generation.",
            "I would recommend being prepared to work significantly harder than in high school. If you know what to expect, I think students will be rewarded with an immense amount of knowledge and expertise, as well as an appreciation for higher education beyond undergraduate studies. Additionally, I would recommend that students get involved. There is an enormous quantity of clubs and organizations, as well as intramural sports, for students to participate in.",
            "CSM is an academically intense institution. The faculty is incredible and extremely knowledgable in their area of expertise. Despite the rigorous curriculum, students retain active lifestyles and are involved in numerous clubs and organizations."

However, they are adding more food options starting spring semester 2015., 312852=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 261095=E-DAYS! First week of April the school throws a concert and other fun things., 45114=as far as dorm life is concerned, the school of mines has many options and a great variety of student living. there are four traditional halls, which is 'traditional' living, meaning you have a roommate (note: you can live in your own room in the traditionals, it's just a limited option), there are community bathrooms, (sinks, toilets, and 4 private showers per floor). there are also many other options, including mines park (apartment-style living about a ten minute walk from campus, (still owned and policed by the school though)), weaver towers, (suite-style living, where you have up to 5 suite-mates, share a living area, 2 private bathrooms (with showers), and can live in a closet-sized space pretty much. and finally, there is maple hall, the brand new residence hall on campus, finished the summer of 2011 and in it's first year of use, (the academic year of fall 2011-spring 2012). in maple, there are many options, you can live by yourself in a single, live with another, (one roommate), or live in a suite, where you share a bathroom with two other suite mates, but they live on the other side of the bathroom., 98231=study up on your algebra, trigonometry, and if possible, calculus, before you start your freshman year. when you take physics 1, you will be surprised at how many integrals you have to do. also, don't think that you won't be writing just because the application doesn't require an essay. brush up on your grammar and spelling, because you will have to do quite a lot of writing just for the core classes., 59447=If you decide to become an engineering major then the School of Mines is definitely worth your money. You have a 14:1 teacher rating which means lots of 1 on 1 attention. The school is challenging, but well respected throughout the engineering world which is helpful in acquiring jobs after college., 35818=In my opinion this is where Mines really needs a lot of improvement. The school is terribly expensive, and while there are quite a few scholarships available from the school it is still much to high priced. The main reason that I don't feel that it is worth as much a I am paying is because monetary waste can be seen all over campus, from brand new landscaping around the president's house as tuition goes up $1000 a semester to the absurd amount of vice-presidents and the huge mess of bureaucracy that slows everything down to a painfully slow crawl., 110307=Slate was TERRIBLE my freshman year (2007-2008), but I've heard that it has improved substantially with the new vendor., 235994=Entering in the Fall 2013 so am not able to rate this fairly but what I have seen and heard about dorm life it will be fine., 16267=I enjoy being at Mines because the school focuses on my favorite subjects, math and sciences. Its not like high school where the students are here just to be here, like other colleges; Mines students care about their education and what they get out of it when at school. Its true, the nerdy vibe that Mines gives off, but the environment encourages more than just studying. The campus is very open and the school itself wants the students to have a rounded life. On Thursday nights the school sponsors a movie night and the ORC rents out equipment for activities such as boarding, skiing, camping, and tubing. I live so close to the mountains now, every weekend I go up and board. The city of Golden is cute and very friendly, but there are several, i guess, entertainment areas near by such as Colorado Mills mall and Belmar shopping center.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Even though I just said that Mines is super hard, there really is a lot of fun to be had. There are so many clubs that a person can join, it made my head spin. The community in the dorms is tight knit and friendly. Even as a freshman living off campus, I find plenty of ways to have fun and hang out with other people. Am learning a lot I would definitely say I'm learning a lot. As is par with the idea of Mines being super hard and everyone always doing homework, there is always work to do and new material to be learned. The material is very interesting, though, and thoroughly engaging.
