The resulting structure is illustrated in FIG. 2B. Preferably, the copper seed layer 15 is formed using a vapor deposition technique, such as CVD or PVD. In order to have adequate adhesion and copper coverage, a relatively thick (1000 Angstroms) copper seed layer is usually required. Such a thick seed layer leads to problems with close-off of small geometry trenches, however, when a PVD deposition process is employed for applying the seed layer., 33611=For each interconnect path, signal propagation delay may be characterized by a time delay \u03c4. See E. H. Stevens, Interconnect Technology, QMC, Inc., July 1993. An approximate expression for the time delay, \u03c4, as it relates to the transmission of a signal between transistors on an integrated circuit is given below., 35148=To meet the foregoing criterion, copper interconnect lines within a low-Ke dielectric will likely replace aluminum-alloy lines within a silicon oxide dielectric as the most preferred interconnect structure. See \u201cCopper Goes Mainstream: Low-k to Follow\u201d, Semiconductor International, November 1997, pp. 67-70. Resistivities of copper films are in the range of 1.7 to 2.0 \u03bc\u03a9cm.; resistivities of aluminum-alloy films are in the range of 3.0 to 3.5 \u03bc\u03a9cm., 31704=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/694,413, filed Oct. 23, 2000, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/045,245, filed Mar. 20, 1998, U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,181, 46457=Preferably, the seed layer enhancement process continues until a sidewall step coverage, i.e., the ratio of the seed layer thickness at the bottom sidewall regions 22 to the nominal thickness of the seed layer at the exteriorly disposed side 23 of the workpiece, achieves a value of at least 10%. More preferably, the sidewall step coverage is at least about 20%. Such sidewall step coverage values are present in substantially all of the recessed structures of the semiconductor workpiece. It will be recognized, however, that certain recessed structures distributed within the semiconductor workpiece may not reach these sidewall step coverage values. For example, such structures disposed at the peripheral edges of a semiconductor wafer may not reach these step coverage values. Similarly, defects or contaminants at the situs of certain recessed structures may prevent them from reaching the desired coverage values. The nominal thickness of the enhanced seed layer at the exteriorly disposed side of the workpiece is preferably in the range of 500 angstroms 1600 angstroms.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Numerous modifications may he made to the foregoing system without departing from the basic teachings thereof. Although the present invention has been described in substantial detail with reference to one or more specific embodiments, those of skill in the art will recognize that changes may be made thereto without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. In operation, vapor deposition tool/tool set 95 is utilized to apply an ultra-thin copper seed layer over at least portions of semiconductor workpieces that are processed on line 90. Preferably, this is done using a PVD application process. Workpieces with the ultra-thin seed layer are then transferred to tool/tool set 100, either individually or in batches, where they are subject to electrochemical seed layer enhancement at, for example, processing station 110. Processing station 110 may be constructed in the manner set forth in FIG. 3. After enhancement is completed, the workpieces are subject to a fall electrochemical deposition process in which copper metallization is applied to the workpiece to a desired interconnect metallization thickness. This latter process may take place at station 110, but preferably occurs at for processing station 115 which deposits the copper metallization in the presence of an acidic plating bath. Before transfer to station 115, the workpiece is preferably rinsed in DI water at station 112. Transfer of the wafers between stations 110, 112, and 115 may",
