    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention is not limited to the embodiments described but may be varied in construction and detail. It will be appreciated that the access node of the invention essentially provides a service management framework to allow network operators to use the various and disparate services available on the Internet to provide valuable services to mobile subscribers. These services are provided in a manner which allows simple, easy-to-use, and personalised user interaction. The modular structure of the node also allows simple accommodation of developments in bearer-side and Internet-side technologies. The WTA server may send a Service Indication representing a network event to the WTA user agent. A network event received by the handset (e.g. incoming call) is transformed into a WTA event in the user agent. WTA services may be mobile-originated (for example check voicemail) or network-initiated (for example voicemail alert). To initiate a WTA service from the mobile handset, the WTA user agent simply accesses the appropriate URL corresponding to the desired service. The URL may be accessed in the local repository (for frequently used WTA services) or on the WTA server via the WAP gateway. Network-initiated services may be invoked in two ways: Initiating WTA Services The WTA server is a web server delivering content requested by a client. The WTA user agent uses URLs to reference content on the WTA server. A URL may be used to reference an application (e.g. a CGI script",
