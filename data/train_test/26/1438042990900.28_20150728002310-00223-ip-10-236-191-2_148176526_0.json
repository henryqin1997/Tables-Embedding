The top-of-the-table Pride will travel to BMD Kougari Oval to face a Wynnum Manly side who have been quietly going about their business to hold a strong footing in the top five. They have won their past five matches in a row - including last weekend's fiery 28-10 win over Burleigh. The Pride were big 52-18 winners over Norths in round 20 - with Blake Leary and Tyrone McCarthy both scoring doubles. Despite the result, coach Jason Demetriou has called for more from his interchange players and this week has added Tom Hancock to an extended bench. For Wynnum, forward Chris McLean comes onto the bench, while Tanu Wulf will start in place of David Stagg. This will also be the 100th match for Seagulls second rower Jon Grieve, who has also played with the Sunshine Coast in the past, winning the premiership with them in 2009. The Seagulls have a strong home record this year and have won nine of their 10 games at BMD Kougari Oval. This weekend the club are also offering a special deal to their junior club affiliates. For every junior player that wears their club colours, parents will receive half-price admission ($5)., 20249=After his electric performance for Easts last weekend, Ipswich Jets fans will be relieved that boom Melbourne Storm fullback Cameron Munster won't be lining up against their side at Langlands Park on Sunday. Munster has been named to play for the Storm's NYC Under 20s team instead of the Tigers, who thrashed Redcliffe 52-16. Munster scored two tries, ran the ball 23 times for a total of 185m, made two line breaks and 15 tackle busts to claim the XXXX man of match honours. Easts have named Eddie Tautali as the replacement for Munster at fullback. Easts coach Craig Ingebrigtsen is sweating on a final fitness report on 2013 Courier Mail medallist Cody Walker, who hopes to make his long-awaited comeback from a hamstring injury against the Jets. The Tigers have had the wood on the Jets in recent times, having only lost once to Ipswich in their past seven matches. In their first encounter earlier this year, big prop Mitch Garbutt inspired Easts to a 22-12 victory at the North Ipswich Reserve., 23566=REDCLIFFE DOLPHINS v MACKAY CUTTERS Dolphin Oval on Sunday, July 27 - 2pm Referee: Robert Gallacher Head to Head: Redcliffe 6 Mackay 6 Drawn 1 Twitter: #intrustsupercup #PHINSvMC, 30885=TWEED HEADS SEAGULLS v CQ CAPRAS Piggabeen Sports on Sunday, July 27 - 2pm Referee: Chris Anderson Head to Head: Tweed 16 Central 6 Drawn 1 Twitter: #intrustsupercup #THSvCQC, 28061=\u2018Dobbo' says: CQ really played tough at home against the Jets last weekend. It is super important for them to really turn up against Tweed this weekend or it could be a half century. The Tweed are fresh from a bye and ready to rumble, while the end of the season can't come quick enough for the Capras. Effort has never been an issue from the men of CQ but the travel and injuries have played a huge toll on their 2014 campaign.

The Seagulls have gone 11 games without a loss and in their most recent game before last weekend's bye - they went on an early attacking spree against the PNG Hunters in their 60-28 win. The Capras however are coming off a 34-14 loss against the Jets, where they let an early 4-0 lead slip with some poor handling. There are many factors stacked against the Capras this weekend, with Tweed having won the past seven games between these two sides. Adding to this, the Capras' only win at Piggabeen came back in 2003. In team news for the visitors, the Capras have made a number of late changes to the team named on Tuesday due to injury concerns. Three players - Rajan Opetaia-Halls, Mitch Hallinan and Garrett Field - are set to make their debuts for the club on Sunday. Named at prop, this will be the 50th\u00a0Cup game for Peter Gallen, who has previously played for the Sunshine Coast. For the Seagulls, Sam Irwin returns from injury into the halves, while Cody Nelson is back from suspension and has been named in the back row., 35855=SCORES & LADDERS:\u00a0click here for our Queensland Cup 2014 page., 27407=SOUTHS LOGAN MAGPIES v NORTHS DEVILS Davies Park on Sunday, July 27 - 2pm* (Live on Channel 9/WIN/NBN) Referee: Nick Morel Head to Head: Norths 23 Souths Logan 13 Twitter: #intrustsupercup #SLMvDEVILS}",
