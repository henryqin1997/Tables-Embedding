    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{14034=Since its passage, the State of California has adopted significant changes in criminal justice policies that directly impacted SB 678\u2014most notably the 2011 Public Safety Realignment, which reduced the number of probationers eligible for revocation to state prison and created two new groups of offenders subject to local supervision. In order to maintain effective incentives and account for the significant changes in criminal justice policy, SB 85, adopted as a trailer bill to the 2015\u20132016 State Budget, revises the SB 678 funding formula and creates a funding methodology that should serve as a long-term formula. Prior to the adoption of SB 85, the state adopted temporary measures., 13456=SB 678, the California Community Corrections Performance Incentives Act of 2009, established a system of performance-based funding that shares state General Fund savings with county probation departments that reduce their probation failure rate (PFR), originally defined in statute as the number of adult felony probationers who are revoked to state prison in a year as a percentage of the average probation population during the same period. At the center of SB 678 is the use of evidence-based practices to improve public safety and incentive based funding., 21316=The SB 678 legislation mandates consistent monitoring and reporting of program implementation and requires county probation departments to report information on the use of evidence-based practices and probationer outcomes to the Administrative Office of the Courts (renamed Judicial Council July 29, 2014) to ensure the program is having its intended effect.The following reports from the Judicial Council and one from the Pew Center on the States provide information on implementation and program findings. In summary:, 25125=The Impact of California\u2019s Probation Performance Incentive Funding Program Pew Center on the States, February 2012, 15440=If a county\u2019s RPR is less than or equal to the original statewide baseline of 7.9%, the county will receive a percentage of its highest SB 678 payment from the period between program inception and FY 2014\u20132015. Depending on how a county\u2019s RPR compares to statewide RPRs, a county can receive between 40 and 100% of its highest payment. The statewide RPRs and percentages of savings are defined as follows:, 22584=To take the impact of public safety realignment into account, county jail and prison revocations were summed to calculate the total number of revocations in 2012 and 2013.}",

Depending on how a county\u2019s RPR compares to statewide RPRs, a county can receive between 40 and 100% of its highest payment. The statewide RPRs and percentages of savings are defined as follows: The first funding component measures each county\u2019s performance against statewide failure rates. Each county\u2019s return to prison rate (RPR), which equals the number of individuals on felony probation, mandatory supervision, and PRCS sent to prison as a percentage of the total supervised population, is compared to statewide RPRs since the original SB 678 baseline period (2006\u20132008).",
    "textAfterTable": "Funding Component #2: Comparison of each county\u2019s return to prison rate and its failure rate in the previous year The second funding component is based upon how each county performs in comparison to the previous year. Each year a county\u2019s RPR from the previous year is applied to its current year\u2019s felony supervised populations to calculate the expected number of prison revocations. If a county sends fewer individuals on felony supervision to prison than the expected number, the county will receive 35% of the state\u2019s costs to incarcerate an individual in prison multiplied by the number of avoided prison stays. The number of avoided prison revocations are calculated separately for each felony supervised population (i.e. felony probation, mandatory supervision, PRCS). For example, if a county had a 3.2% RPR for its felony probation population in 2013 and 10,000 people on felony probation in 2014, its expected number of felony probation prison revocations in 2014 would be 320. If only 300 felony probationers were actually sent to prison in 2014, the county avoided sending 20 individuals to prison and would receive 35% of the state\u2019s cost to imprison these 20 individuals. In order to continue to receive funds under this component, probation departments must continually reduce their return to prison rates year after year. Funding Component #3: $200,000 minimum payment The third funding component guarantees a minimum payment of $200,000 to support ongoing implementation of evidence-based practices.
