            "Simmons is great for strong, independent women who don't mind being in a classroom with other intelligent women. It is also a great place if you are not the biggest party goer and just want to relax and watch movies or stay in on the weekend. Simmons is small and has a great community, so if you want to meet and stay close to as many people as you can, Simmons is great!",
            "One tip is to definitely plan financially! College is so expensive and you don't realize it until you start taking out loans. Scholarships are a great way to pay for college because you don't have to pay them back. However, it takes a lot of research and time but it's worth it! Talking to your financial aid adviser is also important because they can give you tips. Also, buy a planner. There is a lot more free time in college and staying busy will help you beat procrastination.",
            "Although Simmons is very expensive, you can definitely tell what you're spending your money on. There are computers and printers everywhere around campus for use. The classrooms are so nice and have smart boards and computers in them. The desks and chairs are comfy. Whenever there is a problem in the residence halls, it always gets fixed and as fast as possible.",
            "Simmons is located in Boston, MA and it is awesome! The residence campus is a short walk away from the academic campus. Also, there are so many other schools around that you can always find something to do and meet new people. Being in Boston is great because you never get bored and don't have to go to a party every night.",
            "Simmons professors are so knowledgeable and they always share interesting information that deals with the course. I have learned more in the first semester than a year of high school!"

There is always someone on the residence campus. After 10:30, all the gates get closed except for the one by Simmons Hall. You tap into the buildings with your ID card. I have never had a problem with safety. (But remember to lock your doors).}",

    "textAfterTable": "01/10/2011 Reviewer is A current student here. 6 out of 6 people found this review useful. 2 of 46 Categories Comments Great for these types of students The all female classes make concentrating in class easier. It also makes the dorms very home-like and warm. We understand that we need a certain level of testosterone so there are always opportunities to get off campus and meet guys from the surrounding schools. (Tufts, Northeastern, Harvard, Berklee) Simmons is great for any girl who want to meet and learn with other ambitious women. Why overlook a school designed specifically to help women achieve? Tips for prospective students Visit the school and attend the prospective students days. They are geared toward introducing the school and the surrounding area. Half the battle when choosing a school is determining where you want to live and what you want to be doing in you free time. These days will lure you in to the area and from there it is clear how many opportunities there are to get off campus. I suggest applying to the honors program to anyone who has the academic standings required. Bang for the buck",
