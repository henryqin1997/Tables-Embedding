            "UCSD is located in one of the safest cities in the nation. Campus-wide security is efficient and active, so students need not fear walking around late at night. Crimes are seldom heard of, and most days pass by without unfortunate event.",
            "UCSD isn't know for its Greek Life, and it certainly shows on campus. Though students proudly display their letters for all to see, the influence of fraternities and sororities is not great. However, if you're looking into greek life, you'll still find that there's plenty of fun to be had.",
            "Once you get plugged into one of the many organizations at UCSD, you'll find yourself getting closer to the people whom you'll soon consider your family. It's hard to find a community here at UCSD until you get plugged into some sort of group or organization, but once you do, it's smooth sailing. There's a club out there for almost every interest, so one shouldn't fear not being able to find a group where he/she will fit in.",
            "Slightly geeky students who still know how to go out and have fun. People who love the beach. Students who know how to work hard and play hard.",
            "Walking backwards under the Sungod Statue on Muir Lawn.",
            "As a public school within the UC system, UCSD is notable for its leadership amongst colleges and universities in the sciences and engineering. Seeing as tuition is much cheaper than that of an Ivy League or other private university, the education one receives here is definitely worthwhile.",
            "Go to the beach, indulge in your favorite hobbies, go bike riding, soak in the sun, read, etc. Your social life in UCSD is what you make it. There are many who would say that this UC is Socially Dead, but so long as you put yourself out there, you'll find yourself enjoying your time at UCSD.",
            "UCSD isn't exactly known for its dining experience, but it's not like you're eating plastic for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. There are some decent things to chow on during your stay on campus.",
            "As a Freshman, your experience in the res halls will be both pleasant and miserable. On one hand, the social life is wonderful, and you'll make many new friends and learn many new things. On the other hand, however, the quarters are relatively cramped, and you might find yourself wishing for more personal space. The apartments offered to 2nd years and above are much more comfortable, but a bit more isolated; they're great places to come home to after a long day.",
            "UCSD definitely doesn't slack off when it comes to difficulty in courses. Students should make sure to actually study and invest quite a deal of their college life in the books.",
            "This school is not to be taken lightly-- it is academically-rigorous and classes are generally not walks-in-the-park. Make sure to set aside a good amount of time for studying, but at the same time, don't forget to go out and enjoy the great La Jolla weather. UCSD has a lot of hidden secrets, so feel free to explore and make the most out of your college experience!",
            "This is a fantastic school for any aspiring scientists or engineers. The weather and general atmosphere of the campus is just as amazing, and provides an excellent setting for students to study in. UCSD is a school in which pursuers of academia will succeed and flourish under proper guidance and a bountiful pool of resources."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{250492=Revelle college has a tradition called the Watermelon Drop every year in June. They crown a Watermelon Queen (either gender), and they get to drop a watermelon off the roof of a building, aiming at a target on the ground. There is a small concert venue called the Che Cafe. There are many private concerts with beginner bands. It looks like a run-down shack, but the ambiance is comfortable and fun., 1048930=La Jolla Beach UTC Gas Lamp District Seaworld Mission Bay Old Town San Diego Balboa Park Del Mar Coronado Island, 880118=On campus, there are the gym facilities. Again like the food I would get off campus for the really world class recreation. If you are into martial arts, San Diego has a really famous fight community. Black House gym is right up Miramar Road and ATOS jiu jitsu is on Convoy. If you are more of a water sports type, the beach is a 5 minute walk away from the campus, 1126001=Great on Academics, mediocre on campus life, and truly terrible for students with disabilities. Parking for the handicapped is sparse, the transportation programs often make you late to class, and the Office for Students with Disabilities, while mainly staffed with great people, has a lady by the name of April Garrison who is evidently fond of making students obtain thousands of out of pocket dollars of extra testing despite the fact that they have doctors who state that they are in need of assistance. When I told her I did not have that kind of money, she callously suggested that I add to my already crippling student debt and borrow it. Easy for her to say., 818062=Like Dorm Life, depends on where you live. I live in Revelle, and the food is mediocre. You get the eventual hair in your food or find something that doesnt look appetizing, but hey, its a cafeteria. Just t mention, Revelle will be going through cafeteria renovation, so for the 2013-2014 school year, we will not have a cafeteria., 853203=There are plenty of interesting locations around campus. There is Falling Star, which is a small blue house that looks to be teetering on the edge of the engineering building; the talking, singing, and silent trees hidden in the forest near Geisel Library (which was the inspiration for the snow Fortress in Inception); the graffiti room in Mandeville; and much more! As for traditions, each of the six colleges has their own tradition, such as the Revelle Watermelon Drop and ERC's Rock n' Roosevelt. By far the biggest tradition of the year, however, is the Sun God festival in spring quarter, which is a huge concert/dance with a variety of artists, including famous artists like Kendrick Lemar and Macklemore., 1069118=Newly renovated dining plaza in Revelle College. Opens 2014 fall quarter., 842509=Some places on campus are better than others. UCSD is always improving their food and dining experience. They will be remodeling the lowest ranked dining hall in Summer 2013., 719113=UCSD has a bunch of art pieces that may seem random but they are done on purpose. There is a singing tree, a talking tree, and of course a silent tree. The is the Warren Bear in Warren College, which is a big bear made of huge rocks. During, welcome week freshmen students from each college participate in the unolympics, which is a set of competitions between the students of each college, like dancing and races.But really, the Sun God Festival is the big event that UCSD is known for. There are performances by famous artists like Drake, Young the Giant and Kendrick Lamar. Even more so there is a dance stage, activities, and food sold throughout the event. But the best thing is that undergraduates don't have to pay extra for it!! Your student fees cover the costs so your entry is free!, 488527=I am not sure what I will be doing for fun when I go to University of California, San Diego in Fall 2012, however, I am pretty sure I am will going to the beach and music dances to make for friends and have some time for myself to relax from my studies., 549799=Campus security is on 24/7 I feel safe even when I'm walking to my dorm at 11 o'clock at night., 419815=There is an annual Sun God festival in May in which many new artists come and perform! There are also many dance floors and food booths. On campus, there are also many random pieces of art including singing trees, a snake path, and a Sr. Seuss Statue., 251185=We are only a 20-minute walk from the beach and from the most beautiful places to hike and hang out. We also have many concerts on campus that are $10 or less. UCSD has a yearly music festival called Sun God, and we have famous musicians performing here! Last year, UCSD had Kendrick Lamar, Youngblood Hawke, and Portugal, the Man perform. They said that the upcoming years should be even better because of their large budget., 916237=You want to get at least above a 1800 for SATs if you already have good grades. If your grades are not that hot then you might want to score really high on the SATs. Public schools are all about numbers and your college essays. Extracurricular activities are important, but not as important as it would be in a private/liberal arts college. I'd say keep your grades up rather than relying on SATs. Most importantly you must show that you do better each year, rather than the other way around., 763566=I believe tuition has increased almost 100% since I began in 2005, which is both disheartening and discouraging. Luckily UCSD is a big enough name that finding lucrative work, even in this economy -- with the right experience, the right angle, the right attitude, and *definitely* the right connections -- shouldn't be too difficult., 939577=It's pretty expensive but I still have a few hundred left over every quarter with just a $2000 loan. Everything on campus is pretty pricey but with the dining plan given it balances out okay., 1130357=One of the most famous traditions is the Sun God Music Festival held every year in May where UCSD invites bands and artists to perform, and it is free for all UCSD students. Furthermore, the week before Finals Week is a tradition known as the Undie Run, where students run around campus in their underwear as a way to vent their stress. Also, the Stuart Art Collection is scattered throughout campus, so it's always neat to see randomly placed art (i.e. the Warren bear, the big red chair in Revelle, etc.)., 1125063=The school is excellent on academics, but poor on campus life, as UCSD was designed to be slightly alienating in order to discourage the kind of organized student protests that occurred at Berkeley. This is a shame, as student social life is an important part of any college experience. Driving on campus can be extremely slow and frustrating since they went mad and added enough stoplights to choke a horse. The old stop signs worked just fine, but evidently the administration, which is supposedly always strapped for cash, felt this a better use of their funds than putting the money into academics. However, mass transit is excellent until 10:30 PM. Other pluses include the location, as the college is near the beach, and located on a lovely campus.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot UCSD provides excellent professors to optimize learning for its students...for the most part anyway. Like any other school, it has it's off professors, but for the most part, all of my professors have been very enthusiastic and passionate about what they are teaching. Class sizes are very LARGE. My chemistry class for example has over 400 people in it. However, discussions are very helpful and offer a little more intimacy. I would highly encourage you to attend them! Try to get to know your TA, it can help when you have to take quizzes and whatnot and they are on-the-fence on how to grade a particular problem. In addition there are several very helpful, FREE tutoring services such as OASIS (for lower division classes) and others for upper division classes, which is very beneficial. Another thing I've found helpful are the Chem Help Room and Calc Lab, two centers that offer a lot of help for those darn general ed classes, that may be tough for students like myself. There are also plenty of students who know what they are doing trying to tutor for cash if you don't mind paying. I definitely feel like the professors and faculty here want to see me succeed. The students here are crazy smart so there can be a lot of competition, however it is not impossible to get an A in most classes if you",
