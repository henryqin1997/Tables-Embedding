Only one has germ'ed so far. By the time I found it the first set of leaves were developing. The photo's aren't that good...I couldn't get a close enough shot and it be clear enough to tell what the heck it was. But I tried. I've set the others outside in the shade for some warmth. It's been so very hot here that my a/c is running 90 to nothing and it gets too cold in here for them to ever be warm. I'll only leave them for a few hours. Hopefully long enough for them to break dormacy. This message was edited Sunday, Jul 6th 3:01 PM Click the image for an enlarged view.
