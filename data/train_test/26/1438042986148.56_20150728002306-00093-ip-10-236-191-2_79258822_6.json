    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{11630=Eat 'Em and Smile is the debut full-length solo album by original Van Halen vocalist David Lee Roth, released on July 7, 1986., 16477=In a nod to his hit solo EP, Roth included two lounge songs on Eat 'Em And Smile, \"That's Life\" and \"I'm Easy\". Roth also included a cover of the '60s garage band classic, \"Tobacco Road\". Two of the album's original songs, however, became its biggest hits. \"Yankee Rose\", a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the Statue of Liberty, became an MTV and radio hit, rising into the Billboard Top 20.[6] The would-be theme to Roth's then-planned movie, \"Goin' Crazy!\" also became an MTV staple while hovering near the middle of Billboard\u200d\u200a'\u200bs Hot 100 during the early autumn of 1986.[8], 22725=According to Sheehan, the album wasn't well-received, with many people considering it \"gringo Spanish\". Any future Spanish-version ideas were dropped. Sonrisa salvaje was originally released on vinyl and cassette, but deleted almost immediately; a CD version did not appear until 2007. All of the liner notes on the original release were written in Spanish, except for the copyright notice and the Dolby noise reduction information on the cassette version., 13787=After releasing Crazy from the Heat, an EP of lounge standards that became a surprise hit during early 1985, and subsequently parting ways with Van Halen while the band was at its commercial zenith, Roth assembled a new backing band: bassist Billy Sheehan (later of Mr. Big); drummer Gregg Bissonette (later of Ringo Starr and Elton John, among others); and guitarist Steve Vai, who had worked previously with Frank Zappa, PiL and Alcatrazz.[3]}",
