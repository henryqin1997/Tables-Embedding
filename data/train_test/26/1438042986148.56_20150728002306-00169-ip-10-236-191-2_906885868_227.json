            "One thing anyone can appreciate about campus safety is that if anything ever happens students are notified immediately via e-mail, txt message, or phone call. Campus police is always making sure the school has a safe environment for students. And if you personally are having any sort of trouble you can always call campus police or go straight in to their office and talk to someone there. College life should not be something un-enjoyable and campus police are always making sure to take care of things for students to enjoy their time there at CSUN.",
            "CSUN is a great choice for students who are looking to major in the arts, business, education, anything in humanities and music.",
            "Attending CSUN is definitely a lot less expensive than attending a UC. California State Northridge offers many different options when it comes to majors, making a great choice to attend without having to spend double the money.",
            "There is a lot of fun things to do on campus, every semester the school hosts an amazing concert for students with great well-known performers. The concerts are very affordable for students and the upside to it is that students can invite friends who do not attend campus. Out of campus there is also a lot of nearby fun places to go. You can go and do fun activities with a group of friends or with that special someone. Such as go to the Matador Bowling near by campus, plenty of Hookah bars are close by as well. And if your in the mood to go out and release some tension you can grab a couple of friends and go dancing.",
            "The great thing about attending nothing is too far to get when lunch time comes around. Just across the street from campus, you are offered a wide variety of places to dine out. And the best part for us college students, is that they are all affordable places. Plus if you own a CSUN student ID you can get a student discount at most places.",
            "The dorm Life at CSUN is fun, exciting, and a memorable one. It is fun living in the dorms because one always has the convenience of being close by campus and being able to attend great events on campus. It is an exciting experience because one gets to meet new people and grasp friendships from living in the dorms. Thus, making it a memorable experience for individuals.",
            "Strictness at CSUN is not harsh, unless extreme boundaries are cross of coarse. From my time attending CSUN I personally have never hear of harsh punishment being taken weather in the classroom environment or academically. Anyone wanting to attend college should have the understanding that one can't slack of and not expect certain consequences, everything is all on what one is on the effort one is willing to give their education.",
            "Just as any other school when attending CSUN, students should make sure to stay on task when it comes to getting the class requirements completed. It is less pressure when things get done when they are supposed to and not the night before. Be part of a group on campus, it opens many opportunity doors for everyone. You get to meet new people, learn about new places near by campus that are enjoyable, and you get to get a great college experience to take with you.",
            "California State Northridge is a campus enriched with great diversity. It offers a wide variety of major options. And has a welcoming environment for all students."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{136352=I highly recommend the dorms to the newly incoming freshmen so they can start many new people and have a great sense of community within the dorm life. Also there is events sponsors by the RA (Residental Advisor) with free movie screenings, ice cream parties, and even peer advisement. For exercise, their are volleyball nets, a small field for soccer, and basketball courts. The only downside is that the Matador Patrol closes the gates at 7:30 pm so if you need to enter to the dorms, you have to sign and verify with matador patrol before you enter., 1103142=As an Alumni, class of 2012, i really took advantage of all the opportunities that were offered to me in the School of Sociology. The professors are great and really allow you to learn skills that are practiced in the classroom so that you can immediately start using in the workforce. Professor Morgaine, Hatkoff, and Debose were my mentors, teachers, life coaches, and friends., 56915=I love CSUN,but if I were living on campus I would have a lot more fun.The sports are fun and it is easy to get involved with activities.The campus is beautiful and they are building a new Art center which is suppose to open in 2011.I also love the library because I always can find what I am looking for in there if I can't find it at my local library., 675507=I don't dorm, but I do live across the dorms, there is a curfew for getting inside without having to be checked in, they close the gates at 7:30. Also they are fairly overpriced, but I do still wish I dormed to meet new people., 235458=there are many fun events held at c.su.n. such as concerts by well known artists like b.o.b. and the cataracs, who performed in the fall semester, 2011. they recently built the student recreational center where students can become fit and active. best part it is free for students! during the hot weathers c.s.u.n. has a big pool where students can cool off., 75282=Great school. May not have the prestige of other schools like the UCs but it is one of the best CSUs in the state and has a great business program., 874348=I had no fun time. I tranferred in 2006 Fall semester from Mission College and I Graduated from CSUN in Spring 2008. My goal was to complete my BA as soon as possible because I was having a baby in Sep 2008. I had no time to see or do fun things at school... but study,go to class and take exams., 740882=I've been a student majoring in Civil Engineering here at Cal State Northridge since the Fall of 2007. I have seen the campus grow with student life and expand. CSUN has just finished building a new student recreation center, parking structures, updated technology in classrooms, and improved student life on campus. Overall I have enjoyed my years here and despite the large majority of peers commuting to and from, the student body can connect on campus. Go Matadors!, 714536=CSUN has an entire escort system that guards the library and personally approaches students to walk them either to their car or back to the dorms. Security guards have two shacks on the outskirts of Student Housing and patrol from 7:30 pm- 3:00 am. The guards are pretty cool, they actually like chatting with students and asking what's going on with them. They also patrol inside of Student Housing too., 597215=They are not acceptng new applicants until 2013., 739714=CSUN has updated their dormitory life since 2007 and provided better meals for on campus dining., 122576=This year 2012 the hired various security! Its really good., 987137=It`s no wonder than CSUN is ranked 68th in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities (West) by US News. This school offers incredibly small class sizes which are ideal for getting the best of lecture time. CSUN`s vast variety of degree programs ensures than just about anyone can attend CSUN and study what he or she wishes.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here CSUN has given me the opportunity to explore my many different interests. I have helped out with student elections, blood drives, etc. I recently joined the New Student Orientation Team and J.A.D.E Program which has been an incredible experience so far. I have met some amazing, caring people through these programs and hope to befriend many more. Am learning a lot Almost all my professors have been extremely helpful, I have learned a lot not just from my professors but also my classmates. I have also learned a lot about the campus as well as myself in and out of the classroom.
