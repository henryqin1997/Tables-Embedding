    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The quantum wire FET shown in FIG. 4B is thus fabricated through the above-mentioned method, featuring a mutual conductance gm of about 400 mS per 1 \u03bcm of gate width at room temperature, which is 2 to 4 times as great as that of the conventional GaAs MESFET (gm is about 100 mS) or HEMT (gm is about 200 mS). This embodiment deals with a high-mobility transistor to which the present invention is adapted. The procedure is carried out in the same manner as in Embodiment 1 up to the step of forming a second superlattice layer 14. Then, an undoped Ga0.7 Al0.3 As layer (0.1 \u03bcm) 31 and an undoped GaAs layer (0.1 \u03bcm) 32 are formed. The device is then placed under a high-temperature condition to form quantum wires 24 in the same manner as in the Embodiment 1. Then, a Ti/Pt/Au gate electrode (gate length, 0.5 \u03bcm) 33 is formed. Using the gate electrode as a mask, silicon ions are injected to form an n+-type region 34 (FIG. 4A). Thereafter, AuGe/Au source electrode 35 and drain electrode 36 are formed on the GaAs layer 32. EMBODIMENT 3 A light-emitting diode shown in FIG. 3B is fabricated through the above-mentioned steps. In FIG. 3B, arrow indicates the direction in which the light will be emitted. According to this embodiment, there is obtained a light-emitting diode having good efficiency and good temperature characteristics.",
