If a cleaning solution is required to clean the plates, the plates should be removed from the frame and scrubbed with a soft brush and cleaning solution and then rinsed with water. If the deposits and buildup in the exchanger are severe, the unit may need to be dismantled for manual cleaning of each plate.\u00a0 In some cases the plates can be left hanging from the carrying bar while each plates is scrubbed with a soft brush and running water.\u00a0 The plates are then rinsed with a high pressure hose. Packaged CIP system may be available from the vendor but can be easily made up if none is available.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A typical CIP will consist of a reservoir for holding the cleaning solution or chemical, a circulating pump, valves, piping and flexible hose.\u00a0 The vendors recommendations for cleaning the unit should be followed. Fouling of the plate exchange can occur on both the cooling water and sulphuric acid sides of the exchanger although fouling on the cooling water side is most common.\u00a0 Cleaning-In-Place (CIP) allows the exchanger to be cleaned without the need to open and dismantle the entire unit which can be very time consuming.\u00a0 Cleaning Plate heat exchangers are found in",

Opening the Unit Dismantling a plate heat exchanger for inspection, cleaning or maintenance should be done according to the manufacturers instructions.\u00a0 Most manufacturers recommend the following: Measure the width of the plate pack at the bolts prior to opening and record the figures.\u00a0\u00a0 When the heat exchanger is reassembled, the measurements will be used to ensure that the plate pack has been tightened adequately to prevent leaks. Mark the outside of the plate pack with a diagonal line.\u00a0 This will ensure that the plates are assembled in their original order.\u00a0 Alternatively, each plate can be numbered. Loosen the bolts evenly so that the fixed and floating (pressure) plate always remain parallel. Closing the Unit Reassembling the plate heat exchanger should be done according to the manufacturuer\u2019s instructions.\u00a0 The following are general guidelines common to most manufacturers: Ensure that all sealing services are clean Clean and lubricate the threads of the bolts Ensure",
