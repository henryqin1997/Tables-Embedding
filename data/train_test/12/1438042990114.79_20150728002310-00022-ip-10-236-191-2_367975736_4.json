Thus, to calculate the dates of the Heisei era, which began in 1989, add or subtract 1988 (1989 - 1) from the year in question. Thus 2007 was Heisei 19 (2007 - 1988), and conversely Heisei 5 would be 1988 + 5 = 1993., 15487=The practice of issei-ichigen was only formalised in 1979, when the Era Name Law (\u5143\u53f7\u6cd5, geng\u014d-h\u014d) was passed. Thus since 1868, there have been only four neng\u014d: Meiji (\u660e\u6cbb), Taish\u014d (\u5927\u6b63), Sh\u014dwa (\u662d\u548c) and Heisei (\u5e73\u6210).[1], 9426=Although there are Japanese names for each month of the year, in recent times, they have taken a far more pragmatic approach and simply named each month for its corresponding number. Thus January is ichigatsu (\u4e00\u6708) or \"first month\". The table below sets out the new and old names for the months of the year., 16916=The neng\u014d system in use today was initiated by Emperor Mommu (697 - 707) in 701, after two previous attempts by Emperor K\u014dtoku in 654, and Emperor Temmu in 686 were abandoned. The current system has continued uninterrupted through today. Eras prior to 701 are generally linked to the first year of the relevant emperor's reign. Thus the first year of the era of Emperor Jimmu from 660 to 581 B.C. is referred to as Jimmu-Tennou gannen (\u795e\u6b66\u5929\u7687\u5143\u5e74), or the \"first year of Emperor Jimmu\".[3], 1540=Sometimes, instead of the Western year being used, the year of the current Emperor's reign is used. Thus, 2008 could be written as Heisei (\u5e73\u6210) 20, or to use the date format above: \u5e73\u621020\u5e749\u670813\u65e5. To arrive at a Western date, based on an era, you take the commencement date of the era (1989 in the case of Heisei), subtract 1 (as 1989 would be year 1 of Heisei, not year 0) and add the number of years of the era. Thus Heisei 20 = 1989 - 1 + 20 = 2008. The specific eras will be discussed in more detail below., 13774=For example, the year 2008 is Heisei 20, written as \u5e73\u621020\u5e74. Sometimes an era name is expressed with the first letter of the romanized name. For example, S50\u5e74 would mean Sh\u014dwa 50, or 1975., 1072=Writing the date in Japanese also makes use of the system of numbers and counters. Thus, when the date is written out in full, the format is as follows: yyyy\u5e74mm\u6708dd\u65e5, where \u5e74 is the counter for years, \u6708 for months and \u65e5 for days. Thus 13 September, 2008 would be written as 2008\u5e749\u670813\u65e5., 14974=The first year of an era is called gan-nen (\u5143\u5e74). Subsequent years are counted from the beginning of the following calendar year. For example, the Sh\u014dwa era commenced on 25 December, 1926, and the second year of Sh\u014dwa started a week later on 1 January, 1927. It would also imply that 1926 , can be written as both Taish\u014d 15 (the era name of the deceased Emperor) and Sh\u014dwa 1., 42950=During this time, Japan was divided between the rival Southern and Northern Imperial courts, each with their own eras. It was decided in 1910 that the Southern Court had been the legitimate court during the period,[5] so the \"Southern era\" names are provided in official lists. However, as the \"Northern era\" names were actually used in most of the country, these are also provided.}",

Furthermore, a change of emperor did not necessarily mean an immediate change to a new era; this normally occurred between one to two years after the Emperor's death.[2] Prior to the convention that started with the Meiji Era, the start of a new era could be declared for any number of reasons. The main reasons for declaring a new era would be the first, fifth and 58th years of the \"sexagenary cycle\" (\u5341\u5e72\u5341\u4e8c\u652f jikkan j\u016bnishi), based on the Chinese system of 60 combinations of the two basic cycles, the ten calendar signs and the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac, the",
