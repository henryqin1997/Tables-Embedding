    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{28732=The substrate for this flat cable is a woven Dacron polyester fabric, having a weight of 1.25 oz. per square yard, a denier of 10 and a 72/50 count with 400 micron openings. This fabric was impregnated with a Kynarflex\ufffd 2801 emulsion producing a total fabric weight of 3.6 oz. per square yard, and a thickness of 4 mils. The fabric was cut to a width of 4 inches. The bonding operation was carried out in the equipment shown in FIG. 4, using the following procedure. The coated fabric 40 was paid off from a spool 41 and wound around roller 42, where it was heated to the melting temperature of the impregnant with a hot air blower 43. It was then brought in contact with 35 sets of twisted pairs of MIL-W 81044/12-20 wire, arranged horizontally in a single layer 44 touching each other. The twisted pairs were also heated by a hot air blower 45. The bonding was achieved by passing the heated fabric and the twisted pairs between rollers 42 and 46, applying a pressure of about 20 psi. The laminate was then wound around roller 48, and through a set of wire guides 49 and 50 to the caterpillar take up 51. Excess fabric on both sides was trimmed off with an in-line slitter 52. After the process, the fabric had a tear strength of 5 lbs. when tested according to ASTM D-1004., 30094=Example 1 was repeated using as the substrate for the flat cable a woven fiber glass fabric, having a weight of 1.45 oz/yd2, and 60/47 count with Deniers of 450 and 460 for wrap yarn and fill yarn respectively. This fabric was impregnated with Tefzel\ufffd 280. The impregnation was done by thermally fusing two layers of 1 mil Tefzel\ufffd film with the fabric sandwiched between them. The conditions were 500\ufffd F., and 50 psi for 30 sec. Under these conditions, Tefzel\ufffd melted and fused together via the openings of the woven fabric producing a total substrate weight of 4.3 oz/yd2, and a maximum thickness of 6 mils. The fabric was cut to a width of 2 inches. The bonding operation was carried out using the procedure and equipment as described in example 1, except that a pressure of about 10 psi was used in the step of bonding the insulated twisted pairs to the impregnated fabric. The fabric had a tear strength of 5.5 lbs. when tested according to ASTM D-1004., 25047=The porous substrate is preferably about 10 to about 200 microns thick, more preferably about 20 to about 150 microns. Preferred fabrics are woven fabrics made of fibers having a denier of about 20 to about 2000. The nature of the weave is not critical.}",
