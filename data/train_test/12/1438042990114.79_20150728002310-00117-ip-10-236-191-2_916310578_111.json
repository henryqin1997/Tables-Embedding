It has a great sense of community within the campus and you will most certainly enjoy the experience., 179111=Get applications in early. Scholarship applications are due in February and March. Make sure and plan ahead accordingly., 10854=Boise State education is some of the best that you can get in the state of Idaho. With the student to teacher ratio being around 1:19, you can always find the help that you need when it comes to the academics. Every year, BSU is improving the facilities to improve the academics. The professors for the most part are extremely helpful and friendly, and care about the education that you are getting.

I know I will enjoy the boise campus because while being located in a large city (30 miles wide) it still holds the great characteristics of a small school. Everyone on the campus was friendly and helpful during my Orientation (June 9th and 10th 2011). It felt like a place I could grow and learn happily. Even my parents fears were resolved during orientation., 442883=I'm excited to get started in the fall. I attended the first summer orientation in June. I will be staying on campus., 82462=the tuition rise in 2010 caused me to stop attending. The other problem with this is that many paper test where canceled and the online testing doesn't have enough space or accommodations for working or busy students.The test available are rarely available during your usually meeting times}",
