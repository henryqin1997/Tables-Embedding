    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38367=The Los Angeles Angels continue to struggle in the month of April, currently sitting at a 5-14 record and a 3-7 record through their last 10 games. The woes begin with slugging first basemen Albert Pujols, whose struggles have been magnified through his first month in the American League as he pushes to hit his first home run of the season. The rest of his numbers are not strong as well; so far, Pujols has hit just .216 and driven in only four runs. For an offense that was projected as one of the best in baseball, the rest of the team has yet to step either - the Angels are currently near the bottom of the league in all major offensive categories., 10291=11/19/14: A pretty good week for a couple of Los Angeles area baseball players last week. Angels outfielder Mike Trout unanimously won the American League MVP award, while Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw won both the National League MVP and the Cy Young Award. Trout was the obvious choice in the AL. He led the lead in Wins Above Replacement with 7.8 while posting a slash line of .287/.377/.561. He also stole 16 bases while belting 36 home runs and led the league with 111 RBIs. So far, he has given the Angels a pretty good return on the six year, $144 million deal he signed in March. Oh, and he is only 22 years old., 41545=The Los Angeles Angels look to emerge from the 2010 season with a positive focus. After finishing third in the AL West last season, the Angels went out and signed relievers Hisanori Takahashi and Scott Downs. As long as the Angels can get another big year out of Kendry Morales, the club should be able to return to the top of the AL West in 2011., 5087=3/18/15: Every team in the AL West should be improved this coming season, but the LA Angels still have to be considered the heavy favorites to win the division once again. Staff ace Garret Richards is steadily improving from that devastating knee injury last August and the hope is that he will regain that form. But there is concern about another pitcher, specifically it is Jared Weaver and his disappearing fastball. His velocity has dropped in each of the pas five seasons and he averaged only 86.3 MPH in 2014. He was in the low-80's last week against Arizona, and that makes him vulnerable to most hitters. However, he may have a few tricks left and be able to paint corners like Greg Maddux did for so many years., 35756=5/18/12 The slow start to the 2012 season by star free agent acquisition mirrored a similar slow start for the Angels, but both have begun to pick up their play in recent days. With a 2-game series split against the Chicago White Sox, the Los Angeles Angels head into a weekend interleague series with the San Diego Padres with a 17-22 record, 7 games out of first place in the AL West. The good news for the Angels is that they are no longer in last place, as they have moved past the Seattle Mariners into 3rd place in the division., 28417=4/17/14: The Angels have certainly opened up the wallet the past few years, but they have precious little to show for it so far. One of their key acquisitions in recent years was Josh Hamilton. Hamilton had a disappointing 2013 and is now out for six to eight weeks with a thumb injury. The outfield got thinner a few days ago as the team placed Kole Calhoun on the disabled list when he hurt his ankle. L.A. is still looking up at most of the AL West. The first thing they may need to fix is their home record, where they have only won two games all season., 43334=For the second straight year, baseball's second Wild Card format gave a franchise breaking away from decades worth of futility the chance to host the exciting, all-in affair. After the Pittsburgh Pirates became the first home team to win a Wild Card winner-take-all game in the 2013 postseason (though, sadly, they couldn't repeat in 2014),\u2026, 7078=2/18/15: Great news for the Angels, who already have one of the best rosters in all of baseball. They are about to get better. Pitcher Garrett Richards has been cleared to throw off a mound - a significant step in his recovery from a torn patellar tendon in his left knee from last August. He has already been running with his full body weight, so this is one of the last major steps in getting back on the field. He will likely be eased into the team - there is no need to make him go full throttle in the spring - so he may not be ready to go on opening day. That is fine. It is much more important to the team that he is available in September and October., 33176=After an unusually slow start to the season, the Los Angeles Angels have stormed back and have climbed out of the AL West cellar to find themselves in second place, only 3 games behind the first-place Texas Rangers as we hit the halfway point of June. At 34-30, the revitalized Angels will head into a three-game interleague series against the Arizona Diamondbacks this weekend. Dan Haren will be on the mound to open the series on Friday night against the Diamondbacks' Trevor Cahill as the Angels will look to gain some more ground in the AL West., 41977=Los Angeles Angels tickets ensure that fans see the Angels playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The Angels have their work cut out for them in a competitive American League West. With matchups with great teams like the Oakland Athletics and Texas Rangers and non-divisional meetings with the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox throughout the season, the Angels will have a great opportunity to test themselves against top talent in 2011. Buy your tickets now and don't miss the action!, 10931=11/12/14: The Angels improved their front office organization and may have hurt the rival Texas Rangers in the process when they hired Tim Bogar last week. Bogar was named interim manager of the Rangers in September when Ron Washington resigned and led a team that had nothing to play for to a 14-8 record. He was passed over for the permanent position, so leaving the Rangers was understandable. The new position is as a special assistant to GM Jerry Dipoto, though there are rumors that he may be in the mix for the Tampa Bay Rays manager job., 39040=5/4/12 With the longest home run drought of his major league career still going, Albert Pujols has been unable to help the Los Angeles Angels at the plate early on in this season as they have struggled mightily out of the gate. With a record of 10-16, the Angels are currently in last place in the AL West and 7.5 games behind the division-leading Texas Rangers. The lone bright spot for the Angels so far this season has been Jered Weaver's no-hitter that he threw on May 1st in a 9-0 win over the Minnesota Twins. It was the Angels' second no-hitter in as many seasons., 9634=1/14/15: The Angels took a huge blow last season when starting pitcher Garrett Richards, who was turning in ace-like performances, when he blew out his knee last August. The Angels ended up winning the division but lacked the pitching to advance very far in the playoffs. Well, there is some good news. Richards is running again. That does not mean he is throwing or will be ready for the start of the season. In fact, the Angels are just hoping he car return to action within the first six weeks of the season. But it is a good sign that he is rehabbing well and hopefully he will regain the form he showed last season before he got hurt., 41016=Los Angeles Angels tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of baseball's youngest franchises play their way into the history books. The Angels, based in Anaheim California since the expansion team relocated in 1961, won their only World Series championship and AL pennant during the 2002 MLB season. The Angels play at Angel Stadium of Anaheim, also known as The Big A, and have called it home since the park was opened in 1966., 36857=5/3/12 - In front of a crowd of 27,288 at Angel Stadium on Wednesday night, Jered Weaver threw a no-hitter. The 9-0 victory against the Minnesota Twins was the first no-hitter at home since Nolan Ryan threw one back in 1975. Weaver struck out nine and walked one while throwing 121 pitches. The only baserunners for the Twins were Chris Parmelee, who reached first base on a strikeout in the second inning after the ball got away from Angels' catcher Chris Iannetta, and Josh Willingham, who walked in the seventh inning. Weaver ran into a little trouble in the ninth, with a couple of hard hit balls to the deepest parts of the outfield but outfielders Torii Hunter and Vernon Wells were there to track down the balls. Weaver's record improves to 4-0 with a 1.61 ERA. This is the second no-hitter of the year. Chicago White Sox pitcher Phil Humber threw a perfect game earlier this season., 7755=2/11/15: The Los Angeles Angels are holding out hope that starting pitcher Garrett Richards can be back for opening day. That may seem like a pipe dream considering that he has not yet begun even throwing off of a mound yet, but there is always hope this time of year. Richards emerged as a true ace last season when he went 13-4 with a 2.61 ERA and averaged almost a strike out per inning. However, that nasty knee injury last August cut his season short and the Angels can only hope he returns to form. In any case, the Angels should be one of the top contenders in the American League again this season., 11494=11/5/14: Perhaps the biggest move the Angels made in the 2014 season was acquiring closer Huston Street from the San Diego Padres. Street had a career year. Combining his time with both teams, he saved 41 games with a 1.37 ERA. That stabilized the Angels bullpen and put the team on track to overtake the A's and win the AL West walking away. So it is no wonder that the Angels quickly picked up his $7 million option for 2015. It will be the last year under his current contract, but do not be surprised if the Angels try to get him to agree to an extension., 9057=1/28/15: Jared Weaver is one of the top rotation guys for the Angels, and he had another productive season last year. However, he dropped below 200 pounds, which is rail thin for a guy who stands 6'7\". He as added 25 pounds to his frame over the offseason in an attempt to go deeper into games. It may also help him overall as he posted a 3.59 ERA last season which was his worst since 2009. The AL West should be among the more competitive divisions again this season and the Angles will need Weaver to be a heavy contributor to their continued success., 8379=2/5/15: Baseball teams and players going into arbitration hearings is nothing new. And these proceedings are usually pretty cut and dry as there is enough data on the player to determine a value. However, the Garrett Richards arbitration hearing, scheduled for February 11, is very different. Richards was decent until last season, when he became a bonafide ace, sporting a 2.61 ERA, 1.04 WHIP and about a strikeout per inning in just under 170 innings. Then he tore his patellar tendon last August, so it is difficult to figure out how he will respond or even when he will return. Ultimately, the sides met about half way on a one year deal for $3.2 million., 17086=8/21/14: The American League playoff race is heating up, just in time for the stretch run. Oakland has owned the AL West (and, indeed the American League) all season, but the Angels have finally caught them in the standings. They are also doing it without Josh Hamilton, which, maybe why they finally caught them. Hamilton famously signed a big contract with L.A. before the 2013 season but has been a shell of his former self. Even his manager called him out and he has sat for five of eight games. If this keeps up, Hamilton may not see the field again this season. There is a big difference between first and second in the AL West, and neither the Angels nor the A's want to play a wild card game., 40306=After hitting it big in the offseason with the additions of slugging first- basemen Albert Pujols and left-handed-pitcher C.J. Wilson, the Los Angeles Angels have begun the 2011 campaign with a 2-2 record and a game behind the division-leading Texas Rangers in the standings. While Pujols has struggled so far with a .214 batting average, the team is pleased to have added a slugger that paced the St. Louis Cardinals to a World Series with a .299 batting average, 37 home runs and 99 RBI's. The Angels begin the second week of the season with a series against the Twins before heading to Yankee Stadium for New York's home opener., 13936=10/1/14: You can breath easy now, Rangers fans. The nightmare that was the 2014 season is over. There are not many positives to take out of the season. It was marred from the start with major injuries to key players who ended up being shelved for the season. The big offseason acquisition, Prince Fielder, is a prime example. He was hurt in the beginning of the season and that was it. The Rangers traded Ian Kinsler for him, who ended up having a great season in Detroit. But we can now put the season to rest and take comfort in knowing that the Rangers will have a high draft spot and that several prospects got invaluable experience., 4486=3/25/15: The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are seeing some normal results from their staff ace Garrett Richards. And by normal, that means some great pitching. Richards became a star last season as he developed into an ace. Of course, he had that terrible knee injury last August, and that ended his season. He is on the comeback trail this spring and looks great. In an intersquad game, he threw three innings and allowed just one hit while striking out four. Hopefully for Richards and the Angels, this is not an exception, and is what they will see from him throughout the season., 39629=The Los Angeles Angels continued their suspect start this past weekend in a series against the Baltimore Orioles. While they ended up winning two of three in the set, the team record remained below .500 at 6-10. Newcomer Albert Pujols continues to struggle as he adjusts to the American League, while free- agent pitching addition C.J. Wilson has continued to pitch well in the A.L. West. Kendrys Morales has had a strong April so far after returning from injury, posting a .294 batting average on the young season. Going into a three game series against the strong Tampa Bay Rays, the Angels are currently 6.5 games behind the division-leading Texas Rangers.}",
