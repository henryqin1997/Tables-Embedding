    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{51834=Ever since Portland came into the league in 2011, the Fire supporters umbrella, Section 8 Chicago, has had a very good relationship with the Timbers Army, Portland\u2019s main supporters group. The relationship is based on mutual respect and a shared \u201cdislike\u201d of all things Seattle., 92636=However, four of those seven games were on the road, so if the Fire can pick up all three points at home to Real Salt Lake on Saturday, May 3 after a bye week, the complexion of the season, and more importantly the table, will suddenly look a whole lot better., 126502=The Fourth Round draw for the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup occurred Friday morning at Soccer House in downtown Chicago and with MLS teams entering at this stage, the process was much more elaborate than the straight forward flips from last week\u2019s Third Round draw., 40300=TICKETS: Chicago Fire vs. Orlando City Quarterfinal on June 26, 46671=With the October 11 game coming so late in the season, it may be a pivotal one in terms of Playoff positioning., 45366=On the field, the Fire have had some good success against a TFC team that has languished near the bottom of the MLS table since starting in 2007. Thankfully, this match is on a Saturday in August so I expect a much larger contingent of Fire fans to attend., 32733=I then went ahead and told him what I did for a living working with the Chicago Fire at which point he got out his phone (on airplane mode of course) and showed me a number of photos from the two side\u2019s previous encounter last May in Portland., 52221=With that in mind, let\u2019s take a look at five exciting dates in the 2014 Fire calendar:, 49719=Montreal can be quite cold in April, but luckily for Fire fans, the April date is only the first time the Men in Red visit The City of Saints. I hear the weather is a lot nicer in mid-August, when the Fire visit for the second time., 48995=In 2001, Fire fans went to Crew Stadium in their hundreds, even when the Fire was not playing! The Fire had been knocked out in the Conference Semifinals by the Los Angeles Galaxy and many fans turned up to cheer against LA (and for the then Frank Yallop-led San Jose Earthquakes) at MLS Cup., 91376=When speaking about the team, their attitude, their effort in training and their prospects for the season, Yallop hasn\u2019t changed in his thinking since his arrival at Toyota Park last October. If anything, he is more optimistic now than before the season began., 125242=With those done, I will underscore that the most important principle to keep in mind for how pairings are determined comes from Page 7 of the 2014 U.S. Open Cup Handbook. It states:, 49464=Week 11 \u2013 Columbus away \u2013 Saturday, May 24, 42299=Earlier Thursday morning I was once again invited back to U.S. Soccer Federation headquarters in downtown Chicago to witness the semifinal round Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup coin flips., 38997=I can confirm the Chicago Fire have applied to host the 2013 U.S. Open Cup final., 105133=Following the draw, Marstaller said the published fourth round scenarios would not be accompanied Friday by match dates yet. This is because the Fourth Round has three possible match dates over an eight-day span. With USL PRO and the PDL, along with amateur sides having league games between the June 10-18 Fourth Round window, all clubs that have the potential to host a Fourth Round match will have the weekend to give their preferred hosting date before U.S. Soccer balances the already scheduled league games. Because of the logistical process, hosting dates are expected to be announced sometime next week.\u00a0, 24491=Back in 2011, Paladini employed this tactic against RSL\u2019s Kyle Beckerman and after 11 minutes, Beckerman snapped, head-butting Paladini and getting sent off with the Fire ending the game as 3-0 winners., 47975=Week 16 & 32 Kansas City away \u2013Sunday, July 6\u00a0& \u00a0Friday, October 10, 39967=Luckily for the Fire, the first coin flip landed tails, meaning the winner of next Wednesday's game vs. Orlando City will host the winnder of D.C. United/New England on August 7. This is the third straight flip the Fire have won after losing the initial third round flip to the Charlotte Eagles., 39369=Only one coin flip remains and that's for the final which will be played in early October. I'm told that will go down at some point in July., 48267=The Fire only play once at Fire House East this season and I expect to see a lot of red behind the goal\u00a0on May 24., 52112=Week 2 \u2013 Portland away \u2013 Saturday, March 15\u00a0, 39649=In the second flip, the coin came up heads, meaning the winner of Real Salt Lake/Carolina RailHawks will host the winner of Portland/FC Dallas. The flip was the fourth consecutive win for RSL in the 2013 U.S. Open Cup., 50950=Week 6 & 22 \u2013 Montreal away \u2013 Saturday, April 12 and Sunday, August 16, 46537=Week 23 \u2013 Toronto away \u2013 Saturday, August 23, 38893=Earlier 2013 Open Cup Coin Flips:, 47850=Kansas City is another road trip that fans have attended in large numbers throughout the years. My first trip to Kansas City was a disappointing one, with the Fire losing to the Kansas City Wizards in the final of the U.S. Open Cup in 2004., 50836=The Fire were the Montreal Impact\u2019s opponents in the Canadian club\u2019s first home MLS back in 2012 and I was lucky enough to be at the game and had a great time., 48680=There have been many highs experienced in Columbus, such as Paulo Wanchope\u2019s winning goal in a 2007 match after the game was delayed due to a torrential downpour. Fire fans were also 45 minutes away from MLS Cup in 2008 but for a Crew comeback in the second half which left Fire fans, including myself, devastated. There\u2019s also the 2012 invasion which saw 600 Fire supporters make the trek.}",
