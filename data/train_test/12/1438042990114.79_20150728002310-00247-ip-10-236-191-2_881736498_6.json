    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{69617=2013 MLB Tickets Major League Baseball Games of the Week April MLB Highlights Best Starts in 2013 Major League Baseball Season Two weeks does not a six-month season make, but a few strong trends are beginning to emerge in the 2013 MLB regular season. First, the Atlanta Braves are seriously good. With only one loss\u2026, 45762=10/10/13: The worst news the Mets could have received came in last week as star pitcher Matt Harvey will undergo Tommy John surgery to repair a torn ligament in his elbow. Harvey will likely miss the entire 2014 season while rehabbing, as this is typically a year-long process. The Mets have some other solid young starters like Zack Wheeler, who was a condition of the Carlos Beltran trade a couple of years ago. However, Harvey is the ace and baseball fans everywhere should hope that he can come back to the form he showed this past season., 34970=2/13/14: The Mets had struck gold last season with rookie ace pitcher Matt Harvey. He started the All-Star Game last season and was likely on his way to winning the Rookie of the Year Award until he suffered a major injury and had to have Tommy John surgery. That surgery occurred in October, and now that just about four months have passed, he is about to start throwing again. It is very unlikely that Harvey will pitch in the Majors this season as he recovers. It is at least good news that he has had no setbacks so far and hopefully will resume his promising career in 2015., 26833=5/8/14: If you grade the Mets, thus far in the 2014 season, based solely on how they are doing in the NL East, then they would get a 'C'. If you look at the National League as a whole, then they deserve a 'B'. Maybe a 'B+'. The Mets are hanging tough and have a better record than four of the five teams in the NL Central (it would be 5 of 6, but Houston moved to the AL a couple of years ago). In any case, the Mets have not accepted the prediction that they are an 'also ran' team, and continue to rack up wins in the best division in baseball., 37374=1/16/14: The Mets have been on the fast track to nowhere for close to a decade now. It almost seems like the hangover from being eliminated by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006 never left. But better days seem on the way in Queens. New York has done a pretty good job of acquiring and developing talent for the past several years. Some new faces may add some excitement to the team in 2014, including Ivan Wilson and Casey Meisner. Pitcher Zach Wheeler should be full time this season as well. They may be a year or two away, but look out for the Mets in the near future., 26208=5/15/14: The Mets are not doing well in the win column this season and are two games under 500 as the season nears the one quarter mark. Fortunately, the NL East is a bit down this season and the Mets are only three games out of first place. 2014 may not be the year the team makes it to the postseason, but 2015 could be a breakout campaign. In preparation to next season, the Mets got good news that staff ace Matt Harvey has taken the next step in his recovery from Tommy John surgery. He expanded his throwing distance from 90 to 120 feet last week and hopes to begin throwing off of a mound on June 10., 7282=3/25/15: This year, 2015, is supposed to be the New York Mets shed the adjective 'hapless' from the headlines. They have been gearing up for this season for awhile now and have one of the best young pitching rotations to prove it. Hopefully for them, the season does not get derailed before it starts. Starter Zach Wheeler is out for the season with a torn UCL (meaning Tommy John surgery). As it turns out, he had a torn tendon last year and simply pitched through the pain. Losing Wheeler is a tough blow to the Mets, but they may be good enough to get through the season without him and make the playoffs., 14759=10/8/14: The Mets are on the proverbial golf course right now rather than playing meaningful October baseball. But that does not mean that baseball operations have ceased. The team, last Thursday, announced that they fired hitting coach Lamar Johnson and assistant hitting coach Luis Natera. The Mets were middle of the pack in most hitting categories, so while there is room for improvement, it is not like they were awful. The rest of the coaching staff is expected to return, but this could mean that Wally Backman will get the full time promotion to the Major League team., 57983=5/23/13: First basemen, Ike Davis is possibly facing being demoted to the minors. Monday night in the Mets vs Reds Ike grounded out leaving bases loaded in the first inning. He then struck out twice and cost the team a run with an obstruction call. Finally the crowd hissed and booed him out after a double-switch in the seventh inning. Reben Tejada is also in the discussion of possible demotion after terrible results while in Spring training. He's had difficulty both offensively and defensively this year with a few mistakes. If demoted then Omar Quintanilla would take his place as starting short stop., 32541=3/13/14: Good news from the New York Mets side this week as pitcher Jon Niese has been cleared to play again. Niese showed some shoulder soreness at the end of February. He was sent back to New York for scans, but the MRI did not reveal any structural damage. He did throw two pain free innings in an intrasquad game last Thursday. If all goes well and Niese continues to throw without any discomfort, then he is slated to open the season for the Mets on March 31 against the Washington Nationals. Niese pitched 143 innings last season with 105 strikeouts and a 3.71 ERA., 45172=10/17/13: The emergence of starting pitchers Matt Harvey and Zack Wheeler seemed to be good signs for the Mets, and that still could happen. Unfortunately, Harvey will undergo Tommy John surgery and will be lost for the 2014 season. That does not mean that the Mets are necessarily out of luck next year. The team has a lot of talent in AAA ball in terms of starting pitching, not to mention that Wheeler was very good once he got called up mid-season. They may not be able to make the leap next season, but should be in great position once Harvey returns, likely in 2015., 48092=9/12/13: New York Mets ace pitcher Matt Harvey is trying to avoid Tommy John surgery if he can. Harvey has a torn UCL in his elbow, and the repairs and recovery could take well over a year. It is quite possibly that he misses the entire 2014 season. That would be a huge blow to the Mets who are just now showing glimpses of life in their pitching rotation of the future with their prospects. In other news, third baseman David Wright will try to come back before the end of the season. That may be an exercise in futility, but would be good for Wright and the fans., 46323=10/3/13: The Mets got a big scare last Thursday when star third baseman David Wright was hit in the back of a head with a pitch. Fortunately, Wright was able to return to the lineup for Saturday's game against the Brewers. Wright passed all of his concussion tests, but he did injure his thumb while trying to avoid the pitch. Wright had missed the previous seven weeks with a hamstring injury. He will not be getting hurt anymore this season as the regular season is over. Now Wright can get fully healthy for strong return in 2014., 34361=2/20/14: A brief story from the \"Nice Files\" this week for the Mets. The team announced that they would wear an honorary patch for long-time announcer Ralph Kiner during the 2014 season. Kiner passed away earlier in the month and was in the Mets broadcast booth for over 50 years. Prior to being a broadcaster, Kiner had a great career in Pittsburgh where he was one of the best sluggers of his day. The patch features a radio microphone, Kiner's name and his life years of 1922 to 2014. A very classy and touching tribute for a man that gave over 60 years of his life to the game., 61080=9/27/12 ? The magic number for RA Dickey was 20. Against the Pittsburgh Pirates he reached that number. Dickey struck out 13 in 7 2/3 innings en route to a 6-5 win. He was shaky early, allowing three runs during the first four innings of the game. But, the Mets offense was there to pick him up. Ike Davis hit his 31st home run of the year and David Wright hit a three-run opposite- field blast to put the Mets up for good. Dickey became the first knuckleballer to win 20 games since 1980 and became the first Mets pitcher to win 20 since Frank Viola did it in 1990. With one more start to go and the NL CY Young within his reach, Dickey leads the National League in strikeouts (222) and innings pitched (227.2) and is second in wins (20) and ERA (2.69)., 60470=3/28/13: The Mets informed left handed relief pitcher Pedro Feliciano that he will not make the opening day roster, but instead will be sent to triple A ball for a month to build his arm strength. Feliciano played for the Mets for eight years and set a club record for most relief appearances in a season in 2010 with 92. But he spent the last two seasons with the crosstown Yankees - he missed that time with shoulder injuries and has therefore lost velocity. Feliciano claims he feels good, but understands that he needs to get more arm strength before he can be effective on a daily basis., 39791=12/19/13: The Mets added Curtis Granderson and Chris Young to bolster their outfield a couple of weeks ago, but they were not finished with their offseason shopping. During the Winter Meetings in Orlando, Florida, the Mets signed veteran starting pitcher Bartolo Colon to a two year, $20 million deal. Colon had a wonderful career resurgence in Oakland over the past two years. Despite his age, he has shown that he can still pitch effectively, and the Mets have to hope that he can help fill the void with ace Matt Harvey likely out for 2014 with Tommy John injury., 61852=While the demolition of Shea Stadium in 2008 saddened many fans, that feeling was quickly alleviated when Citi Field opened its gates. The time and attention to detail devoted to the design and construction of Citi Field is fitting of a stadium in the Big Apple. Citi Field plays heavy homage to the Brooklyn Dodgers of old, so much so to the point that it caused controversy when the stadium first opened! Despite that, many are fans of the stadium, which strives to create a bridge from past to present. Outside of a few concerts here and there and maybe the oddball soccer event, Citi Field is exclusively home to the New York Mets. While the team has seen little success in recent years, the fans still come out in droves on a daily basis. The passionate New York fanbase will support the team through thick and thin, ensuring a festive atmosphere for fans. Located in Queens, Citi Field is easily accessible through almost any means of New York City mass transit. Hopping on the train after work to catch the 7:05 first pitch should never be a problem. Once you arrive at the stadium, there are a variety of things to do and see. Once you take your first steps in, immediately noticeable is the Jackie Robinson rotunda, a shrine to the former Dodger great. After that, there are ample other attractions, such as FanFest areas and countless restaurants and bars. Once you actually get around to watching the game, many agree that the Field is one of the best in the country. Citi Field has been a NYC staple since it opened and will be for the foreseeable future., 56649=6/6/13: Sure the Mets are struggling this season, but this information should indicate how much. The Miami Marlins are the worst team in the league. The Cardinals and Reds both won more games in May than the Marlins have won all year. But for some reason, the Marlins have the Mets number. The Mets are the only team that the Marlins have a winning record against. Every once in a while, a lowly team beats a top team - that happens. But the consistent beatings to the hands of the Marlins is embarrassing. A cynic may say that the Marlins players are simply playing harder against the Mets because they are auditioning to be on the team next year., 12847=11/12/14: Everyone could see that Mets third baseman David Wright was not right this past season. He hit career lows with only eight home runs and a meager .693 OPS in 134 games. He was shelved at the end of the season due to a bruised rotator cuff (shoulder). Wright is making \"marked improvement\" on the injury, which is good news for the Mets. He has avoided surgery so far, and if this continues, may be able to resume some baseball activities in December. The hope is that they can get this taken care of completely in the offseason and give Wright a full spring training., 44572=10/24/13: The Mets have struggled for so long that it may seem inconceivable that the team could be competitive next season and for a while after that. It is understood that Atlanta and Washington are the class of the NL East, but the Mets could sneak up on some people next season. Even with ace pitcher Matt Harvey likely to miss all of 2014, the team has a silo filled with great young arms starting with Zack Wheeler. They could use some some more offense, particularly in the outfield - so do not be surprised to see them go after free agents like Nelson Cruz or Robinson Cano., 13452=10/29/14: The Mets have taken a largely organic path to rebuilding their team. They have more than a few young and strong arms that have or are coming out of their farm system - and that does not even include Matt Harvey, who missed all of the 2014 season while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery. At some point, however, it makes sense to add an accomplished veteran that contribute. So it seems logical that the Mets are interested in Colorado Rockies outfielder Micheal Cuddyer. Cuddyer won the batting trophy in 2013 but was injured much of this past season. Still, and at 36 years old, he can hit. That would be a nice addition if he can stay healthy., 57315=5/30/13: Friday night's series opener was suspended after eight innings tying with the Braves. Jason Heyward is still recovering from an emergency appendectomy he had back in late April. While first baseman Ike Davis continues to be in a slump. The Manager, Collins said: \"\"It looks like we're going to be sitting here for a while...that hopefully maybe by 8 it lightens up. But I know one thing: They're not going to start this game... it's too big a game for both teams with the guys we've got going....to think, 'Hey, let's see if we can get three or four innings in and maybe five.' I don't think that'll be the case.\"\" \", 9107=3/4/15: Great news for the Mets and their rotation as ace pitcher Matt Harvey is tentatively scheduled to get his first pithing action in a long time on March 6th. He will be taking the mound against the Detroit Tigers in the Grapefruit League and that will be his first game since August 24, 2013. He missed the last month of the 2013 season and all of 2014 recovering from Tommy John surgery. Harvey wanted to try to pitch late last season, but the Mets were wise enough to prevent him from doing that, preferring to save him until the 2015 season., 48676=9/4/13: Devastation in the Mets organization as it was confirmed that staff ace and rookie of the year candidate Matt Harvey has a partially torn UCL. Obviously he is out for the rest of this season, but the danger is that he may miss the entire 2014 campaign as he may need to undergo Tommy John surgery. In a great show of class, Phillies pitcher Roy Halladay reached out to Harvey with some advice. Harvey has Cy Young Award talent and his loss may really affect the Mets rebuilding efforts. The Mets have more pitching talent in the wings, but Harvey already looks special., 31267=3/27/14: The injury woes for the Atlanta Braves have been well documented in recent weeks, as both Kris Medlen and Brandon Beachy (pitchers) are out for the season with elbow injures that require Tommy John surgery. The Mets are not immune to pitching injuries either. Ace Matt Harvey is likely done for the year following his own Tommy John surgery and projected opening day starter John Niese has his own issues. The Mets are now expected to use Dillon Gee as their opening day starter. That game is on March 31 against the Washington Nationals. If Gee does not get the start, then it is likely the Mets would turn to veteran Bartolo Colon., 15353=10/1/14: The Mets are certainly a developing team, one that has a real chance to challenge the Nationals, Braves and Marlins in future years. The season is finished for this year's version of the team, but there are certainly positive signs of life. Star third baseman David Wright is expected to be a part of that future. The Mets shut him down with shoulder soreness on September 9th, but have now discovered that he has ligament damage. The hope now is that a strengthening program for six weeks will help. If not, then he may have to undergo surgery in the offseason., 14125=10/15/14: The Mets were not terrible at the plate this past season, but they were hardly a Murderers' Row either. Instead, they were merely average. They fired hitting coach Dave Hudgens in May, then named Lamar Johnson as his replacement with Luis Natera as the assistant hitting coach. They fired those two after the season ended. The team may be looking at Kevin Long to take the position. Long was just fired by the Yankees after serving as their hitting coach for eight years. There is no rush to get a new coach, but, with several jobs available, the Mets may be wise to get their guy sooner rather than later., 65061=Stephen Strasburg struck out 11 in seven innings in the Washington Nationals 5-2 victory over the New York Mets. The win gives the Nationals a sweep over their rivals and the Mets continue to struggle in the second half of the season. Since the All-Star break, the Mets have lost 11 of 12 games. With injuries to Johan Santana and Dillon Gee and an offense that has stalled has the Mets fading fast. The team has called up top prospect Matt Harvey who is set to make his major league debut in Arizona. Harvey was drafted seventh overall in the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft. In 20 starts in Triple-A Buffalo, Harvey was 7-5 with a 3.68 ERA., 33130=3/6/14: Finally, some very good pitching news for the Mets. Yes, it is great that Matt Harvey made his first throws, but he will be rehabbing from Tommy John surgery all season and is not likely to play in 2014. However, closer Bobby Parnell faced batters for the first time since July 30 and reported no pain or issues with his neck. He had surgery in September to repair a herniated disk in his neck and it looks like he will be completely ready by Opening Day. He is also expected to make his spring training debut later this week in a 'B' game., 30634=4/3/14: Mets' closer Bobby Parnell blew a save in the opener on Monday night and complained of tightness in his right forearm after the game. It was more than just tightness, as tests revealed a partially torn medial collateral ligament in his right elbow. He may require surgery and could miss time. The team wasted no time in calling up veteran Kyle Farnsworth from the minors. This is the same injury that prompted Jeremy Hefner to undergo Tommy John surgery last August. Mets' ace Matt Harvey is already out for the year after Tommy John surgery and the Mets just do not need more blows to their pitching staff., 42830=11/14/13: One can be forgiven if one believed that LaTroy Hawkins had retired. The bullpen pitcher is 41 years old and was stuck on the Mets last season. But Hawkins had a great season and is now considered likely to return for at least one more season. He had a .293 ERA and an impressive 55-10 strike out to walk ratio. He also save 13 games for the Mets in 2013. He is not considered an everyday closer at this point in his career, but the crafty veteran certainly can get people out and can continue to be a fine set-up man.}",
