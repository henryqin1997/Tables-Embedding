Furthermore, the incidence of \"false positive\" predictions of recessions is dramatically reduced by utilizing a bivariate model that includes both a credit-spread measure and a term-spread measure. In 2006, for example, the yield curve was generally flat or inverted and hence models based solely on this variable signaled an alarmingly high probability of recession, whereas our data-preferred bivariate model is consistent with survey evidence indicating that financial-market participants perceived a very small risk of recession.5, 46871=Giacomini, R. and B. Rossi. 2006. \"How stable is the forecasting performance of the yield curve for output growth?\" Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, 68: 783-95., 23262=The final two columns of the table report the results of out-of-sample tests. Of all of the variables, the 10-year AA spread produced the highest out-of-sample recession probability for the months in 2001 when a recession actually occurred. Several of the other credit spreads also yielded average probabilities of over 50% during this time. Meanwhile, most term spreads produced recession probabilities between 20 and 40 percent. On the other hand, most of the credit spreads also gave out-of-sample recession probabilities well above the unconditional probability of 10.4% during the post-2001 expansion, while most interest rates and term spreads gave quite low probabilities., 6562=We begin the sample in 1988 in light of the evidence for a structural break in term-spread models mentioned above, as well as for practical considerations of data availability and reliability prior to the mid-1980s. However, there are also good economic reasons to limit attention to a relatively recent sample. The well known drop in real-side volatility that began in the 1980s--the \"Great Moderation\"--appears to have involved a decline in the frequency and duration of recessions, which is likely to have altered reduced-form forecasting relationships.6 Furthermore, financial markets developed at an unprecedented pace during this time, giving market access to a much larger class of investors and providing those investors increasingly diverse ways to place bets on their perceptions of the economic outlook. Thus, market signals today are likely to reflect a different set of factors than they did twenty years ago. Although beginning the sample in 1988 limits us to only sixteen recession-month observations, this turns out to be sufficient to draw strong statistical conclusions about which variables are important., 46311=Estrella, A. and M. R. Trubin. 2006. \"The yield curve as a leading indicator: Some practical issues.\" FRB New York Current Issues Economics and Finance, 12(5): 1-7., 41914=However, the skewness of the distribution implies that forecasting performance will be sensitive to the central-tendency measure used. Since we are evaluating forecast performance by mean absolute error--and thus assuming a linear loss function--the median is arguably more appropriate than the mean. The performance of the median across the distribution of models and parameters is shown in the last line of the table and as the dashed line in the figure. At least for the bivariate models, this measure outperforms any of the alternatives in terms of its prediction of the post-2001 expansion, with performance during the recession comparable to the Bayesian average of the ML estimates. Qualitatively, it looks quite similar to the Bayesian average of the ML forecasts that was presented in the previous section., 45562=Friedman, B. M. and K. N. Kuttner. 1992. \"Money, income, prices, and interest rates.\" American Economic Review, 82(3): 472-92., 45718=Estrella, A. and G. A. Hardouvelis. 1991. \"The term structure as a predictor of real economic activity.\" Journal of Finance, 46(2): 555-76., 45234=Chauvet, M. and S. Potter. 2005. \"Forecasting recessions using the yield curve.\" Journal of Forecasting, 24(2): 77-103., 26291=We note, however, that even the best credit spreads, by themselves, are not perfect predictors. In addition to the spike in 1998, the AA spread produces some false positives in the 2002-03 period. In other words, while term spreads may ignore important information about default risk, credit spreads may be overly sensitive to financial-market noise that is not necessarily linked to macroeconomic fundamentals. Presumably, information from both sources is potentially useful. This is precisely our motivation for considering bivariate models in the following section., 46505=Gertler, M. and C. S. Lown. 2000. \"The information in the high-yield bond spread for the business cycle: Evidence and some implications.\" NBER Working Paper 7549., 5663=Moreover, we find that Bayesian model averaging produces results far superior to simple model averaging in our out-of-sample forecasting exercises, in contrast to some previous studies that have found it to be inconsequential or even counterproductive. Because a large proportion of the models we consider turn out to have no meaningful forecasting ability, simple model averaging swamps the predictive power of the few informative models with overwhelming amounts of noise. On the other hand, because the models that fail at out-of-sample forecasting also generally have poor in-sample fit, Bayesian model averaging assigns them relatively little weight. The Bayesian model average thus discriminated quite strongly between the 2001 recession and the subsequent expansion, while the simple model average produced only slightly higher probabilities prior to the recession than afterwards., 28790=The bivariate models also do a better job in terms of out-of-sample predictability. All of the models in Table 2 would have predicted the 2001 recession with greater than 50 percent probability, and most would have given probabilities of over 90 percent. During the expansion, nearly all of these models would have produced recession probabilities of less than 10 percent, with several producing less than 5 percent. Again, the models including both term and credit spreads generally do the best job in the out-of-sample tests., 19174=where is the number of parameters in model .7 The BICs forms the basis for our in-sample model comparison. We compute these measures for each of the univariate and bivariate logit models discussed below, using monthly financial data from February 1988 through April 2006 (with R spanning February 1989 through April 2007)., 47477=Stock, J.

In particular, we consider monthly data for the period 1988 to 2007 for 54 different financial-market variables, including all of the series considered by SW03 as well as a variety of corporate credit spreads and several other distinct measures of market liquidity. Furthermore, we examine the entire space of bivariate statistical models to determine whether any of these models can provide a substantial improvement in the Bayesian information criterion or out-of-sample forecasting performance of the best univariate models. Finally, we investigate the benefits of combining individual model forecasts via either simple unweighted averaging or Bayesian model averaging (which places relatively greater weight on models with higher posterior probability)., 87363=This draft: 14 August 2007 Return to Text, 40811=Figure 4 tracks the resulting estimates of the mean recession probability (solid line), together with the middle 90 percent of the mass (shaded area). Due to the asymmetry, the mean recession probabilities tend to be closer to 50 percent than the ML probabilities. Thus, for example, as of April 2007, the ML estimates from the preferred bivariate model and the Bayesian average of the ML estimates both produce recession probabilities of essentially zero. However, accounting for the distribution across models and parameters, the mean probability was 12 percent, and the middle 90 percent of the distribution spanned 0 to 83 percent., 19986=We also perform (pseudo) out-of-sample tests. It is of interest to know both how well the models do in predicting recessions and how well they do in predicting expansions--that is, their type-I and type-II errors. We thus consider two test periods: (1) the 2001 recession, estimating the model on financial data through April 2000, and (2) the post-2001 expansion, estimating on data through November 2000. In general, a successful model should generate high recession probabilities in the first period and low probabilities in the second period.8, 46077=Estrella, A., A. P. Rodrigues, and S. Schich. 2003. \"How stable is the predictive power of the yield curve? Evidence from Germany and the United States.\" Review of Economics and Statistics, 85(3): 629-44., 67688=Notes: Sample begins in February 1989, using independent variables from one year earlier. \"Odds\" in the third column are Bayes factors, computed as in equation (2), relative to the model using only the AA 10-year credit spread.., 23952=Figure 1 provides some further insight into the relative performance of credit and term spreads over this sample by plotting the in-sample recession probabilities produced by the lowest-BIC model of each type. The horizontal line indicates the unconditional recession probability of 7.3 percent. The relatively poor performance of the term spread (the dashed line) is driven primarily by three episodes. First, although the yield curve did invert prior to the 1990-91 recession, its most dramatic dip was in March of 1989, too far in advance of first official recession month, which occurred in August of the following year.11 By contrast, the credit spread (the solid line) began rising precisely in August 1989. The second episode occurs in 1997-98, a period in which the yield curve was flat, producing recession probabilities of over 20% for several months in a row. Meanwhile, credit spreads remained quite low, except for a brief spike following the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in October 1998. Finally, toward the end of our sample the yield curve again inverted, even as corporate spreads remained at historic lows. Since no official recession had materialized by April 2007, this represents a failure of the term-spread model., 43991=To keep the analysis focused, we have confined our attention to univariate and bivariate models of recessions estimated on post-1987 data. Possibilities for future work would be to relax these restrictions. For reasons suggested above, focusing only on the recent data appears appropriate, but an interesting extension would be to trace the performance of credit spreads in earlier periods. Examining other measures of economic performance, such as GDP growth, may also provide additional insight. Finally, it may be that including more than two variables could improve the performance of the logit models even further., 47653=Wright, J. H. 2006. \"The yield curve and predicting recessions.\" FEDS Working Paper 2006-7., 45383=Dotsey, M. 1998. \"The predictive content of the interest rate term spread for future economic growth.\" FRB Richmond Economic Quarterly, 84(3): 31-51., 25355=It is also instructive to consider some models that perform even less well. The solid line in Figure 2 gives the predictions of the ten-year high-yield credit spread. Junk-bond spreads frequently receive attention in the press because fragile firms may be especially sensitive to economic and financial deterioration. However, as the graph indicates, this sensitivity may also lead to false positives--notably, during the turmoil of 2002 and 2003, a period of financial turmoil in the wake of scandals at Enron and elsewhere. The dotted line in the graph presents the predictions of the worst-performing model, which uses the second difference of log silver prices. The recession probabilities generated by this model are nearly indistinguishable from the constant-probability case. The consideration of such models will dampen the simple model-average forecasts (but not the optimally weighted forecasts) we construct below., 47073=Hamilton, J. D. and D. H.
