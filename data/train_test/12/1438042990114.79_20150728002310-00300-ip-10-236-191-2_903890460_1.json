            "Mary Baldwin is great for people who don't mind being in a small and very quiet town. If you like being out in the country then you will like it here. It's a very beautiful place to look at. If you're serious about your education then this a good place for you as well because it's a good place to get some studying done.",
            "Mary Baldwin is a great school, but if you have to be fully aware that it may be a complete change from the environment that you're used to at home. This can be true for other schools as well. Mary Baldwin College is an all girls school in a very small town. Before deciding to live there you have to think about whether or not it's the right environment for you. It's important to visit and check out the dorms and all the facilities before attending any school not just Mary Baldwin.",
            "Because Mary Baldwin is a private college, it comes at a pretty high cost. Whether or not the Baldwin experience is worth the money is a decision that can really only be made by each individual student. I feel that I'm getting my money's worth at Mary Baldwin. I enjoy the learning environment and the social environment at school. The dorms are nice as well. Freshmen dorms all com equipped with floor to ceiling storage and a sink and mirror. The dorms also have lounge areas and kitchens. There is also a gym that is free for students. They even offer free workout classes throughout the week.",
            "Mary Baldwin is located in Staunton Virginia, which is a very call town. Being in a small town is something that was hard to get used to because it's unlike home in the suburbs. There are a number of school events put on by different clubs and organizations. This gives the students something to do on a weeknight or a weekend. I personally come to enjoy the small town environment because I feel the school is more oriented towards studying than partying. Even so, that doesn't mean we don't have fun. The school has organized carnival events, mixers, shopping trips, spa days and each Saturday night there is an event for anyone who wants to come. The clubs and organizations put together a wide range of activities for students to become involved with. If you like volunteering and being socially involved or if you like watching improve there will always be something for you to do around campus. If campus events aren't your thing then there is always a party scene at JMU, which is thirty minutes away. There are also events that happen in downtown Staunton for people who like live bands and good food.",
            "The courses at Mary Baldwin can definitely be challenging. Of course some classes are harder than others and some professors are more helpful than others, but the small class size creates an environment where students can connect with their professors better. General education classes at Mary Baldwin have about twenty students. The ability to connect with fellow students and professors in small classes has been helpful to me because I can follow along to the lectures and ask questions when I need to. I really feel as though I have learned a lot this semester."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{176014=Every October MBC has Apple Eve and Apple Day. Apple Eve there is a huge gathering in the gym, where each class plays dodge ball against each other and at the end there is a huge dance party. On Apple Day, students can choose to go pick apples for charity or they can sleep in. The dining hall cooks an amazing feast that puts Harry Potter feasts to shame and in the afternoon there is a carnival., 217857=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 42141=You get what you are paying for. Tuition pays for FIVE academic terms. Fall term, Spring term and May term. May term is an extra three week term that ends by the usual time other schools ends. You will take up to four credit classes and only take them for three weeks. Fun classes are given during this term. So in short, you get a lot of classes done. My Freshman year I finished 39 credit hours. This is considered a lot, but you have the opportunity to get a lot of classes done in a short time period., 110320=Clubs and activities are active and meet / occur often. There is always something to do at Baldwin (unless it's 1o'clock in the morning and you're just bored XD)., 83418=Mary Baldwin offers classes that area colleges don't offer. In the Spring of 2011 I was able to take a History of Furniture class for Art History. This is a class that you would not be able to take at any other college. Here you can expand your learning for the same price as any other class on campus., 51476=Tuition, room, and board for 2011-2012 totaled to $36,500 which is admittedly very expensive but MBC generally makes it worth the money., 67174=This is included in your tuition. Unfortunately, there are only two dining facilities on campus and no dining dollars for off-campus dining. Additionally, there are pretty limited closing hours (breakfast ends at 9:30, lunch at 1:30 and dinner at 7:30) and the food is cafeteria-style, no seconds until the last half hour of dining, and yes this is enforced. For the vegetarians,vegans, and people that eat halal/Kosher there are very limited pickings, though there is a salad bar that is always open. Dining services boasts in their healthy choices, but not in tasty ones...}",

Not a party school. Tips for prospective students Study and get involved. Bang for the buck There is a wide variety of classes but there are a lot which are not offered more than every other year. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus and plenty of leadership chances. Am enjoying being here It is a very small town and campus but allows you to get to know people well. Not always a lot to do around town over the weekends. However, there is always plenty to do on campus! Am learning a lot",
