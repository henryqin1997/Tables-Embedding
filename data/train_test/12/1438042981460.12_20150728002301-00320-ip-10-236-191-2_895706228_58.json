            "There are tons of clubs and organizations that one can join for fun along with the greek life and intramural play. San Francisco is about a 40 minute drive which is full of entertainment and great places to sight see.",
            "The dining and food are just like any other location with the same meal plans and food. We are currently opening up a new dining court that will hopefully boost the experience to a five star experience.",
            "One thing that attracts most students are the amazing student dorms or should I say suites. These are one of the best on-campus living situation in the nation and I really enjoyed my time in them.",
            "The classes are small and the teachers are very nice and helpful making the classes that much easier to pass. There are also an abundance of tutors that will help anyone at anytime.",
            "A tip for prospective student is to make friends as soon as possible, all though most of the students are very friendly the best thing to do is make as many as quickly as possible. Everyone is just like you willing to make friends so it will be very easy to make friends the first month compared to the last.",
            "I have enjoyed my time so far here at Sonoma State. As a californian i have felt comfortable here because of all the local student body that attend it. I also enjoy the location and campus of the school, away from it all yet close enough to San Francisco to go during the weekends."

Charlie Brown's has okay food and severely overpriced drinks. The University Restaurant, which is sort of a secret more up scale place to eat, has both okay service and okay food. In 2012, though, they started building a new building, which is supposedly going to have more food options, maybe even ones like Subway, or other fast food places, so future students might have more options., 215727=Most traditions are pretty normal here, except there is a Geek Week, which pokes fun at Greek Week. Geek Week happens every Spring semester in March, and is a time for students in math, technology, science and engineering classes to participate in contests and generally conduct activities related to these subjects. All students can participate, not just STEM majors., 242136=Very nice dorms. Some built in 2011. Alot of student mixer type events and Co-op groups.}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 11 out of 12 people found this review useful. 2 of 72 Categories Comments Tips for prospective students -I would try and check out the school and as many schools that you are interested in. -Research your major/minor and programs and see if the school has a good reputation -Keep your grades up! -Always check your Sonoma State online portal to make sure you meet all the deadlines -Make a pro/con list of each school you visit and make your decision for you. Bang for the buck College now a days in general is expensive, and Sonoma state costs roughly about $20,000-$21,000. If you try to get scholarships, grants, and apply for your FAFSA ahead of time, I'm sure you can get at least half of your tuition and fees paid off. Will enjoy being here Being from a big city, I am already used to",
