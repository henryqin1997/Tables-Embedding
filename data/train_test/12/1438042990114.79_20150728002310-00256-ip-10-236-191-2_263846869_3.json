Former members include Prime Minister Stanley Bruce (1918-29, 1931-33). Phillip Lynch (1966-82) and Peter Reith (1982-83, 1984-2001). Flinders has seen the end of two Prime Ministers and one Opposition Leader. Bruce became the only Prime Minister to lose his seat when defeated at the 1929 election, and in 1967, Prime Minister Harold Holt disappeared without trace while swimming at Cheviot Beach in the electorate. Labor's failure to win the December 1982 by-election renewed the leadership tension that lead to Bob Hawke replacing Bill Hayden as Labor Leader. The winner of that by-election, local solicitor Peter Reith, lost his seat at the 1983 election before he had the chance to be sworn into Parliament, but returned in 1984, serving as Deputy Liberal Leader 1980-83 and Minister for Industrial Relations in the first two terms of the Howard government. He retired at the 2001 election, his successful efforts to achieve waterfront reform earning the ire of the union movement, but the more mundane 'telecard' affair earning him the greatest public opprobrium., 1810=Liberal majorities were recorded in 54 of the 56 booths within the electorate in 2004. The best and worst Liberal booths were on opposite sides of Western port, rising from 47.5% at Shoreham Hall on the western shore to 87.0% at the Kernot Community Centre to the east., 1469=The son of a former state Liberal MP, Greg Hunt was born in Frankston and raised in Mornington and went on to study law at Melbourne University, graduating with first class honours before winning a Fulbright Scholarship to complete a Masters in International Relations at Yale University in the United States. While at Melbourne University, Hunt captained the Australian Universities Debating Team. Hunt was appointed a Parliamentary Secretary after the 2004 election, initially to the Minister for Environment and Heritage, speaking often on water and sewage re-cycling issues before Malcolm Turnbull's appointment to the Ministry. He shifted to be Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in early 2007. Hunt turns 42 in the week before the election. Labor's candidate is Gary March, who was raised and educated in Frankston before taking up an engineering cadetship in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1981. He became an engineering officer, working in Sydney and Melbourne before entering the public service in 1992 as an engineer in the Department of Defence in Canberra. In 1995 he returned to the Mornington Peninsula and took up a position at BlueScope Steel\u0092s Western Port steel plant, where he works in Occupational Health and Safety. He holds a Bachelor of Engineering, an MBA and has recently completed a Bachelor of Laws.}",
