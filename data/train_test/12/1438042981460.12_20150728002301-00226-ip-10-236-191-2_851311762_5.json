No handlers could be found for services with IDs: <list of service IDs that are not present in the target instance but prsent in the archive> For example:  No handlers could be found for services with IDs: oracle.webcenter.collab.forum oracle.webcenter.collab.rtc Solution You can work around this problem by either adding the services to the target, or removing the service-related info from the data.xml file of the archive as described below. To remove service-related info: Extract the archive. The archive contains two files: policy-store.xml and transport.mar. Expand the transport.mar into a directory. The data.xml file is located in the oracle\\webcenter\\lifecycle\\importexport directory. Remove the service tags for all the services that are not present in the target as listed in the error message. For the example error message above, we would need to remove the following:  <service id=\"oracle.webcenter.collab.forum\" version=\"11.1.1.0\"> <metadataUsages> <metadataUsage includeBaseDocuments=\"YES\" includeSystemCustomizations=\"YES\"> <paths> <include path=\"/oracle/webcenter/collab/forum/scopedMD/s516227ec_dde1_4991_9e18_28d487cb3bce/**\"/> </paths> </metadataUsage> </metadataUsages> </service> <service id=\"oracle.webcenter.collab.rtc\" version=\"11.1.1.0\"/> Repack the transport.mar file by zipping the top-level directories Oracle and pagedefs into a file named",
