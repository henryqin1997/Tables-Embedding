I love PPCC because of the degree plan I had set up and the staff. The staff members there try to work with you and help as much as they can, also the class sizes are perfect not to big and not to small., 268265=Will start classes August 2013 but so far has been great, 1742=The tuition of Pikes Peak is a decent price and financial aid really helps too.

Great for these types of students students who want one-on-one help from the teacher and great interaction between fellow students. Bang for the buck with in-state tuition at less than $3500, earning a two year degree cannot be cheaper. What to do for fun find a study group. this is a great way to meet new people and get help outside the classroom. Food and Dining the cafeteria is good, healthy food at a good price. Dorm Life pikes peak does not have dorms. Academic Rigor since this is a community college, this is not the most competitive learning environment. it is college, so not a place to be lazy either. Tips for prospective students always be on time to classes and listen to what the teachers say. if it sounds important, write it down! In three sentences",
