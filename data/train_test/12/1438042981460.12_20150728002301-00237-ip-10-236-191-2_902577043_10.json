            "The campus is completely safe. We've never had anything bad happen (no robberies,intruders, anything) for at least the 2 years I've been here. no one really even locks their car doors, it's THAT safe.",
            "None.",
            "There are about 8 clubs on campus.",
            "Anyone who wants a small school with little rigor. One-on-one help from professors is very common, with a class size of 10-40 people. If you don't mind having no social life within campus, and want to get a degree cheap, this is the school for you!",
            "There's a center court yard in the middle of Founder's Hall, not many people use it so if it's nice outside, it's a good place for studying or if you're just on a break.",
            "I'd say that for the little you pay to attend here, you are getting an education, maybe not the highest quality, but a degree nonetheless.",
            "Again, joining clubs is about the best you can do without going 30-40 mi away. I'ts a small rural area. A few bowling alleys are close, and a small mall.",
            "There is a cafeteria where they serve a few different items to eat. Most students pack their lunches, or don't eat at the college at all. There is a Hardee's down the road, but thats the only other eating place within a close proximity",
            "It literally doesn't exist; this is a commuter school.",
            "The school is a commuter, community college, where a lot of older people come to finish their degree, or change their life path, so many professors go slow to make sure everyone understands.",
            "The only tip I have is to join clubs; it's literally the only way to meet people with he same basic interests that you have.",
            "Kent State at Tuscarawas is a very small campus, with all age groups attending because everyone commutes. It's a nice school if you're only looking for an education with virtually no social interaction. You won't make many friends, BUT if you need help, most professors are willing to help."
