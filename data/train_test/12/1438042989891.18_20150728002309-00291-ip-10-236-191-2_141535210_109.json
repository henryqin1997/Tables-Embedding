    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{12001=This collection contains the literary papers of author and illustrator Munro Leaf. Fifty-eight titles (both published and unpublished) are represented, most notably manuscript drafts and illustrations from Leaf\u2019s long-running Can Be Fun series, the original handwritten draft of The Story of Ferdinand (1936), an early draft of Noodle (1937), and a large pastel drawing of Noodle by the book\u2019s illustrator, Ludwig Bemelmans, inscribed to Munro and Margaret Leaf. Also of interest are Leaf\u2019s Watchbird cartoons and related materials, serialized in the Ladies' Home Journal and published in six compilations, and materials from his time in the Army during World War II and as a specialist for the United States Information Agency and Foreign Service. The collection dates between 1918 and 1983 (bulk 1936-1976) and includes audiotapes, blueline proofs, books, correspondence, clippings, drafts, a filmstrip, galley proofs, government memoranda, illustrations (primarily in graphite and pen and ink, but also in colored pencil, gouache, marker, and pastel), typescripts, photographs, promotional materials, and a scrapbook from one of Leaf\u2019s lecture tours. There is also a variety of unusual merchandise ephemera from the Walt Disney adaptation \u201cFerdinand the Bull\u201d (1938), including a charm bracelet, decorative buttons, and quilting squares., 4676=Gift of Margaret Leaf, 1977-1983., 12919=Leaf, Munro. \u201cJust for Fun.\u201d Publishers Weekly Volume 130: 1975., 16269=Munro Leaf was born in Hamilton, Maryland on December 4, 1905, and grew up in Washington, D.C. After receiving his B.A. from the University of Maryland and M.A. from Harvard University, Leaf first worked as an English teacher (including a stint at the Montgomery School, which was at that time a boys prep school in Wynnewood) before moving to New York City with his wife, Margaret, in 1932. His first city job was as a manuscript reader at Bobbs-Merrill, but within the year he had moved to the F.A. Stokes Company where he remained an editor and a director until leaving to write full-time in 1939., 15636=Leaf\u2019s first book, Grammar Can Be Fun, was the first in a long series of \u201cCan Be Fun\u201d books written and illustrated by Leaf. It was published by Stokes in 1934 and included his \u201cscratchy pencil indications of what the artist was supposed to draw.\u201d That same year Leaf published Lo, the Poor Indian under the pseudonym Mun, but tended to leave it out when recounting his career. Leaf\u2019s most lasting recognition was for writing The Story of Ferdinand, published in 1936 and illustrated by his friend Robert Lawson. Leaf wrote Ferdinand for Lawson, who had been disappointed with his lack of creative freedom as an illustrator. In 1938, Disney\u2019s short-film animated adaptation \u201cFerdinand the Bull\u201d was released to enormous fanfare and merchandising opportunities; Leaf was known to wryly comment that the hit movie made Leaf, Lawson, and their publisher Viking Press a grand total of $800 split three ways. Another big hit came in 1937 when Leaf collaborated with Ludwig Bemelmans, best known for writing and illustrating Madeleine (1939) and its sequels, on the book Noodle, inspired by Hendrik Van Loon\u2019s dachshund., 14365=Although Leaf is best remembered as an author of children\u2019s books, much of his life was spent working for the United States government. Leaf enlisted in the Army in 1942 and collaborated with Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss) on a War Department health pamphlet on malaria, \u201cThis Is Ann,\u201d although neither Leaf nor Geisel were credited. After leaving the Army in 1946, Leaf returned to the State Department as a Specialist in 1960, traveling with his wife on Foreign Service lecture tours throughout Europe and Asia. Many of his children\u2019s books of this period were directed towards explaining (and fighting) Communism and promoting world peace. Throughout his career, Leaf was highly regarded for his \u201cchalk talks\u201d to schoolchildren both in his home in Andover and around the world. Although he is perhaps most well-known for his collaborations with Lawson, Leaf was a prolific illustrator of what he called his \u201cstick figures.\u201d He acknowledged that \u201cI can\u2019t draw and I never said I could. I think I am equal to a five-year-old, if he did not go to a progressive school.\u201d Leaf published more than fifty books, most as author and illustrator, and many remain in print and widely read today.}",
