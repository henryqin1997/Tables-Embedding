Sorensen February 07, 2011, 25484=FDIC Center for Financial Research Working Paper No. 2011-03 Ming Liu, Jeremy Staum December 10, 2010, 24441=ABSTRACT Using a large sample of U.S. mortgages observed over the 2005-2009 period, we find that foreclosures are contagious. After controlling for major factors known to influence a borrower's decision to default, including borrower and loan characteristics, local demographic and economic conditions, and changes in property values, the likelihood of a mortgage default increases by as much as 24% with a one standard deviation increase in the foreclosure rate of the borrower's surrounding zipcode. We find that foreclosure contagion is most prevalent among strategic defaulters: borrowers who are underwater on their mortgage but are not likely to be financially distressed. Taken together, the evidence supports the notion that foreclosures are contagious., 20152=FDIC Center for Financial Research Working Paper No. 2011-07 Fabio Braggion, Steven Ongena March, 2011, 19188=ABSTRACT Beginning in 2000, Japan's postal saving system experienced a rapid outflow of funds as a large number of 10-Year Postal Saving Certificates were maturing. This paper exploits this episode as a natural experiment in order to investigate the effects of a government-owned depository institution on local economic performance. The results show that the prefectures in which local funds were more heavily invested in the postal saving system in the early 1990s tended to experience a larger shift of funds away from the postal saving system and that these prefectures performed better in terms of output and small business creation in the early 2000s., 19033=FDIC Center for Financial Research Working Paper No. 2011-08 Masami Imai July, 2011, 24221=FDIC Center for Financial Research Working Paper No. 2011-04 Ryan M.

We find that among the largest 100 corporate bond funds the use of CDS has increased from 20% in 2004 to 60% in 2008. Among CDS users, the average size of CDS positions (measured by their notional values) increased from 2% to almost 14% of a fund's net asset value. Some funds exceed this level by a wide margin. CDS are predominantly used to increase a fund's exposure to credit risks rather than to hedge credit risk. Consistent with fund tournaments, underperforming funds use multi-name CDS to increase their credit risk exposures. Finally, funds that use CDS underperform funds that do not use CDS. Part of this underperformance is caused by poor market timing., 28074=FDIC Center for Financial Research Working Paper No. 2011-01 Tim Adam, Andre Guettler November 19, 2010, 22539=FDIC Center for Financial Research Working Paper No. 2011-05 Manju Puri, J\ufffdrg Rocholl, Sascha Steffen June 18, 2010, 22726=ABSTRACT This paper examines the broader effects of the U.S. financial crisis on global lending to retail customers. In particular we examine retail bank lending in Germany using a unique dataset of German savings banks during the period 2006 through 2008 for which we have the universe of loan applications and loans granted. Our experimental setting allows us to distinguish between savings banks affected by the U.S. financial crisis through their holdings in Landesbanken with substantial subprime exposure and unaffected savings banks. The data enable us to distinguish between demand and supply side effects of bank lending and find that the U.S. financial crisis induced a contraction in the supply of retail lending in Germany. While demand for loans goes down, it is not substantially different for the affected and non-affected banks. More importantly, we find evidence of a significant supply side effect in that the affected banks reject substantially more loan applications than non-affected banks. This result is particularly strong for smaller and more liquidity-constrained banks as well as for mortgage as compared to consumer loans. We also find that bank-depositor relationships help mitigate these supply side effects.}",
