            "In light of the 'shooting' we recently had on campus, safety is still a top priority. Of course, the shooters ended up being boys on the football team with an airsoft gun, but campus police handled it very seriously. Security is a big part of why I chose this school and I could not be happier with how the situation was handled.",
            "Love it. It's a large portion of campus, about one fourth of the students are affiliated. We also have the Divine Nine. I have been told that it is hard to get into parties if you're not Greek or do not know someone.",
            "We have Greek life, environmental clubs, and even a squirrel watching club. There really is something for everybody.",
            "People who do well in lectures. Some of my classes are about four hundred people. You also need to be willing to take time to study and sometimes teach yourself the material. Enjoying sports is also recommended because athletics is such a big part of campus.",
            "Keeneland is a big deal here. Being an out of stater I didn't fully understand the hyper at first, but Keeneland is a lot of fun! There's scholarship day where students are enrolled in a chance to win and the first 2,000 students get swag bags.",
            "I'm paying out of state so I feel like for what I'm paying the food should be a bit better. With that said, health care is free. I have made plenty of visits to the clinic due to a health issue and they have been nothing but kind to me, and nothing came out of pocket. That cannot be said for many other institutions.",
            "I am in a sorority so my sisters and I like to hang out, go to sporting events (I like hockey), and go out for food.",
            "Most of the dining halls are pretty good, but always have food in your dorm for when you don't feel like leaving your room for food. Every once in a while treat yourself to a restaurant off campus to remind yourself that great food is still available to you.",
            "I live in the cheapest dorms on campus, so they can get pretty gross, but having a bunch of people who have never lived alone all together will make for a somewhat unhealthy environment. I have been in the nice dorms and they are amazing. The best part about dorm life is that there is always someone there who can help you if you need anything.",
            "I know many people who study as often as they can. I often see people studying outside of buildings in between their classes and my sorority has mandatory study hours if your GPA is below a certain number.",
            "Be ready to walk. The average student walks about 3.1 miles a day, which isn't that much but it is enough to kick your butt the first week or so until you get used to it. Also, on your tour try to eat at at least one dining hall and as many restaurants as you can on South Limestone to really get a feel for campus life.",
            "The University of Kentucky is everything I dreamed and more. I have found my place in my major as well as in my sorority. There is a wonderful balance between academics and fun, and campus offers tons of events for you to go meet people and get involved."

I went from getting kicked out to returning three years later and accomplished a 3.25 GPA for the semester., 356203=This campus is gorgeous, there are safety measures everywhere, and everyone is incredibly helpful. I have yet to see someone who wouldn't point me in the right direction (or give me a completely random high-five when she realized we had the same major). I wish it was August already, and move-in day., 786307=Tour the campus in October - you'll see how big and beautiful the campus truly is before it's a little too chilly. Don't count UK out if you are from Lexington or a surrounding area: it can easily be your new home [somewhat] away from home!, 465115=Apply for scholarships and housing as soon as you can. The sooner you get this done the better chance you have of getting a good dorm or more scholarship money. Also apply for financial aid on Jan. 1., 513366=K Week introductory activities are awesome and a good way to get to know the campus, but don't get used to having fun and partying all the time. By September, you'll have to crack down on studying!, 355569=-Talk to everyone. That's why they're there. Financial aid counselor, admissions counselor, or just call. -Apply early. I had my application in as soon as I could (October) and got the decision letter in November. -GPA is important, so don't slack off, but practice your testing skills for the ACT or SAT. My GPA was 2.98, but I got accepted with an ACT score of 32. -Visit the campus anytime you get the chance. It's beautiful. And bring an umbrella!, 299375=The greek life is great they help with community service events the NPHC holds a Martin Luther King march every year which is fun. Also some of the Greeks in the NPHC have Yard shows, Step shows during homecoming and other fun events., 854033=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2528=When President Todd accepted the role as University President, he brought with him the Top 20 business plan meaning, thus, that the university will be a in the top 20 by the year 2020. Therefore, the University of Kentucky is making progress to become on of the top 20 schools in the nation. The William T. Young Library, a 58 million dollar complex, has the nation's second largest book endowment second only to Harvard University and is the largest among Public Universities. Also, on a side note the fifth floor was voted the best place on campus to get a date., 348057=Willy T which is the library is always filled during exam week and its almost a social event as well as a study event. Also during March Madness the city of lexington gets out of control and thats something that everyone should experience.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Even though UK is a pretty big school, they make it more like a small school by keeping many classes with a low student to teacher ratio, so you receive more one on one time with your instructor, which makes it easier to grasp the bigger concepts and master the small ones. Login to rate or flag the reviews Kelsey from Georgetown, KY 12/06/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 18 out of 18 people found this review useful. 3 of 196 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Anybody! UK is VERY diverse and offers opportunity for any kind of student. Tips for prospective students Definitely live on campus for at LEAST one year. It's awesome! Apply early for housing though... or you wont get your assignment until late summer and you definitely wont get the dorm you want. GET INVOLVED! There are so many opportunities to do this, don't worry. Take advantage of resources like The Study",
