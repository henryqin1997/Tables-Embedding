Lab Elite: The article you sent says , \u201cBiochemical characteristics, serology, genetic profile, virulence, or toxicity should be periodically reconfirmed as appropriate.\u201d Genetic information is included with the Lab Elite product. The Lab Elite product has a unique profile so it can be distinguished from other strains of the same species. http://www.microbiologics.com/Products/Lab-Elite If a laboratory is ISO:17025 accredited, they should use certified reference material (Lab Elite) when available. We sell some strains of organisms at high concentrations. If we do not have the microorganism which the customer needs at a high Epower concentration, you can fill out a Lyophilized Microorganism Request Form. When the demand for a certain product is high we try to add it to our catalog. An alternative is to ask the technical support department what the approximate concentration of an organism is. Another solution is to purchase the KWIK-STIK or LYFO DISK and make an inoculom from freshly grown organisms. Epower products can be used in inactivation studies because (according to the journal article) \u201chigh numbers of organisms are typically used, e.g. 6 to 7 log CFU/g. the target level of reduction, which influences the inoculums level used, may depend on the regulations for specific food types, e.g., a 5-log reduction of the appropriate pathogen in juice (21CFR 120.24)\u201d 3. Epower: Epower products are sold as a vial of 10 pellets at a specific concentration for example, 104, 106, 108). They come with a Certificate of Assay.",
