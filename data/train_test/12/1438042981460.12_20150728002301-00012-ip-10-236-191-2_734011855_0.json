    "textBeforeTable": "For cranking deep ledges and brush piles, try the DD22 series. These baits can be effectively fished as deep as 18+ feet on a long cast. They'll wake them up and move a lot of water with the medium wide wobble and built-in rattle. The 3/4 ounce weight will enable you to cast a long way for maximum depth and effectiveness. For mid-depths, try the Deep Little N. They offer all the fish- catching properties of the bigger baits in a smaller, 1/2 ounce package. These Norman crankbaits are an exceptional value and proven money- winners. You'll want a variety of colors at this price. When bass anglers talk about successful crankbaits, you can be sure that the Norman Crankbait will be included in the discussion. These 100% American made crankbaits have been around for a long time and are proven fish catchers. We carry only the Norman Pro Edge series because they stand head and shoulders above the other baits. The Norman Crankbait features deep lustrous finishes and a huge variety of colors. The diving bill and the attitude that the bait naturally swims at, enable these lures to come through and over underwater obstructions easily. If a hang up does occur, they float up backwards which will often free them automatically. Customer Reviews Description",
