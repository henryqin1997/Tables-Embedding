What interests you - temples, beaches, trekking, nature and wildlife, shopping and big city life, moon parties? What is not worthwhile to you could be very worthwhile to me. There is a wealth of info on this website and in the forums - but it can be overwhelming at first. I would suggest that you start here: http://www.travelfish.org/trip_planner/ and browse through some of the suggested itineraries. You will soon discover what grabs your interests and can go from there. At the bottom of each itinerary is a table of travel times between locations for trains, buses and flights - invaluable to get an idea of how much travel time you will need to allow for. The key thing is - don't try to do too much. A month in Laos and a month in Cambodia is a great and will allow you to do it a a reasonable relaxed pace. I myself am planning a month in Laos in Oct as well. I could share my plans with you - but with possible differences in age, interests, etc I don't know how much help it would be. For example, I have absolutely no interest in going to Vang Vieng so going there would probably be a waste of time - ie not worthwhile. But if you are a younger 20-something who likes to party it up, it may be worthwhile. Check out the itineraries in the link above, and tell us a bit more about what you are looking for - and we can all chip in to give you some ideaas.}",
