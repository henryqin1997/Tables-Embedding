    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations is a sagittal cross section of another embodiment of the invention, wherein an elastic component surrounds pieces that move along inclined planes. Loads on the upper tibial component force the moveable outward. The cushion component forces the movable components together as the load is removed from the tibial component. The elastic component is not exposed to shear or compression. The elastic component is only exposed to tension. This embodiment of the device is also described in co-pending provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/445,958, entitled \u201cComposite Components For Disc And Joint Replacements.\u201d FIG. 27 is a sagittal cross section of an alternative embodiment of the invention wherein the cushion element is enclosed within a flexible metal component. The cushion component, a sealed elastomer, or hydrogel, for example, is not exposed to the fluids of the body, which can degrade some materials. A somewhat similar device is described in co-pending provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/445,489, entitled \u201cImproved Longevity Elastic Components For ADRs.\u201d FIG. 26 is a sagittal cross section of an alternative embodiment of the invention including hydrogel as a cushion element 302. A flexible, preferably fluid permeable membrane 304 surrounds the hydrogel. Axial loads on the hydrogel are converted into hoop stress on the flexible membrane. In the preferred embodiment the flexible membrane is elastic. The flexible membrane or components above and below the hydrogel",
