    "textAfterTable": "Detailed Description: Advancements in HAART for HIV-infected children and adolescents are hindered by patient nonadherence. The availability of a powder formulation and the once-daily dosing schedule make ATV an attractive agent for improved adherence in pediatric treatment regimens. This study is designed to provide pharmacokinetic (PK) data to guide dosing recommendations for ATV, when given concurrently with or without low-dose RTV boost, in infants, children, and adolescents. During the study, the safety and tolerance of ATV (with or without low-dose RTV) will be closely monitored, and virologic efficacy data will be obtained. There are two parts to this study. Step I will take place in the United States and South Africa, and will be further divided into two sets of groups, Parts A and B. Part A participants will receive ATV only and Part B participants will receive ATV with low-dose RTV boost.
