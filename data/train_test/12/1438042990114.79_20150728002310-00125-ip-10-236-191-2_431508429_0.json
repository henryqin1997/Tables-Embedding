The front of the device is covered with Gorilla Glass 3, under which you'll find a 7.9-inch 2048x1536 IPS display made by Sharp. It isn't quite as bright as the miniature Apple tablet, but it is better calibrated, covering 97 per cent of the sRGB gamut.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "To put it into perspective, two SMXs can run Crysis 3 on medium settings at 720p at between 20-40fps, and Battlefield 4 at the same quality level at 30-50fps. The question is, what can one SMX achieve, and are the low-power CPU cores an issue? Let's get to the bottom of the issue by rolling out some benchmarks. Note that there's no x86 version of the latest GFXBench right now - so the Manhattan benchmark only runs on ARM devices for now, while Shield lacks the requisite high-end OpenGL ES support for this specific test. UPDATE 4/8/14 15:36: We've updated the MiPad with Android 4.4.4 and re-benched. We see a significant improvement in CPU tests. Overall then, the MiPad is a well-made device with a robust feature set, but obviously it's the brand new Tegra K1 that is the true star of the show. Nvidia's latest chip packs in four ARM A15 cores (along with a 'companion' core for low-power operation) along with a single SMX (a cluster of 192 CUDA cores) from the desktop Kepler graphics card architecture. This is where things get interesting - Kepler has support for all major rendering APIs, and is capable of phenomenal things. Rounding off the port selection we have a headphone jack on the top and a USB socket with OTG support on the bottom edge - here you can hook-up gamepads, mice etc, while the left-side of the unit houses a micro-SD slot capable of boosting storage by up to 128GB.",
    "textAfterTable": "We've benched the Tegra K1 against its predecessor, its Apple competition, the most popular x86 tablet on the market and the insanely wonderful Razer Edge. The aim here is simple - we're comparing Nvidia's new SoC with the best of the last generation, and the two best x86 performance monsters. The results are tantalising - Tegra K1 offers up a more-than-2x GPU boost over current-gen mobile technology, though CPU power is relatively more restrained with a 25 per cent boost - pretty much equivalent to the increase in clock-speed from Tegra 4 to K1. It's in looking towards the more powerful x86 devices that Tegra K1 becomes more interesting. 3DMark graphics scores suggest that it has 75 per cent of the raw rendering power of the Surface Pro 2 - a tablet that can run a great many modern era games. Looking towards the Razer Edge - featuring a dual-SMX Kepler chip operating at around 500MHz - the K1 has around 63 per cent of its GPU power. Re-familiarise yourself with the Edge review if you will - this thing can play Crysis 3 beautifully as long as you're sensible with your settings. Nvidia's marketing talked about Tegra K1 hitting the last-gen console standard - something John Carmack took issue with, but on a very rough scale, we'd say that the Surface Pro 2's GPU performance is fairly comparable to Xbox 360 and by that metric, it's close but not quite there. However, assuming that mobile graphics'",
