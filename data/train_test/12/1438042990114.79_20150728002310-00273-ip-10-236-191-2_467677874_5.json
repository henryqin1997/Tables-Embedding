Markov, N. C. Oglethorpe, et al., Hemodynamic electrocardiographic and metabolic effects of fructose diphosphate on acute myocardial ischemia, Am. Heart J. 100: 639-646, 1980). In experiments performed on animals, FDP was found to improve hemodynamic parameters, reduce arrhythmias and infarct size, and increase survival rate. (See A. K. Markov, N. C. Oglethorpe, et al., op. cit., and J. W. Starnes, K. S. Seiler, et al., Fructose-1,6-diphosphate improves efficiency of work in isolated perfused rat heart, Am. J. Physiol. 262: M380-M384, 1992. All of these articles are incorporated herein by reference.), 32012=In a recent study, the effect of irradiation of the blood (subclavian artery) by He\u2014Ne lasers in patients after MI was observed (see N. N. Kipshidze et al., Intravascular laser therapy of acute myocardial infarction, Angiology 801-808, September 1990, which is incorporated herein by reference). The study reports a better recovery of the laser-irradiated patients in terms of the levels of enzyme activity (creatine phosphokinase) in blood (which was lower in the irradiated patients) and a reduction of arrhythmia of the heart., 33186=It is known in the art (see Mester, A. R., Modalities of low power laser applications, Galletti et al. (eds.) Laser Applications in Medicine and Surgery, Monduzzi Editore (1992), pp. 33-40) that the energy emitted from a He\u2014Ne laser, even with high power, is absorbed by hemoglobin in the red blood cells and by living tissues. This type of energy at the specific wavelength (632.2 nm) does not penetrate well through living tissues. The loss in power output is about 90% after 2 mm depth of tissue and there is practically no power capable of penetrating beyond 3 mm depth of tissue with a moderate blood supply. It is also acknowledged in the art that exposure of the tissue to power less than 4 mW has no biostimulatory effect on tissues (see Galletti et al. ibid. and Bradley, P. F. and B. Gursoy, Penetration studies of low intensity laser therapy (LILT) wavelength, Proc. WALT 1996, p. 18.)., 22464=This patent application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/230,399 filed Nov. 1, 1999 and claims priority from Israel Patent Application 118,968 filed Jul. 28, 1996, and from PCT Patent Application PCT/IL97/00011, filed Jan. 14, 1997, both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present patent application. This patent application also claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/034,703 and 60/034,704, both filed Jan. 3, 1997, which are assigned to the assignee of the present patent application. All of these related applications are incorporated herein by reference., 37415=Russian patent 1806781 to Leveshunov et al., deals with magnetic-laser treatment to improve clinical prognosis of patients with complicated acute myocardial infarction. Pulsed laser irradiation and infrared radiation (wavelength not mentioned) are applied to the patients' chest wall. There is no known data in the art on the bioeffects of combination of magnetic field and laser irradiation on tissues. The pulsed laser, as suggested in this patent, has a mean power of 12 mW, while the continuous infrared radiation has a power of 50 mW. However, the laser beam has to penetrate through the chest skin and muscles between the ribs with a total average tissue width of about 3 to 5 cm before reaching the heart muscle. Since the laser power diminishes within living tissue in an exponential manner with respect to depth, the maximal laser power output incident on the heart, as suggested by Leveshunov et al., will be reduced through the thick chest wall of a patient to a practically zero, obviously too low to cause any stimulatory effect on the heart muscle., 57044=Preferably, irradiating the tissue includes a plurality of irradiations of the myocardial tissue with the source of electromagnetic radiation and/or irradiating myocardial tissue with the source of electromagnetic radiation for a duration of 0.5-15 minutes., 29109=Implantation of cells from skeletal muscle origin or of embryonic heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) into ischemic or infarcted regions of the heart has recently been reported (see R. K. Li et al., Cardiomyocyte transplantation improves heart function, Ann. Thorac. Surg. 62:454-460, 1996, which is incorporated herein by reference). The implanted cells survived the implantation and remained viable for a period of at least several weeks thereafter. The cells, implanted into a cold injury site of the left ventricle myocardium of rats, were reported to significantly improve the heart function (with respect to various physiological parameters) in comparison with control rats, which had not undergone cells implantation. In experiments on mice performed (see J. E. Morgan et al., Yield of normal muscle from precursor cells implanted into preirradiated and nonirradiated legs of young and old max mice, Muscle & Nerve 19:132-139, 1996, which is incorporated herein by reference), only about 10% of the implanted cells of skeletal muscle origin survived the implantation and remained viable for a period of few weeks after the implantation., 30276=Low power laser irradiation has recently been found to modulate various processes in different biological systems (see M. Belkin, B. Zaturunsky, and M. Schwartz, A critical review of low power laser bioeffects, Laser Light Ophthalmol. 2: 63-71, 1988, and T. Karu, Photobiology of low power laser effects, Health Phys. 56: 691-704, 1988). For example, in isolated mitochondria, He\u2014Ne laser irradiation (5 J/cm2) elevated membrane potential and production of ATP, while in isolated fibroblasts with the same radiation, an increase in collagen production was observed. The effect of low power laser irradiation on regeneration processes following trauma has thus far been investigated in the skin, the peripheral nervous systems, skeletal muscles and bone. It has been found that laser irradiation given at the right time and energy level modulates the process of skeletal muscle regeneration and, in most systems, causes a faster recovery after trauma and an enhanced rate of regeneration in muscles and bone (see N. Weiss and U. Oron, Enhancement of muscle regeneration in the rat gastrocnemius muscle by low power laser irradiation, Anat. Embryol. 186: 497-503, 1992, and O. Barushka, T. Yaakobi and U. Oron, Effect of laser irradiation on the process of bone repair in the rat tibia, Bone 16: 47-55, 1995). Low power laser irradiation has also been found to induce a twofold increase in new blood vessels formation (i.e., angiogenesis) in the injured zone of skeletal muscles (see A. Bibikova, N. Belkin and U. Oron, Enhancement of angiogenesis in regenerating gastrocnemius muscle of the toad by low energy laser irradiation, Anat. Embryol. 190:597-602, 1994, which is incorporated herein by reference)., 23507=Heart disease or heart failure following myocardial infarction is still the major cause of death in the western world. The mature heart muscle (myocardium) cells of mammals are those that reach their last stage of differentiation and, therefore, are considered unable to undergo proliferation (see P. P. Rumynastev, Growth and Hyperplasia of Cardiac Muscle Cells, B. M. Carlson, ed., Harwood, New York, 1991, pp. 3-68). Thus, the myocardium may be afflicted with hypertrophy (increase in cell mass and not cell number) due to mechanical stress or ischemia (inadequate oxygen supply to the cells). Following ischemia, due to occlusion of blood supply to the cells during myocardial infarction (MI), irreversible, physiological changes occur in the cells, which degenerate and are replaced by non-contracting scar tissue (infarcted zone) with time (see M. C. Fishbein, M. B. McLean et al., Experimental myocardial infarction in the rat, Am. J. Pathol. 90: 57-70, 1978)., 27574=Ischemic cardiac tissues may have their blood supply restored, using various treatments known in the art, such as coronary angioplasty. In the course of such a treatment, the ischemic tissue may be rapidly reperfused with blood. Such rapid reperfusion has been shown, at least in some cases, to result in post-reperfusion injury, i.e., damage induced by the reperfusion per se. The injury may be caused, inter alia, by superoxides formed within the tissue due to a sharp increase in oxygen supply following the reperfusion procedure. Superoxides are highly-reactive, toxic free radical substances, which undergo detrimental, undesirable reactions with organic and inorganic cellular substances. Indigenous and/or exogenous antioxidants alleviate the toxic effect of the superoxides by either preventing their formation or scavenging the free radicals immediately upon formation. Use of exogenous free radicals scavengers for alleviation of post-reperfusion injury in heart muscle has recently been reported (see E. P. Chen et al., Extracellular superoxide dismutase transgene overexpression preserves post-ischemic myocardial function in isolated murine hearts, Circulation, 94:412-417, 1996, which is incorporated herein by reference). In particular, non-toxic seleno-organic free radical scavengers were found to exhibit such a cytoprotective effect (see V. Ullrich, et al., Seleno-binding equilibria between plasma and target proteins, Biochem. Pharmacol. 52:15, 1996, which is incorporated herein by reference)., 25435=Current clinical treatments of acute MI include thrombolytic treatment (W. Ganz, N. Buchbinder, H. Marcus et al., Intracoronary thrombolysis involving myocardial infarction, Am. Heart 101: 4-10, 1983); PTCA (coronary angioplasty) performed on occluded arteries (A. R Gruentzig et al., Long-term follow-up after percutaneous transmural coronary angioplasty, N. Engl. J. Med. 316: 1127-32, 1987); and also bypass surgery as near as possible to the occurrence of the MI (G. M. Fitzgibon, A. J. Leach, H. P. Kafka et al, Coronary bypass graft fate: long-term angiographic study, J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 17: 1075-80, 1991). These procedures are expensive, demand very highly qualified personnel and physicians, and are not always practically possible in health care. Moreover, these methods endeavor to alter the consequences of the irreversible ischemic injury that occurs in the cells rather than inhibit such consequences. It should be mentioned that even with qualified personnel and first-rate treatment, the above procedures are not always successful., 41996=LMR is a technique known in the art for creating channels in ischemic heart tissue to improve the blood supply thereto. PCT patent application no. PCT/IL97/00011, filed Jan. 14, 1997, which is assigned to the assignee of the present patent application and incorporated herein by reference, describes LMR in detail. In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, methods and apparatus of LMR described in the PCT/IL97/00011 application are preferably used in conjunction with ECB to effect synergetic healing of ischemic zones of the heart, as described below. The ECB irradiation is preferably performed during a LMR procedure, so as to irradiate the ischemic area and the channels generated therein. The irradiation enhances healing of the channels and ischemic area and stimulates angiogenesis in the vicinity of the LMR channels, as mentioned above (see A. Bibikova et al., 1994).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It will be appreciated that the preferred embodiments described above are cited by way of example, and the full scope of the invention is limited only by the claims. FIG. 10 is a schematic illustration showing apparatus 116 for combined invasive and partially invasive biostimulatory irradiation of a section of the heart, in accordance with an alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention. Apparatus 116 comprises a console 112, similar to console 12, as described above with reference to apparatus 48 (FIG. 3A), with both catheter 50 and waveguide 34 (shown in FIG. 2B) coupled thereto. Distal end 36 of waveguide 34 is inserted into the body of a patient 118, as described with reference to FIG. 2B above, and irradiates the patient's heart 120 epicardially. Distal end 51 of catheter 50 is simultaneously inserted into a chamber of heart 120 to irradiate the endocardium. Thus, the ECB irradiation covers an extended area of the ischemic heart tissue from both inside and outside the heart, so that therapeutic levels of radiation reach a relatively greater portion of the thickness of the heart wall than in the other preferred embodiments described above. Catheters known in the art for conveying therapeutic radiation to tissues inside the body, such as catheters for LMR, are generally designed to concentrate the radiation on a target at the catheter's distal end. The catheters shown above in FIGS. 3 through 9, and",
