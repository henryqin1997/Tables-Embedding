    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{19027=Electrostimulation is a well known technique for treatment of various medical conditions. Electrostimulation involves providing a mild electrical shock to particular regions of a human (or other) body. Such treatment is useful, among other things, in pain therapy and has been shown to provide relief from chronic pain under circumstances when other methods have failed or lost their efficacy. Electrostimulation is believed to block transmission of nerve pulses thereby interrupting the flow of \"pain\" signals along the body's nervous system. While electrostimulation of this type does not provide a cure to the underlying cause of pain, it is a useful palliative which can be very helpful to those who suffer from chronic pain. The term TENS, standing for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation, has been coined in the art to refer to this type of pain relief by electrostimulation. See for example, Soric and Devlin, \"Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation-Practical Aspects and Applications,\" Postgraduate Medicine, Vol. 78, No. 4, Sep. 15, 1985, pages 101-106., 28351=Electrostimulator 10 further comprises light source 22 emitting light beam 24, indicated by the letter L. Light source 22 may be any convenient light source, but a light emitting diode (LED) is especially suitable because of its typical small size and suitable wavelength for penetrating radiation, e.g., 600-1000 nanometers, conveniently 600-800 nanometers and preferable about 670+/-10 nanometers. LED's having output powers of less than 1 milliWatt are preferred. Higher or lower powers can be used depending upon the particularly desired result. As used hereinafter, the term LED is intended to include light sources of any form or type suitable for the intended application, including but not limited to light emitting diodes. While it is preferable that the light output be continuous, this is not essential and the LED may be pulsed so as to provide a pulsating light beam. A repetition rate above about 20 Hz is desirable., 38386=Further, by using light wavelengths that penetrate skin and flesh, the light energy is delivered to substantially the same sub-cutaneous region where electrostimulation is occurring, for whatever palliative or other effect the combination may, in the experience of the user provide, depending upon the individual and the condition being treated. In this respect there is evidence that merely exposing pain control centers to certain wavelengths of light with no electrostimulation can provide relief from pain in some persons as well as changes in body chemistry. For example, in an article entitled, \"Relief From Chronic Pain by Low Power Laser Irradiation,\" appearing in Neuroscience Letters, Vol. 43, (1983) pages 339-344, J. Walker reports the results of a double-blind study in which chronic pain sufferers had various body regions irradiated by a 1 multiWatt low power laser operating at 632 nanoMeters with a pulse repetition rate of 20 Hz. Walker states that 19 of 26 subjects experienced significant pain relief. This was accompanied by a substantial change in urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, which Walker states is a degradation product of serotonin. Other effects of light therapy are reported by H. C. Colov in \"Low Level Laser Biomodulation for Chronic Pain Management,\" in Contemporary Issues in Chronic Pain Management, Edited by W. C. V. Parris, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, 1991.}",
