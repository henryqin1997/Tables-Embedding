No. 5,850,102 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference., 27970=Further, by using an HDP (High Density Plasma)--CVD for forming this insulating film, stable film having even fewer defects can be obtained. A high-density plasma having a density of plasma above 1\ufffd1011 cm-3 is preferably used. It is therefore possible to prevent Cu contained in the wiring layer 6 from diffusing into the interlayer insulating layer 2 while maintaining the barrier characteristic of the barrier metal layer 5. Thus, it becomes possible to prevent the current leakage between the wiring layer 5 and adjacent wiring layers that is caused by Cu diffused into the interlayer insulating layer 2., 51235=As described above, the insulating layer having a low content of F and C is preferably deposited from source gases which do not include F or C, except as possible trace impurities. Thus, neither F nor C are intentionally added to the insulating layer between the insulating layer with low dielectric constant and the metal wiring layer. Other methods may be used to form this layer as long as the low density of F and C is maintained. While no precise, direct experimental data is currently available, the inventor believe the density of F under such conditions should be less than 1\ufffd1020 cm-3 and preferable less than 1\ufffd1019 cm-3. In contrast, F and/or C is intentionally added to the layer of low dielectric constant in an amount necessary to produce the low dielectric constant. The electric constant is preferably less than about 3.9.}",
