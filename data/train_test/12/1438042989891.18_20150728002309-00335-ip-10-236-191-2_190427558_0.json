Families are deemed to be closely related if their E-value is less than 10-3 and these relationships are shown with a solid line. Less closely related family pairs, with an E-value of between 10-3 and 10-1, are shown with a dashed line. The E-value for each pair of closely or partially related families is shown next to the line linking the families.
