A main objection to Common Core is it circumvents the ideals and concept of \u201clocal control.\u201d In reality, an unelected, governor appointed, 11-member state board of education, decides without substantive debate. Local boards have little input or ability to change curriculum., 235727=The recount is now rolling into Orange County, with the Registrar of Voters announcing the recount will commence on Wednesday, September 5., 126082=As Obamacare implementation is the subject of national headlines, also in 2014, an equivalent tsunami will occur in America with a controversial national education curriculum arriving in our schools and classrooms.

The legislation creates the right of elementary and secondary school students to use sensitive sex-segregated school facilities such as showers, restrooms and locker rooms based on the student\u2019s perceived gender identity rather than their actual sex.
