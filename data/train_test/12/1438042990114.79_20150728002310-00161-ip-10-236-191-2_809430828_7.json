The source of the data used for this report is the TAF database maintained by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office., 167753=Plant Patents Report PARTS A1, A2, B Granted: 01/01/1990 - 12/31/2014 A Patent Technology Monitoring Team Report, 51220=Plant Patents Report PARTS A1, A2, B Granted: 01/01/1990 - 12/31/2014 A Patent Technology Monitoring Team Report, 7425=Part B is a listing of national and international organizations (i.e., corporations, universities, government agencies, etc.) that have received U.S. patents during the profiled time period. The availability of assigned ownership data in the TAF database, as displayed in Part B, begins in 1969 for utility patent grants and in 1977 for design, plant, and reissue patents, statutory invention registrations, and defensive publications. The listing is limited to organizations receiving 5 or more patents during the period. This minimum number is identified in the title heading of the table. Part B ranks these organizations in terms of total patents granted for the period and displays their annual patent activity for the most recent period. Patent grants may be distributed in two ways, by year of grant and/or by year of patent application. Data lines for each listed organization may distribute the counts of patent grants by the year of grant and/or by the year in which the patented applications were filed. Please note that in some reports, only one of these two data lines may be displayed. Information regarding patent ownership reflects ownership at the time of patent grant. Although a substantial effort has been made to combine name variations into a single organizational name, many organizations continue to have patents listed under more than one name., 13147=Plant Patents Report PARTS A1, A2, B Granted: 01/01/1990 - 12/31/2014 A Patent Technology Monitoring Team Report, 10237=Patented application data are of significant value since the date an application was filed more accurately reflects when the technology was developed. Additionally, fluctuations in data based on application date are much more likely to reflect changes in technological activity since, for the most part, such fluctuations would be immune from changes in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) processing such as occurred in years such as 1986 and 2005 when the USPTO issued fewer patents than would have normally been expected due to administrative reasons. Note that a patent's \"pendency\" can be quite variable from one patent to another, thereby affecting the date of patent grant. Such variation in pendency is determined by many factors, including PTO workload (which varies between technologies), budget and manpower levels, patent printing schedules, etc. Please note that other types of patent documents such as design patents, plant patents, reissue patents, statutory invention registrations, and defensive publications may have average pendency periods that differ somewhat from the pendency period for utility patents., 3769=This report counts only documents of the following type(s): plant patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office during the period 01/01/1990 - 12/31/2014. These profiled documents hereafter will be referred to as \"patents\"., 3154=Plant Patents Report PARTS A1, A2, B Granted: 01/01/1990 - 12/31/2014 A Patent Technology Monitoring Team Report, 90423=Plant Patents Report PARTS A1, A2, B Granted: 01/01/1990 - 12/31/2014 A Patent Technology Monitoring Team Report, 128511=Plant Patents Report PARTS A1, A2, B Granted: 01/01/1990 - 12/31/2014 A Patent Technology Monitoring Team Report, 689102=Plant Patents Report PARTS A1, A2, B Granted: 01/01/1990 - 12/31/2014 A Patent Technology Monitoring Team Report, 11500=*For example, in a report profiling utility patents granted through December 2014, patent grant data, as distributed by year of application, are approximately 98% complete for applications filed in 2006, 97% complete for applications filed in 2007, 95% complete for applications filed in 2008, 93% complete for applications filed in 2009, 90% complete for applications filed in 2010, 80% complete for applications filed in 2011, 63% complete for applications filed in 2012, 41% complete for applications filed in 2013, and 31% complete for applications filed in 2014; data are essentially complete for applications filed prior to 2006. About 90% of all patent documents granted by USPTO (i.e., including utility, design, plant, and reissue patents, statutory invention registrations, and defensive publications) are utility patent grants.
