            "Greek life is becoming bigger. We get a new sorority and fraternity every semester. It's not a traditional Big 10 Greek Life, but it's still great (being Greek myself)",

            "Take a tour of the school. If you love the city, Loyola's great for you. But if you want a Big 10 school, look somewhere else.",
            "Although it is a Private Catholic School, the school itself is very liberal. Res-Life is not the greatest, but Fordham and Baumhart are great dorms. Loyola is going more for a campus feel, so there are a lot of constructions going on."

The best place to eat is (currently) Simpson Dining. I would advise not eating at Lakeshore Dining, except come April we won't even have Lakeshore Dining. They are opening up a brand new student center where I'm sure there will be exceptional food., 690229=Well there are the rocks by the lake that everyone loves, and the beach on warmer days to just sit and relax. An unusual tradition would be christmas on campus or the new years party that is held almost every year. The christmas on campus is self explanatory, you basically have christmas on campus! It's wonderful because everything is decorated! The new years party is in early september and its a small celebration for all the students and staff to welcome the new academic school and wish everyone good luck in their endeavors!, 801808=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 102840=Wolf and Kettle day is in March every year when we celebrate the donors of our education and those who help pay for tuition. FUN, 18578=Do not take a class at 8:30 offered at the Water Tower Campus!One of the classes I would highly recommend is Human Values in Literature with Mr. Fruhauff. Overall, try to have an open mind about courses and balance out your schedule so that it fits your needs. Do not try to do too much in one semester but do try to get involved in extra curriculars. You will not regret it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot As a nursing student at Loyola University I was immediately enrolled in classes directly related to my major. The teachers for my nursing classes encouraged me to take initiative in getting involved early within the nursing field. They taught me that nursing is not just taking care of sick patients but taking on the incredible role of helping someone with their spiritual, mental, and physical health. Since I came to Loyola I have become extremely passionate about my chosen career due to the compassion and encouragement of faculty members and fellow students. I am truly excited to take on another year at Loyola.
