    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets In the claims which follow, the words \"hologram\" and \"diffractive pattern\" are used to mean any diffractive pattern, including laser-viewable holograms, Benton holograms, diffractive graphical effects, multiplexed holograms, ruled diffraction gratings, and diffractive mosaic patterns. While the methods disclosed herein are primarily directed toward replication of diffractive surface relief patterns, it is clear that the methods are also useful for replication of any kind of surface relief pattern. Radiation-curable resins can be formulated so that they do not shrink during curing, which makes them especially well suited for replicating relief patterns which require high fidelity, such as corner reflector retroreflective array tapes usefuil as roadway reflectors. FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of a typical holographic hot-stamping foil. A carrier 200 of thin polyester film with a release layer 210 is the substrate for a radiation-cured resin hologram 220. The hologram 220 is vacuum-coated with aluminum 230, and the aluminun 230 is coated with a hot-stamping adhesive 240. The holographic hot-stamping foil is used by pressing the foil against a receiving surface using a heated die so that the adhesive 240 adheres to the receiving surfce and the resin hologram 220 is thereby more strongly adhered to the receiving surface than to the carrier 200. A brittle material, such as Cellofilm C-200, is desirable in the manufacture of holographic hot-stamping foil because the transferred material separates cleanly at the edges from the untransferred material remaining",
