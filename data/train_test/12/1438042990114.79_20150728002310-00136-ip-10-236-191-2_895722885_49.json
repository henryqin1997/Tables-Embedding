            "There are a lot of music venues downtown which will usually have shows at night. There are also a lot of parks around, one down by the tennessee river in fact.",
            "The options available with your dining dollars on campus are great! The school cafeteria is rather hit or miss though. Sometimes it has great food, like whenever they do brunch, but otherwise it can be rather lackluster.",
            "Currently the dorms are not great but next year they are opening new freshmen dorms which are going to be an upgrade from the current situation.",
            "For me it is a perfect balance in the academic world because it has some harder classes but it is not way too hard. The university's honors program allows you to step up the academics if you wish and also gets you involved in the community with service projects and what not. In general, the academics are not super hard but that allows more time to get involved.",
            "Get involved in organizations on campus because that is how you meet people and how I have made an immense amount of my friends.",
            "UNA is a great school and I've greatly enjoyed the time I have had there so far. The surrounding towns are very supportive of the university and everything that it does for the shoals. Overall it is a great place and I would recommend it to anybody."

Reviewer has been to campus. 5 out of 5 people found this review useful. 2 of 50 Categories Comments Bang for the buck Although the town is small, the campus nice. It is safe campus and tuition is not very high. Will enjoy being here The town is very small town. The mall is very small as well. Finding things to do will be hard if you don't know anyone there. Will learn a lot The classrooms are small, so that means that you may be able to get more assistance from your teacher. I can't be curtain because I have not had the chance to sit in a classroom while a teacher was lecturing. Login to rate or flag the reviews From Atlanta, GA",
