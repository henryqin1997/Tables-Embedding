    "textBeforeTable": "In our fourth analysis of basic statistics, we take a look at the top 22 power forwards eligible for the 2014 NBA draft. A key component of the game of basketball, statistics are both exalted for their comprehensiveness and condemned for their ridiculousness. There are an unlimited number of ways to evaluate a player on paper, with each seemingly generating non-stop debate over its value. In recent seasons, Synergy Sports Technology and other companies have brought on a new generation of statistics in basketball, and along with the likes of John Hollinger and Dean Oliver, have changed the way NBA teams evaluate prospects. Accounting for every jumper missed on a fast break, pick and roll from the top of key, and bad pass in crunch time, the data at the disposal of NBA decision-makers seems to get deeper almost daily. As statistics become more advanced, you can even start to predict what areas a college player may struggle in moving forward based on what their numbers in college or where they may still have upside. As we get further and further away from the actual season that was played between November and April, we tend to forget at times how productive prospects actually were on their individual teams between all the talk about wingspans and upside and performance in private workouts and such. With that in mind, we're running a simple analysis of how all",
    "textAfterTable": "This stat tells us plainly how often these power forwards put the ball in the basket, adjusting for minutes played and pace, which levels the playing field as best as we can without taking into account competition level, individual team roles, and teammates into consideration. This is a good place to start with this group of players, as it tells us about their versatility, the range of roles they played last season, and a little bit about each prospect's mentality as a playmaker or scorer. Cameron Bairstow is the top per-minute scorer in this group. Developing into a reliable midrange shooter and post threat, Bairstow had a terrific senior year. Adreian Payne takes the second spot here, showing significant improvement from the previous season, just like Bairstow. Nikola Jokic finishes a somewhat surprising third. As much as Jokic boosted his stock with his performance at the Hoop Summit, he was having a terrific year in the Adriatic League, his first seeing extensive playing time at the age of 19. While he hadn't shot the ball as well in league play as he did in Portland, his highly efficient scoring inside the arc made him a prolific weapon nonetheless. Dario Saric and Shayne Whittington round out the top-5, though Julius Randle, among others, ranks just behind them. Saric bounced back from an average season in the Adriatic league last year a big way with",
