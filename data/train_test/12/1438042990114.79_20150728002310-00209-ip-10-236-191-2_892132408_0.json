Hailing from Sweden, the Bridal Shop make the kind of drifty, reverb-swathed dream pop that makes your head feel like it's wrapped in a light blanket of cotton candy. In other words, From Seas is a really comfortable listen, and that's nothing but a good thing. The Bridal Shop could have lost themselves in their influences (the Radio Dept. are a good touchstone, as are New Order and the Field Mice), but they bring enough of their own sparkly, ethereal individuality to the table to make From Seas more than a pale imitation. From Seas is a very earnest album, emotional to the point of nearly drowning, but it's saved by the Bridal Shop's playful musical touches. \"Spectrum of Clarity,\" featuring bandmember Ida's wonderfully diaphanous vocals, is saved from synth-washed doldrums by some playful synthesized bongos (yes, those are actually a saving grace) and a nigh-on euphoric crescendo at the end of the song. Other standout songs include the album's breezy and rollicking first track, \"Toomas' Floor,\" and \"Early Longing\" (misspelled on the liner notes of the Magic Marker edition), both of which find the band at its sweet, synth-kissed best. From Seas is just a feel-good little album; it's difficult to fault, and promising., 103203=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc. Todos los derechos reservados.}",
