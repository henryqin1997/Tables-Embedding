Alex played in a behind closed doors game earlier this week against neighbours Sheffield Wednesday where he scored, what Steve Evans said, was a great goal. Speaking to MillersPlayer the Millers Boss said, 'After missing the early matches, Alex came into the team and did great getting a couple of goals and then he went a bit AWOL and conceded a penalty with a poor challenge against Rochdale and then got himself sent off at Barnet. But, he's paid the price financially and mentally and has worked really hard over the last couple of weeks and is the real professional that we know Revs is and he will come into contention on Saturday whether he starts or is on the bench we'll be keeping that under wraps until 2 o'clock Saturday.' There was a rumour that Kari Arnason had been injured again while away with Iceland but Steve Evans refuted that by saying, 'Somebody 'phoned a local 'phone in show and said that he was out for six weeks. I don't know why people do this but they do and I don't for one minute think it was a Rotherham United fan because it wouldn't be the type of thing you do if you support your club. Kari will be playing on Saturday.' There is one player who has a knock and won't play but Steve Evans didn't want to say who although he did say that there would be three or four changes from the loss to Southend last week. He also said that Laurie Wilson will travel but, reading between the lines, doubts he will play as he is still in pain. \u00a0 Don`t forget, you can also catch Vital Rotherham on Facebook and Twitter! \u00a0 Vital Rotherham on: \u00a0 VitalRotherhamon:, 13294=RUFC - Pen Pics - Lewis Buxton (Monday August 3 2015), 18382=Date:Thursday October 18 2012, 12888=RUFC - What Of The Loanees - Lawrie Wilson (Monday August 3 2015), 13099=RUFC - A Look Back At Last Season - April/May (Monday August 3 2015), 18335=Time: 8:12PM, 11634=RUFC - Manu 'Squad Stronger Than Last Year' (Friday July 31 2015), 12268=RUFC - Gaffer 'That Won't Be Starting Eleven Next Week' (Saturday August 1 2015), 12470=RUFC - Maguire 'We Had To Be Patient' (Sunday August 2 2015)}",
