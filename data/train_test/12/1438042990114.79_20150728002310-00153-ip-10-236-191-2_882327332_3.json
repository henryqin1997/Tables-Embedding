    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{11181=10/10/13: The Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues have been at each other's throats since the Blues joined the league in 1967. But things are getting more and more heated. Detroit is now in the Eastern Conference, so that rivalry will likely not be as strong. But this year is different. Not only do the Blues and Blackhawks (and their fans) despise each other, and not only is the Blackhawks' coach Joel Quinville - who got his head coaching start for the Blues - but this season both teams are considered Stanley Cup Contenders. Oh, and they face each other for the first time this week in a must see game for any hockey fan., 51503=3/11/15: The Chicago Blackhawks certainly took Patrick Kane's shoulder injury seriously. Kane is likely finished for the season and the team needed to beef up their lineup to overcome that loss, plus improve defensively for the playoffs. Therefore, Chicago was extremely active at the trade deadline. The added defenseman Kimmo Timonen and forwards Antoine Vermette and Andrew Desjardins. They paid a lot for these guys, including their first and second round picks in 2015 as well as defensive prospect Klas Dahlbeck. Of course, Chicago has a lot of depth throughout the organization and they see this year as a chance to win another Stanley Cup., 25186=3/13/14: The Blackhawks did not sit idly by and let everyone else make moves at the trade deadline while they did nothing. They made a trade for depth. Chicago picked up David Rundlbad and Mathieu Brisebois from the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for a second round pick in the June draft. Chicago does not need much help, as they are one of the elite teams in the NHL, are the defending Stanley Cup champions, and have most of the pieces that won the the title last year. Of course, when it gets to playoff hockey, the games are tighter and more physical, so the Blackhawks tried to address that with this trade., 8806=9/12/13: There are not many holes on the Blackhawks' roster. They set a record last season with the most games to start a season without losing, until they finally succumbed to Colorado. That makes it tough to make the roster. Chicago has a young defensive prospect named Adam Clendening that will push for a shot in the NHL this season. He was a second round pick in 2011, and though he is not big, he is an offensive weapon. He posted 9-37-26 in the AHL last season and seems like a natural on the powerplay. He may not get his chance this season, but Hawks fans should be looking for him in the future., 22863=2/20/14: Not many hockey players, whether pro, semi-pro, amateur or youth, can relate to T.J. Oshie (St. Louis Blues) and his amazing shootout performance. Oshie took six penalty shots in the shootout victory over Russia and became an instant U.S. Hockey legend. Jonathan Toews of the Blackhawks can kind of relate. The Blackhawks and Team Canada captain scored three shootout goals in three attempts in the 2007 World Junior Championships. While there is a big difference between the World Juniors and the Olympics, both are amazing feats that do not come around all that often (and should be enjoyed when they do)., 30620=5/22/14: The Chicago Blackhawks had a pretty good regular season, but it was certainly not the dominant performance of the 2012-13 season. They easily made the playoffs, taking the third seed in the Central Division. The Blackhawks used some questionable tactics to eliminate the St. Louis Blues in the first round, but they did enough to move on to round two against the L.A. Kings. Chicago won the first game of the series in convincing manner. At the same time they must beware of the Kings, who have shown a propensity to rise up in the playoffs when least expected., 404=In 2010, many of the same players you would see in the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals for the Chicago Blackhawks won a Cup with the team. Their President's Trophy campaign in this shortened season has many people expecting another long run in the NHL Playoffs with plenty of big games at the United Center., 39266=8/28/14: Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford may be one of the most underrated goalies in the NHL. He may not have the day-in and day-out stats of say Jonathan Quick or the acrobatics of Roberto Luongo. All he has done is win two Stanley Cups. But there is a drop-off after Crawford so the Hawks moved to address that by signing Michael Leighton. Leighton was drafted by Chicago but moved on. Ironically, he was in net for the Philadelphia Flyers when Patrick Kane scored the OT game winner in the 2010 Stanley Cup (Game 6), which is one of the more iconic goals in Blackhawks history., 17290=12/19/13: Former Blackhawks power forward Jamal Mayers opted to retire last week, bringing an end to his 14 year career. Mayers was never a goal scorer, his best season came in 2005-06 with the rival St. Louis Blues when he scored 15 goals. However, he was a gritty forward and was never afraid to go into the corners to battle for a puck. He retires with over 100 career fights, if that is not proof enough. Always classy, Mayers thanked his mother, step-father, and even former Blues GM Larry Pleau for his opportunities. Good luck with the rest of your life, Jamal., 2352=The 2013 NHL regular season wasn't long thanks to a lockout, and the summary of the Chicago Blackhawks is short and sweet. They dominated the Western Conference from day one, including a half-season streak of games where they earned a point. Their historical start to the season got them out in front, but it took a great deal of character and leadership by the likes of Captain Jonathon Toews to keep the Blackhawks out in front, sights set on another shot in the Stanley Cup Finals. They finished the regular season with some hardware - the President's Trophy for most points in the entire league - but it's Lord Stanley's Cup that they'd like to see again., 39830=9/17/14: All signs point up for the Chicago Blackhawks going into training camp and the regular season. The team is the odds on betting favorite to win the Stanley Cup. They return most of the core players. They are hungry after getting knocked out in the the Western Conference Finals by the eventual Stanley Cup winners - the L.A. Kings. And now they have their venue for the Winter Classic. The Blackhawks will travel to Washington D.C. to the Washington Capitals at Nationals Park - home of the Washington Nationals of MLB on January 1, 2015., 38662=8/21/14: Fans of the Chicago Blackhawks have known for weeks, but now it is official. The team will not be signing Kevin Hayes. Instead, Hayes is a free agent and can sign anywhere. Hayes was the 24th overall pick in 2010. He is now only 22 years old and would like a shot at regular playing time. The speculation is that Hayes believes that he would not have a great chance at making the roster or getting that playing time on a loaded Chicago team. But the Blackhawks will not leave empty-handed. they will receive a 2015 second round pick as compensation., 1510=After such a hot start, people have been looking for cracks in the Chicago Blackhawks' game - the kind of flaws that led to disappointing early finishes in the NHL Playoffs that ended their campaigns in the last two seasons. Since their Stanley Cup Finals victory in 2010, the young, well-rounded core of the Blackhawks has dealt with pressure and high expectations every day; despite their NHL Playoff pedigree, youth like that is often met with skepticism as one-hit wonders until they can achieve consistent, sustained playoff results. This year, the Blackhawks are driving toward another Stanley Cup Finals to prove that their core is as good as any in the league and that the 2010 title wasn't a fluke. Any team, including division champion Los Angeles Kings, doubting them in the playoffs is doing so at a very high risk of their own failure., 45833=1/7/15: The Chicago Blackhawks, once again, were a participant in the annual Winter Classic game. It was played, as always, on January 1st. This year's outdoor venue was Nationals Park (home of the Washington Nationals of the MLB) against the host Washington Capitals. Chicago was down 2-0 before tying the game. Unfortunately for the Hawks, Washington scored on a controversial power play just before the end of regulation to win 3-2. While the loss may sting, the Blackhawks are still at the top of the Central Division with Nashville and are in prime position for a nice playoff seeding., 33230=6/19/14: The ice has not even been cleared yet from the Kings double overtime win in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup, but that does not mean it is too early to talk about next season's champions. Or at least to make a wager on the next Cup winners. The early favorite is the Chicago Blackhawks at 15/2, with the Boston Bruins, Pittsburgh Penguins, LA Kings and St. Louis Blues rounding out the top five. Chicago won the Cup last season, as well as in the 2010-11 season, so another would be three championships in just five years. One other factoid, if the Hawks do win next season, then they and the Kings would have combined to win four straight, the first time two team will have done that since the Bruins and Canadiens from 1969-73., 4816=7/18/13: The Stanley Cup winning Blackhawks traded forward Daniel Carcillo to the former Stanley Cup winning L.A. Kings for a conditional draft pick in 2015. It is not likely that the Blackhawks will miss Carcillo that much. He has been injured for a lot of time the past several years. Even this year, he only played in 23 regular season games, tallying two goals and an assist. The Hawks only used him in four games in the playoffs - perhaps fearing he would get too many penalties. It is a minor deal, but does give the Hawks a little more cap flexibility and a pick in the future., 18563=1/2/14: Tough loss for the Blackhawks last Saturday, as the St. Louis Blues rallied three times to win 6-5 in an overtime shootout. While the Blackhawks are at the top of the NHL in points (battling it out with Anaheim for the best overall record), they cannot seem to solve St. Louis. The Blues have won all three meetings this season, and did it this time without two of their top offensive weapons in Alex Steen and captain David Backes. Chicago had two goal leads three times in the game, so this one is rather disappointing. No matter, the Hawks still look to have a top playoff seed and may see the rival Blues in May or June., 47684=1/28/15: The Chicago Blackhawks took a bit of a tumble in the weeks leading up to the All Star break, but managed to win their last two games to tie the St. Louis Blues at 62 points (though the Blues have a game in hand on the Blackhawks). The Blues and Blackhawks both trail leader Nashville by three points, but the Predators may be slipping since goalie Pekka Rinne got injured. Off the ice, the NHL announced that the Blackhawks will once again be in an outdoor game next season. They will head to Minnesota to face the Wild at TCF Bank Stadium on February 21, 2016.}",
