    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{37456=In automotive vehicle interiors, it is common to have supports such as coat hooks located against an interior headliner trim panel or along a plastic garnish molding for holding clothing. A typical coat hook is designed to hold garment hangers or an individual garment itself. Traditionally, most automotive coat hooks are merely U-shaped members having one leg attached to a sheet metal side rail panel. Many coat hooks are attached to assist handle or side rail lamp bezels which, in turn, are mounted to the vehicle's side rail panel by screws or by quick connect fastening systems. Such a quick connect fastening system has been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,981,323 entitled \"Assist Strap for a Modular Headliner\" and 4,981,322 entitled \"Assist Strap for a Motor Vehicle,\" both of which issued to Dowd et al. on Jan. 1, 1991 and have a common assignee with the present invention; these patents are incorporated by reference herewithin.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the many preferred and alternate embodiments of this device for supporting garment hangers have been disclosed, it will be appreciated that various modifications may be made without departing from the present invention. For example, a rigid vertically oriented loop may be mounted directly onto the vehicle side rail without use of a separate bezel. Furthermore, the loop of the present invention may be stationarily fixed rather than pivoting from a stowed position. Moreover, the inside surface and aperture of the loop may have a variety of enclosed shapes and sizes. While specific materials have been disclosed in an exemplary fashion, various other materials may of course be employed. It is intended by the following claims to cover these and any other departures from the disclosed embodiments which fall within the true spirit of this invention. Referring to FIG. 13, an eighth embodiment of the present invention device 11 comprises a loop 301 and a bezel 303, both of which are substantially similar to that of the third embodiment. It should be noted, however, that this eighth embodiment may be less preferred than the prior ones for some uses. In this embodiment, bezel 303 has a pair of cavities 305 formed in a back side 307. Furthermore, a pair of J-shaped guides 309 have a substantially straight leg 311 and a curved leg 313. Straight leg 311 of each guide 309 has an end 314 which",
