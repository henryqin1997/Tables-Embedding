    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{138333=2015 2R, 163849=In essence they basically gave away their best player, Andre Iguodala, their second-best player, Nikola Vucevic, their first-round pick, Maurice Harkless and a future first-round pick in 2016 (it\u2019s technically protected, but unless they make the playoffs this year, it won\u2019t be) and got nothing back., 182334=Vucevic and Harkless are both on their rookie deals, so when they hit restricted free agency in 2015, the Magic will have the rights to match any offers., 157845=Joe Johnson has arguably the worst contract in the NBA. Ergo, whoever trades Joe Johnson automatically wins the trade. Atlanta was in a rut, trapped in giant, underperforming contracts which were only leading them into early postseason exit after early exit. A week before, they\u2019d dealt Marvin Williams for Devin Harris, freeing up more money for the summer of 2013., 174781=They were literally discussing whether they would break the Chicago Bulls' all-time records for wins in a season: 72. That became impossible by December 7, 2012 when they lost their 11th and still had just nine wins. They didn\u2019t even break .500 until March 3, 2013., 150166=Jordan Farmar, 140209=David Stern famously vetoed the initial Chris Paul trade for \u201cbasketball reasons.\u201d That trade would have probably worked out better for the Hornets in retrospect, as the New Orleans Pelicans would have received Lamar Odom, Luis Scola, Goran Dragic and Kevin Martin., 146218=If they make the playoffs this year, which it seems they\u2019re all but certain to do, they will make the postseason three years in a row for only the second time in franchise history. The last time that happened was when they were still the Buffalo Braves in the 1975-76 season., 172479=2017 1R, 161799=2016 1R, 122956=2014 1st Round Pick, 123386=If it wasn't clear then, it certainly is now. The Denver Nuggets won the Carmelo Anthony trade. They gained a net 20.4 win shares out of the deal, and they still have five players obtained from the trade, either directly or indirectly, on their roster. And, that\u2019s not including the value Andre Iguodala had for the team, who was partially obtained for the Knicks' 2014 first-round pick (if the Nuggets finish better than the Knicks this year).\u00a0, 167110=2014 1R, 175630=Yes, they still owe the 2017 draft pick, but it could have been much worse. They get a D+ because the payout was as overstated as what they got., 116176=The Knicks seem to have peaked with what they were going to accomplish in the Anthony era last season, when they finished second in the Eastern Conference and made it to the second round of the NBA playoffs for the first time since the 1999-2000 season., 150627=2017 2R, 183154=They\u2019ll also have the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 first-round pick in 2016, and the Los Angeles Lakers' first-round pick in 2017. Both of those picks could potentially be lottery picks too., 120243=2015 2Rd Pick, 212020=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Bleacher Report, Inc. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

As a note, I did not grade the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Carmelo Anthony trade, because while they were technically involved, they were essentially just included to make the trade work. They neither dealt nor received anyone of consequence and were mostly used to dump excess salary. After determining that, I evaluated the net win shares for each team since the trade, how many players and/or assets from the trades were still on each team\u2019s roster and how the team in question is presently situated based on what they were trading for at the time of the trade. The logic is that for the receiving team, the total gain from the trade needs to be measured, but for the sending team, the only reasonable assurance is that the player would have",
