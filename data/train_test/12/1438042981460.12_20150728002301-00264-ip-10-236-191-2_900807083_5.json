            "I would say that UK is great all types of students. If you like the small town type of feel UK can offer that to you, but if you're used to the big city feel UK can offer that to you as well :)",
            "I would tell anyone thinking about coming here to take a few test trials of your schedule once you figure it out, because if you don't, on the first day you will be late to EVERY class :)",
            "UK is worth every penny they footed out of pocket for me to come here. I am very happy with my decision of school.",
            "I am having fun! Every weekend there is so much to indulge in that making a decision on exactly what to do is very hard. I met new friends (my roommates), and honestly the campus is so big that if I didn't want to see someone, I dont have to see them.",
            "Everyday that I go to class I am grateful and I feel as if my time was spent in a more efficient way. I listens to my profesor as he/she explains the material, and surely my mind is being stretched, and the way that I look at the world is completely changed. Overall the education is amazing!"

I went from getting kicked out to returning three years later and accomplished a 3.25 GPA for the semester., 356203=This campus is gorgeous, there are safety measures everywhere, and everyone is incredibly helpful. I have yet to see someone who wouldn't point me in the right direction (or give me a completely random high-five when she realized we had the same major). I wish it was August already, and move-in day., 786307=Tour the campus in October - you'll see how big and beautiful the campus truly is before it's a little too chilly. Don't count UK out if you are from Lexington or a surrounding area: it can easily be your new home [somewhat] away from home!, 465115=Apply for scholarships and housing as soon as you can. The sooner you get this done the better chance you have of getting a good dorm or more scholarship money. Also apply for financial aid on Jan. 1., 513366=K Week introductory activities are awesome and a good way to get to know the campus, but don't get used to having fun and partying all the time. By September, you'll have to crack down on studying!, 355569=-Talk to everyone. That's why they're there. Financial aid counselor, admissions counselor, or just call. -Apply early. I had my application in as soon as I could (October) and got the decision letter in November. -GPA is important, so don't slack off, but practice your testing skills for the ACT or SAT. My GPA was 2.98, but I got accepted with an ACT score of 32. -Visit the campus anytime you get the chance. It's beautiful. And bring an umbrella!, 299375=The greek life is great they help with community service events the NPHC holds a Martin Luther King march every year which is fun. Also some of the Greeks in the NPHC have Yard shows, Step shows during homecoming and other fun events., 854033=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2528=When President Todd accepted the role as University President, he brought with him the Top 20 business plan meaning, thus, that the university will be a in the top 20 by the year 2020. Therefore, the University of Kentucky is making progress to become on of the top 20 schools in the nation. The William T. Young Library, a 58 million dollar complex, has the nation's second largest book endowment second only to Harvard University and is the largest among Public Universities. Also, on a side note the fifth floor was voted the best place on campus to get a date., 348057=Willy T which is the library is always filled during exam week and its almost a social event as well as a study event. Also during March Madness the city of lexington gets out of control and thats something that everyone should experience.}",

It's so diverse, it would be hard not to fit in somewhere! Tips for prospective students Don't slack off during senior year! Schools still look at those transcripts! Also, GET EXCITED! You're going into your first year of college! It can be scary going to a big school at first, but K Crew holds tons of activities for you to meet new people and try new things. Bang for the buck Ohio's tuition is expensive, and it is almost cheaper for me to attend out-of-state at Kentucky as it is for me to go to school in Ohio. Am enjoying being here I love",
