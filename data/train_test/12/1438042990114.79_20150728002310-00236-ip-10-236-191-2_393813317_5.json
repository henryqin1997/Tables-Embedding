The Equine Research and Development Program of RIRDC has been looking strategically at the major area of horse nutrition for the past four years, commencing with a major workshop in early 1995. Funds have been invested in research on pasture nutrition, comparison of supplementary and pasture rearing and safe and effective grain feeding of horses. Additionally, major publications have been commissioned on pastures for horses, developmental orthopaedic disease of foals and a practical handbook on feeding horses in Australia.}",

To overcome imbalances that arise from high grain rations, a feed high in calcium such as lucerne or clover should be included or alternatively add lime to balance the ration., 18515=1048, 18118=1427, 149335=Victorian Bushfire Information Line: 1800 240 667, 147202=Following the State Election held on 29 November 2014, there has been a change of Government. The website will be updated accordingly., 18526=1258, 71574=A simple procedure to confirm these observations is to water with a watering can a square meter in several places in the paddock and see what grows. In previous droughts the results of this procedure has shown a close relationship to what subsequently germinates. If horses are in the paddock it may be necessary to put a small fence around the watered area. To avoid runoff, build a bank about 10 cm high around the are to be watered. Apply the water in March if the autumn break has not occurred. Do not water in the summer months because the normal summer dormancy of seed and plants may not have broken. Sub. clover plant densities should be greater than 100 plants/m2, where as species such as phalaris should have at least 15 live plants/m2. You will also be able to predict weed populations and plan appropriate control strategies., 73278=After the drought breaks there will be very little paddock feed remaining; horses will graze every bit of new green pasture as it appears. Heavy grazing at this time can greatly reduce subsequent pasture production. Perennial ryegrass and cocksfoot are also susceptible to being pull out of the ground during this period. If possible delay grazing the majority of your pastures until they are 8 cm in height (around 1750 kg DM/ha) as this will optimise pasture growth. Given a \"normal\" autumn break this should take about 6 to 8 weeks. A late autumn or early winter break will reduce feed supply for a longer period and would result in feed shortages throughout winter., 18129=1711, 15407=1127, 48259=$210 per tonne / (1000 kg x 12 MJ /t) = 1.8 cents/MJ, 17731=1024, 18107=1141, 14981=1023}",

    "textAfterTable": "Drought may cause you to change the categories of horses on the stud. As a result, feed you normally store may be inappropriate. For example you may have purchased very high quality lucerne to feed pregnant mares. Due to drought, you may have decided not to breed this year. It therefore may be more appropriate to sell the high quality hay and replace it with pasture hay as this is all you will require to meet the needs of dry mares. Remember that feed costs rise as drought progresses, so do not be too anxious to sell off \"surplus\" feed, only to discover that it is needed later on. Hay Hay is extremely variable. There are three broad types of hay; cereal, pasture and lucerne. Cereal hay is made from grain crops such as oats. The nutritive value of cereal hay depends on the time of cutting and the proportion of grain in the hay. Late cut cereal hay with little grain closely resembles straw. Cereal hay attracts mice and is difficult to store for any length of time. Pasture hays range from 100% clover to almost 100% grass and the feed value is as variable. Generally the higher the clover the higher the protein. The species of grass in the hay is also important, for example silver grass is inferior to ryegrass. Lucerne paddocks are often cut for hay several times and hay is sold as \"first-cut\" or \"second-cut\". First-cut lucerne hay is generally high in nutritional value",
