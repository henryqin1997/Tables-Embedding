For example, an assignment that would have received a 100% had it been handed in on time will receive a 60% (an F) if it is handed in 4 days late. Only a note from a physician or the Dean sent to me in advance of the due date will be accepted as a valid excuse. Missed field trips/labs Missed field trips or labs cannot be made up and will result in lost points unless the absence has been approved by me at least one week in advance or with a note from the physician or the Dean sent to me in advance of the field trip or lab. If you must miss a field trip or lab because of a legitimate school-sponsored activity or religious observance, then you must seek my permission at least one week in advance. In all approved cases, an equivalent activity will be assigned. Plagiarism/Cheating Plagiarism means using someone else\u2019s statement word-for-word without quotation marks (even if you cite it) or using someone else\u2019s ideas, even if you have paraphrased them, without proper attribution of credit through a citation. The penalty for plagiarism on your research project is a zero. Do not plagiarize \u2013 I run all of your written work through software that detects plagiarism. All",
