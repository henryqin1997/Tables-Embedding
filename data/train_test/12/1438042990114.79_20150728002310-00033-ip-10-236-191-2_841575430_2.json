Per the deal, Accenture will manage UniCredit\u2019s invoice management operations. UniCredit, one of Europe's leading commercial banks, has 9,360 branches across 22 countries. Financial terms of the contract were kept confidential. Accenture will deliver its information technology service through a separate unit, which was formed in association with UniCredit. Apart from Accenture\u2019s financial, accounting, management, consulting and IT capabilities, the new unit consists of UniCredit\u2019s personnel and processes from the invoice-management department. The unit, Accenture Back Office and Administration Services, will be supervised by Accenture. The Accenture Back Office and Administration Services unit will take up the job of efficiently managing invoice processes including accounts-receivable, accounts-payable, asset-management and expense-payments task. The idea of setting up the unit was mainly to help UniCredit in meeting highest industry standards for serving customers and business partners better. Accenture\u2019s services will also bring down operating costs, which will help the bank to boost profitability. Accenture\u2019s association with UniCredit seems beneficial since it is expected to be a long-term business tie for its Accenture Back Office and Administration Services unit. We believe that the new unit\u2019s success will help clinch similar deals going forward. It is, however, not new for Accenture to set up a new unit to provide some specialized services. In an effort to better serve government clients, Accenture formed the U.S. Federal Advisory Board in 2012. The company has also invited experts with years of experience in Fed activities to join the board. This will provide Accenture more insight into the current requirements to deal with critical IT operations. It will also help the company to win more federal deals, going ahead. Last week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury selected Accenture\u2019s Federal Services unit to provide IT services to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for improving its customer services. While Accenture\u2019s prospects look bright, increasing competition from IBM Corp. (IBM - Analyst Report), a strained spending environment and broad European exposure may temper growth to some extent. Currently, Accenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). But not all stocks in the sector are performing as badly as Accenture. CRA International Inc. (CRAI - Analyst Report) and Information Services Group Inc. (III - Snapshot Report), with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) are worth buying., 63961=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 64022=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year.
