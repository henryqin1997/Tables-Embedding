Recently a new parking lot was added, and though it has less parking spaces, there are plans for many more, as well as new/nicer buildings, finished by approx. 2016. There is a four-story library that has a bagel shop, so students and faculty may munch and read. There is ample seating area with some of the most comfortable chairs on campus. There are many places to eat, including healthy choices such as Subway and Chik-Fil-A. As well as these amazing things, however, are the excellent academic programs. There are qualified teachers in every department, and the undergraduate catalog includes a vast variety of majors, minors, and concentrations. What is particularly unique about the university is the wonderful music program, which is very extensive and not found in many schools., 188971=The Student Activities Council and Registered Student Organizations always have events going on, almost every day.

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students 1.STUDY, STUDY, STUDY!!!! 2.Get enough sleep for class 3.Have a light snack or eat breakfast 4.Try to workout whenever possible-we have a free recreational facility for students to partake in a variety of exercises and sports---It's FREE with school ID- don't gain the FRESHMAN 15 5.Get a study group started or join one, every bit of studying will help with even the hardest class 6.keep a steady schedule so that you can still schedule other things you would like to do like spending time with family and friends or enjoying you favorite hobby. 7.if you work or would like to work make sure it does not interfere with school. I learned that the hard way but I fixed the mistake before it was too later 8. Take every scholarship opportunity available. College isn't cheap, and take it from me, you will not want to continue paying for school well after you graduate, many,many,many years late Bang for the buck The great thing about this school is you have the opportunity to drop classes if you feel uneasy, whether you really feel the class is not for you or whether you will fail the first test, you have the opportunity to redeem yourself before the deadline or just before its too late. there's also a wide range of food choices, so you'll never go hungry.
