Pearce was one of the first signings made by former manager Neil Warnock last summer when he joined on a free transfer from Portsmouth. The central defender was a regular in the side until his sending off against Watford in November and he has struggled to break back into the side since. The 25-year-old got his opportunity following Tom Lees sending off at Ipswich Town last month and he has now started the last five games. Fellow centre back Lee Peltier was also missing with an ankle injury in recent weeks and despite the club captain returning to the squad for the trip to Birmingham City on Saturday, Pearce retained his place in the side alongside Lees. Pearce now feels he has regained his match fitness after being a bit part player for four months and he wants to keep it going in the final weeks of the season. \"For me personally I am just trying to do my best. I had a long time out of the team, I think I lost a little bit of sharpness but hopefully I have got that back now and I`ll try and put in the performances,\" Pearce told the official website . \"I`m just going to do my best before the end of the season and hopefully I will fit into his plans.\" Pearce has made 39 appearances in his debut season for Leeds with 30 of those being starts. He is now closing in on 300 senior appearances since making his debut for Woking in 2007.
