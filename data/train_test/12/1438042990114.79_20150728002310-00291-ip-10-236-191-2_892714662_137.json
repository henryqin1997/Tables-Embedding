            "The campus is really safe. Campus police are always around and there are these things call blue phones that are place all around campus if you need to call for an emergency.",

            "It does cost a lot and some things don't seem to go toward the quality of education.",
            "There are places to walk to downtown of the university. There are shows of dancing and acting that are held on campus. There are also a lot of football events that everyone enjoys.",
            "There are plenty of places on campus to get food. There are even delivery available.",
            "There were a lot of students accepted this year so I was put in an overflow room. However, they did move me into an apartment before the second semester. It's a good place to live but you don't really get the full freshman experience.",
            "The work is difficult but there are always people to help. You just have to make the effort.",
            "My advice to any student considering this school is be prepared to work and have friendships that will last a lifetime. Apply early to the school to get priority in housing. Begin to look for scholarships as soon as possible. Transportation is a little difficult to look for after 5 but if you have a car you'll be good. Have a lot of orange and purple clothing for game days and orange Fridays which is every Friday. Join IPTAY for good football game tickets and discount for some restaurants around the school.",
            "I am a second semester freshman and so far I love it here. It is a big transition from home (I live four hours away). This school is everything I dreamed of and more."

Applied learning has helped to advance Clemson to the top 20 public schools in the country as of 2014. Overall the University wants you to succeed in academics as well as future career opportunities, producing successful students., 578417=I'd say there's probably around a 1000 people affiliated in greek life? It's everywhere but you definitely DON'T have to join to make friends or feel complete, 23290=Clemson has many things to do. There are always sports going on. You can join intramural, club, or varsity sports. There are many clubs and leisure skill classes you can take. Clemson also has random activities that they send you emails about. Last December, Clemson even went to the extent to set up an ice skating rink right on campus., 814391=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 667409=Clemson is a great campus to be on during the school year and even when school is not in session. It is ranked in the top 25 for colleges and has great staff that are very welcoming. I cannot wait to start in August., 662857=I had no intention of going to Clemson until I toured in April of senior year. The campus was beautiful and there was something about it that made it feel like a close-knit community. There's not much to do in the surrounding area if you don't have a car but there are so many organizations on campus that if you just give your email at the organizations fair, you'll always be a part of something and have something to do. I'm not a huge fan of the housing and dining but that's pretty much all that's ever bothered me., 434569=Keep your GPA up and your SAT score high. Clemson is selective, but it never hurts to apply even if you think you will not get in! Also, never think that just because you have a 1600 on the SAT or a 4.0 you will get in. Clemson seems to look a lot at extracurricular activities too., 199601=clemson is definitely a sports-minded school. football season welcomes the tigers in august. in december the torch is handed to basketball season. and in march we are graced by baseball season. throughout the year there are also other sporting events to go to and for those who are not interested in sports, clemson offers great bands for concerts in the coliseum on campus. clemson also organizes social events for all tigers, not just greek life. if clemson can't entertain you, there is sure to be something happening in charlotte, nc or atlanta, ga which are both a short two hour drive from clemson.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Clemson University is a great college with much to offer. The campus is beautiful and spacious, the faculty, staff, and students are nice and regardless the situation you will feel at home. Am learning a lot Adjusting from the high school atmosphere to the college life atmosphere was not easy but can be made successful. In high school things often seem to come to you easy and you barely have to study, you enjoy and spend a lot of time with your friends, completing homework and assignments would not have taken much of your time, and things were pretty much handed to you. But, in college, and that being any college you attend, things are different. In college you are an adult and pretty much make your own rules and schedule. You decide what classes you are going to take and when you will take those classes. You have to learn how to balance your academics and social life and that is one thing that I have learned from my first year attending college. Time management is a big deal and should be practiced daily when in college. You have to study and not procrastinate which is another task you will learn if you have not already. So you will learn a lot that being learning the campus to learning how",
