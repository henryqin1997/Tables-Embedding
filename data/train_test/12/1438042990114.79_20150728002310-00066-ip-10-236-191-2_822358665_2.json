He entered a treatment facility for alcohol addiction at 19, and most recently completed voluntary treatment for unspecified substance addiction at a rehab facility in April., 18057=\u201cI've learned as I went along. I didn't come out of some school knowing how to act,\u201d he told the Boston Herald in 2009. \u201cI put this all together as time has gone along.\", 18700=\u201cIf you're an aspiring actor and you want a good character study, you should be a taxi driver for a while \u2014 you see a lot of characters,\u201d he joked to US Weekly magazine in 2010., 20842=\u201cIf I were to give... a 'most improved,' it would go to Cory,\u201d Glee co-star and singer Matthew Morrison told the Associated Press in 2010. \u201cHe wasn't a singer. Definitely wasn't a dancer. To see where he's come, I feel like such a proud teacher ... or almost like a proud parent. It's crazy.\u201d, 19328=Cory Allan Michael Monteith was born May 11, 1982, in Calgary, Alberta, and grew up in Victoria, BC, after his parents divorced when he was 7. He said that the split affected him deeply and that he soon began dabbling in petty crime, alcohol and drugs., 21096=Early on, Glee \u201cauto-tuned\u201d Monteith's performances; in later seasons, thanks to his diligent improvement, he didn't require such electronic manipulation. His first performance before a live audience was at the White House in 2010.}",
