Tips for prospective students Stay on top of you studies and homework. It really makes a difference and you feel more accomplished. Plus, you can look back and say I did that. I finished college. In three sentences Going to Hocking College is one of the best choices I have ever made in my life. The location is beautiful and there is a lot of outdoor activities to do. Also, the faculty and staff are super nice and super helpful when you do ask for help and provides hands-on learning. Which a lot of other colleges do not.
