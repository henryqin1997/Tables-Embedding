            "Greek Life on campus is amazing. There are many different social and honorary fraternities and sororities. The different fraternities and sororities work together and lift each other up and gives all students involved a sense of belonging.",
            "Northwest is great for all kinds of students. Whether they be shy or outgoing.",

Northwest is a great school but the town Maryville can get very cold and have very strong winds. Please dress accordingly., 258487=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 183739=The campus is switching to a new dining plan in the 2013 Fall semester. According to the new plan there will be many great places to eat. There is also a small store that you can buy snack food and other supplies (trash bags, cleaning supplies) and is open 24hours. You can also use your meal card on the vending machines all over campus for a quick snack., 59250=The bang for your buck is probably one of the best you can get in Missouri and around northern Missouri. If you did A+ in the Missouri Schools then you get an easy 1500 bucks a year for 3 years, and all you need to keep is a 3.0 GPA. Even though it's a cheaper college the level of education that comes with it is awesome, its definitely a bang for your buck starting at around 14,000 a year., 180618=Lots of options for places to live. May live in a new suite style dorm, the older dorms, apartments, frat houses, etc. Many options off campus also., 133724=The Hangars ( movies), Outback, Molly's, the Lake. There are also event such as speakers, comedy shows, and other performers that come to the school. The events are usually free. This past October 4 comedians performed at our school for free and the last guest was Steve'O from Jackass. There is always something to do on campus for free.}",
