Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. It is understood that flash memory device 1 may be utilized in any of a number of devices or systems requiring nonvolatile memory. For instance, flash memory device 1 may be located in an electronics system 100 (FIG. 4) having a processing unit 102 that accesses data stored in flash memory device 1. System 100 may be, for example, a computer and/or data processing device, or a telecommunications device, such as a wireless telephone. In the event that the memory read operation is to be performed in the same dual bank (or core bank 2) as the dual bank (core bank 2) in which the ongoing memory modify operation is being performed, control circuit 15 prevents at 417 the data read from appearing at data I/O pins 14. This may be undertaken in a number of ways. Compare circuit 31 controls multiplexer circuit 29 so that the output of status generation circuit 30 (having status information relating to the ongoing memory modify operation) is provided to data I/O circuit 13. At this point, the",
