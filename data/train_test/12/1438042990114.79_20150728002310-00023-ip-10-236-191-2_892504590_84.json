Even though I'm technically an out of state student, I was able to get the Weber Edge Scholarship which pays for the out-of-state portion of tuition (which also isn't bad), and now I have in-state tuition! I love it here and would recommend their hybrid classes, which allow you to get the same credit in half the time - my hybrid classes ends October 17 and I still get 3 credit hours!, 478547=There was an incident with cheating in the math department this year. I felt like my classes offered a challenge for me. My 1010 Psychology class seemed a little elementary, but still intriguing., 121533=Ogden Greek Festival every October. Great food, great people, lots of fun and great opportunities for a multicultural experience.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Weber is great for all sorts of people. I've seen high school kids and 60+ year olds in my classes. The majority of people on campus are commuters, but they do have on-campus housing options. Weber is great for those who want to learn but don't have a lot to spend. It is definitely not a party school, though; no drugs and alcohol allowed on campus, and you will actually learn something. Tips for prospective students Get involved. It's the only way to have fun. They have a club for EVERYTHING. From ballroom to anime to martial arts and beyond, there's nothing that can't entertain you on campus. Also, get to know your professors. I recommend dropping by their offices in the first three weeks of class, at least those you plan to work hard for. They're bored during that time anyways, and it'll make you stand out to go say hello and try to get a feel for their class. Bang for the buck Weber is amazing at the price. Being a public school, tuition is only about $5,000 a year.
