    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{7514=Prof. Marjorie Walker currently holds the position of Professor of Anatomical Pathology in the School of Medicine and Public Health at the University of Newcastle. Prior to her appointment at Newcastle, Professor Walker held concurrent appointments as Reader and Honorary Consultant with the Histopathology Centre for Pathology at Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust Cellular Pathology Department, St Mary\u2019s Hospital. She also served as Assistant Admissions Tutor at Imperial College. Her diagnostic specialty areas are GI pathology, Uropathology and Dermatopathology. Professor Walker has also previously held the position of Honorary Associate Professor in the Faculty of Medicine, University of Sydney, Australia (2008-11)., 6740=Research Expertise My expertise as a histopathologist is in interpretation of clinical or molecular events in tissue sections, correlating both routine pathology and immunocytochemistry to demonstrate particular cells or their function or secretion with clinical patient data. I principally work in gastrointestinal and urological pathology, particularly prostate cancer. In the last 10 years I have developed expertise in upper gastrointestinal pathology and my current research is focused on finding biomarkers and pathways in functional bowel diseases, named functional as there is no discernible organic pathology.Over the next 5 years I plan to complete the investigation of functional bowel disorders and other gastrointestinal disorders to unravel the pathology which occurs in these diseases, and hope to elucidate the cause of these distressing conditions with the aim of devising effective agents for treatment. I am also working on coeliac disease and plan to continue defining parameters for diagnosis of coeliac disease in conjuction with the International Coeliac Definitions Group. Teaching Expertise My teaching experience extends across Undergraduate, Masters and Postgraduate levels. I have taught histopathology to undergraduate and graduate entry students at Imperial College in years 1 - 5, from basic principles to systems pathology. I contribute to course design, exam development and marking - as a senior examiner in pathology at Imperial College I have responsibility for setting and marking all years of undergraduates, and attend group marking sessions and examinations meetings. As Divisional Head of Teaching for Investigative Science (1999-2003), in the curriculum review at that time, I ensured that pathology was introduced as a standalone course, comprising lectures, tutorials and clinicopathological conferences to ensure that students see the integration of clinicians and the different pathology disciplines. I have lectured on principles of pathology to wide ranging groups, for example, perioperative surgical practitioners and ophthalmology FY2s. I also give invited lectures at National and International meetings. Administrative Expertise I have extensive administrative experience, having served on numerous committees and held the position of Assistant Admissions tutor at Imperial College. In this role, I was the sole clinician on the team and my duties included:, 3728=I am also the UK representative for the European Society of Pathology Gastrointestinal Working Group (2005 \u2013 Present), which decides on topics of interest for short courses, symposia and slide seminars at the now yearly European Congress of Pathology. I have organised all types of sessions, which involves inviting histopathologists from Europe to participate. I undertake review of papers for Gut, American Journal of Gastroenterology, Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Histopathology, Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Journal of Clinical Pathology, European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Clin Chem Acta, European Journal of Surgical Oncology and the British Journal of Medical and Surgical Urology. I also review grants for CRUK and NHMRC (Australia) and am an Editorial Board member of Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics. Collaborations My research collaborations include:}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{46674=Background Study of the upper gastrointestinal microbiome has shown that other bacteria besides Helicobacter pylori flourish despite the hostile environment. Whilst H. pylori is the most studied bacteria in this region with a defined role in inflammation and neoplasia, it is apparent that other bacteria may contribute to UGI disease. Aim To review current knowledge of bacteria inhabiting the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum. Methods Published studies on the upper gastrointestinal microbiome (extracted from PubMed during the last 20 years). Results The stomach is a hostile environment for bacteria; however, recent studies categorising the microbiota have shown surprising results. Helicobacter pylori has been intensively studied since 1984 and recent sequencing analysis of other gastric microbiota shows that H. pylori is not alone. Composition can be influenced by acid suppression, gastritis and abundance of H. pylori. Eradication of H. pylori, whilst decreasing gastric cancer is associated with an increase in asthma, reflux and obesity. A future approach may be to selectively eradicate bacteria which predispose to inflammation and cancer as opposed to a comprehensive knockout policy. In the oesophagus, viridans streptococci are the most common bacteria influenced by both oral and gastric bacteria. Oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus are characterised by a significant decrease in Gram-positive bacteria and an increase in Gram-negative bacteria. An inverse association of H. pylori and oesophageal adenocarcinoma is described. The duodenal microbiome has been shown to influence small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, irritable bowel syndrome and coeliac disease. The numbers of bacteria recoverable by culture are variable in the stomach mucosa and gastric juice, typically 102-104 colony-forming units (CFU)/g or mL and in the oesophagus, up to 104 bacteria per mm2 mucosal surface. In the small bowel, in health, 103 CFU/mL are normal. Conclusion This review highlights current knowledge of upper gastrointestinal bacteria and associations with disease. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd., 55159=Background Activation of the immune system has been demonstrated in atopy and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Previous data from our group have suggested a connection between immune dysregulation, FGIDs and mood disorders. Aim To investigate if these data translate to clinical practice and examine connections from the perspective of FGIDs to determine whether atopy and FGIDs are connected via mood disorders. Methods Evidence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD) and constipation was sought from the medical records of 30 000 primary care records over a minimum 5 year period. The same records yielded diagnoses of four atopic conditions (asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis/hay fever and conjunctivitis). Results Atopic conditions were found in excess among all FGID groups considered when compared with controls. In the groups with IBS alone (OR = 1.43, 1.29-1.58), FD alone (OR = 1.41, 1.26-1.58) and those with multiple FGIDs (OR = 1.92, 1.75-2.12) there was elevated prevalence of asthma compared with controls without a FGID. Across disorders the excess was generally highest among patients diagnosed with multiple FGIDs (rhinitis/hay fever OR = 3.74, 3.32-4.20; conjunctivitis OR = 3.00, 2.49-3.62) and was only partly explained by a common association between both FGIDs and atopic conditions with mood disorders, although not for every atopic/FGID combination (rhinitis/hay fever OR = 2.60, 2.29-2.96, conjunctivitis OR = 2.34, 1.90-2.87). Conclusions Irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia and constipation share an association with atopy that is only partly explained via a common connection with mood disorders. These data have important implications for understanding both the pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders and development of new treatments. \u00c2\u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd., 248902=Copyright 2015 CRICOS Provider Number 00109J The University of Newcastle, Australia, 74530=Coeliac disease is defined as a small bowel enteropathy due to immune mediated damage on exposure to gluten in the diet, occurring in those with a genetic predisposition to this condition. Previously considered rare, the prevalence of coeliac disease is increasing due to a genuine rise in incidence and also better detection. The diagnosis of coeliac disease involves many disciplines, presentation is varied and if the diagnosis is delayed there is a risk of poor quality of life and a small increase in malignancy. Serology is a first line test, followed by confirmatory small intestinal biopsy. This review discusses the clinicopathological approach to diagnosis, through serology and biopsy and discusses complications which occur in some individuals, namely refractory coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. The entity of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity is also entering the spectrum of coeliac diagnosis and may lead to an extension of the diagnostic parameters of coeliac disease. \u00c2\u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd., 17057=Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder defined by symptoms in the absence of overt pathology. Colonic spirochetosis (CS), defined by histologic observation of spirochetal strains of Brachyspira in colonic biopsies, is uncommon and considered of doubtful significance. We aimed to determine the prevalence of CS in the general population, identify subtle colon pathologies, and evaluate a link with symptoms of IBS. Colonoscopy was performed in 745 subjects (aged 19-70 years, mean age 51 years, 43% male) with biopsies (ileum and 4 colonic sites) from a random population sample, Stockholm, Sweden, who completed a validated questionnaire of gastrointestinal symptoms; IBS was identified by Rome III criteria. CS was identified by histology and immunohistochemistry. In a general population, 17 individuals (2.28%; 95% confidence interval, 1.2%-3.5%) were diagnosed as having CS by histology; 6 (35%) had IBS. CS was always present in the sigmoid colon, but only 14 rectal biopsies. Eosinophils were increased in colon biopsies in CS cases versus controls, in the transverse (P =.02), sigmoid colon (P =.001), and rectum (P =.0005) with subepithelial eosinophil clusters (P =.053). Lymphoid follicles (at any site) were present in 13 CS (P =.0003). There was a 3-fold increased risk of IBS in CS (odds ratio, 3.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-10.11; P =.015). Polyps and diverticular disease were similar in CS cases and controls. The prevalence of CS in a general population is 2% and associated with nonconstipating IBS. Colonic eosinophilia with lymphoid follicles may signify the presence of CS.}",
