The Falkland Islands War involved maybe 50 people. So, the selection was awkward. I also was bothered that the author made too many apologies for the \"losers.\" Sure, they might mutilate and eat the British; but the British burned their fields. I dislike books that go out of their way to making me feel guilty. The author spent almost as much time apologising for \"native\" atrocities as he did ridiculing the British. ...more",

It is easy to understand one argument - the Marxist argument, that says the oppressed masses rose up against the nobles. The other argument is harder to summarize. A group of authors who challenge the Marxist view encompasses them. The main theme being that the nobility was often supporting the many reforms of the bourgeois. Other proponents have established that the theory is really presenting two revolutions: 1) The bourgeois and lesser nobility pushing for an industrialized society and abandoning the old feudal society. The dramatic success of this economic revolution fostered a peasant revolution that sought a social revolution. Just as the administration of King Louis failed to control the bourgeois revolt, the bourgeois administration was unable to manage the peasant revolt. The second theory is difficult to textualize in that many authors challenging the Marxist view do not actually propound the argument of two revolutions; but merely point out weaknesses in the Marxist interpretation. ...more",

Towards the middle of the book is an excellent section on analyzing people. I enjoyed the way the ancient authors advised their rulers to question/test people for different qualities and different positions. The last section of the book pertains to topography and the physical environment. This is the most difficult section for someone who is not well versed in Eastern Philosophy to understand. There are many different concepts for things like Chi and the 100 armies that make little sense to Westerners and Sawyer is not clear in reinforcing a definition for these concepts. He does try to describe Chi; but something is lost in the translation as the ancient authors clearly devoted considerable thought to it. ...more",
