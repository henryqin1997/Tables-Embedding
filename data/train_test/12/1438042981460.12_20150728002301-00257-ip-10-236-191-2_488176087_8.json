In addition to the previously mentioned example, successful experiments were performed with other embodiments of the polishing means according to the invention. In these experiments the volume ratios between the polishing component, demineralised water and chemical activator were 100:100:25, 100:60:50 and 100:60:40, respectively. It is to be noted that the elements 65 and 79 in FIGS. 11 and 13 may have either a reflecting or a collimating character, dependent on the curvature of the elements. The devices shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 are provided with an X-ray tube 71 and a detector 73 each. The device of FIG. 12 also has transmission gaps 75 for limiting the divergence of X-ray radiation incident on a pivotable calibration sample 77, and a gap 78 in front of the detector which determines the acceptance angle of the radiation. The copper sample 77 has a surface 77a polished by means of the method according to the invention. The device of FIG. 13 has a mirror 79 for dispersive processing of radiation incident on a sample 81. The mirror 79 has a surface 79a obtained by means of the method according to the invention. The device shown in FIG. 11 comprises an energy-dispersive spectrometer 60, an X-ray tube 62, a transmission gap 64 and a plane or curved mirror 65 for dispersive processing of",
