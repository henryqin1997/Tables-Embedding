Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection.",
