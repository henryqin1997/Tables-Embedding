This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 21214=The move comes in after a reduction in inflation from 1.7% to a three-year low of 1.2% in April and unemployment\u00a0hitting its highest level. Joblessness remains at elevated levels across the 17 eurozone states recording above 12% including a Spanish rate of nearly 27% (Italy ETF Plunges on Election Chaos)., 66443=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 20347=The European Central Bank (ECB) took its first step in ten months to avoid falling into a deeper recession by cutting its benchmark interest rate. The interest rate, which was last changed in July 2012, has now been reduced by a quarter percentage point to a record low of 0.50%. Also, the marginal lending rate was reduced to 1.0% from 1.5% (Euro Small Cap ETFs: The Way to Play Europe?)., 21628=Also, euro-zone manufacturing activity contracted at a slower-than-forecast pace in April, with the manufacturing PMI falling slightly to 46.7 from 46.8 in March. It seems that the weakness in the commodity market is putting pressure on inflation., 23440=Launched in Dec 2005, this ETF tracks the movement of the euro relative to the USD, net of the Trust expenses, which are expected to be paid from the interest earned on the deposited euros., 14877=by Zacks Equity Research \u00a0\u00a0Published on May 09, 2013 |, 20846=In fact, the ECB President has promised to provide ample liquidity to Eurozone banks until next July in an effort to support the recession hit economy. It also seeks to support smaller companies which were affected by poor liquidity condition. However, it seems that steps taken by the\u00a0ECB would have little impact on the economy in the short term., 25271=Launched in May 2008, this note seeks to track the performance of the Double Long Euro Index, net of fees and expenses.
