Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Echo Star in general - it is a blend of high-tech recycled plastic with a minimum of 80% and up to 100% pre-consumer plastic. It provides nearly the same durability as other Innova premium plastics with a superior grip, even better grip than the already grippy Star plastic. Echo Star has great characteristics and it's environmentally friendly too.\u00a0 Speed 9, Glide 5, Turn -4, Fade 1 It is a great choice for first distance driver, roller disc, tailwind driver, narrow woods driver, downhill distance, and long turnover drives. \u2022 Beginners - a great control driver to maximize distance \u2022 Skilled players - predictable turn and slow fade, tailwind drives \u2022 Power throwers - Long turnovers and rollers The Innova Echo Star Roadrunner is a beginner friendly understable long-range distance driver golf disc with lots of glide. It makes an excellent finesse driver or long range roller. Power throwers can use this disc for long turnover shots and rollers. Less powerful throwers can use this disc for long, straight shots or",
    "textAfterTable": "\"The Roadrunner is a disc that everyone from beginner to Super-Pro should have in their bag. It's an under-stable finesse distance driver that will hold a straight-line on a tunnel-shot...and is excellent for downhill or downwind shot's. If you rip on it hard and turn it over a little...YOU HAVE A GREAT ROLLER!!!\" - Joel Kelly \"Another great versatile disc. Great range as a straight flier and can be very effective as a turnover/roller disc. Put one of these in your bag for those tight fairways!\" - Matt LaCourte Jr \"The StarLite Roadrunner is my favorite disc. I use it for anhyzers and long, accurate upshots under 275'. It is easy to throw for beginners and if you have trouble throwing anhyzers, try one in lighter weights between 134g-145g.\" - Holly Finley \"The Roadrunner is a great compliment to the Leopard. It has a similar flight path but will fly 10-20% farther. It is a go to disc for my hyzer flip and tunnel shots.\" - Mike Solt If you want a disc with more Fade, try the Valkyrie more Turn, try the Mamba more Glide, try the Archangel Other Speed 9 discs include the Firebird, FL, Sidewinder, Valkyrie and Viking.
