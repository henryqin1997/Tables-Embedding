No. 08/727,789 filed Oct. 7, 1996., 46880=When book 135 is positioned between upper and lower platens 42,44 of laminator 40 as shown in FIG. 7, the laminator is closed and a heat cycle in the range of 175\ufffd F. to 300\ufffd F., and most preferably in the range of 180\ufffd F. to 275\ufffd F., is applied to book 135 for a period of 10 to 25 minutes to produce a pressure on book 135 of between 200 to 450 psi, preferably 250-350 psi, with a ram pressure that varies depending upon sheet size or the ram size of the laminator 40, but which is typically approximately 1000 p.s.i. with an 18 inch diameter ram. This step causes the overlaminate layer 38 to flow in order to produce a uniform protective layer over the printing.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Those skilled in the art will recognize that the foregoing description has set forth the preferred embodiment of the invention in particular detail and it must be understood that numerous modifications, substitutions, and changes may be undertaken without departing from the true spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the ensuing claims. In an alternative embodiment, a cavity or window 16 is formed in the first or second sheet of plastic core stock, prior to the first lamination step. The core stock is positioned over the electronic element, generally 20, to expose one or more contact pads 26. This may also be done using electronic elements wherein microprocessor chip 22 is already attached to contact pads 26 and/or antenna 24 in which case the cavity is positioned over and around chip 22. As shown in FIG. 5a, a spacer 90 is inserted into cavity 16 and over contact pads 26 or chip 22. The spacer 90 may be integral to one of the matte laminating plates 50, 52 or separate therefrom and made of any suitable non-stick material such as Teflon\u2122 Spacer 90 is utilized to prevent or limit the flow of plastic into cavity 16 during the lamination process so as not to cover contact pads 26 or chip 22 with plastic. When spacer 90 is non-integral with matte laminating plate 50 or 52 it may be removed or cut-away after either",
