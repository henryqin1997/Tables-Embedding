Assume that the most recent log data in rate log 88 for average response time for a particular device indicates 2.00 seconds, that the time period for that entry is from 8:00 a.m. on Dec. 1, 1997 through 5:00 p.m. on Dec. 3, 1997, and that the threshold value for the response time of that device is 5%. If the current rate table information (assume the information is for Dec. 3, 1997 from 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) indicates an average response time of 2.02 seconds, which is within the threshold value of 5% of the logged 2.00 seconds, then the end time for the time period in rate log 88 is updated to the end time for the current rate table information, thereby changing the entry in rate log 88 to indicate an average response time for the device of 2.00 seconds with a time period from 8:00 a.m. on Dec. 1, 1997 through 6:00 p.m. on Dec. 3, 1997. However, if the current performance information indicates an average response time of 15.00 seconds, which is not within the threshold value of 5% of the logged 2.00 seconds, then the current entry in rate log 88 remains unchanged and a new entry in rate log 88 is created, indicating an average response time for the device of 15.00 seconds with a time period from 5:00 p.m. on Dec. 3, 1997 through 6:00 p.m. on Dec. 3, 1997., 31368=Network management is the process of managing the various network devices and network communication links to provide the necessary network services to the users of the network. Typical network management systems collect information regarding the operation and performance of the network and analyze the collected information to detect problems in the network. The amount of data collected in such a manner can be vast and increases as the size of the network (e.g., the number of interconnected devices in the network) increases and as the collection frequency increases. For example, tracking information for a network having 1000 interconnected devices can easily result in over 100 Mbytes of data daily. Although it would be beneficial to have access to such information over time, typical network management systems do not allow for the ability to store such large amounts of data. Furthermore, for many networks the storage capacity required to store such large amounts of data is prohibitively expensive., 43765=In a particular embodiment of the invention, a separate cognitive signature is provided for each day of the week. A cognitive signature for a particular day of the week may include data separated into multiple time periods (e.g., each hour of the day). For example, a cognitive signature for Tuesday may include a particular time period that represents the normal operating mode (based on collected historical data) for a particular network device from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday. A cognitive signature for Saturday may include a time period that represents the normal operating -mode for a particular network interface from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Saturday., 52741=The information from log table 68 is used to periodically update a rate table, block 50. A rate table 78 according to one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 7. Rate table 78 maintains the minimum, average, and maximum performance information until rate log 88 of FIG. 8 and change log 116 of FIG. 11, both discussed below, can be updated. Rate table 78 includes up to one row per device or application in the network environment (column 80). A start time (column 84) and an end time (column 86) is maintained for each entry. In the illustrated implementation, the start and end times cover one-hour periods (e.g., 8:00 a.m.-9:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m.-10:00 a.m., etc.), so that rate table 78 has a granularity of one hour. For each piece of performance information in columns 72 of log table 68, the minimum and maximum values are identified and the average value is calculated for each time period. The average values can be calculated either with or without regard for the duration of such values. For example, if a particular piece of information had a value of 2 from 8:00 a.m. to 8:45 a.m., and a value of 8 from 8:45 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., the average could be calculated without regard for time (e.g., the value of (2+8)/2, or 5), or with regard for the time (e.g., the value of (2\ufffd45+8\ufffd15)/60, or 3.5)., 74681=By way of example, assume that the \u201ccurrent\u201d time is 8:00 a.m. on Jul. 1, 1998. If a user desires to know the configuration of the network on Jan. 1, 1998 at 8:00 a.m., then configuration log 158 need simply be searched for any changes which occurred after Jan. 1, 1998 at 8:00 a.m. By working \u201cbackwards\u201d from base configuration table 150, any such identified changes can be \u201creversed\u201d and a table generated of the network configuration as it existed on Jan. 1, 1998 at 8:00 a.m., 54190=Due to the maintenance of data on an hourly basis in rate table 78, information more than an hour old need not be maintained in log table 68. Thus, each hour when rate table 78 is updated, only the most recent entry for a device need be maintained in log table 68. For example, if log table 68 includes one entry for a particular device from 8:00 a.m. to 8:45 a.m., and a second entry for that device from 8:45 a.m. to the current time (i.e., 9:00 a.m.), then the first entry covering the 8:00 a.m. to 8:45 a.m. information can be deleted once rate table 78 is updated. Furthermore, all \u201ccurrent\u201d time entries in log table 68 are updated to the current time after rate table 78 is updated. This updating is done to ensure that accurate information can be stored in rate table 78 at hourly intervals. Again, using the preceding example, the information from the first entry (8:00 a.m. to 8:45 a.m.) and the second entry (8:45 a.m. to the current time, 9:00 a.m.) is used to generate the 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. entry for the device in rate table 78. Since the next entry that will be generated for that device in rate table 78 is for the time period 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., the current entry in log table 68 is updated so that the start time is 9:00 a.m. (all other information in the entry is left unchanged). Alternatively, rather than updating current time entries, the start time could remain unchanged and earlier times can simply be ignored when updating rate table 78.}",
