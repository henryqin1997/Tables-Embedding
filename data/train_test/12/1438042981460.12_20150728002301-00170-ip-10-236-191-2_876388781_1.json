    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5503=McBride's \"Waking Up Laughing\" and \"Shine\" were the last deployed by RCA records (in 2007 and 2009, respectively) before she signed with Republic Nashville. What followed was the critical and commercial hit \"I'm Gonna Love You Through It,\" which became part of a national campaign to promote breast cancer survivors., 8351=McBride recently announced she will deck the hall (and her stage) during what has become her annual Joy of Christmas Tour. The 2013 version is a 12-night trek that begins November 29 in Huntington, West Virginia and wraps December 21 in Chicago, Illinois. It includes a December 4 show at the historic Ryman Auditorium, and all stops will feature McBride and her 12-piece band., 5132=Currently spreading holiday cheer on her \"The Joy of Christmas\" tour, Martina will join forces with country stalwart George Strait in 2013. The \"Cowboy Rides Away\" tour will be the last for Strait, a true icon with career accomplishments that include 59 number one hits and over 65 million albums sold. The tour is set to run through 2013 and into 2014. Currently dates have been announced from January through mid-April, making stops across the United States., 10175=There will be shortage of chances to see Martina McBride on the road this year. Fans will be excited to know her current tour has been extended through the summer of 2015 due to high ticket demand. \"The band and I are having so much fun on this Everlasting tour,\" McBride said in a press release. \"I really wanted to put together a show that is as visually entertaining as it is musically entertaining.\", 7956=In 2012, McBride's 16-city tour proved to the be the highlight of the season to many of her fans. They packed stop after stop, and were treated to staples like \"I'll Be Home For Christmas,\" \"Let It Snow,\" and her can't-miss version of \"O Holy Night.\" Guests also included the likes of former Chicago Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher, Green Bay Packer Jordy Nelson, hockey great Jim Dowd and many others., 9733=The tour takes its name from McBride's latest album, \"Everlasting,\" which was released back in 2014. It is her 12th album, and features a mix of genres, including covers of soul and R&B classics. Joining McBride on stage each night is a full horn section and a roster of backup singers and dancers., 7506=Beyond her Christmas tour, McBride has also been holed up in her studio working on a new album expected to drop in early 2014. Though details of the project are scarce, she told CBS News \"It's gonna be awesome,\" and has also used words like 'unique and special' when talking about it. The disc comes on the heels of \"Eleven,\" the country star's most recent studio album from back in 2011. It contained \"I'm Gonna Love You Through It,\" which became an anthem for breast cancer survivors around the world, and has inspired McBride to take part in the Save Lids to Save Lives program for Breast Cancer Awareness Month., 9052=Fans don't need to worry that the current tour won't include McBride's staple songs. The setlist still includes songs like \"Independence Day,\" \"A Broken Wing\" and \"This One's For the Girls.\" The tour resumed February 10 in Midwest City, Oklahoma and will make upcoming stops in Mississippi, Texas, Wisconsin, Iowa, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, California and several more states. She'll also move north of the border in July to play in Canada., 3874=Martina McBride was born Martina Mariea Schiff in Sharon, Kansas, in 1966. She started singing at age 8 in her father's band, called The Schiffters, but soon took on a bigger role. It was in 1990 that country icon Garth Brooks, impressed with McBride's spirit, asked her to open for him, and her career took off. Her debut album, The Time Has Come, released in 1992, was a collection of traditional country, with honky-tonk and folk influences. With the release of McBride's second album, The Way That I Am, she began a succession of country and pop hits, including 'Indepndence Day' and 'My Baby Loves Me' from that album, then several from her albums Wild Angels (1995), Evolution (1997) and Emotion. In recent years, McBride's music has crossed over into pop territory, and several cuts from her Greatest Hits album in 2001 have made it onto Billboard pop charts in addition to country charts., 6007=The best example of that connection was found in the 2005 release of \"Timeless,\" an album consisting of country standards like Hank Williams' \"You Win Again,\" Loretta Lynn's \"You Ain't Woman Enough,\" and Kris Kristofferson's \"Help Me Make It Through the Night.\" It marked the highest sales start for a Martina McBride album, with the lead single, \"(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden\", climbing inside the Top 20 on the country charts., 2639=Martina McBride Tour Dates Concerts Videos Martina McBride Tour The weather outside may be frightful (well, not yet, anyway), but doesn\u2019t a Christmastime concert series with country superstar Martina McBride sound just, well, delightful?
