When the fixtures are released at the begining of the season the first game, both Arsenal and Man U fans alike look for is Arsenal V Man Utd. It is undoubtedly one of the fixtures of the season. Chelsea maybe leading the way, but there is so much rivalry between these two teams that no other game will mean as much. With Arsenal not having beaten United in the league since the famous title winning game at Old Trafford in 2002 the Gunners will be very fired up, coupled with the fact that they need to get their season back on track, suggests that this game will be a classic. Manchester United will still be reeling from the Fa Cup Final defeat that saw Arsenal snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, after The Red Devils battered the Gunners for 120 minutes and yet left Cardiff empty handed.
