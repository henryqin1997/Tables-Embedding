The last entry is the most astonishing of all and makes my point regarding the relative youthfulness of technology. With the above notions in mind, the folks at BGS created a timeline of 46 birthday events of 46 equal time units depicting key geological events in the history of the earth. Many of the following events do not, of course, fall exactly on any specific anniversary. For convenience they are placed to the closest increment. Their belief is that this scale related to human terms may be more understandable. The BGS model considers that our solar system is in its mid-life. Instead of being a planet that is 4600 million years old, it can be thought of as a middle-aged person 46 years old. The BGS believes models that scale the passing of 4600 million years by using a book 460 pages long or a 24 hour day were misleading in that they give the false appearance that once humans appeared we represented the ultimate life form. To do this, geological time, needs to be scaled. If children are challenged to comprehend thousands of years, how can they possibly conceive millions of years? Children are expected to digest the concept of thousands of years when studying the Egyptians, the Romans, or the Vikings. The above document was created as a classroom lesson plan by the British Geological Survey. The plan is built upon the following",

Take time to study the entire timeline. This is a profound perspective on the current speed at which change occurs in our lives. I walk away from this phenomenal timeline with wonderment about what other things in our natural world are evolving that we pay little attention towards. As for our future, will we use technology to make our lives better or are we perhaps evolving ourselves right off the timeline?",
