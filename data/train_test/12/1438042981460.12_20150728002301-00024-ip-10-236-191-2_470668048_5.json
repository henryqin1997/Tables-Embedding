    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17357=An improved type of circuit is a cache address comparator of the type found in, for example, the TMS 2150 cache address comparator produced by Texas Instruments Incorporated. This cache address comparator does not contain a read function, thereby limiting the operations which it is capable of performing or which can be performed therein. Such prior art cache memories include an SRAM, parity generator and checker, comparator and reset circuit. These prior art comparators do not contain a read function. In addition, the comparators are difficult to cascade because they utilize NMOS to totem-pole and can not be ANDed with other similar circuits without the addition of a great deal of additional circuitry. This limits the ability to increase memory storage capability or to increase the range of addresses to which they may be capable of response. It is readily apparent that these deficiencies of the prior art severely limit the use of such cache address comparators., 16163=This is a division of application Ser. No. 940,369, filed Dec. 11, 1986, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,625., 20589=Referring now to FIG. 1, wherein positive logic is utilized, there is shown the CMOS cache memory in accordance with the present invention. The memory includes an SRAM 1 having a 9\ufffd2047 arrangement of memory cells in the preferred embodiment which is provided by way of example and not by way of limitation. The memory also has a plurality of address input A0 to A10 and a plurality of data inputs D0 to D7, the latter with intervening input buffers 3 on each data input line. The reset input passes through an inverter 33 to the RESET bar input of the SRAM 1 and to one of the inputs of OR gate 31. The OR gate 31 also includes as an input thereto the output of comparator 7, the S input and the output of OR gate 23. The output of OR gate 31 includes an open drain circuit as shown in FIG. 2 and, when there is a match in the comparator 7, as will be explained hereinbelow, provides a high output on the MATCH output line.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Though the invention has been described with respect to a specific preferred embodiment thereof, many variations and modifications will immediately become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is therefore the intention that the appended claims be interpretted as broadly as possible in view of the prior art to include all such variations and modifications. It is apparent from the above description relative to FIGS. 1 and 2 that there is provided a cache memory which overcomes the problems of prior art devices and which is cascadable as demonstrated in FIG. 3. FIG. 3 shows the expansion of the cache memory carried out in both depth (more sets) and width (wider address). The least significant address lines (A0 to A10) are used as the set select inputs to the cache memory and system buffer RAM. Set select determines, in the case where, for example, many sets of four chips as shown in FIG. 3 are provided, which set of four chips is to be accessed. The address line A11 is used as a word select. When address line A11 is high, chips A and C are selected. Since chips A and C are each 8 bits wide, sixteen bits (two eight bit data words) are now selected. When address line A11 is low, chips B and D are selected in the same manner. Therefore the top 2K blocks A and C (or B and",
