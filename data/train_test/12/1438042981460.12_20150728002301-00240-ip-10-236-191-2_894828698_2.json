Bradley Smith felt much better on his Aprilia of the Bancaja Aspar team at Le Mans, and returns to a track where he won last year. He will hope for a similar result to lift him from his current place of sixth in the standings. Esteve Rabat (Blusens-STX), Efr\u00e9n V\u00e1zquez (Tuenti Racing) and Marc M\u00e1rquez (Red Bull Ajo Motorsport) will all be candidates for at least the podium and all three will have aspirations of challenging for first wins not only of the season, but of their careers. Terol finished second in last year\u2019s race at Mugello having qualified down in 12th, whilst Tuenti Racing rider Espargar\u00f3 has finished third and fourth in the past two seasons and comes into this race off the back of two straight wins at Jerez and Le Mans. The fantastic contest that is playing out in the 125cc World Championship will also continue and at present it is Nico Terol who leads the standings with a narrow two-point advantage over Pol Espargar\u00f3. 125cc GP BQR-Moto2 Blusens-STX FRA Anthony DELHALLE 96 R(95) BQR-Moto2 Blusens-STX QAT Mashel AL NAIMI 95",
