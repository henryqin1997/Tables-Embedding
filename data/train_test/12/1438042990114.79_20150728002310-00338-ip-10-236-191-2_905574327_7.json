There is always campus security walking around especially at night, to make sure that everything is okay and safe. and if you don't feel safe walking from point A to point B you can call the campus police and they will drive you where need to be. Or even if you need a ride to work. What to do for fun For fun you can take walks around the campus or even the town, ride horses, go to Athens and explore the city. OR go rock climbing, swimming, lift weights, play basketball or table tennis in the student center. Food and Dining The food isn't that of a 5 star restaurant, but it gets the job done. Each day they have a special. The personal favorite is the chinese food day. There is a salad bar and they do have made to order food, like, hamburgers, fries, chicken sandwiches, chicken strips, Fish sandwiches, boneless wings, etc. There is also a convient store where you can do a little grocery shopping Dorm Life Dorm life... Is dorm life. Here everyone is",
