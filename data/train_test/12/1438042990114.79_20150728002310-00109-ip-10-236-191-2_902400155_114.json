            "Due to the location of the school (downtown Akron) the campus could be a little more safe. There is a University Police station and emergency poles, with buttons to press if you are in an emergency that immediately alert the campus police . If the University police are called they can be at the scene in about a minute! The school also has a service available so that if you need an escort to your car (if it's night time or you are just concerned).",
            "The University of Akron has 15 fraternities and 9 sororities!",
            "There are definitely a variety of clubs and activities for the students to enjoy and express who they are while making new friends.",
            "This school is great for outgoing and excited students. Everyone at the University of Akron is so friendly and willing to help you to feel accepted and comfortable. It is also great to the students that are excited and ready for a great education.",
            "I don't know of anything 'unusual' about the University of Akron.",
            "There are a wide variety of classes you can take and the tuition is not the highest at this school. I believe that you get much more out of the education, than the amount of money that you put into this school. They have so much to offer!",
            "Since I am not on campus a lot, I do not know all of the extra activities that the school provides, but I do know we have great options. There is a bowling alley and a billiards room in the Student Union, along with a movie theater! The school is also very close to all the major events that occur downtown. We also have our own recreation center with a pool and all the workout equipment you could ever need.",
            "We have a wonderful selection of food at the University of Akron! Any kind of food you could possibly desire, we have: Subway, Auntie Anne's, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Ohio Burger, just to name a few. We have the Market in the Student Union that also has a variety of dishes, along with Rob's, a buffet of endless options!",
            "I personally commute to campus each day, but the dorms at the University of Akron are great! There are multiple residence halls to choose from, again to help you find your place.",
            "It is as challenging as you make it. Some professors are considered 'difficult,' but if you need help and ask for it you will be able to make it.",
            "I would suggest that you take a campus tour, so you have a good idea of where all the cool, helpful places are. There are also some services that are free to students and are well worth the time. If you need help, ask! Everyone is really helpful and happy to help you improve.",
            "The University of Akron is not a very large university, compared to some, but it is still diverse and has a comfortable atmosphere. It has a variety of areas of study, and excellent resources to help your find your place. The layout of the campus is well organized and provides comfort for new students."

One can go to the game room to bowl and play pool. One can go to the amazing rec center we here, they can go swimming, rock climbing, play sports there, or just workout. One can join intramural teams for sports. Every week there are movies showing. One can go to any of the home sports games at no additional cost. One can also join organizations in which they find interesting. And finally, every week we have different 9:09 and 7:17 events put on by RHPB and RHC., 193993=The Quaker Square Inn is one of the most unusual hotels in the nation, being built within a grain silo. The Hower House is also a historic house that was built in 1871 by John Henry Hower and is filled with unique treasures and furnishings collected by the Hower family during their travels around the world., 53150=You can tell that the university is using tuition for the benefit of the students. Quite a few new buildings have been built since 2005 and they are still in the process of building new dorms and sports facilities. The teachers here actually want to help you succeed, unlike other colleges where they could care less if you attend class or not. With tuition a lot of things are included such as parking passes, membership to the rec center, and all home games for any sport are free to students (you even get points which earn you free stuff just for going to games!)., 637524=Again, The University of Akron is right in downtown Akron so there is a lot to do in the city. We are also very close to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, which has hiking, bikini, canoeing, and many other activities! Cleveland is only a 40 minute drive North and Canton is 20 minutes South. If you are looking to stay on campus, there are movies every Thursday-Saturday in the movie theatre. The game room is open 7 days a week and there is always a sporting event. Men's soccer is particularly popular after they won the NCAA championship in 2010., 51936=Soccer fans (we are home to the 2010 national champions, 2009 runners up; two years ranked number 1 team), students who enjoy small class sizes but still want to experience a large university, 85639=I am starting as a freshmen in the Fall of 2012. I have to learn more about the university in the fall., 781166=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 332261=Akron as amazing new football stadium and are men soccer time is really good. In 2010 Akron were national championships. If you want to go to sport game go to Men Soccer team. Join the Ak-Rowdies. There is lot of fun things to do at Lock 3 and Ej Thomas., 282731=I used to have the Unlimited dining plan. With Unlimited we had 1000 swipes for Rob's Cafe. But if you're really looking for something where you can have access to Subway the market and so on etc I hear the Gold Plan is just one step up from the Unlimited dining plan and you have access to many fast food restaurants., 738221=Make sure you make time to study because it will count. Always party/go out in groups at night. AND NEVER TAKE A 7:45 CLASS BECAUSE YOU WILL HATE IT.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Fill out your FASFA early to get your maximum financial aid package. If you're living in the dorms, you either love it or hate it. I would recommend it to freshman because then you are located in the center of campus and everything is easier to get to. Plus you are closer to the dining hall. Bang for the buck Quality education and a beautiful campus is worth it. The cost is relatively cheap compared to other universities this size. Am enjoying being here I wouldn't be this happy anywhere else! Am learning a lot The classes are generally small and the professors are fantastic. After you finish your electives, all the major-specific class are enticing and exciting. I'm glad I chose Akron over a smaller school. There are tons of opprotuniteis here for internships even in the cities near by like Canton, Stow, even Cleveland.
