Also, as used herein, the article \u201ca\u201d is intended to include one or more items. Where only one item is intended, the term \u201cone\u201d or similar language is used. The scope of the invention is defined by the following claims and their equivalents. In addition, while the present invention has been described in relation to detecting conduits, the present invention may be used to detect any subsurface object. For example, a marker may be affixed to one or more subsurface objects that may then be detected, after burial, in the manner described above. Furthermore, while the conduit location recording device and the conduit locating device have been illustrated and described as separate devices, the functions of both of these devices may be performed by a single device. , the order of the steps is not critical. FIGS. 9-12 The foregoing description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention provides illustration and description, but is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings or may be acquired from practice of the invention.
