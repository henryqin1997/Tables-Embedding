            "The campus is located in the city, so some of those risks do apply. However, our campus safety department runs shuttles from 6pm-2am to get students within 1 mile radius of campus home safely.",
            "As with the rest of the school culture, sororities and fraternities also focus on social justice and community service. However, there are not many of them (5 sororities and 4 fraternities), and they do not have campus housing together.",
            "While we do not have a lot (or the best) sports teams, we are a D1 school. However, in addition to college sports teams, we have academic, social, and political clubs and club sports. Any interest that you have is most likely reflected in a club or organization already on campus.",
            "Loyola is the perfect school for students who are interested in using their skills and knowledge to benefit other people. All students are required to take service learning courses, and get involved with the social service community. LUC will teach students to become people for others, and to use their skills to benefit society as a whole.",
            "On our Lakeshore campus, we have a discounted movie theater that includes a full bar! Furthermore, we have our own art museum (LUMA) and the lake!",
            "Coming from the East Coast, I find Loyola's tuition extremely reasonable compared to university's in Boston. However, folks from the Midwest do see it as a more expensive school. It is all a matter of perspective, but I completed my undergraduate coursework at LUC and chose to stay at grad school here. I am pleased with the value of the education that I received and continue to receive here.",
            "Loyola is in Chicago, so be sure to take advantage of that! The Lakeshore campus is in a fantastic residential neighborhood, complete with bars, restaurants, movie theaters, the beach, and more. The downtown campus is right on Michigan Ave (The Miracle Mile) and from there you can easily get to the Museum Campus, theaters, Wrigley Field or Soldier Field, and so much more.",
            "With 2 dining halls, a food court, and a convenience store on campus, finding decent meals (including vegetarian and gluten free) is not hard. Furthermore, the declining balance (meal plan money) can be used at local restaurants, if you are looking to change it up a bit.",
            "Loyola has spent a lot of time and money in the past few years updating their dorms to provide safe, clean, and enjoyable living environments for their students. As far as dorms go, they are social, spacious, and most included kitchens, either in the dorms' common areas or in the individual rooms. Dorms for between 1 and 6 people are also available, which provides a nice amount of variety.",
            "As in most colleges, there are a range of classes and professors, each with their own levels of rigor. If you are looking to take easy classes, there are options. However, if you are dedicated to hard work and academic intensity, there are also ample options for you to challenge yourself both in and out of the classroom.",
            "IF you are interested in Loyola, be sure to spend a weekend in Chicago first. The University is one thing, but deciding whether or not you want to live in the 3rd biggest city in the country is a huge decision. Really research Chicago, and decide if that is a good fit for you, as well as if the school is.",
            "Loyola's biggest asset is it's embodiment of the Jesuit tradition and Jesuit values. It is unique in its dedication to social justice across all areas of study, a fact that greatly benefits all of its students. Graduates from Loyola truly have the skills to go out and become people for others, regardless of what their future careers may be."

The best place to eat is (currently) Simpson Dining. I would advise not eating at Lakeshore Dining, except come April we won't even have Lakeshore Dining. They are opening up a brand new student center where I'm sure there will be exceptional food., 690229=Well there are the rocks by the lake that everyone loves, and the beach on warmer days to just sit and relax. An unusual tradition would be christmas on campus or the new years party that is held almost every year. The christmas on campus is self explanatory, you basically have christmas on campus! It's wonderful because everything is decorated! The new years party is in early september and its a small celebration for all the students and staff to welcome the new academic school and wish everyone good luck in their endeavors!, 801808=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 102840=Wolf and Kettle day is in March every year when we celebrate the donors of our education and those who help pay for tuition. FUN, 18578=Do not take a class at 8:30 offered at the Water Tower Campus!One of the classes I would highly recommend is Human Values in Literature with Mr. Fruhauff. Overall, try to have an open mind about courses and balance out your schedule so that it fits your needs. Do not try to do too much in one semester but do try to get involved in extra curriculars. You will not regret it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot As a nursing student at Loyola University I was immediately enrolled in classes directly related to my major. The teachers for my nursing classes encouraged me to take initiative in getting involved early within the nursing field. They taught me that nursing is not just taking care of sick patients but taking on the incredible role of helping someone with their spiritual, mental, and physical health. Since I came to Loyola I have become extremely passionate about my chosen career due to the compassion and encouragement of faculty members and fellow students. I am truly excited to take on another year at Loyola.
