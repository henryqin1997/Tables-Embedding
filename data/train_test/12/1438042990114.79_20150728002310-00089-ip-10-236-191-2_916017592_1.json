Both cash inflows and cash inflows excluding interest earnings are displayed. Current estimates by the Department are based on an expected unemployment rate of 5.58% during FY 2009, decreasing to 4.80% in FY 2013 and thereafter. Total cash inflows exceed total cash outflows for all years projected after FY 2009. The net inflow increases from $3.5 billion in FY 2010 to $10.5 billion in FY 2013, leveling off at the $7.1 billion to $10.2 billion range after that, indicating that most States have replenished their funds to desired levels. The net inflow is sustained by the excess of Federal tax collections over Federal expenditures., 11654=The FCI assessments by building and structure are consolidated to calculate an FCI score for the entire portfolio of constructed assets, which is used to evaluate the overall asset condition of the Job Corps portfolio. Job Corps has set the goal of achieving and maintaining an FCI of 90% or greater (the standard used by the National Association of College and University Business Offices) for its portfolio of constructed assets. In 2008, the portfolio's aggregate FCI score for 3,511 constructed assets was 92.2%, and deferred maintenance costs to return the portfolio to an acceptable condition were estimated at $71.9 million, as shown in the table below. The final graph juxtaposes deferred maintenance cost estimates with the FCI trend line for the five year period ending in 2008., 37655=2018, 33045=Charts III and IV demonstrate the effect on accumulated UTF assets of projected total cash inflows and cash outflows of the UTF over the ten year period ending September 30, 2018, under mild and severe recession scenarios. Each scenario uses an open group, which includes current and future participants in the UI program. Charts III and IV assume increased rates of unemployment during mild and deep periods of recession., 3536=DOL Annual Report, Fiscal Year 2008 Performance and Accountability Report, 111924=As discussed in Note 1.L.3, DOL recognized a liability for disability benefits to the extent of unpaid benefits applicable to the current period. Accrued disability benefits payable at September 30, 2008 were $19.5 million. Although no liability was recognized for future payments to be made to present and future program participants beyond the due and payable amounts accrued at year end, future estimated cash inflows and outflows of the BLDTF are tracked by the Department for budgetary purposes. The significant assumptions used in the projections are coal excise tax revenue estimates, number of beneficiaries, life expectancy, medical cost inflation, Federal civilian pay raises, and the interest rate on new repayable advances from Treasury. These projections are sensitive to changes in the tax rate and changes in interest rates on repayable advances from Treasury., 26165=The Federal/State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 provides for the extension of the duration of UI benefits during periods of high unemployment. When the insured unemployment level within a State, or in some cases total unemployment, reaches certain specified levels, the State must extend benefit duration by fifty percent, up to a combined maximum of 39 weeks. Fifty percent of the cost of extended unemployment benefits is paid from the Extended Unemployment Compensation Account within the UTF, and fifty percent by the State, from the State's UTF account., 124581=COMBINING STATEMENT OF BUDGETARY RESOURCES For the Year Ended September 30, 2008, 13715=Buildings and structures - 2007, 37418=2015, 33560=The Department projects the effect of moderate recession on the cash inflows and outflows of the UTF. Under this scenario, which utilizes an unemployment rate peaking at 7.43% in FY 2011, net cash outflows including projected interest earnings and expenses from Federal sources are projected in FY 2009 through FY 2012. Net cash inflows are reestablished in FY 2013 and peak in FY 2016 with a drop in the unemployment rate to 5.11%. Net assets never fall below $32.4 billion and are within $32.4 billion of the balance under expected economic conditions by 2018. The crossover pattern remains the same when interest earnings are excluded., 6415=2008, 32149=Chart II demonstrates the effect of these expected cash inflows and outflows on the net assets of the UTF over the ten year period ended September 30, 2018. Yearly projected total cash inflows, including interest earnings, and cash outflows are depicted, as well as the net effect of this cash flow on UTF assets., 127049=Unobligated balance, brought forward, October 1, 116221=2014 - 2040, 24290=The UI program provides regular and extended benefit payments to eligible unemployed workers. Regular UI program benefits are established under State law, payable for a period not to exceed a maximum duration. In 1970, Federal law began to require States to extend this maximum period of benefit duration by fifty percent during periods of high unemployment. These extended benefit payments are paid equally from Federal and State accounts., 115333=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SUPPLEMENTARY SOCIAL INSURANCE INFORMATION CASH INFLOW AND OUTFLOW OF THE BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND FOR THE THIRTY-FOUR YEAR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2040, 31612=These projections, excluding interest earnings, indicate increasing net cash inflows from FY 2010 to FY 2013, then net cash inflows at varied levels through 2018., 14014=Buildings and structures - 2006, 28887=As discussed in Note 1.L.1 to the consolidated financial statements, DOL recognized a liability for regular, extended and emergency unemployment benefits to the extent of unpaid benefits applicable to the current period and for benefits paid by States that have not been reimbursed by the UTF. Accrued unemployment benefits payable at September 30, 2008 were $1.2 billion., 37260=2013, 37023=2010, 18083=Under the provisions of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), a Federal tax is levied on covered employers, at a current rate of 6.2% of the first $7,000 in annual wages paid to each employee. This Federal tax rate is reduced by a credit of up to 5.4%, granted to employers paying State UI taxes under conforming State UI statutes. Accordingly, in conforming States, employers pay an effective Federal tax of 0.8% (0.6% starting January 1, 2009). Federal unemployment taxes are collected by the Internal Revenue Service., 56614=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SUPPLEMENTARY SOCIAL INSURANCE INFORMATION CASH INFLOW AND OUTFLOW OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND EXCLUDING THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION ACCOUNT FOR THE TEN YEAR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 (2) MILD RECESSIONARY UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, 13416=Buildings and structures - 2008, 174045=COMBINING STATEMENT OF BUDGETARY RESOURCES For the Year Ended September 30, 2007, 37102=2011, 37576=2017, 111263=At September 30, 2008, total liabilities of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund exceeded assets by $10.4 billion. This deficit fund balance represented the accumulated shortfall of excise taxes necessary to meet benefit payment and interest expenses. This shortfall was funded by repayable advances to the BLDTF, which are repayable with interest. Outstanding advances at September 30, 2008 were $10.5 billion, bearing interest rates ranging from 4.250 to 13.875 percent. Excise tax revenues of $652.6 million, benefit payment expense of $267.0 million and interest expense of $739.5 million were recognized for the year ended September 30, 2008., 32477=Total cash inflows exceed cash outflows for all years projected after FY 2009, with this excess peaking in FY 2013. Starting at $64.7 billion in FY 2009, net UTF assets increase by 114.7% over the next nine years to $138.9 billion by the end of FY 2018., 112812=These projections, made over the thirty-two year period ending September 30, 2040, indicate that cash inflows from excise taxes will exceed cash outflows for benefit payments and administrative expenses for each period projected. Cumulative net cash inflows are projected to reach $14.1 billion by the year 2040. However, when interest payments required to finance the BLDTF's repayable advances are applied against this surplus cash inflow, the BLDTF's cash flow turns negative during each of the thirty-two periods included in the projections. Net cash outflows after interest payments are projected to reach $53.1 billion by the end of the year 2040, increasing the BLDTF's deficit to $49.4 billion at September 30, 2040. (See Chart I on following page), 19424=Federal and State UI taxes are deposited into designated accounts within the Unemployment Trust Fund. The UTF was established under the authority of Title IX, Section 904 of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended, to receive, hold, invest, loan and disburse Federal and State UI taxes. The U.S. Department of the Treasury acts as custodian over monies deposited into the UTF, investing amounts in excess of disbursing requirements in Treasury securities. The UTF is comprised of the following accounts:, 12455=Job Corps Center Constructed Assets Portfolio Condition and Deferred Maintenance Cost Estimates at September 30, 2004 - 2008, 77860=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SUPPLEMENTARY SOCIAL INSURANCE INFORMATION CASH INFLOW AND OUTFLOW OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND EXCLUDING THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION ACCOUNT FOR THE TEN YEAR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 (3) DEEP RECESSIONARY UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, 114031=The projected decrease in cash inflows in the year 2014 and thereafter is the result of a scheduled reduction in the tax rate on the sale of coal. This rate reduction is projected to result in a fifty-one percent decrease in the amount of excise taxes collected between the years 2013 and 2015. The cumulative effect of this change is estimated to be in excess of $11.9 billion by the year 2040. Yearly cash inflows and outflows are presented in the table on the following page., 157410=Unpaid obligations, brought forward, October 1, 36368=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SUPPLEMENTARY SOCIAL INSURANCE INFORMATION CASH INFLOW AND OUTFLOW OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND EXCLUDING THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION ACCOUNT FOR THE TEN YEAR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 (1) EXPECTED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, 15987=The Unemployment Insurance (UI) Program was created in 1935 to provide income assistance to unemployed workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The program protects workers during temporary periods of unemployment through the provision of unemployment compensation benefits. These benefits replace part of the unemployed worker's lost wages and, in so doing, stabilize the economy during recessionary periods by increasing the unemployed's purchasing power. The UI program operates counter cyclically, with benefits exceeding tax collections during recessionary periods and UI tax revenues exceeding benefit payments during periods of recovery., 37339=2014, 35548=Net cash inflows are reestablished in FY 2014, with a drop in the unemployment rate to 7.26%. By the end of FY 2018, this positive cash flow has replenished UTF account balances to $22.0 billion. This example demonstrates the counter cyclical nature of the UI program, which experiences net cash outflows during periods of recession to be replenished through net cash inflows during periods of recovery. However, at the end of the projection period, net assets are $117.0 billion less than under expected economic conditions., 100858=Chart V presents the State by State results of this analysis at September 30, 2008 in descending order by ratio. As the table below illustrates, 29 state funds were below minimal solvency ratio at September 30, 2008., 21246=The Extended Unemployment Compensation Account (EUCA) was established pursuant to Section 905 of the Act. EUCA provides for the payment of extended unemployment benefits authorized under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, as amended. Under the extended benefits program, extended unemployment benefits are paid to individuals who have exhausted their regular unemployment benefits. These extended benefits are financed one-half by State unemployment taxes and one-half by FUTA taxes from the EUCA. The EUCA is funded by a percentage of the FUTA tax transferred from the ESAA in accordance with Section 905(b)(1) and (2) of the Act. The EUCA may borrow from the ESAA or the FUA, without interest, or may also receive repayable advances from the general fund of the Treasury when the EUCA has a balance insufficient to pay the Federal share of extended benefits. During periods of sustained high unemployment, the EUCA may also receive payments and non-repayable advances from the general fund of the Treasury to finance emergency unemployment compensation benefits. Emergency unemployment benefits require Congressional authorization., 37497=2016, 26798=During prolonged periods of high unemployment, Congress may authorize the payment of emergency unemployment benefits to supplement extended UI benefit payments. Emergency benefits began in July 2008, authorized under the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008. Before this fiscal year, emergency benefits were last authorized in 2002 under the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation Act. Payments in excess of $23 billion were paid under the program which ended in January 2005. Prior to that, emergency benefits were authorized in 1991 under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act. Emergency benefit payments in excess of $28 billion were paid over the three year period ended in 1994., 20563=The Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) was established pursuant to Section 904 of the Act. FUA is funded by any excesses from the ESAA as determined in accordance with Section 902 of the Act. Title XII, Section 1201 of the Act authorizes the FUA to loan Federal monies to State accounts that are unable to make benefit payments because the State UI account balance has been exhausted. Title XII loans must be repaid with interest. The FUA may borrow from the ESAA or EUCA, without interest, or may also receive repayable advances, with interest, from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury, when the FUA has a balance insufficient to make advances to the States., 14612=Buildings and structures - 2004, 34562=The Department also estimates the effect of severe recession on the cash inflows and outflows of the UTF. This scenario assumes a rising unemployment rate peaking at 10.14% in FY 2012. Under this scenario, net cash outflows including projected interest earnings and expenses from Federal sources are projected in FY 2009 through FY 2013, with the fund in a deficit situation from 2012 to 2016. The net assets of the UTF decrease from $62.6 billion in FY 2009 to negative $45.2 billion in 2013, a decline of $107.8 billion. State accounts without sufficient reserve balances to absorb negative cash flows would be forced to borrow funds from the FUA to meet benefit payment requirements. State borrowing demands could also deplete the FUA, which borrows from the ESAA and the EUCA until they are depleted. The FUA would then require advances from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury to provide for State borrowings. (See following discussion of State solvency measures.), 114535=The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008, enacted on October 3, extended the higher coal excise tax rates for an additional five years from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018. The Act also authorized the refinancing of high interest rate Advances to U.S. Treasury and replaced them with lower interest rate zero coupon bonds. Additional income from the extension of the higher excise tax amounted to $1.8 billion. The decrease in effective interest payments amounted to $11.121 billion. These changes resulted in a zero fund balance at the end of the projection period., 113582=The net present value of future projected benefit payments and other cash inflow and outflow activities together with the fund's deficit positions as of September 30, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, and 2004 are presented in the Statement of Social Insurance., 14313=Buildings and structures - 2005, 36944=2009, 28023=At September 30, 2008, total assets within the UTF exceeded liabilities by $72.1 billion. This fund balance approximates the accumulated surplus of tax revenues and earnings on these revenues over benefit payment expenses and is available to finance benefit payments in future periods when tax revenues may be insufficient. Treasury invests this accumulated surplus in Federal securities. The net value of these securities, including interest receivable, at September 30, 2008 was $73.3 billion. This interest is distributed to eligible State and Federal accounts within the UTF. Interest income from these investments during FY 2008 was $3.6 billion. Federal and State UI tax and reimbursable revenues of $39.4 billion and regular, extended and emergency benefit payment expense of $42.5 billion were recognized for the year ended September 30, 2008., 11360=* Distribution of FCI for 2004 \u0097 2007 was estimated, based on the trend in asset condition established in 2008, when modifications to the calculation were newly implemented., 124287=The principal Statement of Budgetary Resources combines the availability, status and outlay of DOL's budgetary resources during FY 2008 and 2007.
