            "Never once did I feel uncomfortable on campus or the town in general. Fort Lewis and the city of Durango are very safe.",
            "There is no Greek life with Fort Lewis, which I love. I hear way too many horror stories about my friends involved in Greek life at other schools.",
            "I'm very committed to the club Dance Co-Motion. We hold auditions at the beginning of every term, and have a show at the end of the term. All levels are welcome. I was always involved in dance when I was little and then it got too expensive. Dance Co-Motion doesn't cost anything but the price of your costume for the show which is fantastic for me! I plan to always be apart of this club. The winter 2012 term was my first time choreographing and it was a great experience that I won't forget. This club helps me fill out my schedule when I need a break from studying, and it helps me stay active rather than sitting around for a study break.",
            "I think Fort Lewis has something to offer for everyone and anyone. You will love this school if you like small classes, small school, being away from the city, love the outdoors, and I really do believe anyone would love it here if they tried it.",
            "If you're in the mood for really good pizza, go to Home Slice. If you're in the mood for shopping, take a peek in any of the stores on main. If you're in the mood for star gazing, there's a spot I loved to go sit at. There's a bench right next to the chapel on the edge of the mesa. Perfect place to see stars and look down on the town! Otho get breakfast from Doughworks now that I think about it. I love getting their blueberry cake doughnuts.",
            "I'm surprised that this school doesn't cost more when I take into consideration the education and college experience I'm getting g here. That being said I come from a family of a single father raising five children, so I am paying for school myself and it can be a little difficult to make ends meet.",
            "During the winter, most people find themselves hitting the slopes. Me, on the other hand, don't find myself going enough to make it worth spending the money. So during the winter you'll find me in town at a coffee shop or visiting friends. When it's nice out, everyone is outside doing something. Whether that be playing football or soccer with friends, or riding bikes and longboards, or going down to the river and starting a game of volleyball. There's always something fun to do in Durango.",
            "On famous dining is great for at least your first year of school. It's convient, good, and you don't have to worry about cooking your meals or doing dishes. That was my favorite part, not having to do the disburse for once.",
            "Living in the dorms could be a pain at times when people are running up and down the hall when you're trying to sleep (honestly that's going to happen wherever you go though) but it was one of the greatest aspects of college for me. To have your friends just down the hall from you and to be able to meet so many different people is a unique experience and something you'll only get to experience once.",
            "I think this depends on a lot of things. Such as what classes you take, how much you already know about the subject, and how much effort you put in the class. If you take classes you don't know much about or are difficult for you, then yes it will be academically rigorous. If you take classes on subjects you're already familiar with and are easy, then no it's not very academically rigorous.",
            "Take a tour of the school, take a walk down main or a drive around town. Go sit by the riverside, take a peek in Animadversion Trading Company, or go get some breakfast from Doughworks. Come watch a soccer game or sit in the library. This place is magic and has something for everyone, all you have to do is open your eyes and see all that Fort Lewis has to offer.",
            "I was dying for a fresh start after high school, and I decided to try Fort Lewis and Durango as my escape. Coming here is one of the best decisions I have ever made. I cannot simply express with words how happy I am in this tow and at this school."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students There is honestly something for everyone. Tips for prospective students 1. Take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way, you will have a lot of them here. 2. Do your research! Fort Lewis isn't for everyone. Do your research, visit the school and talk to current students to find out if Fort Lewis is the right fit for you. (This is good advice for any school, not just Fort Lewis) Bang for the buck I can't place a value on the tools I have received during my education at Fort Lewis. They really do provide you with everything you need to be successful. If you make use of all of these opportunities you will find that what you get far exceeds the price you pay. Am enjoying being here Durango is a beautiful place!
