Rather, we claim as our invention all such embodiments as may come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto. The attribute values to be associated with caller's phone numbers in the database (such as the phone numbers of Spanish speakers, default directory assistance options, etc.) can be obtained by the directory assistance center from the telephone provider. The telephone provider can gather this data, for example, from surveys sent with billing materials, or other means. Additionally, the VRU 30 voices the various greetings, closings, and menus based on the caller's phone number. The VRU 30 retrieves the attributes associated with the caller's ANI from the database. The VRU 30 then voices greetings, closings, and menus personalized according to the data associated with the caller's ANI at the appropriate times in the processes shown in FIGS. 2A-2E and 3A-3E. For example, where an attributes value associated with the caller's ANI specifies the name of the caller (i.e., <caller name> in the following greeting), the VRU 30 voices greetings and closings, such as, \"Hello, Mr.(Ms.) <caller name>, your directory assistance call is being handled by <service provider or operator name>, how can we",
