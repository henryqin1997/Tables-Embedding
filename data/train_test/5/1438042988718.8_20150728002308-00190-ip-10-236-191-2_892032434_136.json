            "sorority girls dress like they're going to the gym, frat boys dress like their going to a company bbq. it's pretty typical. my roommate is in delta zeta and she says greek life takes up a lot of your free time, but she loves it. some other friends say that everyone acts fake to impress each other and fit in but they don't mind it. unless you pledge a dry house (one that doesn't provide alcohol) expect to drink heavily weekly, age doesn't make a difference. the pressure to drink when you are part of a sorority or fraternity is more than you would expect. in my opinion, the friends you buy through joining a house (and its not cheep), aren't the kinds of friends you want to depend on for the next 4 years. but there are sororities and fraternities that aren't like this! although the other greeks don't really see them as really part of the greek life, there are some of dry houses. these are mostly the ones that have a christian or community service focus. these actually do provide life-long friendships and sisterhood/brotherhood. but beware, business/engineering/whatever frats (which are often co-ed) are not necessarily dry houses just because they aren't social houses.",
            "the university of florida has so many different clubs, you are bound to find the perfect fit! if you want to get involved on campus, there are countless organizations you can join.",
            "if you live in florida, you are definitely getting your moneys worth. especially if you have the bright futures scholarship. uf is not anymore expensive than the other universities in florida, but it is by far the best. if you are paying out of state tuition, it gets kinda pricey but not any more than any other florida university.",
            "partttyy! no i'm kidding, please don't. there are plenty of other things to do here. in the reitz union they have bowling (and cosmic bowling on some nights), there is a roller skating alley a short drive away, gator nights every friday, and there's always some sort of game going on (football games are the best!). but fun isn't in the activities you do, but the people you are with. hanging out with your closest 20 friends is always a blast and you'l find that your circle of friends never stops growing. one of the best things to do over the weekends is to go to lake wauberg. you can go kayaking, sailing, canoeing, swimming, rock climbing and a whole bunch of other stuff for free with your gator 1 id card. plus, each uf student can bring 2 non-students with them for when your non-uf friends come to visit. but if you must, there's plenty of partying every night in midtown or at the frat houses.",
            "the meal plans are great for the first couple weeks but by the end of the semester you will hate the dining hall food. i wouldn't suggest getting a meal plan. the way the dining hall works is essentially a buffet. you pay a certain amount (at most $9 if you don't have any meal plan, or just swipe your id if you do have one) and you can stay there and eat as much as you want. downside: foods not that great, non-paying friends can't come in with you, closes at 11 and opens at 10(?), not many healthy choices. upside: you never have to cook or buy groceries. i would suggest eating at the dining hall or any restaurant for the first couple of weeks while you get settled (you can pay cash or card or whatever) and then buy groceries and make your own food. publix and target (walmart doesn't have a good selection of food) have plenty of frozen microwavable dinners. every traditional dorm has a microwave, stove, and oven in its lounge by the way. as far as restaurants go, we have a pretty good selection. we have food courts in the reitz union, the hub, and next to the student rec center. if you don't want to eat at any of the restaurants in there, you can always walk down university avenue which has plenty of places to eat.",
            "it's not terrible, but it's not wonderful either. i would suggest living in a dorm for the first year, because it is convenient and close to classes. you also meet lots of great people and usually you live close to your friends. beware of the random roommate. here are some of the demographics off the top of my head: the traditional dorms have no co-ed floors, but all buildings are co-ed (1st floor is boys, 2nd floor is girls) east: all the engineers, 15 min walk to turlington (where most classes will be) weaver: all the foreigners, connected to east graham and trusler: normal people, 30 second walk to weaver broward: party place, 5 min walk to turlington yulee: normal people, 7 min walk to turlington in the apartment style dorms, all floors are co-ed murphery (spelling may be a bit off): closest you can get to turlington, its like a 2 min walk beaty towers: lots of greeks, close to sorority row, 15 min walk to turlington",
            "again, if you party you have a slim chance of being successful at this school. know that classes here are difficult and very different than any class you've taken at the ap or dual enrollment level. learning is completely up to you and you need to be self motivated. do not fall behind. you need to hit the ground running from the first day of class. have your books bought before school starts (amazon and other online sites are great if you're on a budget) and start your reading on the first day. study groups are really helpful, try to establish one in each class within the first couple weeks and don't wait until the final comes around. stay off of facebook. facebook will take up more hours in your day than you spend sleeping (that's a joke, college students don't sleep).",
            "if you love to party, don't come here. there are parties every night and if you don't have your priorities straight, your grades will suffer dramatically. it's easier than you think to fail a class. for you that don't plan on trying the party scene, no fear, there are plenty of students that don't party that you can spend your time with. also, avoiding parties is not difficult. random roommates don't always turn out the way you think they will. if you have rules about the opposite sex sleeping in the room, drinking/coming home drunk, being messy, etc. then i strongly suggest moving in with someone you know and have talked about your standards with. if you have to have a random, go over the rules in the beginning of the semester. also, get to know your ras, tas, professors, and advisers. if you're still applying, know that your essay is what makes or breaks you. plenty of students here do not have the ideal gpas or standardized test scores. you want them to know that you're more than just some grades. show them when you have been a leader, or what you have planned for your future. you want your essay to tug at their hearts. let them know that you absolutely must go to this school, and don't forget some gator pride!",
            "the university of florida has a ton of wonderful opportunities! teachers and staff do their best to get you internships, jobs, and important connections. we have so many different groups you can join and so many different people you will meet, there's a place for everyone here. you will have to work hard but its the same as any good university you will consider, you get out what you put in."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors. Aim for an SAT and ACT score within their middle 50% (somewhere between a 1900 and 2100 for the SAT and 27-31 for the ACT) or better, and make sure to take many rigorous classes in high school. Also, show a passion for attending UF in your essays or elsewhere on your application., 582346=i guess we're safe... there's blue emergency lights scattered around the campus, a separate police dept for uf, and scan-card dorms, but rapings and suspects with guns have been reported to the students via email and text just in fall 2011. oh and some shots fired... but i haven't seen anything, which is good. just make smart choices. the person who got raped, got in the car for a ride to campus with an elderly male she didn't know., 613241=there is so much to do at the university of florida! in the reitz union there is a game room with a bowling alley which is always a lot of fun. uf also has gator nights every friday night, where students can go to the reitz union for free and partake in a bunch of activities including midnight breakfast. they also show movies in the reitz union on fridays. there are also about 1000 clubs at uf as well as multiple sororities and fraternities. lastly the gator nation is very big on football. there's nothing like being in the swamp cheering on the gators with your gator family., 911913=There are numerous blue light emergency posts everywhere on campus, and guarantee police assistance within 60 seconds of when the button was pushed. A free snap transportation service is provided, which gives students a ride anywhere on campus after 3:00 AM., 49808=UF is one of the top 50 universities in the US and a great education for a tuition of about $4000 a year and housing is about $2000 for each semester is an amazing deal. If you received Bright Futures you really only have to pay for housing (and of course books and food.) UF also has many research opportunities with top-rated professors available for undergraduates., 48916=Apply as early as possible, way before the November 1st deadline. The earlier you apply, the earlier you can apply for housing (if you are planning on living on campus.) I find that living on campus is really convenient, where you can literally wake up ten minutes before your class and still make it. Off campus has it's perks but it costs about the same as on campus housing and you have to take the bus (which are often times always late.) I suggest living on campus for at least your first year. Also, UF seems to emphasize this quite a lot but GET INVOLVED! Try something new! Get new experiences!, 820345=There are over 1000 student organizations, if we don't have the one you are looking for it is extremely easy to create one yourself., 611633=the university of florida has about 1000 clubs with everything from a quidditch team to clubs for intramural sports., 939581=Dorms are not my thing. I stayed in them and sharing a bathroom with many girls is not what I enjoy. A plus for dorms is that you can meet a lot of people and you are right on campus so classes will be closer, as long as your 7:30 class isn't on the opposite side of campus, you will be able to enjoy every second of sleep., 502966=The campus is gorgeous (besides the weather in August and September, but that's horrible everywhere in Florida)! For being such a large university, it's really easy to get involved in organizations., 322695=The French Fries is a favorite sculpture near the Marston Science Library done by artist John Henry that was placed on campus in February 1989. Though the actual name of the piece is Alachua, named for the county which the city of Gainesville calls home, it still remains a notorious landmark often referred to when giving directions to campus visitors and Freshman. Another popular sculpture around campus, The Potato, is located near Turlington Hall and serves as a popular meeting point. Krishna Lunch, a full vegetarian meal, is served daily in the Plaza of the Americas for dirt cheap, and it is delicious!, 246201=Home to almost 1000 campus organizations, UF offers something for every student that attends. From greek life to skydiving to intramurals, almost anything you can think of will probably exist at the University., 172699=Like I previously mentioned, there are almost 1000 clubs and just about anything you can think of. There are tons of intramural sports and workout facilities all over campus!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Definitely get involved with whatever organization/group you can. It will help you get over the whole idea of being away from home. Make sure you study for classes and don't wait until the last minute cause you will regret it. I would recommend living on campus for the first year but not wasting your money on the meal plan. Bang for the buck One of the least expensive state schools in Florida and also one of the cheapest housing areas in the state. There is also buses to take you practically anywhere in the area so you don't have to waste your own gas. Am enjoying being here The school spirit is so infectious it's crazy. You will love being around for any sporting event whether its gymnastics or football. There is always something to do whether its tubing at Lake Wauburg, floating down the river at Jennie Springs or partying at Midtown. Am learning a lot Most of the professors are always willing to help out and make you want to learn. There is also TutoringZone for those classes which pose more of a challenge or teaching assistants who sit around and wait for you to ask",
