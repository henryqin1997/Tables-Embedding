Was worried there for a second.I guess Rabbit was just having a laugh.April Fool's Day and all\u2026One of my favorite days when I was a kid, 133538=NatsJack in Florida said\u2026 Espinosa is a much better hitter when batting right handed. It's a real struggle from the left side. April 01, 2012 2:33 PM____________________________Agreed. I am also in with those saying batting him 2nd RH and 7th LH. MPHRod handled that the leadoff hit well. Very impressive.Bernadina back from bereavement and delivers in a 0-2 count with a single.Gio Gonzalez seemed masterful today. A couple of pulled doubles past 3rd and nothing else., 134635=Thanks for the HR \"sculpture\" scouting report, DWS, as nobody had mentioned that it was not yet in regular season form. :-)DWS said\u2026 Watching the Yankees Marlins game as I check in on the Nats\u2026good win BTW. The monstrosity according to the Miami announcers is a \"sculpture\" and David Sampson says it will not \"light up\" until the regular season. Sorry if this was already mentioned. April 01, 2012 3:30 PM, 49254=Pretty funny about the truck giveaway. The fans were cheering about it, but turned out it was Wainwright's truck (courtesy of Berkman). Pretty good April Fools' joke., 144165=Espinosa is a much better hitter when batting right handed. It's a real struggle from the left side. He gets 1000 at bats in the majors then they ask him to not to switch hit if it doesn't seem like he is getting it., 121678=@Erik \u2013 \"And no, Werth is not better than Markakis or Jones.\"WRONG \u2013 Werth's WAR each of the last three years has been higher than Markakis and Jones for each of those years.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 27583=#4- Yeah put me in the Kool-Aid camp as well.I'm thinking 87-75 this season, and 90+ in 2013.I think the Marlins are overrated, the Braves probably similar to the Nats, the Mets are bad, and this will be Philly's last year of winning the division., 120081=I hear you MicheleS. Who are we playing this afternoon, again? Oh, um, never mind.MicheleS said\u2026 NJ.. Thanks for the info on Clipp.. Forgot about that game (short term memory sucks) April 01, 2012 3:30 PM, 14675=And what JayB said in an earlier thread is correct. The pitching is here now; it may not be in 2013,so it seems a now-existing opportunity is being squandered. With the well-known mechanical questions surrounding Stras, Storen, and Gio (google pitching mechanics and these names), you simply cannot assume that all of them will be healthy in coming years, and I would wager that the will not all be so., 106373=Good point. :-)MicheleS said\u2026 1A.. don't forget Gorzo too..
