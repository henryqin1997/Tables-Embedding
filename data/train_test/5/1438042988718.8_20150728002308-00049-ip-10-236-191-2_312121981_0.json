Season product Product variability Storage and handling can be a problem. Producer must take these in bulk form, semi-trailer delivery, and must have storage and handling facilities. Disadvantages: Need to look at mineral differences Less risk of digestive upset due to over consumption Excellent energy and protein source Advantages include: By-products are being used as energy and protein supplements for growing cattle as well as cows. In these situations, supplemented to moderate to low quality forage or where forage availability is limiting. Wheat Midds-Approximately 25 % of total wheat milled is left as a byproduct, and termed wheat middlings or mill feed. This by-product feed has been used in ruminant diets and is widely used in commercial supplements as a protein and energy source. Wheat midds tends to vary in nutrient composition due to the varying amount of flour starch. The CP content of wheat midds is 15 to 19 % and energy is in the form of fiber and starch. Soybean hulls-soyhulls are generated from the rolled or cracking of soybeans into small pieces so that hulls can be removed. Soyhulls are separated from the cracked seeds by an air stream, and seeds are extracted with hexane to remove oil, leaving high protein bean meal (48 %). Next, the soyhulls pass through a toaster to destroy the unease activity. Finally, the hulls are ground to",

The DDG is the best source of fat. One must take the nutrients into consideration when balancing a diet with these co-products.

One must keep in mind that SH and WM also have more degradable CP than corn. In terms of cost per unit of gain, all three supplements have better cost of gains than no supplement but the by-products are also cheaper than corn. The addition of by-product feeds, like soyhulls or corn gluten feed, have advantages as a supplement to high roughage, low energy diets as compared to using corn grain. When comparing Wet and Dry",
