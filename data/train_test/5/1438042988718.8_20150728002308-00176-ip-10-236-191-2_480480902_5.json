One type of intracoronary stent is a tubular device made of fine wire mesh, typically stainless steel. A stent of that type is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,655,771. The device can be radially compressed so as to be of low cross-sectional area. In this \"low profile\" condition, the mesh is placed in or on a catheter similar to those used for PTCA. The stent is then positioned at the site of the vascular region to be treated. Once in position, the wire mesh stent is released and allowed to expand to its desired cross-sectional area generally corresponding to the internal diameter of the vessel. Similar solid stents are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,868,956 to Alfidi et al., 56606=In 1977 a major advance in the treatment of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease occurred with the introduction of a technique known as Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA). PTCA involves the retrograde introduction, typically from an artery in the arm or leg to the area of vessel occlusion, of a catheter with a small dilating balloon at its tip. The catheter is guided through the arteries via direct fluoroscopic guidance and passed across the luminal narrowing of the vessel. Once in place, the catheter balloon is inflated to several atmospheres of pressure. This results in \"cracking\", \"plastic\" or other mechanical deformation of the lesion or vessel with a subsequent increase in the cross-sectional area through the lesion. This in turn reduces obstruction and trans-lesional pressure gradients and increases blood flow., 52356=This application is a file wrapper continuation of application Ser.

The procedure has rapidly become the primary therapy in the treatment of advanced atherosclerotic coronary disease throughout the United States and the world. By way of example, since its introduction in 1977, the number of PTCA cases now exceeds 300,000 per annum in the United States and in 1987, for the first time surpassed the number of bypass operations performed. Moreover, as a result of PTCA, emergency coronary artery bypass surgery is required in less than four percent of patients.}",

EQUIVALENTS PEPS has the flexibility of being safely and effectively used prophylactically at the time of initial PTCA in selected patients or being incorporated as part of the original dilation procedure as a second stage prophylactic vessel surface \"finishing\" process. For example, the invasive cardiologist may apply the PEPS technique on a wide clinical basis after the first episodes of restenosis. In addition, because the PEPS technique significantly aids in the vascular healing process post intervention, it may be readily used prophylactically after initial angioplasty prior to any incidence of restenosis. This would free the patient from the risks of repeat intracoronary procedure as well as those associated with metal stenting. A specific and important attribute of",
