I purchased these in april of 2014 and it is now the end of february 2015. below are my observations. Overall they are comfortable but they do take some adjusting to , there is a small ridge that runs parallel to the base of your toes that will kind of be uncomfortable till your feet toughen up. but once broken in they are really super comfortable. the front of the shoes are made of a durable thick rubber that is spill proof and cleans easily, I just hose mine off every night after my shift and they look like new. they are very very durable , after 10 months at 40 hours a week they still look like new and the soles hardly show any signs of wear. the non slip surface of the soles is absolutely great and will stick tight to the greasiest and wettest floors however if you do not work on rubber mats they have a tendency to accumulate a thick layer of crud which can be very slippery when you hit a wet spot, I end up having to spray the soles clean at least one time a night, rubber mats seem to keep the crud scraped clean by comparison. overall for the price I feel that these are the bar none best cooks shoes I have EVER purchased all of the others fall apart after 4-6 months and are often much less comfortable to wear.}",
