            "Although you don't have to be Christian to attend SPU, it is definitely an integral part of the environment. So, I would say Christians who want to go to an intellectual school surrounded by great (if slightly eccentric... in a good way!) people, and who want to challenge themselves academically and see all Seattle has to offer!",
            "SPU is pretty pricey, but they still managed to bring my tuition down a lot. My advice is to apply for scholarships early, and do as many as you can! Still, affordability is one of the biggest reasons SPU didn't make the cut. It is pretty expensive, but it is also a great school, and if it's the one for you then it's definitely worth it.",
            "There is so much! SPU is in the Queen Anne district of Seattle, which is one of the safest districts, and you can walk to so many different stores and shops. We walked to a store that only sold cupcakes! It was adorable, and so good. There is a lot to do around campus too; zombie-versus-human nerf wars, music recitals (and there are pianos in pretty much every dorm, which means music can be heard very often), plays, dorm projects, etc...",
            "There is a lot of variety at SPU's dining hall, and the food is very good. They have options for people who are lactose intolerant, vegetarian and even allergic to gluten. However, on the weekends, Gwinn dining hall has a lot less variety. Luckily, there are places you can walk to within minutes.",
            "I stayed in Emerson, which is the quietest dorm and a pod-style, meaning there are four dorms with a common living room area. The bathrooms were great (as weird of an observation as that is), and each pod had 2, which is a lot nicer than only one or two to a floor. The girls seemed like best friends, and it was really cool to get to know all of them while I was there.",
            "The nursing program (which is what I looked into) seems great, though time-extensive. They have a program called SPU Scholars which replaces your gen-eds if you get into it. In SPU Scholars, you read things like Plato and Aristotle, and they have two teachers from different areas teach the class, so you get a bit of a different prospective.",
            "SPU is costly, so try and apply for any scholarships you can. And definitely visit, and try and stay in the dorms when you do.",
            "Although I am not attending Seattle Pacific, I think it is a wonderful school, and I want to encourage anyone who is thinking about attending to seriously consider it. Both the staff and student body are wonderfully caring, extremely intelligent and yet very down-to-earth. It is a great community and it was a very hard choice not to attend."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students SPU has one of the most successful nursing programs in the nation, so if you're thinking about nursing this is a great school. We also have a popular business school and a fantastic English program. (English students will have great internship opportunities at SPU!) If you don't mind rain, it's a great place for you; if you like getting involved in community service and charity, there are tons of opportunities for that at SPU as well. And if you like books or music, Seattle has a great artsy scene that you'll really enjoy. Tips for prospective students Apply for as many scholarships as you can--it will pay off. Also make sure you apply for University Scholars if you are any good at writing, or if you're just interested in getting better at writing. You'll do a lot of essays but it's worth it to have all the school's best professors inviting you to their office whenever you want help! Apply for housing as soon as possible, and try to get into Ashton or Hill (they are commonly known as the friendliest and best halls). And make sure to schedule an entrance interview; it's not required, but it really helps the admissions office get to know you and helps you get to know the school. Bang for the buck",
