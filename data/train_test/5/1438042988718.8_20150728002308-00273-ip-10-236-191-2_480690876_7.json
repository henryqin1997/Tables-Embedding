In one embodiment, the search engine 10 is written in C++, runs on the Microsoft 2000 Server operating system, preferably in parallel using suitable Intel Pentium processors. It should be clear, however, that it is not essential to the invention that this hardware and operating system be used, and other hardware and operating systems can be used such as Solaris or Linux. Preferably, we run multiple instances of the crawler 12 to increase its capacity to crawl and re-crawl enormous hypertext document collections such as pages on the Web. The crawler 12 stores the fetched pages in a Web page database 14, which includes data structures optimized for fast access of the fetched pages as explained below in connection with FIGS. 2A-2C., 38615=[0010] By late-1999, Yahoo! reported indexing more than 1.2 million pages, but this is relatively small compared to the Web. In late 1999, Yahoo! had about 100 editors compiling and categorizing Web sites, but even if this number greatly increases, Yahoo! is not expected to cover the entire Web., 31205=[0001] This application is a divisional application of and claims the benefit of priority from U.S. application Ser. No. 09/757,435 to Brian Kim et al., filed Jan. 10, 2001 and entitled \u201cSystems and Methods of Retrieving Relevant Information\u201d, which is fully incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes [0106] Although the present invention has been particularly described with reference to the embodiments thereof, it should be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that changes and modifications in the form and details thereof may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, those skilled in the art will understand that variations can be made in the number and arrangement of components illustrated in the above described block diagrams. It is intended that the appended claims include such changes and modifications. [0105] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for calculating ranking scores by dividing the entire hypertext pages into distinct number of groups. The page weight can be refined further by classifying pages into several distinct groups such as \u201cArt\u201d, \u201cEducation\u201d, \u201cReference\u201d, etc. Once the pages are classified, the page weights can be calculated in the same manner described above within these groups. The page weight will be more relevant for the given topic. [0104] Here n represents the number of keywords in the query. The constant parameters \u01920 and \u03c3 has typical values of 0.5 and 1, respectively. \u01921=\u01920+(1\u2212\u01920)e \u2212i/\u03c3",
