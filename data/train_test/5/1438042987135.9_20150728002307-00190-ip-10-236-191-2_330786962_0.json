Competition \u00a0 For stand burners (pictured above at left), all you need to do is switch out the orifice and remove the propane regulator. We recommend hiring a professional plumber to install the gas to your stand and ensure that the installation meets local codes. Also, this requires a separate gas shutoff valve, which is not included with the orifice. For floor burners, you will need the floor burner gas conversion kit (pictured above at right). It includes an orifice ported for natural gas and also a needle valve for flame height control. We recommend you have a professional plumber do any piping to the stand. You will not need the propane regulator and propane orifice included with the stand, so store them away should you ever wish to operate on propane in the future. Also, this requires a separate gas shutoff valve, which is not included with the kit. This requires a 6\" H20 gas pressure, which is typical for residential locations. However, we do\u00a0not\u00a0recommend installing this product indoors. Consult the manual for required minimum distance from structures. TopTier\u2122 burners run great on natural gas! Due to",
