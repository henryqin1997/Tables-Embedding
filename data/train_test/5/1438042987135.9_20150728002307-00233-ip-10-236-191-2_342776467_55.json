Through this initiative the Commonwealth is providing $37.5\u00a0million per year to States and Territories, allocated on the basis of the population of aged persons in each State and Territory.

The Government's overall target of 113 operational places per 1,000 people 70\u00a0years and over by 2011 will continue to be met. This measure reflects the current preference of many older people to stay in their own home for as long as possible while accessing care services. Future funding arrangements for the delivery of aged care will be reviewed in light of the findings of the Productivity Commission inquiry into aged care. This measure will provide savings of $9.0\u00a0million over four years due to the lower costs associated with delivering care at home, while increasing the number of high\u2011level community aged care places.
