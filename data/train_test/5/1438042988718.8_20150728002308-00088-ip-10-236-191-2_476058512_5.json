No. 08/438,043, filed May 8, 1995, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,359, and 08/841,423, filed Apr. 22, 1997, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,045,671; commonly assigned U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/016,102, filed Jul. 23, 1996; and PCT Application No. WO 95/13278, filed Oct. 18, 1995; the complete disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 25201=One of the processes whereby nature produces molecules having novel functions involves the generation of large collections (libraries) of molecules and the systematic screening of those collections for molecules having a desired property. An example of such a process is the humoral immune system which in a matter of weeks sorts through some 1012 antibody molecules to find one which specifically binds a foreign pathogen (Nisonoff et al., The Antibody Molecule (Academic Press, New York, 1975)). This notion of generating and screening large libraries of molecules has recently been applied to the drug discovery process., 78238=According to one embodiment of the invention, specific molecular vibrations are evaluated by infrared absorption. Because C\u2550C stretch modes have specific absorptions at 1650 and 2200 cm\u22121, monitoring the relative change in absorption at those frequencies over a library provides a measure of the relative change in the number of C\u2550C bonds in the system. Therefore, the change in absorption reflects structural changes that occur during polymerization, for example during the polymerization of ethylene., 27337=Using these various methods, arrays containing thousands or millions of different elements can be formed (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/805,727, filed Dec. 6, 1991, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes). As a result of their relationship to semiconductor fabrication techniques, these methods have come to be referred to as \u201cVery Large Scale Immobilized Polymer Synthesis,\u201d or \u201cVLSIPS\u2122\u201d technology. Such techniques have met with substantial success in screening various ligands such as peptides and oligonucleotides to determine their relative binding affinity to a receptor such as an antibody., 59622=Given the chemical complexity of catalytic systems, the lack of predictive models, the number of possible combinations of metals, counterions, ligands, and supports, and the time consuming process of evaluating the performance of each catalyst formulation utilizing conventional laboratory pilot reactors, it is not surprising that the search for the optimum catalyst is a time consuming and inefficient process. Thus, a combinatorial approach to the discovery and optimization of catalytic systems, which combines the synthesis of catalyst libraries with the screening tools of this invention, is useful for accelerating the pace of research in this field. The catalyst libraries of the resent invention can include organic (e.g., catalytic antibodies), organometallic, heterogeneous or solid state inorganic array elements. Organometallic catalyst libraries which can be screened for useful catalytic properties include, but are not limited to, those described in co-pending U.S. patent application-Ser. No. 08/898,715, filed Jul. 22, 1997, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes., 21976=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/183,306 filed Jun. 25, 2002 and issued as U.S. Pat No. 6,849,460, which itself is a continuation-in-part of commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/898,715 filed Jul. 22, 1997 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,917, and a continuation-in-part of commonly assigned, U.S. Provisional Applications Serial No. 60/050,949, filed Jun. 13, 1997; 60/028,106, filed Oct. 9, 1996; 60/029,255, filed Oct. 25, 1996; 60/035,366, filed Jan. 10, 1997; 60/048,987, filed Jun. 9, 1997; 60/028,105, filed Oct. 9, 1996; and 60/035,202, filed Jan. 10, 1997; the complete disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 29328=In general, combinatorial chemistry refers to the approach of creating vast numbers of compounds by reacting a set of starting chemicals in all possible combinations. Since its introduction into the pharmaceutical industry in the late 80's, it has dramatically sped up the drug discovery process and is now becoming a standard practice in the industry (Chem. Eng. News Feb. 12, 1996). More recently, combinatorial techniques have been successfully applied to the synthesis of inorganic materials (G. Briceno et al., SCIENCE 270, 273-275, 1995 and X. D. Xiang et al., SCIENCE 268, 1738-1740, 1995). By use of various surface deposition techniques, masking strategies, and processing conditions, it is now possible to generate hundreds to thousands of materials of distinct compositions per square inch. These materials include high Tc superconductors, magnetoresistors, and phosphors. Discovery of heterogeneous catalysts will no doubt be accelerated by the introduction of such combinatorial approaches., 71417=As an estimate of the temperature change expected, if a microjoule is deposited in a 1 mm\ufffd1 mm\ufffd0.0001 mm region of material, a temperature change of approximately 0.5 K is expected. The reaction of ethylene and hydrogen to ethane produces 120 KJ/mole and, therefore, 1 microjoule requires only the reaction of 5\ufffd1012 molecules. Many times that number of molecules will react per second on a typical 1 mm\ufffd1 mm\ufffd0.0001 mm porous support or on a non-porous 1 mm\ufffd1 mm\ufffd0.000001 mm film. In another embodiment, individual elements can be monitored in series using position insensitive temperature detection technology or single element scanned detectors., 53113=Generally, physical masking systems can be employed in combination with various deposition techniques in order to apply components onto a substrate in a combinatorial fashion, thereby creating arrays of resulting materials at predefined locations on the substrate. The arrays of resulting materials will usually differ in composition, stoichiometry and/or thickness across the substrate. The components can, for example, be dispensed to the substrate in the form of a gas, a liquid or a powder. Suitable deposition techniques include, but are not limited to, sputtering, electron-beam and thermal evaporation, laser deposition, ion beam deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and spray-coating. In solution phase deposition techniques include, for example, sol/gel methods, discrete liquid dispensing techniques (e.g. pipettes, syringes, ink jets, etc.), spin coating with lithography, microcontact printing, spraying with masks and immersion impregnation. Moreover, such dispenser systems can be manual or, alternatively, they can be automated using, for example, robotics techniques. A more complete description of representative arrays of materials and systems and methods for generating such arrays of materials can be found in commonly assigned, co-pending patent applications \u201cThe Combinatorial Synthesis Of Novel Materials\u201d, Publication No. WO 95/13278, filed Oct. 18, 1995; \u201cSystems and Methods for the Combinatorial Synthesis of Novel Materials,\u201d patent application Ser. No. 08/841,423, filed Apr. 22, 1997; and \u201cDiscovery of Phosphor Materials Using Combinatorial Synthesis Techniques,\u201d provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/039,882, filed Mar. 4, 1997; the complete disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 28781=In PCT WO 96/11878, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, methods and apparatus are disclosed for preparing a substrate with an array of diverse materials deposited in predefined regions. Some of the methods of deposition disclosed in PCT WO 96/11878 include sputtering, ablation, evaporation, and liquid dispensing systems. Using the disclosed methodology, many classes of materials can be generated combinatorially including inorganics, intermetallics, metal alloys, and ceramics., 25875=Applying this logic, methods have been developed for the synthesis and screening of large libraries (up to 1014 molecules) of peptides, oligonucleotides and other small molecules. Geysen et al., for example, have developed a method wherein peptide syntheses are carried out in parallel on several rods or pins (J. Immun. Meth. 102: 259-274 (1987), incorporated herein by reference for all purposes). Generally, the Geysen et al. method involves functionalizing the termini of polymeric rods and sequentially immersing the termini in solutions of individual amino acids. In addition to the Geysen et al. method, techniques have recently been introduced for synthesizing large arrays of different peptides and other polymers on solid surfaces. Pirrung et al. have developed a technique for generating arrays of peptides and other molecules using, for example, light-directed, spatially-addressable synthesis techniques (U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854 and PCT Publication No. WO 90/15070, incorporated herein by reference for all purposes). In addition, Fodor et al. have developed a method of gathering fluorescence intensity data, various photosensitive protecting groups, masking techniques, and automated techniques for performing light-directed, spatially-addressable synthesis techniques (Fodore et al., PCT Publication No. WO 92/10092, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes).}",

The disclosures of all articles and references, including patent applications and publications, are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. The images captured by the IR camera should be collected and analyzed to create a series of interferograms (intensity versus time) for each element in the image corresponding to an element in the combinatorial library. The interferograms must be transformed back to a more useful intensity versus wavelength representation with the aide of a Fourier transform performed by the computer. In order to perform the Fourier transform, the computer must know precisely the time or mirror position corresponding to each image. It is therefore necessary to have an electronic trigger on the interferometer to trigger the camera shutter. In this way a series of plots of absorbance versus wavelength can be constructed for every element within the field of view of the infrared camera. In order to track chemical reactions with this device, the IR spectrum needs to",
