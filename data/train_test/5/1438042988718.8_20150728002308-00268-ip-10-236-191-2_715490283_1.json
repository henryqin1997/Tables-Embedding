Abhaath is looking to reverse earlier form with the selection on better terms but has a bit to prove over today's longer trip though an apprentice's claim means he's weighted to get the better of The Mongoose and Officer In Command. Electrician won a seller here last month but this is tougher and Spin Again is preferred if fully recovered from a bad stumble here",
