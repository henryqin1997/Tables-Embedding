Buses come and load up all the students and bring us to Mt. Kearsarge to hike the mountain. There is a big cook-out and t-shirts to tye dye. Fun day!, 23544=If you're looking for a place to have a great connection with teachers, a friendly and safe environment while having fun at the same time, Colby-Sawyer is the place for you. One never thinks twice about their safety here as campus safety does a grab job of ensuring the well-being of everyone. With a small school consisting of less than 2000 students, you'll always see friendly faces you know., 118330=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 55174=We have this tradition where one day the bells will ring at 10:05 and that means it is mountain day. On mountain day we go to Mount Kearsarge, Tie-dye tee shirt, have lunch, and climb the mountain as a school. Its a great way to get to know each other and spend a day enjoying the schools unique tradition.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Will enjoy being here I slept over, attended a class, had a great time and I'm already considering myself as part of the community... It really is amazing!!!! Will learn a lot The advantage of being a rural school, is that the students will be more concentrated or focus on school than anything else that could keep them back from achieving their goals...
