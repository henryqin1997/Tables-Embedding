After the initial period of post-conflict reconstruction, it has helped establish and develop local institutions. Kosovo is now on a new phase of development. The international community is scaling down its presence, and local authorities are taking on the responsbilities for leading development process and managing European integration. However, Kosovo faces a daunting task in coping with some of the taughest economic and social conditions. The UNDP is ideally placed to help the Kosovan people and institutions in overcoming these challenges. Our support comes in numerous forms and uses experience gained from developing economies around the world., 19836=In Kosovo, during the initial post-conflict reconstruction (1999-2002), UNDP has been largely engaged in emergency reconstruction and rehabilitation, providing assistance to the housing sector, quick employment generation (including the highly successful Village Employment and Rehabilitation Programme that provided over 20,000 short-term jobs funded by European Agency for Reconstruction), electrification, TV and radio, community development and municipal administrations. Since 2002, we started to focus on longer-term development challenges, helping to establish, develop, and strengthen Kosovo institutions, promote economic growth, enhance people\u2019s everyday security and improve environmental sustainability. Since the office establishment on 1 August 1999, UNDP Kosovo delivered over 200 million USD in assistance to Kosovo society., 35076=\u00a9 2015 United Nations Development Programme *References to Kosovo shall be understood to be in the context of Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) Turn high contrast mode on}",
