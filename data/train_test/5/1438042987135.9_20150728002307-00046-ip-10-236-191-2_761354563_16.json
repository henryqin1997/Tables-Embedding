Larish's amazing season also included 18 doubles and 18 home runs, while hitting .372 (87-for-234). Even more amazing is that Larish became only the second player in ASU Baseball history to join the 70-70 (RBI-BB) club. Former Sun Devil and major leaguer Alvin Davis, who played first base for the Sun Devils from 1979-82, is the only other member of that club after recording 91 RBI and a single-season school record 87 walks in 1982. Larish ranks fifth in the ASU single-season record books with his 95 RBI., 26840=Poll Mechanics: Arizona State finished the 2003 season with a 54-14 record and earned a consensus top 10 ranking in all four national polls. ASU ranked as high as No. 7 by Baseball America, and also ended the year ranked No. 10 by Collegiate Baseball and No. 9 by Sports Weekly. Ranked as high as No. 8 in the preseason polls, the Devils spent virtually the entire season in the top 10 and for two weeks manned the top spot in two of the three national rankings, marking the first time being No. 1 since heading into the 1993 College World Series. ASU has been ranked for 78 consecutive national polls dating back to the start of the 2000 season. Arizona State also earned a preseason No. 9 ranking by Sports Weekly/ESPN, No .10 by NCBWA and No. 12 ranking by Collegiate Baseball. The No. 8 preseason ranking is the highest by an ASU squad since opening the 2001 season as the consensus No. 6 team in the nation., 119207=An Early Season Opener: The Jan. 16 season opener at Hawaii-Hilo was the second earliest start in ASU Baseball history and the earliest start by any collegiate team in 2003. The Devils opened the 1999 season at home with a game at Packard Stadium against the University of Utah on Jan. 15. Arizona State's previous earliest start before 1999 was a Jan. 19 home contest against Grand Canyon (W, 12-2) in 1990. With the 9-0 blanking of UHH on 1/16, ASU is now 25-2 in season-opening games (dating back to 1977) and head coach Pat Murphy is 8-1 in season-openers at ASU (15-1 at D1)., 92977=Scoring at Will: Arizona State finished the season ranked second in the NCAA averaging 10.03 runs per game and scored 10 or more runs in 35 of its 68 games (51%). The Devils have also scored 20 or more runs in three games this season and as a team are also ranked second in the nation (first in Pac-10) hitting .347. The 10.03 runs per game average are the fourth best during 45 years of ASU varsity baseball history. With 35 games of scoring 10 or more runs, ASU trailed only the 1981 Sun Devils (36) for the most games with double-digits in runs scored since ASU joined the Pac-10 in 1979., 16720=Sept. 26, 2003, 93590=Nine RBI: Twice during the 2003 season a pair of Sun Devils tied the ASU single-season record with nine RBI in a single game. Sophomore Jeff Larish was the first to do it in a 24-9 win over San Diego State (1/26). Larish accomplished the nine RBI with a two-run single, two-run home run, a grand slam home run and a bases loaded walk. Junior Jeremy West also had nine RBI in his record setting game vs. Washington State (4/27), in which he went 5-for-7 with three home runs. West recorded his nine RBI with a two-run homer, a three-run homer and a grand slam. The only other Sun Devil to record nine RBI in a game was Tommy Adams on May 2, 1990 vs. UNLV., 70837=Pedroia Joins .400 and 100 Hit Club: Sophomore shortstop Dustin Pedroia joined a pair of elite clubs during his memorable 2003 season. Pedroia became only the 16th player to hit over .400 in a season dating back to the start of varsity baseball at ASU in 1959. With 120 hits, Pedroia also became only the 22nd player to join the 100-hit club. His 120 hits, which included a Pac-10 record 34 doubles and was highlighted by 41 multi-hit games, ranked as fourth most in ASU single-season history. Pedroia will enter his junior season with 202 career hits and a .379 career batting average., 101453=Sun Devils Record Best Start in School History: Arizona State's 28-1 start to the season goes down in the record books as the best start in school history. The 28-1 record includes an 11-game winning streak to start the season before a loss at nationally ranked Long Beach State (Jan. 31) and a 19-game win streak up until suffering a 6-5 loss to Oklahoma (3/14). During the 28-1 start to the season ASU's pitchers posted an impressive 3.11 ERA and the hitters combined for a .360 team batting average. Here is a look at ASU's best starts in school history:, 42264=A Record Breaking Season: In addition to finishing in the top 10 in the NCAA in the four major statistical categories, the 2003 season also brought about a number of entries into the single-season record books.

The 54 wins are the most by a Sun Devil squad since the 1988 team finished with 60 victories. ASU also set an NCAA record with 14 grand slams and extended its NCAA record consecutive games scoring streak to 501 games (dating back to April 7, 1995). Individually, several Sun Devils also had record-breaking seasons. Shortstop Dustin Pedroia became only the 22nd player with 100 hits and the 16th player to hit .400. He ranks fourth all-time with his 120 hits and 15th by hitting .404. He set an ASU and Pac-10 record with 34 doubles. First baseman Jeff Larish broke into the record books in several categories, including ranking fifth with 95 RBI and second with 78 walks. He broke the school record with four grand slams and tied the single-game records with nine RBI and four doubles. Designated hitter Jeremy West also tied the single-game records with nine RBI and three home runs., 127945=ASU And Team USA Connections: Arizona State baseball has had a long-standing tradition of sending players to play for the USA National team during the summers. In a recent poll distributed by USA Baseball, ASU ranked No. 11 as a supplier to the National Team. With the selections of Jeff Larish and Dustin Pedroia to the 2003 team, ASU has now had nine players and 10 total selections don the Red, White and Blue for Team USA since 1984. The first Sun Devil on Team USA was Oddibe McDowell in the 1984 Olympics played at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.

Current Tampa Bay Devil Ray prospect Jon Switzer was also a member of the 2000 National Team and Mike Esposito was 3-1 with a 1.56 ERA in the summer of 2001. Pedroia played for the National Team in 2002 and is the first Sun Devil to repeat n the national team. Pedroia, Travis Buck and Larish were nvited to USA Baseball National Team Trials in June in Tucson, Ariz., 31563=Pac-10 Player/Pitcher of the Week: Jered Liebeck (Feb. 4) Jeremy West (Feb. 25) Ryan Schroyer (Feb. 25) Travis Buck (April 1) Jeremy West (April 28) Dustin Pedroia (May 19) Andre Ethier (May 26), 126235=Home Sweet Home: ASU returned to Packard Stadium in 2003 after playing in Mesa (Hohokam Park) in 2002. The Devils recorded their 800th career victory at Packard Stadium (3/1 vs. PSU) and have an all-time 818-235-1 dating back to 1974. ASU played 40 of its 62 regular-season games in the state of Arizona and 37 at Packard Stadium. After going 29-10 in designated home games last year, the Devils were 30-7 at Packard Stadium this year now have a combined 163-50-1 (.764) home record in the last five years dating back to 1998.

The Devils recorded the sweep in dominating fashion, outscoring Arizona 36-4 in the three games. The Devils opened the series with a 5-2 win on Friday night scoring three in the bottom of the eighth to break a 2-2 tie. ASU then pounded UA over the next two games, winning 16-0 on Saturday and completed the sweep with a 15-2 victory on Sunday. For the series the Sun Devils hit .380 with eight doubles, seven home runs and recorded 78 total bases. The pitching was just as dominant with a 1.33 team ERA and for the third time in Pac-10 play held an opponent to under four runs in a series. Andre Ethier earned Pac-10 Player of the Week after hitting .500 (6-for-12) with three home runs in the series. Sophomore Jeff Larish also caught fire going 8-for-11 (.727) in the rivalry series to raise his season average from .358 to .377., 113422=Murphy's Teams Know How To Score: A true icon of the Pat Murphy system is scoring runs. The Sun Devils have done plenty of that since he arrived in 1995. ASU has led the NCAA in scoring in two of the last five years, averaging 11.32 runs per game in 1999 and 10.97 runs per game in 2000. The Devils paced the Pac-10 in 2001 and 2003, hitting at a .327 clip in 2001 and a .347 mark in 2003. ASU finished second in the nation in 2003 averaging 10.03 runs per game.

Here is a look at Larish's four grand slams this year:, 126885=Arizona State at Packard Stadium (1998-2003):, 123000=ASU Owns Pac-10 Player of the Year Award: Since the old Pac-10 North (formerly Washington State, Washington, Oregon State, Portland State) and the Six-Pac joined to form the unified Pac-10 baseball conference in 1999, Arizona State has enjoyed much success with a combined 74-46 record in league play. Even more impressive is that in four of the five years a Sun Devil has won the annual Pac-10 Player of the Year award. Willie Bloomquist won the inaugural award in 1999, while Casey Myers took home the hardware in 2000 and 2001 to become only fourth player in Pac-10 history to win the award twice in a career. Dustin Pedroia shared the Pac-10 Player of the Year award with Stanford senior catcher Ryan Garko. In all, ASU has won 10 Pac-10 Player of the Year Awards dating back to 1978 (Myers (2), Bloomquist, Dustin Pedroia, Jacob Cruz, Paul Lo Duca, Linty Ingram, Oddibe McDowell, Alvin Davis, Mike Sodders) and two Pac-10 Pitchers of the Year (Noah Peery and Marc Barcelo)., 71530=Pedroia Earns Co-Pac-10 Player of the Year: Sophomore shortstop Dustin Pedroia was named the Pac-10 Co-Player of the Year with Stanford senior catcher Ryan Garko. Pedroia finished the year leading the team in hitting at .404 (120-for-297), while setting the Pac-10 record with 34 doubles. With his selection Pedroia becomes the 10th Sun Devil to earn the Pac-10 Player of the Year award. Since the Pac-10 North and South divisions joined in 1999, ASU has had a player win the POY award in all but one season (1999: Willie Bloomquist; 2000: Casey Myers; 2001: Casey Myers; 2003: Dustin Pedroia)., 107639=Pedroia Named To Initial Watch List For Golden Spikes Award: Arizona State sophomore shortstop Dustin Pedroia was included among 25 players named to the initial watch list for the 2003 Golden Spikes Award, given annually to the nation's top amateur baseball player. The 2002 Team USA member was one of only two Pac-10 players to be named to the initial watch list (Carlos Quentin, Stanford). The five finalists were named this week without Pedroia making the final cut. Arizona State has a long tradition of Golden Spikes Award winners as three past Sun Devils have won the award. Bob Horner (1978), Oddibe McDowell (1984) and Mike Kelly (1991) have all won the award. Only Florida State and Cal State Fullerton have matched ASU's legacy also with three winners of the annual Golden Spikes Award., 80552=Andre Ethier Named Pac-10 and National Player of the Week: For consecutive weeks to end the 2003 regular season, an Arizona State baseball player was named the Pac-10 Player of the Week. Junior outfielder Andre Ethier earned the weekly Pac-10 honor and was also named the Collegiate Baseball National Player of the Week after hitting four home runs and compiling a .471 batting average in ASU's four games against Washington and Arizona (5/19-5/25). Ethier, from Phoenix, Ariz., went 8-for-17 (.471) with six runs scored, two doubles, two triples, four home runs and eight RBI during the four-game stretch, including a three-game sweep over instate rival, Arizona. In the four games he compiled a 1.529 slugging percentage while the Sun Devils went 3-1 to reach the 50-win mark on the season (50-12).

Arizona State had four players for five total selections as the weekly player of the week honor in 2003. Jeremy West earned the honor twice, while Dustin Pedroia, Travis Buck and Ethier all earned one weekly award. West, senior right-handed pitcher Jered Liebeck and Ethier have all earned Collegiate Baseball National Player of the Week honors. Ethier finished his ASU career hitting .377 (98-for-260) with 13 doubles, four triples, 10 home runs and 68 RBI. Drafted in the second round by the Oakland Athletics, Ethier ended the year with a 23-game hitting streak. During the streak, which is listed as one of the top 10 longest in ASU history, Ethier combined to go 44-for-99 (.444) with eight home runs and 31 RBI., 78591=Comparing 2003 to 1981: Arizona State put together an amazing season in 2003 leading the Pac-10 and amongst the NCAA leaders in pitching (3.32 ERA), hitting (.347), fielding (.973) and averaged 10.03 runs per game. ASU's fifth and last national championship came in 1981 with a Sun Devil squad that is arguably the best to take the field in program history. The 1981 squad set school records in home runs (110), runs (694) and batting average (.356). Star performers on the 1981 club included Pac-10 Player of the Year Mike Sodders (.424, 22 HR), Alvin Davis (.395, 20 2B) and Kevin Romine (.410, 12 HR, 20 2B). Here is a comparison look at the two squads:, 27774=Sun Devils Reach 50-Win Mark in Regular Season: With the 15-2 victory over Arizona to clinch the series sweep during the las weekend of the 2003 regular season, ASU recorded its 50th. The 2003 squad became just the fifth team in ASU history to win at least 50 regular season games. The other years were 1972, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1982, 1984 and 1988. After going 3-0 in the regional last weekend, ASU's 54 wins are the most by a Sun Devil squad since the 1988 edition of Sun Devil baseball went 60-13. The 2003 season marks the 16th time in program history with 50 or more wins in a season., 119894=How They Have Finished: Arizona State has finished five seasons ranked in the top 10 in the final Collegiate Baseball national poll since 1990, ranking 7th of all college baseball programs. The schools with the most Top 10 Collegiate Baseball finishes are listed below:, 129843=Golden Spikes Common At Arizona State: While Rickie Weeks of Southern was the recipient of the 2003 Golden Spikes award as the nation's top amateur baseball player, it should be noted that three Arizona State players have won the award. In addition to ASU, only Cal State Fullerton and Florida State have won three Golden Spikes Awards. Bob Horner, who was a standout at ASU from 1976-78, won the inaugural award in 1978. Oddibe McDowell, who was a member of the first Team USA baseball team to compete in an Olympics, won the award in 1984. Mike Kelly, who ranks second in ASU history with 46 home runs from 1989-91, won the award in 1991. In all, 12 players that have worn the Maroon and Gold have been named a Player of the Year for college baseball. Dustin Pedroia was one of 25 players named to the initial watch list for the 2003 award., 28383=Sun Devils Set NCAA Single-Season Grand Slam Record: ASU ended the regular season in grand fashion vs. Arizona (5/25), hitting two grand slams to set the NCAA record for grand slams in a season with their 13th and 14th of the year. The Devils broke the old record set by Oklahoma State in 1996 with 12. After hitting only one grand slam all of last year, the Sun Devils have gone on a binge this year hitting 14 in 2003. Sophomore first baseman Jeff Larish broke the single-season school record by hitting his fourth grand slam vs. UCLA (4/19). Larish broke the old record of three set by Dave Hudgens in 1977. Steve Garrabrants and Jeremy West each have three slams, Rod Allen has two (both pinch-hit grand slams) and freshmen Ryan Bosch and Travis Buck each have one., 34931=National Player of the Week: Jered Liebeck (Feb. 4) - Collegiate Baseball/NCBWA Jeremy West (April 28) - Collegiate Baseball Andre Ethier (May 26) - Collegiate Baseball, 110615=Travis Buck Hits For The Cycle: Freshman outfielder Travis Buck went 5-for-5 with even RBI and hit for the cycle in ASU's 19-0 win over Southern Utah (3/7). He became only the seventh Sun Devil in recorded history to record the elusive cycle and became the first freshman in Pac-10 history to hit for the cycle. Buck capped his perfect night with a grand slam home run as part of an eight-run sixth inning to become ASU's first player to hit for the cycle since Mitch Jones on May 21, 2000 at Arizona. Buck, ASU's normal starting left fielder who was making only his second start in right field, had a single in the first, a double in the third and a triple in the fifth before connecting on his second home run of the year for the cycle. He also added a run-scoring single in the fourth and tied a career high with two stolen bases. Buck was also named the Pac-10 Player of the Week after going 8-for-11 (.727) vs. USC. He was named a freshman All-American by both Collegiate Baseball and Baseball America. He finished his freshman season hitting .326 (78-for-239) with 13 doubles and four home runs. Below is a list of ASU player who have hit for the cycle:, 76366=Pitching Staff Dominates in 2003: Arizona State has always been known as an offensive team, often ranking amongst the top teams in the nation in batting and runs scored. 2003 was no exception, but the pitching also decided to join the hitting in 2003. ASU's pitchers, led by pitching coach Chris Sinacori, led the Pac-10 with a 3.32 ERA, ranking eighth in the NCAA. Senior starting pitchers Ben Thurmond (2.73) and Jered Liebeck (2.88) finished No. 1 and No. 2 in the Pac-10 in ERA and senior Beau Vaughan was second in the league with 105 strikeouts. The 3.32 ERA marks the first time since 1990 that an ASU pitching staff has finished a season under a 4.00 ERA and is the lowest since the 1976 Sun Devil hurlers posted a 3.26 ERA. In fact, since the NCAA adopted the designated hitter and aluminum bats in 1974, the 3.32 ERA is the third lowest., 18611=The Sun Devils finished the 2003 season with a 54-14 record and were second in the Pac-10 behind Stanford with a 16-8 record... earned final season national rankings of No. 7 (Baseball America, NCBWA), No. 9 (ESPN/Sports Weekly) and No. 10 (Collegiate Baseball)...

After that loss, ASU went on a 19-game winning streak combining to go 13-0 in February and won the first six games in March before losing 6-5 to No. 30 Oklahoma (3/14).

Pat Murphy's Sun Devil squads have produced four Academic All-Americans over the past five years (Willie Bloomquist, Mark Ernster, Jeff Phelps, Casey Myers), including Myers being named the Academic All-American for college baseball in 2000 and 2001. The four players honored as First-Team Academic All-Americans is the second most by any college baseball program in the nation since 1995.

The Devils had recorded only six shutouts combined between 2000, 2001 and 2002., 124340=Hitting For The Cycle... in the First Inning: In what may be one of the rarest feats of Arizona State baseball history, the Devils led off the Feb. 9, 2002 game vs. Tennessee in grand fashion with the first four hitters combining to hit for the cycle in the first inning. Leadoff hitter Steve Garrabrants led off the game with a first-pitch home run, then Dustin Pedroia followed with a double, then Rod Allen singled and to cap off the amazing event, Jeremy West tripled to give ASU the early 2-0 lead. ASU also accomplished the rarity in the 10-run first inning against Washington State (4/27) in 2003 when the first five batters (Pedroia, 3B; Walsh, 1B; Larish, 2B; West HR) combined to hit for the cycle., 45317=Devils Lead All Colleges in MLB Draft: The Sun Devils had a record 12 players selected in the Major League Draft and had two more players sign free agent contracts.

The Devils made history on April 7, 2001 when they scored at least one run in their 350th consecutive game. The Devils broke the 12-year-old NCAA record in a 5-1 loss to USC exactly six years to the day when they were last shut out. ASU was shut out 9-0 in that game on April 7, 1995 at Dedeaux Field. The Devils celebrated the eighth anniversary of the start of the streak in 2003 with a 10-2 win over Grand Canyon on April 7. The one run scored in a pair of games to Cal State Fullerton in the Super Regional marked only the 15th and 16th times during the streak that ASU has scored only one run. Coastal Carolina previously held the NCAA record at 349 games set from 1983-1989. ASU also had a stretch of 278 games without being shut out from 1990 to 1994, meaning the program has only been shutout in three games dating back to the 1990 season. ASU is a combined 333-167-1 during the streak. Notable pitchers the Devils have faced during the streak include Jeremy Guthrie (Stanford), Barry Zito (USC), Kirk Saarloos (CS Fullerton), Jason Young (Stanford), Ben Diggins (Arizona), Adam Johnson (CS Fullerton), Ryan Drese (Cal), Jeff Weaver (Fresno State), Chad Hutchinson (Stanford), Abe Alvarez and Adam Pettyjohn (Fresno State).}",

His 120 hits, which included a Pac-10 record 34 doubles and was highlighted by 41 multi-hit games, ranked as fourth most in ASU single-season history. Pedroia will enter his junior season with 202 career hits and a .379 career batting average.
