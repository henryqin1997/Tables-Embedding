Moreover, since the means for delimiting the tilting angle is provided under the inclining knob, it not only prevents the contacts from a simultaneous shortcircuiting when the knob is depressed at its center, but also prevents the knob from erroneously operating in more than one direction. As described above, the cylinder 35 is provided to contain the light elitting element 34 in the control knob. Therefore, the position of the illuminated knob can be clearly recognized even at the time of driving a vehicle at night, and the control of the rearview mirror can be easily achieved. In addition, the cylinder increases the reliability of the operation of the switch by stabilizing the insulating distance between the non-activated contacts. Further, since the movable contacts are disposed within the hollow elastic swells of the insulating rubber sheet, the contacting or separating operation of the movable contacts can be performed in a very simple manner. The base plate 22 has, as shown in FIG. 17, rows of metal-plated through holes 104 and 105, in addition to the through holes 102. The holes 104 are sequentially soldered with terminals LV, M, S",
