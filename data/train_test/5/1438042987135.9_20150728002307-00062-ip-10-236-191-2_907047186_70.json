            "There are SO MANY clubs and activities. There is a bazaar at the beginning of each semester that displays all of the different clubs, so that is when you can sign up for anything you want.",
            "SO worth it",
            "Fashion Valley is about 5 minutes from the University, so you can go to the mall and eat at restaurants there or go to the movies. The beach is about 10 minutes away, so you can go to the beach whenever. The tricky part is just finding a ride if you don't have a car. The University is close to Old Town, where there is great mexican food and tourist attractions. It is also close to Ocean Beach, which is a cute hippy town with a farmer's market and cute shops. There is honestly so much to do for fun. The possibilities are endless.",
            "The Student Life Pavilion is so beautiful! It has marble counters and such a selection of food. I am a vegetarian and lactose intolerant and it is very easy for me to have a great meal. La Paloma, Berts, Aromas, Frank's Lounge, and Mission Cafe all have great options and good food!",
            "The dorms in Founders are beautiful, but there was no common area that all the girls hung out in, so we didn't become close with everyone in the building. In comparison to the valley where they lived in suite style so they met more people and had a better community.",
            "Hard, but in a great way that makes you learn the material at hand.",
            "Join a club or organization that suits you, because that is how you will find your closest friends. Don't buy your books until you have your first class to ask if you will actually use the book so you don't waste your money. Take advantage of all of the activities the university offers.",
            "A university with a beautiful and friendly campus. The education is challenging and interesting. There are so many different things to get involved in on campus."
