Previously a member of two England Under-19 tours, e was awarded his county cap in 2005 and in 2006 scored two hundreds to help consolidate Durham's place in Division One., 14575=Falling returns across all formats meant Muchall's place was no longer assured, and he himself admitted that he had doubts over whether he would even be contracted in 2010. Durham stuck with him, and in May 2011 he responded in fine style, setting a new county record partnership for the fifth wicket with Ian Blackwell. Muchall eventually reached a massive 175, and his 247-run stand with Blackwell helped set up an innings victory over Worcestershire., 38655=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average, 34577=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five, 14211=He was subsequently pigeon-holed as something of a limited-overs specialist, however, topping Durham's batting averages in the 2007 Twenty20 Cup after being dismissed only once in the competition. He did not play any Championship cricket in 2008 and was a bit-player in Durham's triumphant campaign the following season., 15072=By the time Durham won the Championship in 2013, Muchall was consigned entirely to one-day duties, although his returns were impressive enough to win a contract extension until 2015., 13639=Gordon Muchall, a middle-order batsman, was in the first intake of England's Academy, which went to Australia under the guidance of Rod Marsh in 2002-03., 21191=NBC Denis Compton Award 2002, 19244=Jun 12, 2015, 20142=Jun 20, 2014, 18395=Jun 30, 2015, 31534=The Cricket Monthly: The IPL lasts two months, but through the year talent hunters are scouring India (and the internet) for the next big thing TCM July issue}",
