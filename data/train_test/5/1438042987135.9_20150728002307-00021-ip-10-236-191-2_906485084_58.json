            "Students who were fond of high school life may find Glendale Community College similar to that. Classes are small and personal like in most high schools and that means the teachers are more available to help individuals on a need to need basis.",
            "Glendale Community College offers a wide range of courses and classes that are financially feasible for most students that cannot pay for more expensive educational campuses.",
            "GCC's cafeteria is good but has a few items that are a little bit pricey. The actual dining area is great where there is much social interaction between students, but it never gets too distracting.",
            "Most classes at Glendale Community College are not too tough if you study. The key is studying. The more time you put into your homework assignments, the more likely you are to pass. Doing the little things like looking over notes or even doing a few extra problems on homework can go a long way on your test scores. In some cases, a class can become difficult for just you alone, but the free tutoring at Glendale Community College is very helpful in getting you passed your speed bumps.",
            "Make sure you do not apply last minute. You will thank yourself when you are able to register for the classes you want and not be stuck in limbo on the waiting list to register for the class. Also take advantage of the free tutoring on campus. It may come in handy for more challenging courses.",
            "Glendale Community College is a great start to post-high school education. Its helpful atmosphere eases new students in with no hassle. Best of all, it is transfer friendly with many other Universities across the valley."
