A gas delivery tube may be introduced through an intercostal access port, or a gas delivery lumen may be provided in a wall of the one of the access ports themselves through which the gas is delivered. To facilitate maintaining the gas within the chest, the access ports may be provided with gaseous seals such as those commonly used in laparoscopic trocar sleeves which provide a gas-tight seal both when an instrument is introduced through the port, as well as when the instrument is removed. These and other techniques for removing air from the heart and aorta are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 08/585,871, filed Jan. 12, 1996, attorney docket No. 14635-23-6, entitled \"Methods and Apparatus for Preventing Air Embolism When Performing A Procedure On A Patient's Cardiovascular System,\" which is incorporated herein by reference., 133686=Referring now to FIG. 22, knots 300 are formed in each of sutures 264 outside of the chest, and a thoracoscopic knot pusher 302 is used to push knots 300 along sutures 264 through lumen 212 of access port 192, through aortotomy 184 and against sewing ring 286 of prosthetic valve 288. Knot pusher 302 preferably has an elongated shaft 303 to which is attached a head 304 with a convex curvature on its distal end 306 and a pair of axial channels 308, 310 along its lateral sides, as described in copending application Ser. No. 08/288,674, filed Aug. 10, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,601,576, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. One end of each suture is threaded through channel 308, a knot 300 is formed in the suture distally of head 304, and the other end of the suture is positioned in channel 310. While holding the ends of suture 264 in tension, knot pusher 302 is advanced toward prosthetic valve 288, engaging knot 300 with distal end 306 and sliding the knot along suture 264 until it is against sewing ring 286. Several knots are formed in each suture in this manner. The ends of sutures 264, along with needles 266, are then trimmed off above knots 300, using thoracoscopic angled scissors 194 or other suitable cutting device., 144910=FIGS. 27-29 illustrate an additional embodiment of an access port for retraction of tissue within an intercostal space so as to provide an open passageway through which a replacement valve may be positioned into the chest. Access port 350 comprises a tubular body 352 having an axial passage 354 configured to allow a replacement valve to be positioned through it without contacting the inner walls of the axial passage. Tubular body 352 is a metal or biocompatible polymer with sufficient rigidity to retract intercostal tissue and to retain a shape suitable for positioning a replacement valve through the axial passage into the chest. Axial passage 354 preferably has a cross-sectional shape suitable for introducing a replacement valve or sizing disk through it in the edge-first orientation illustrated in FIG. 25, such as oval, elliptical, racetrack, rectangular, trapezoidal, or other suitable shape. Axial passage 354 will have a cross-sectional width orthogonal to a central axis AX of less than about 30 mm, usually about 10 mm-25 mm, and preferably about 15 mm-20 mm. The cross-sectional length of axial passage 354 orthogonal to central axis AX will be larger than the outer diameter of the replacement valve utilized, and usually substantially larger than the cross-sectional width of the axial passage, usually being about 15 mm-50 mm, and preferably being about 25 mm-40 mm. Tubular body 352 has an exterior shape and dimensions suitable for positioning access port 350 in an intercostal space without cutting or removing the ribs, and preferably without significant retraction of the ribs from their natural, undeflected positions (e.g. less than about 10 mm of retraction). In an exemplary configuration, the outer surface of tubular body 352 has a shape corresponding to that of axial passage 354 with a wall thickness therebetween of about 0.25-2 mm, preferably 0.75-1.25 mm. Of course, the exact size and shape of tubular body 352 will be determined by the size and shape of the replacement valve to be utilized in the procedure., 87869=In addition to delivery of cardioplegic fluid in the \"antegrade\" manner via endoaortic catheter 32 as just described, it is usually desirable to deliver cardioplegic fluid in a \"retrograde\" manner through the coronary sinus during the aortic valve replacement procedure. For this purpose, a coronary sinus catheter 52 is placed into a peripheral vein 54, preferably the internal jugular vein or subclavian vein in the neck, and advanced through the superior vena cava into the right atrium, where it is maneuvered into the coronary sinus (not illustrated). Coronary sinus catheter 52 has a balloon or other expandable member 58 near its distal end 60 which may be expanded by means of a syringe 62 to occlude the coronary sinus during fluid delivery. A delivery lumen (not pictured) extends through the coronary sinus catheter 52 to a port at its distal end 60 to allow delivery of a cardioplegic fluid, which will usually be similar to that described above used in antegrade delivery. Coronary sinus catheter 52 may also include a pressure port near distal end 60 and a pressure lumen extending to its proximal end for monitoring pressure distal to expandable member 58. Other aspects of coronary sinus catheters and retrograde cardioplegia techniques useful in connection with the present invention are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 08/372,741, filed Jan. 12, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,644, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 89945=In an alternative technique for inducing cardioplegic arrest, devices are introduced thoracoscopically through access ports between the ribs to occlude the ascending aorta and, optionally, to deliver cardioplegic fluid into the ascending aorta upstream of the occluded area. In these thoracoscopic techniques, the pericardium is first opened to expose the ascending aorta. As illustrated in FIG. 3A, several access ports 71, such as trocar sleeves or other tubular cannulae, are placed in intercostal spaces I between ribs R. A thoracoscope 73 of conventional construction and having a video camera 75 mounted to its proximal end may be placed through one of access ports 71 for visualizing the procedure, or the surgeon may look directly into the chest through one of access ports 71. Thoracoscopic scissors 77 and graspers 79 are introduced through access ports 71 and used to create an incision 81 approximately 4-10 cm in length in the anterior side of the pericardium 83 overlying the aorta 85 so that the ascending aorta 87 and upper anterior side of the heart 89 are exposed. Thoracoscopic scissors 77 and graspers 79 may have any of various well-known constructions, including those described in copending application Ser. No. 08/194,946, filed Feb. 14, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,698, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 45567=This application is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/485,600, filed Jun. 7, 1995, now abandoned which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/281,962, filed Jul. 28, 1994, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/163,241, filed Dec. 6, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,215, which is a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/023,778, filed Feb. 22, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,452,733. This application is also a continuation-in-part of Ser. No. 08/486,941, filed Jun. 6, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,799,661. The complete disclosure of each of the above-referenced applications is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes., 81153=The patient is first prepared for aortic valve surgery by putting the patient under general anesthesia, establishing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and inducing cardioplegic arrest. General anesthesia is induced in a conventional manner. A preferred technique for accomplishing CPB and cardioplegic arrest which does not require a sternotomy, thoracotomy, or other opening in the patient's chest is illustrated in FIG. 1. Additional aspects of the systems and methods for inducing cardioplegic arrest described here may be found in patent application Ser. No. 08/282,192, filed Jul. 28, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,584,803, and Ser. No. 08/486,216, filed Jun. 7, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,151, the complete disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference., 102706=Clamp applier 140 has, as shown in FIG. 7, an actuator 164 at its proximal end which comprises one or more movable leaves 166 pivotably mounted to a shaft 168. Leaves 166 are linked to clamp applier jaws 162 by a linkage 170, best seen in FIG. 8, which may be a rod or wire slidably disposed in a lumen 171 within shaft 168, linked to a scissors mechanism 172 coupled to jaws 162. In this way, moving leaves 166 toward shaft 168 causes jaws 162 to move between an open position for releasing clamp 136 to a closed position for grasping and closing clamp 136. Clamp 136 is preferably biased into an open configuration by a torsion spring (not shown) around pin 152 or a compression spring (not shown) between proximal extremities 154, 156 of jaws 142, 144. In this way, once locking mechanism 148 is released by deflecting fingers 150 away from each other, clamp 136 will be urged open as clamp applier jaws 162 are opened. Other aspects and alternative configurations of clamp 136 and clamp applier 140 are disclosed in commonly-assigned copending application Ser. No. 08/567,966, filed Dec. 4, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,618,307, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference., 120126=When the size of the valve annulus has been determined, the appropriate replacement valve is then identified. A variety of replacement valves may be used in the method of the invention, including many of the more widely-accepted valves used in conventional open-chest aortic valve replacement procedures. These include mechanical valves such as the St. Jude Medical Mechanical Heart Valve (St. Jude Medical, Inc., St. Paul, Minn.), the Carbomedics Prosthetic Heart Valve (Carbomedics, Inc., Austin, Tex.), and the Sorin Monostrut Heart Valve or Sorin Bicarbon Valve (Sorin Biomedical, Inc., Irvine, Calif.), as well as bioprosthetic or tissue valves, such as the Carpentier-Edwards Pericardial Bioprosthesis or Carpentier-Edwards Model 2625 Porcine Bioprosthesis (Baxter, Inc., Edwards CVS Division, Irvine, Calif.)., or Medtronic Hancock MO Bioprosthesis or Medtronic Hall valve (Medtronic, Anaheim, Calif.). In addition, the method of the invention may be used to replace a diseased aortic valve with an autologous graft such as the pulmonary valve from the same patient, which may be removed thoracoscopically from the patient's pulmonary artery using thoracoscopic instruments and visualization devices positioned through access ports between the ribs. Allografts, such as an aortic valve removed from another donor patient's heart, may also be implanted using the methods of the invention. While the aortic valve replacement procedure of the invention will be described with reference to a mechanical bileaflet valve such as the St. Jude Medical Mechanical Valve, it should be understood that the methods described are equally applicable to other types of mechanical valves, as well as to bioprosthetic valves, autografts and allografts., 85503=In a particularly preferred embodiment, arterial return cannula 26 includes an additional hemostatic port (not shown) at its proximal end that allows endoaortic catheter 32 to be slidably positioned through the blood return lumen of the arterial return cannula. Arterial return cannulae having such a configuration are disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 08/282,192, filed Jul. 28, 1994, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,584,563, which is incorporated herein by reference.}",
