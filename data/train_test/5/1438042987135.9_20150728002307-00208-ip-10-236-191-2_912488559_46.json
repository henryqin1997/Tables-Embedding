            "All the rooms are nice and clean but the residence life team will find any reason to give out fees so beware of what you can and cannot do.",
            "It really depends on what classes you take, some of course, will be more difficult than others but some you just need to pass to get the credit.",
            "I would suggest taking lots of tours and making sure it has everything you want, since it is a smaller school",
            "Augsburg College is a small school with a campus easy to navigate. It is close to the city and has great teachers. The facilities are alright but planning to be upgraded soon."
