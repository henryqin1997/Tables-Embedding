            "^ explained in clubs and activities",
            "we have everything from rugby (even for girls) to bible study groups to peta-ish groups to gay-straight alliance clubs, latino/a clubs, some sororities (not like in your college movies, they're much nicer and smarter), we've got basketball, baseball... the list goes on forever.",
            "- open minded - not afraid to express themselves/afraid of others doing this - lovers and fighters for love (not just romantic) - social justice lovers - art lovers - people who love close interaction with their teachers and other classmates -people who want to be more in college than just a number",
            "the education building on campus was formerly presentation high school. it's a beautiful part of the school - well it all is besides the construction being done haha. but when the new science building is finished it will be amazing!",
            "i am a mostly-financial aid student and i really wish costs were even just $3,000 less per semester cause that would save me! but as far as a beautiful campus, breath-taking church (and i'm not religious), a super supportive staff, friendly students and overall awesomeness, it's pretty good. especially because the school is really generous with grants and scholarships. they gave me a grant for over $18,000 just for financial need (not including my grades). for applying with a 3.63 gpa they gave me a $7,000 scholarship that's renewable for four years as long as i keep up a 3.0 gpa. and if you really do need more money, the one stop office for financial aid will tell you to have your parents apply for a plus loan (from the federal government) even if your parents have crap credit (mine do). and when you get a rejection letter, you notify the school and they will help you get approved for an increase on your federal unsubsidized loan. (if this is jibberish, they'll explain everything better).",
            "everyone here goes downtown shopping in westfield mall which is super easy to get to by public transportation and it's amazing! it's beautiful, huge, and overall just amazing. there are like four floors filled with endless amounts of stuff to do, taste, try on and just experience. another big thing here is going to the always interesting and limit-testing haight street which is within walking distance to school. this is where everyone goes for cool, interesting clothes, organic tea shops, and of course tattoo and piercing places. and on campus there is usually something going on just about every night. and every event is publicized on bulletin boards all over campus.",
            "we do have a wide selection around noon (when it is unreasonably packed with people) but they run out of the tasty nutritious stuff too quickly, all that gets left is hamburgers and fries and pizza and burritos - which is all pretty good (well the pizza has gone downhill since fall) but after a few days of eating that and being in class when the good food is being served.... it can get annoying.",
            "i live in phelan hall (recently renovated) and it's absolutely beautiful. the only thing to watch out for is gilson hall. phelan used to be the jock building so it was trashy and stinky but now gilson is inheriting the name ghetto gilson. i think they'll renovate that building this summer but i can't say for sure...",
            "it's tough in some, few classes but most teachers here actually want to see yo succeed. crazy right? here it's not. teachers have a passion for teaching and really, truly want you to understand or even go so far as love what they are talking about. teachers here love students who have strong opinions and who participate in discussions. the rest is pretty easy. oh yeah, they love it when you see them out of class during their office hours. even if you just sit with them and talk about a movie that just came out, or just to do your homework, they like to know more about you. plus, this way when they have to write you a letter of recommendation they know a lot about you and have tons to say.",
            "write an honest, good essay in your applications. your gpa and sat scores are not all of who you are, they barely represent you. with interesting letters of recommendations from people who really know the type of person as well as the type of student you are, usf is more likely to overlook iffy scores and gpas. they want overall, good, interesting people to come to their school cause no other type of people could possibly fit in here.",
            "usf is a school for every type of person who is at least accepting of all other types of people. being in san francisco, this school is filled with just about every kind of person from everywhere in the world, from a small village in ohio, to a big city on louisiana to china - everyone comes here to get along with everyone and to fit in. everyone fits in because everyone is here."

Even when returning from a class last semester at 10:30-10:45 pm, where I had to walk across the main plaza of campus, I felt safe. When incidents are reported, the school automatically emails everyone, informing them to watch out so something similar does not happen to them., 249000=Being in San Francisco, there is always something going on. On Sunny days I will picnic in Golden Gate park, window shop in the Marina, or maybe participate in a Free Tibet March. On days when the weather is not so nice, I visit museums or find a new coffee shop., 382230=On-campus dining is expensive. The meal plan is a little over $2000 a semester and some people still run out of money before the semester is over. They choices they have in the dining halls are good, but can get a little repetitive. However, the off-campus dining is amazing. Everything you can think of is within a few blocks, whether you want sushi, burgers, pizza, pho, or anything you crave, it's probably within walking distance of the campus., 45089=Spring 2012 is my third semester at the University of San Francisco and I highly recommend this University to nursing majors. The professors are very helpful and intuitive to each student and present the subjects well., 51950=USF offers students a decent cafeteria with many options. On the average day, you can have waffles for breakfast, pizza for lunch, and Kung Pow chicken for dinner. USF has the main cafeteria in the University Center (which is at the center of the university; you guessed it!), one under the main Caf typically called the Under Caf and one smaller one on the secondary campus. The main Caf has the best options for students as it is the largest. Sometimes, however, students find that they school provided meals could be improved and that it way too expensive. USF gives each student $2000 worth of pure food money and sometimes, students find themselves running out of it a month before the semester ends. Each meal averages to about $10. Simple math will tell us that that is not enough for a semester. However, with budgeting and careful spending, the USF meal plan money should last you through the semester. Sometimes, it is to be noted that the cafeteria sometimes seems to close too early. But, with planning, that should not be an issue for those of you who are savvy at staying fed. Rating: Three out of five. While the food is expensive and the Cafeteria may have odd hours, the food is decently good, convenient, and well portioned. All in all: Spend smart, stay fed.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This College is great for students, who want to acquire an education in a religious environment, and also for those who wish to live in the beautiful City of San Francisco. Tips for prospective students Apply as early as possible. Gather all documents months in advance to meet the deadline. Will enjoy being here The life that the University of San francisco extends to its students can assist me in incorporating good ethical changes in my lifestyle. I haven't visited the College, but I have started relishing the prospect of attending the College. Will learn a lot Education is the first rung of the ladder which leads to success. It is not just an asset, but a prerequisite without which one cannot compete in the daily activities of life. I strongly believe that education is an integral part of ones life, for it provides one with knowledge which is imperative for human survival and existence. Futhermore, when education blended within the folds of faith and humanity is extended to the learner, it creates a sense of equality and brother. I have been very much attracted towards activities which have an ethical and religious influence on",
