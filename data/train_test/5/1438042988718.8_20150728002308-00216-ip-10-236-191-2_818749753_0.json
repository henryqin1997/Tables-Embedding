The recent cause of this concern is the Program for International Student Assessment (better known as PISA), an international triennial test coordinated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and first administered in 2000. The PISA scores seemed to show the United States falling behind the rest of the world in math, science and reading., 27945=1921 to 1922, 3980=washingtonpost.com \u00a9 1996-2015 The Washington Post, 27259=1909 to 1910, 29317=1952 to 1953, 26411=From A History of Mathematics Education in the United States and Canada, National Council of Teachers of\u00a0Mathematics, 1970, via \u201cA Brief History of American K-12 Mathematics Education in the 20th Century\u201d by David Klein:, 25513=The impetus for New Math was also the fear that we were falling behind other countries, though back then the anxiety was triggered by a much more dramatic event.

New Math is not mentioned at all. All of this begs some bigger questions about the way we discuss public policy. The New Math precedent would certainly seem to be relevant to the conversation, and we generally work under the assumption that a vigorous discussion will bring all relevant and available information to the surface. Is there something special about this example that keeps it off the table? Are we not very good at handling historical precedents? What other topics are being left out of other discussions?, 28974=1948 to 1949, 24403=The general reaction was best captured by U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who said in 2009, \u201cThis is an absolute wake-up call for America.

It almost seems a little quaint now\u00a0\u2014 the postwar era is considered a period of remarkable scientific progress\u00a0\u2014 but these fears had been building for a long time, and they were supported by what seemed at the time to be some deeply troubling numbers. The impetus for New Math was also the fear that we were falling behind other countries, though back then the anxiety was triggered by a much more dramatic event. On Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union had launched Sputnik. Having a Soviet satellite flying overhead at the height of the Cold War had a strong and immediate effect. The response included the creation of NASA and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (soon to be renamed DARPA) and a radical change in the way we taught math and science. Further scrutiny revealed a somewhat murkier picture. Among other criticisms, it was pointed out by Tom Loveless, a senior fellow with the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, that the top-ranked \u201ccountry\u201d (Shanghai) maintained its position largely, if not entirely, because China had systematically made sure",
    "textAfterTable": "For the education reformers of the \u201950s, Sputnik was both a confirmation of their fears and a powerful tool for advancing their agenda. Their proposals were big and far-reaching, but for most people, they came down to one thing: New Math. Of the various elements of New Math, the best known and most controversial was the decision that primary and secondary school students should learn advanced mathematical concepts and, what\u2019s more, should learn them the way they were taught in upper-level mathematics courses. It seemed at first glance an entirely admirable, if perhaps overly ambitious, plan. But even at the proposal stage, there were concerns. Upper-level math courses were and are generally built around the idea that every theorem must be rigorously proven before one proceeds to the next idea. Unfortunately, many of the basic, largely self-evident theorems that students encounter in algebra and geometry require a surprising level of sophistication to prove. George P\u00f3lya, one of the small set of major mathematicians to dig seriously into the subject of math education, pointed out the following example: [T]he School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG) \u2026 geometry text that gave a theorem with proof \u2014 taking up half a page \u2014 stating that with three points on a line, one point must lie between the other two. [P\u00f3lya] argued that though this is a necessary theorem for a foundations course in geometry, it has no place in an elementary text. He said that had he been asked",
