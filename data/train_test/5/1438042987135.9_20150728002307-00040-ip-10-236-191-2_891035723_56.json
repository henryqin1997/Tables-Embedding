            "Chico's campus is calm and friendly. If one has to stay late at night to study one can use the bus the school offers as transportation. All one needs to do is swipe their Chico ID to reach their apartment. Also if you're unsure about walking late at night to the parking lot there is a number one can use to be helped and taken to their car.",
            "Theres a variety of fraternity and sororities one can be placed in depending on their interest.",
            "There's clubs for every major. All one has to do is get involved. Student are usually informed about them on the first weeks of school and are seen putting events and activities on campus.",

One finds The Bear- an unusual burger joint known for its famous burgers. one wont go hungry in Chico because there's a variety of food being offered by different cultures not to mention the farmers market.",
            "Figure out how many dorms your school offers and which one best fits you're style. What you want to look into is the location of the dorm and what meal plans they offer. Besides that the dorm life is an experience part of college. The dorm life is a transition from your home into college a place where you get to meet a variety of individuals where you make life long friends.",
            "Professors at Chico State are well endeavored to have students understand the subject. Professors are passionate about their subject and are glad to expand on an idea all one has to do is ask a question and ask them to show a different example. Analogies are sometimes used to convey a better understanding. So hard work is shown by the hours one puts into their studding and work being done.",
            "as a prospective student walk into college with a general idea of what you're interested in. The next step is to follow the A-G requirements the school expects one to take, for example Math and English. And if you know what field you want to major in go talk to an advisor they have a map of the classes you have to take in order to achieve you're degree in the 4 years.",

My mind changed at summer orientation when I saw all of the clubs and opportunities Chico actually gave you. -If you have a meal plan try and organize how many meals a week you should be having. Because both semesters I had so many meals left over and the last week I tried to eat around 5 times a day! -Be prepared for both extreme heat from August to early October, and extreme cold in the winter. And when I say extreme I mean extreme for someone from the Bay Area. (100degrees and 30degrees), 217698=Okay, I'm going to divide the food and dining into two categories-the dining hall on campus and dining out in town. The Sutter Dining Hall was only recently opened in 2011, so it's extremely new and modern. However, the food options aren't necessarily the greatest. But I guarantee if you ask anyone at any school, they'll all tell you that they're dining hall stinks. Now as for downtown dining, it's awesome. There's a great pizza place called Celestino's (it's been a huge staple while I've lived in Chico), and also a burger/bar joint called The Bear (you have to try the jiffy burger...yes, it's a burger with peanut butter on it!), 584889=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Chico is the school to go to if you have a good head on your shoulders and you can focus on why you are really there...to go to school! Bang for the buck Chico is not just a wonderful campus with the most knowlegable professors, it is also a beautiful town and great place to live. There are really nice dog parks to go to and the local swimming holes that are popular as well. All colleges are going to be expensive, but it feels better to be paying for an education AND a great local community and town with the same check! Am enjoying being here I have only met the best people and friends at Chico. It is easy to get into that party scene, but with the challenging academics, focusing on school is just as easy and way more important. Everyone always says people only go to Chico State for the partying, but I always say that im there to get one of the best buiness degrees in the state of CA. Am learning a lot As a business student at Chico State, it is very competetive and i feel that the teachers are there",
