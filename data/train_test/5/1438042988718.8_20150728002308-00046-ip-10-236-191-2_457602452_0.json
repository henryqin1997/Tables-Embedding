The competition is Friday and Saturday. Ron Passmore and Dan Milby, owners of the restaurant, will explain how The Galax Smokehouse, which opened in 2003, came to be. After years of entertaining with recurring dreams of opening a restaurant, the two were given the opportunity to pursue that dream and traveled the country researching barbecue, learning all they could about recipes. The restaurant specializes in Memphis-style barbecue. The restaurant has shown profits since its opening and prides itself in gaining the \u201cNational BBQ News\u201d best-of-the-best barbecue award in its first year. The restaurant has been featured in \u201cSouthern Living\u201d three times, with the magazine naming its banana pudding the best in the Southeast. Galax always has been known for its music, but because of the state barbecue contest, it is now known for its barbecue and restaurants, said Chris Shackelford, director of Chestnut Creek School of the Arts. \u201cThis class is an example of what the art school is here to do,\u201d said Shackelford. \u201cWe want to encourage those who come to the lecture to register to come back to the class. We not only want to gain students from the immediate area, but also tourists.\u201d Shackelford said the school hopes to make this an annual event. \u201cThe Art of BBQ is not just about working with barbecue, but the mastery of the skill,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly surveying the community in what they would like to see, and cooking is one of the most requested classes.\u201d The art school has held classes on Appalachian cooking and making apple butter. \u201cThis is a perfect opportunity for the restaurant owners to shine and tell their story,\u201d she said. \u201cBetween the lecture and the class, students can get to know the instructors and learn about barbecue with a hands-on experience. This allows us to continue to make the most of the school and showcase what is here. \u201cThe Galax Smokehouse is an asset to the community, and this is going to be a real delight to hear the Smokehouse owners\u2019 story,\u201d Shackelford said. \u201cMaybe people will come out of curiosity about how to make barbecue, or if they know about the Smokehouse, maybe they\u2019ll come out of the appreciation for barbecue.\u201d, 28954=A free lecture and slideshow presentation \u2014 \u201cBlue Ridge, Bluegrass and BBQ\u201d \u2014\u00a0 will be held on Friday at 3 p.m. at Chestnut Creek School of the Arts to tell the story of how The Galax Smokehouse and its barbecue became a staple in the Galax area. This will be followed by a class at The Galax Smokehouse July 30-31 on \u201cThe Art of BBQ,\u201d with the restaurant\u2019s pitmaster Earl Cherry. The first day of class, from 10 a.m.-2 p.m., will focus on the history of barbecue, the geographic significance, a variety of styles and a thorough introduction to Galax\u2019s claim of the best barbecue around. The second day\u2019s class, from 4-7 p.m., involves hands-on instruction, in which students will cook and leave with a half rack of ribs, a pound of barbecue pork and a pint of sauce. Tuition is $70, and materials fee is $10.}",
