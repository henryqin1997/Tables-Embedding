            "\"Feels rather staged, as if you can hear Sallin telling Giger to, for instance, open the front door and look contemplative, or walk through his museum and look contemplative. \" \u2010 Washington City Paper Posted Jun 24, 2015",

            "\"Less about organized religion than it is about community, compassion, and unconditional love. \" \u2010 Washington City Paper Posted Jun 24, 2015",
            "\"The film is not to be missed, especially considering that during her lifetime, Simone -- the woman, the emotionally wrecked -- was rarely heard. \" \u2010 Washington City Paper Posted Jun 24, 2015",

            "\"This is a Wes Anderson film. It's gonna be quaint. It's gonna be wry. It's gonna look just like Anderson's other features. But is that such a bad thing? \" \u2010 Washington City Paper Posted Jun 1, 2012",
            "\"The only things differentiating Thin Ice from Fargo? A lack of Midwestern accents and entertainment value. \" \u2010 Washington City Paper Posted Apr 6, 2012",
