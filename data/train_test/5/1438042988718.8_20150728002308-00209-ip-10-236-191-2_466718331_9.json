No. 4,371,702. A 15 gallon (5.68 L) crystallizer type kettle was charged with 3600 g of comminuted V2 O5, 36 L of isobutyl alcohol and 3.6 L of benzyl alcohol. The liquids were stirred while the V2 O5 was added. The mixture was heated at reflux for 14 h. 5400 g of 85% H3 PO4 were added over a 2-h period at the rate of 45 mL/10 minutes. The mixture was heated at reflux for 20 h. The slurry was filtered and the filtrate was recycled until it was clear. The solid was comminuted to a powder with particles of size 1 and 3 micrometers. 7068 g of V/P/O catalyst precursor was thus produced. A 5 wt % SiO2 polysilicic acid solution was prepared by diluting 1014 g of JM grade sodium silicate solution (300 g SiO2) with 4985 g of distilled water in an 8-L stainless steel beaker. The solution was stirred for a few minutes and then filtered through folded filter paper to give a clear water-like filtrate. This clear filtrate with pH of 11.3 was stirred vigorously while Dowex HCR-W2-H resin, a strongly acidic nuclear sulfonic acid cation exchanger supplied by Dow Chemical Company, was added to reduce the pH. When the pH was about 6.8, excess resin was added to reduce the PH below 5.5 rapidly, thus avoiding microgel formation. When the pH reached 3.0+/-0.1, the resin was filtered off and the clear filtrate was used within an hour to prepare the V/P/O precursor-PSA slurry for spray drying. 4444 g of the 5 wt % SiO2 PSA solution was added to a mixing bowl and with the mixer on low speed, 2000 g of V/P/O comminuted catalyst precursor was added in small portions over a period of 30-45 minutes. The resulting slurry, containing 34.48% solids (90% V/P/O catalyst precursor and 10% SiO2), had a pH of 2.5+/-0.1., 24316=It is preferred to carry out the oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride at a hydrocarbon concentration of about 1.5% in air (by volume) for a fixed bed type of operation. The oxidation may be carried out within a temperature range of 300\ufffd to 500\ufffd C., preferably within the 350\ufffd to 450\ufffd C. range. Operating pressures can range between 0.5 to 20 atmospheres (50 to 2000 kPa) but are preferably in the range of 1 to 7 atmospheres, and more preferably 2 to 4 atmospheres. Contact times can vary from 0.1 to 15.0 seconds, although 0.2-4.0 seconds have been found to be preferable., 21607=Benesi, H. A.; Curtis, R. M.; Struder, H. P., J.
