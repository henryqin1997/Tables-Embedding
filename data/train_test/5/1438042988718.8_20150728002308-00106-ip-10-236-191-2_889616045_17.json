            "There's danger on any college campus, but OWU does a great job of managing it.",
            "A good presence on campus, but no pressure to be Greek. Good bunch of kids!",
            "Great music and theatre extracurriculars, competitive and intramural sports.",
            "All of them! :)",
            "There are underground tunnels connecting some dorms and buildings - old, creepy, and awesome!",
            "Yes! Tuition is expensive, but they give GREAT scholarships.",
            "Delaware is a cute little town, and it's not far from Columbus, where there are lots of museums! There's a nice mall about 20 min away from campus too.",
            "For college food, it's great! A little iffy sometimes, but what school food isn't?",
            "The dorms are pretty well kept, and they're working on slowly renovating all of them, which is nice. Most students do have to live in the dorms, which can be a downside, but when everyone you know is there it's a nice place to be.",
            "Rating this a four because classes are challenging, but not so challenging that you feel lost or fail frequently. And professors/students are super helpful when you have trouble.",
            "Don't bring a car freshman year! Find a friend who has one, and decide from there if you need one with you.",
            "Ohio Wesleyan rapidly became my home. The students and faculty are so welcoming and warm that you immediately feel like you're part of the community, and the academics are wonderful. As a Theatre major especially, I love my program and my school."

There are parties constantly, slamming doors, mysterious clouds of smoke in the stairwell that make you lightheaded. If you are there for studies at all, just don't do it. My personal recommendation is Smith East or West. The dining hall is in the basement, the suites are well laid out, and there's air conditioning - a big plus for August and April. Also, I don't know about frats, but the sororities seem like a waste to me. There are dances and mixers, but other than that, it's just cupcake icing and other stuff for recruits. I'm friends with quite a few sorority girls without even being in a sorority, so I don't really recommend it. If you want, I don't think it'd be bad, I just don't see the point in spending the money for it., 172365=There is the President's Ball in December, right before finals start. It's a really great dance with the Jazz Band playing for a while and then the DJs take over. What really makes it special is that it's held in the science building. Out science building is really new and has this huge atrium on the ground floor - perfect for dancing. It's really special and always tons of fun. President Rock Jones even comes and dances with us for a while!, 6889=Like every campus, there are the people you want to avoid, but there's a lot fewer of them at OWU than there were at my high school, so I really can't complain. The dorms are fantastic, the food is pretty good; Smith dining can get a bit repetetive, but whatever it is, it's usually good - that's more than I can say for my mom's cooking! The professors are, for the most part, very laid back and welcoming. Whatever you do, you have to take HMCL 122 with Elias - he's hysterical! I was taking his course the same semester as Calculus, and I loved going to his class - even at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays - just for the laughs. The excellent readings, discussions, and jokes kept me sane while I was biting my nails over integrals and derivatives., 49796=Ohio Wesleyan is situated in quaint, rural mid-west environment with a 10:1 student to faculty ratio, making it an awesome place to learn first-hand from a very talented and dedicated group of academics. It offers a broad range of student activities, ranging from special-interest clubs to foreign study programs to highly-competitive Division 3 athletics. For the student seeking a high-quality education without the distractions of a large city, I strongly recommend visiting OWU in Delaware, OH., 12193=Academics! Those who major in: Economics, accounting, or management, english, statistics, and several sciences. How many schools with 1800 students have a dorm dedicated to econ/management students and a scanning electron microscope in the science center?, 180155=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot During my freshman year, I knocked out a lot of my diversity course requirements: Computer Science, Mathematics, Foreign Language, Electives, etc. I'm an English Major, so Computer Science and Mathematics were a bit tough for me. Mainly Calculus. But at OWU, the professors expect you to have common sense. In the introductory courses, it really is introductory - they don't expect you to know everything ahead of time, which is really helpful. I highly recommend CS 103 with Zaring - he's an awesome professor. But, as easy as they make it for students learning the field from nil, I learned a lot over the past two semesters. Not to mention my musical skills that have grown exponentially over the past year. I don't come from a big school district with an overly fancy music department with correlating budget, so I was always the top player. When I got to OWU, Dr. Griffin had those same expectations, and more. He challenged me to improve, not just for the group, but for myself.
