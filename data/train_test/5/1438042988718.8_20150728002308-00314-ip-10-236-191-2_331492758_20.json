    "textBeforeTable": "Funcom is excited to announce that 'Dreamfall Chapters', the long-awaited sequel to the award-winning adventure title 'Dreamfall: The Longest Journey', has gone into pre-production at Red Thread Games, a new studio founded by Ragnar T\u00f8rnquist, creator of 'The Longest Journey' saga. Red Thread Games has licensed the rights to 'The Longest Journey' universe from Funcom, and Mr. T\u00f8rnquist will spearhead development of 'Dreamfall Chapters', while continuing in an advisory role as Creative Director on Funcom\u2019s recently launched modern-day massively multiplayer online game \u2018The Secret World\u2019. Last month Joel Bylos stepped into the position as Game Director on the myths, legends and conspiracy themed online game, allowing Mr. T\u00f8rnquist to devote more of his time to 'Dreamfall Chapters', which recently entered pre-production. Red Thread Games will independently fund and produce the sequel to 'Dreamfall', and has entered into a revenue sharing agreement with Funcom as part of the licensing deal. Funcom owns the intellectual property rights for 'The Longest Journey', but due to the company\u2019s focus on and commitment to the development of online games, the decision was made to license the rights to Mr. T\u00f8rnquist and his new development studio. The close working relationship between Funcom and Mr. T\u00f8rnquist will allow him to continue on as Creative Director of Funcom\u2019s \u2018The Secret World\u2019, in parallel with putting together a team to develop 'Dreamfall Chapters'.",
