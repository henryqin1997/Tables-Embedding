Mammals also express Lcytb, a close homolog of Dcytb that localizes in the lysosome, but has not yet been studied functionally [104]. The Drosophila genome has two homolog genes, termed CG1275 and no extended memory (nemy). nemy was recovered from a genetic screen for learning and memory mutants [91] and could function in memory formation by regulating intravesicular peptidyl alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) activity and the formation of amidated neuropeptides [92]. Because PHM is a copper-dependent enzyme [105] and Dcytb is known to also reduce copper [106,107], the function of nemy in learning and memory may therefore be mediated through copper reduction. A recent report showed that nemy is strongly induced by hypoxia [108]. Whether nemy has a role in iron absorption remains to be elucidated. Likewise, CG1275 has not been studied to date.}",

Mvl mutants lost a characteristic sugar-preference trait of wild type flies and this phenotype could be rescued by exposure to excess dietary iron [ 72 ]. Tissue staining with a specific antibody revealed that the Mvl protein resides in the anterior and posterior parts of the middle intestine, as well as in the Malpighian tubules, brain and testis [ 73 ]. Iron stores are depleted in Mvl mutants [ 70 , 87 ]. The Mvl mutant also suppressed iron accumulation in the intestine, caused by RNA interference (RNAi) of ferritin in this tissue [ 74 ].
