Returning to a purely instrumental approach following At Last...The Duets Album (which featured a great cameo by Chaka Khan), I'm in the Mood for Love is admittedly a lot like Kenny G's other albums. Like At Last..., this is yet another album's worth of standards, ranging from torch songs to \"Yesterday.\" And like every other album Kenny G has made, it's pop-oriented and ultra-smooth. But the overall feel of this release is a little brassier and a smidgen more big band than usual, and it adds up to some sparkling moments. The title track, \"I'm in the Mood for Love,\" two-steps along with ease, warmth, and genuine emotion, and it's a real treat to hear Walter Afanasieff on piano. \"The Way You Look Tonight\" is refreshingly genteel, and there's something gratifying in hearing Kenny G belt out \"Fly Me to the Moon.\" Naturally, there are a few underwhelming moments on the album. Kenny G's squealing improvisation on \"Love Theme from 'Romeo and Juliet'\" is a little over the top, and a few of the arrangements are forgettable, if not a tad silly (the chimes on \"If,\" for example). But when a slinky-sweet number like \"It Had to Be You\" comes rolling around, you forget all about it.}",
