            "Students with moderate TOEFL scores, students with moderate GMAT scores, students with little to no work experience, students interested in dual degrees, International students, part-time students interested in a program located downtown",
            "Go to a class at the downtown campus if you are thinking about going to the GSB. There had been some issues with students cheating, and the academic honesty is very relaxed. Many of the students are from China or India. Some students are from other parts of the world. The majority of the students are young, and have little experience in business. Students with moderate to relatively low TOEFL scores are required to enroll in a non-credit earning English course taught at the downtown campus. The course is an added $4000, so be sure to study. Most domestic students are part-time students with full time jobs and careers. Most domestic students are helpful and friendly. Classes are offered during the day or at night. I have not seen an online graduate course. If you are a McNair Scholar or classified as a McNair Scholar Candidate, I would recommend a different university.",
            "This was a very expensive gamble. I had applied to several graduate business schools, and I expected to learn a great deal from the program. Unfortunately, I could not afford the tuition. Tuition is about $13000 a semester, and roughly $25000 for the year. Although I had a 4.0, I did not qualify for scholarships. Most of the scholarships went to International students and joint MBA/JD students.",
            "There is a Friday lecture series ranging from guest lecturers and PhD candidates. Most are very interesting. Some activities are worth going to, but most of the activities are on the main campus. If you want to create a group or club, the university has the funds to do so. The GSB uses a floor from the Law School, and the Law students have more events and services.",
            "I was a graduate student at the business school. I would like to say I learned a lot, but I really didn't learn as much as I expected. The graduate program is semester based. The professors have a great deal of experience and knowledge. Unfortunately, the class structure benefited the international students than the domestic students. I felt unengaged and I was bored."

The amount of experience that you will receive here in the end of course is worth it, since the graduating class of 2008 made in their first year between 80-90 grand. So IIT is worth it., 72079=I was a member of the Japanese Film and Animation Society and had a great time. I am actually in the Illinois Institute of Technology: A Vibrant Campus in a Global City video at 5:38 in the floppy hat. That was for Homecoming 2011 and we turned out cart into a cardboard tank., 171724=I'm a commuter. So a strong work ethic is essential, especially when traveling from home. The earlier the you arrive at school the better. This will allow you to prepare for your classes and be on time for your morning class. Make sure you get your eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. Just as school/work/thinking happens in steps, you must go through your five phase of sleep in order to be well-rested and ready to work the next day. For me I try to sleep by 10:00 pm and wake up at 5:30am. For first year students, especially commuter students, try to get involved in clubs so that you can make friends and build your network. Do not let it interfere with your course work! Balance is key. If you do not have a strong work ethic coming out of high school, develop one as soon as you can. I've depended mostly on books and online resources to learn. READ before class! Its hard work but once you get the hang of it, it saves you a LOT of time and stress in the long run. If you can, try and get your textbooks weeks before classes start and begin to read and study from them. This will leave you less stressed during the semester, feel more confident because you will have prepared before class and give you some extra time for activities you would like to do during the semester. Work hard in college! Understand that this is one of those rare periods in your life where you have a ability to change the world, learning new things, and have numerous opportunities. Once you're finished with college, there are seldom times where you will have the same enriching experience., 55840=Apply early, fill out your FAFSA on ASAP (January 1st), and make sure to personally visit campus. They'll give you a warm welcome in a very personal way. IIT is all about the people!, 10722=When I first got accepted into IIT I received a 50% scholarship (which most students receive). Within two years I had increased that to a 100% tuition with an additional $2000 from various scholarships., 43123=if you are not going for engineering, architecture (which is our top program w/ very few rivals in the area) and computer science, move on. most other majors are used to catch engineers who decided it wasn't their thing and can't transfer since our gen ed is tech specific. we have programs from the '40s that are still going through growing pains - psych, business and new ones from post 2000 - poli sci and socio - don't do it. you're paying for engineering lab fees and equipment and a technical name for a non-technical degree.}",

Those academic types. Students willing to work to get what they want. Students who know that hard work pays off. Those who like a close-knit community, a big city atmosphere, or both! Tips for prospective students 1.) Work hard in high school, but make sure that you take part in some extracurricular activities too. Colleges look at the whole package, and being in an engineering activity or student government could set you above the rest. 2.) Make sure you apply early to the college, I know it helped me. Also, visit the campus. This might be the place for you, or you might want something bigger. IIT is unique in its size, so make sure you check out many options. 3.) Make sure you are willing to put the work in if you want to",
