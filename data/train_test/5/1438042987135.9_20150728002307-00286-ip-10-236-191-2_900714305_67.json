            "This college is very expensive, but applying for aid helps out tremendously.",
            "There is a train station near campus that goes straight to downtown.",
            "The food isn't too bad, but it's definitely not 5 star quality. The cafeteria workers are very nice.",
            "The house system is the best. You can expect to meet your first and closest friends through housing.",
            "Classes are very rigorous and require a lot of time commitment, but it is worth it.",
            "If you're looking for a college where you can maintain a 4.0 gpa and not have too work to hard for, then you're looking in the wrong place. This school is very challenging, but the pay off is definitely worth it. And the people you will meet are great.",
            "The University of Chicago is a wonderfully diverse community of students. There are many great opportunities offered, both for the present and for your future, and this school is a great investment. Plus, there's always something fun to do!"

This prestigious university provides numerous opportunities for its students and I love its diversity in student body and in student life. I am definitely thrilled in looking forward to the day that the admissions decisions are mailed out., 155057=When the admissions say they are holistic; they are holistic. Don't get caught up with your test scores and having the highest GPA. Those might help a little, but once you are in the range of a 2200 and in the top 10-15% of your class, you don't have much to worry about in that respect. Focus on your essays. Give yourself time and make sure to explore the school. Talk to admissions officers and have a strong interview. Your Uncommon essay will make the difference of how the admissions office perceives your character. It's hard. But never impossible., 352039=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 278446=We occasionally have health code type issues, but all in all the food and dining is pretty good here. There are options for vegans, vegetarians, and people with allergy or faith restricted diets. There are 2 dining halls (as of 2013-14), a food court with national chains, and more coffee shops than you can imagine. There are also two small grocery store type markets on campus. Your meal plan will more than cover all your needs. And if you get tired of campus dining, there are plenty of restaurants in the area to choose from!, 257805=Scav- Every year, for one weekend, UChicago students participate in the world's largest scavenger hunt to try to finish a list of over 300 items. There are road trip elements where students have been taken to Iowa, Canada, and Tennessee; a Scav Olympics where students compete in multiple challenges over the course of one afternoon; and some items that are just bizarre, like creating a drink-dispensing piano, or converting a bus into a bowling alley. Kuviasungnerk- a week-long January festival where hundreds of students wake up at 5 a.m. every day to do calisthenics or sun salutations by Lake Michighan, literally saluting the sun as it rises. Humans vs. Zombies- A quarterly event where hundreds of students fight the zombie apocalypse. Hosted by the UChicago Zombie Readiness Taskforce, one student (the lead zombie) attempts to spread a human-flesh craving virus among other participating students. Humans defend themselves by shooting nerf darts at zombies. If you are a human, and you're tagged by a zombie, you will become one. Buildings are safe, but the outside is not. If you are able to complete the final mission at the end of the week, you will have survived the zombie apocalypse., 130211=I visited the school in April and it was an amazing experience! I was able to attend several overviews of different subjects and one especially I enjoyed was the economics one lectured by one of their Nobel Prize winners. The classes are small and in depth from what I experienced!}",

You run into far more students who say they don't particularly care about the increased paycheck foreseen for college graduates than who list that as a top 5 reason for coming here. In fact, of the six or so people with whom I've discussed post-graduation plans, four have said they would be perfectly happy doing menial labour for pay and pursuing their interests in their spare time. In reality, most of them will",
