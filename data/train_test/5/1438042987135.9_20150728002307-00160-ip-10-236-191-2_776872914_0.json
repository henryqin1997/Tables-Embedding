We are into trekking, national parks, beaches, temples, history. We want to see the local culture not just the touristy bits. Any suggestions of where to spend extra time, must sees that I\u2019ve left out or where to avoid would be great. We would also like to get some clothes made, is Hoi An the best place? We\u2019re arriving in Singapore 22nd Sept, leaving Singapore 19th Dec. 1 wk Singapore \u2013 KL (Fly to Bangkok) Thailand 1 \u2013 2 wks (Oct) Bangkok - Ayutthaya - Chiang Mai (trekking & cooking school) - Chiang Khong - Huay Xai. Would 1 wk be sufficient to do this? Would it be better to try and fly from Chiang Mai to Luang Prabang \u2013 is this even possible? Laos 2 (if flying to LP) \u2013 2 \u00bd wks (if not flying to LP) October Huay Xai - Luang Prabang (elephant trek, waterfalls) - Vang Vieng - Vientiane -ThaKhaek (1) - Savannakhet (1)- Champasak - 4000 Islands Don Khong & Don Dhet Cambodia 2 weeks \u2013 we will be here end October will it still be wet? Are we trying to fit in too much for 2 wks? Kratie - Phnom Penh \u2013 Kep - Ko Tonsang \u2013 Kompat\u2013 PP \u2013 Siem Reap (Angkor) - Battambang \u2013 PP Vietnam (3 wks) November PP -> Saigon \u2013 Mekong - Mui Ne or Dalat ?? - Nha Trang - Hoi An - Hue - Hanoi - Ha Long Bay Fly from Hanoi to Bangkok. (December) 2 \u00bd wks to get from Bangkok to Singapore looking to spend 1 week on Ko Sokurn maybe (We are looking for a quiet, relaxing wk (snorkeling, sunbathing, nice walks) before we head home, is this a good choice? I have also heard about the perthinan islands off Malaysia \u2013 would these be a good alternative? Also re visas, is it a good idea to get all visas sorted in Singapore or Bangkok? Re Thai visa we are going to be in Thailand for 2 wks at start of trip and 2 wks at end of trip which is longer than 2mth visa, any suggestions on how to get around this? Doubt we will be flying from Thailand at any stage unless maybe Chiang Mai so not sure about the 30 day one?! Think that\u2019s it..Thanx, this is a brill site/resource!, 10023=#1 Posted: 3/7/2007 - 07:29, 12399=Joined Travelfish 20th June, 2007 Posts: 9, 4905=Joined Travelfish 10th March, 2011 Posts: 1, 9406=admin Joined Travelfish 21st January, 2004 Location Indonesia Posts: 7220 Total reviews: 24 Places visited: At least 113, 5216=#3 Posted: 10/7/2007 - 06:42}",
