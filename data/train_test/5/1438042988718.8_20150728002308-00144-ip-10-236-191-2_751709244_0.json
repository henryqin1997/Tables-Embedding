Terri denied she had been engaged in prostitution at Putnam\u2019s residence. She also told Macumber rather bluntly that a number of statements she made in 2010 to Roseville police detectives and investigators from the Placer County District Attorney\u2019s Office were \u201clies.\u201d, 30326=\u201cDuring the whole time you were away from home in 2010 you had your own phone and could have contacted someone at anytime and left, right?\u201d he asked., 27271=Throughout the course of a nearly six-hour examination, Terri recalled that she had ran away from an uncomfortable home life in the summer of 2010 and \u201clied\u201d to Thongsy when they first met, saying she had been kicked out, was living on the streets against her will and had no place to go. Terri said Thongsy purchased her food, new clothes and then brought her to the Thongsy family home in Sacramento, where she stayed for several days. Terri was soon joined by a runaway friend, Angelica, at which point Thongsy began buying both teens food and renting them a room to stay in at the Motel 6 on Stockton Boulevard in Sacramento.}",
