            "The University of Pittsburgh is definitely on of the safest campuses I have ever been on. Oakland is a beautiful part of Pittsburgh and the police are always on site making sure that all is going accordingly. You also must hand your ID to a guard to be swiped any time you enter a dorm. Not once have I ever felt unsafe wandering the campus.",
            "There are frats and sororities on campus for those who would like to join something like that. I am not personally a member but I do have some friends who are and they love it. It is not such a large part that if you choose not to participate you feel left out in any way either.",
            "There is every club imaginable on campus. If Pitt doesn't have it you can create it yourself. They even hold an activities fair at the beginning of the year so that you know what is out there. It is a bit overwhelming but so much fun and with so many options you will always find something you like.",
            "Any and all.",
            "Pitt is very good with scholarships and you really are getting a private school education at public school prices but it is still a bit too much. I love Pitt and do believe it is worth the money but with the latest increase in tuition was just a bit much. Still, try for every scholarship out there and remember Pitt is an amazing school.",
            "You can go out to eat, watch any sport, join clubs, go to concerts, visit Wildwood, go shopping, catch a movie, go ice-skating and do a bit of sightseeing just to name a few. Add on the fact that bus and subway rides are free for any Pitt student and you have yourself one amazing city at the tips of your fingers.",
            "For college food it really isn't as bad as I though it would be but Market Central can get a bit boring after awhile. I would recommend a meal plan with quite a few dining dollars as you can use those at any on campus convenience store such as Quick Zone (went there at least once a day everyday) and the mini stops like bagel shops, Burger King, Taco Bell, ect. The Union and Cathedral also have a nice selection of eateries if you wish to shake things up. There is also the fact that there are so many restaurants on campus there is no chance you won't find something. It is wonderful!",
            "There are so many different varieties to choose from in the way of on campus housing. I lived in Tower A and it was wonderful. I met some of my best friends while living on my floor! Safety protocols are also really well established, with the guards and the fact that you must swipe your card to enter any dorm left me always feeling safe. The bathrooms weren't too bad and even if your floor was noisy for a bit you could always go to the library or even to another floor to visit some friends and work in their room.",
            "Pitt is tough but not impossible. They truly wish to enhance your skills and abilities during your time on campus. Classes are a lot of work, some more than others depending on the subject, but most teachers take the time to be sure that you are getting everything you can out of the experience. Just be sure to always do the homework.",
            "Do not take what RateMyProfessor.com has to say to heart. I was very iffy about some of my professors due to the comments left on the site and it turns out that a lot of those who weren't rated as well were just tough not bad. College is about challenging yourself so these teachers are just what you need. Some of those I feared ended up being some of my best teachers. Also, don't be afraid to try something you never have before class-wise. I took Japanese though I had no prior knowledge and it was a wonderful experience. Stepping outside of your box is never a bad thing. Last but not least, always keep on eye on your E-bills (payment system for school). Every semester there seemed to be a problem with mine where payments would disappear and things would not add up. It isn't unusual when you have to keep track of thousands of students. Just call financial aid and the according offices and they will gladly work with you. But always check just in case because there is nothing worse than looking at something telling you that you owe more than you do. It is terrifying!",
            "Pitt is an exciting and cultured school with a lot to offer. Not only is it exceptional academically but socially. There is always something to do and always someone there to help."

It might not be New York or L.A., but it's pretty close and has just about everything you'd expect from a city., 751244=Put yourself out there as much as you can in your first week. It's a big school and is easy to get lost in, so being involved can really make your experience 1000 times better., 415963=I feel very safe. Especially after the bomb threats during the Spring of 2012 semester., 270404=There's a lot of review in most below-1000-level classes if you've taken a course on it before (in high school, for example) but it's worth it and the teachers do build on it. Once you get to the upper levels it's mostly new knowledge., 170674=At the University of Pittsburgh, there is a large Arena called the Peterson Events Center, otherwise known as the Pete. There is a large field outside right outside there and every year, Univ. of Pittsburgh plans an event for Freshman students to break a world record of some sort. This past year of 2012, Univ. of Pittsburgh Class of 2016 broke the world record of the largest uniformed dance with umbrellas dancing to the Cupid Shuffle for 6 minutes. This field is also known by students to play Ultimate Frisbee, Croquet, Football, Volleyball, Tanning, etc., 526885=Definitely study, study, study. Join as many clubs as you can handle in high school. Keep your GPA above a 3.5, and aim for at least a 1200 on the math and reading section of the SAT, and you will be guaranteed entrance to the University., 1013494=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 601016=The Cathedral of Learning (42 stories, 535 feet tall, 2529 windows) is the largest academic building in the United States. The building is Pitt's landmark and provides wonderful views of campus from the Unversity Honors College on the 35th and 36th floors., 220278=If you're in-state, you're definitely getting a good deal. Pitt is just as good as private schools that charge twice as much. Obviously the out of state tuition is one of the highest in the country, but I still think it's a pretty decent deal. You get so many opportunities that small schools don't offer. The free bus pass alone retails for over $1600.}",
