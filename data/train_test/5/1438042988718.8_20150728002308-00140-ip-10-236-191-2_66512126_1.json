One appeared to have been planted deliberately, the others volunteered themselves in other places in the garden and had grown rather large in the absence of anyone to stop them (the Cottage was vacent and severely neglected when we bought it). It is quite lovely in bloom, but I spent evey week last year killing off volunteers sprouting amoungst my perennials and in places I didn't want them (too close to the house, where previous volunteers had grown and scratched the siding quite deeply and also put holes in screens). I am considering digging a \"trench\" around the one parent plant and installing a few feet of metal trim we had left over to try to keep it from continuing to sprea... read mored-or growing a few honeysuckle up into it to choke it and hopefully kill it so the unwanted root based seedlings stop. Carefully plan where you plant this shrub-be sure it can be mowed around for several feet in every direction if you don't want more of them!!",

Frost in our part of Zone 5 can blast the flowers, but the years in which they do make it are ample reward. It took a while to figure out that serious pruning, not unlike what works for Lilacs, can make a better show and help the shrub to produce nice tall branches for cutting. Unfortunately, the flower color is strongly connected to how much sun the plant gets, so flowers on cut branches will bloom out lighter and lighter colors as the display sits inside. Once established the shrub will both spread out and spread by shoots coming up from the roots. These sprouting roots are remarkably persistent. If you want to entirely remove an older clump, it is a lot of work to get the plant entirely out of the site.",

My wife was disappointed that I failed to surround the plant with a barrier so each year we expected flowers but nothing happened. Within the last couple years the plant has taken off and is now prolific with spring blossoms and to our surprise this year it has 3 fruit that are about 3-4 inches in diameter. We will harvest the fruit and get our first taste of quince. We've enjoyed watching the changes over the years and expect to do so for years to come",

It is a dense, twiggy, spiny, deciduous shrub noted for its pure white, early spring flowers and its compact, broad-spreading habit. Five-petaled white flowers (1.5\" diameter) appear in small clusters mostly before the foliage emerges in an extremely showy early spring bloom. Flowers are followed by hard, yellowish-green fruits (quinces) which ripen in autumn. Although edible, quinces are too bitter to be eaten directly from the plant, but are sometimes used in preserves and jellies.",
