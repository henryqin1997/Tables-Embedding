Also, second longest winning streak in D-I history (7, Jan. 19-Feb. 10)., 21731=Loyola has completed the turnaround from finishing the 2003-2004 season with the lowest RPI in NCAA Division I basketball. The Greyhounds finished that season with a 1-27 record the season before Jimmy Patsos took over as head coach., 35084=Loyola improved to 13-1 this season when shooting 45.0-percent or better from the field with its win over Siena. The only loss the Greyhounds have suffered when shooting that mark or better was on February 24 when they went 25-of-55 (.455) from the field at Rider and lost by four., 23908=The outing was 10 percentage points better than the Greyhounds\u2019 previous best this season when they shot 52.9-percent from the field (27-of-51) at Bucknell on December 28, 2011., 32386=Second MAAC title in school history and first since 1994., 42240=Last season, Patsos moved into third-place all time at Loyola in victories, trailing only Lefty Reitz (349 wins, 1937-44, 1945-61) and Nap Doherty (165, 1961-74)., 33696=The last time no starters scored in double figures was on November 24, 2010, when the Greyhounds lost 51-48 at Vermont., 122957=I celebrate your misery, clowns.

Even then, I dunno., 25215=Winbush hit two 3-pointers midway through the first half of the MAAC title game that were part of a 10-3 Loyola run, giving the Greyhounds a 16-9 lead with 10:12 left in the half. Prior to the two 3-pointers, Winbush was 3-for-15 (.167) from downtown on the season., 57561=Posted on 13 March 2012 by Glenn Clark, 36307=Since then, however, he has averaged 13.0 points per game, starting with a 16-point game on January 7 against Canisius. The game against the Golden Griffins started a stretch of 11-straight in which Olson scored 11 or more points and had 15 or more seven times. During the last 15 games, Olson has shot 75-of-150, 50.0-percent, from the field and 45-of-94 (.478) from behind the 3-point line., 37267=The Greyhounds previously had held three teams to sub-60 performances just once since joining Division I, and that came during 1981-1982, their first season at this level., 41937=Head Coach Jimmy Patsos became the third coach in Loyola history to win 100 games when the Greyhounds defeated UMBC, 73-63, on the road. Patsos, who is in his eighth season, took over a team that finished 1-27 during the 2002-2003 season. He won his 100th game in his 215th career game., 68029=Thursday\u2019s game is scheduled for a 9:50 p.m. tip-off and will be televised on TNT., 120269=Posted on 21 November 2011 by Glenn Clark, 32803=First back-to-back sellouts of Reitz Arena since the venue opened in 1984 (Feb. 3 and 10)., 81034=You\u2019ll see a lot of funny things in 2012. I\u2019ll go ahead and guess that there won\u2019t be many funnier than this Drayton Florence flop\u2026, 47969=The junior, who transferred from Northeastern University and first played for the Greyhounds as a sophomore in 2010-2011, has scored 756points in his two years at Loyola, and he has 467 rebounds as a Greyhound.

The 44 points were the fewest Loyola had allowed in a game this season. It was the fewest points a Loyola opponent had scored since the Greyhounds held Dartmouth to 41 in a 58-41 decision on November 24, 2009., 34856=Transversely, the Greyhounds are just 2-5 when two or fewer players tally 10 or more with their only wins coming on December 7 at George Washington and at Manhattan., 29677=For the first time since the league expanded to three All-MAAC teams in 1998, four Greyhounds received all-league honors, topping all teams in the conference. Erik Etherly was named to the All-MAAC First Team, Dylon Cormier to the Second, and Justin Drummond and Robert Olson to the Third., 26262=Dylon Cormier and Shane Walker each hit threes during the span, and Olson capped it with a three off the dribble at 14:12, making Loyola\u2019s lead 44-33., 21422=After trailing by four points (30-26) at halftime, Loyola held Fairfield without a point for the first 7:48 of the second half, and without a field goal for the first 8:48.

He has shot .440 from behind the arc, second-best in the MAAC, and has averaged 11.3 points per game. The junior guard entered the month of January averaging less than nine points per game, but since then he has been the team\u2019s second-leading scorer at nearly 13 a contest., 30089=The Greyhounds\u2019 previous high was at the end of the 1997-1998 season when Mike Powell (1st), Jason Rowe (2nd) and Roderick Platt (3rd) earned All-MAAC honors., 37842=Shane Walker blocked two Fairfield shots in the first three minutes of the game, and he then swatted a Maurice Barrow layup with 13:58 on the clock, tying him for second all-time at Loyola in blocked shots. He now has 130 in his career, second all-time., 25946=When Kyle Downey cut through the lane and laid in a basket with 16:42 to go in regulation, it pulled Siena within three, 32-29. Robert Olson responded for the Greyhounds, however, knocking down a three at 16:25 that started a 12-4 Greyhounds run that saw the Greyhounds go 4-of-4 from 3-point range., 13536=Posted on 14 March 2012 by WNST Staff, 36103=Robert Olson entered the month of January averaging 8.9 points per game through Loyola\u2019s first 11, and he stayed right on that track in the first two games of 2012, scoring a combined 17., 37455=The last time a Loyola team held six-straight teams under 60, regardless of division, came in January-February 1977 when it held six teams in a row \u2013 Southampton, Saint Peter\u2019s, Randolph-Macon, Mount St. Mary\u2019s, Baltimore and Philadelphia Textile \u2013 to 59 or fewer. The Greyhounds, however, were just 3-3 in that stretch., 43816=Since taking over as head coach in 2004, Jimmy Patsos has put an emphasis on recruiting locally, and it has never shown as much as on this year\u2019s roster. Three players \u2013 sophomore guard Dylon Cormier (Cardinal Gibbons), sophomore forward Jordan Latham (City) and freshman guard R.J. Williams (St. Frances) are products of schools within the city limits., 20019=The Greyhounds are 2-8 all-time against Big 10 schools.

Manhattan led by 11 four times, including with 11:36 in the second half. The Greyhounds also rallied form 15-point deficits to defeat Boston University at home and Fairfield on the road., 34593=Loyola is 11-2 this season when four or more players score in double figures, and prior to the defeat at Rider, it had not lost since the season-opener on November 11 at Wake Forest. The Greyhounds are also 21-3 when three or more players top 10., 48847=Etherly and the Greyhounds are in Pittsburgh for tomorrow\u2019s NCAA Second Round game against Ohio State University.

He earned his 100th career coaching victory in November and led the Greyhounds to the No. 2 seed in the MAAC Championships., 78345=Perhaps Flynn\u2019s success had much more to do with the Green Bay Packers\u2019 scheme & wide receivers and even the Detroit Lions\u2019 less than exceptional defense than the former LSU quarterback himself. But as he enters free agency, Flynn may have just made himself a viable option for teams that won\u2019t enter 2012 with Andrew Luck on their roster., 28255=The Greyhounds\u2019 victory over Boston University on February 19 was their 20th of the season, setting a school Division I record., 25497=In the Semifinal game vs. Siena, he tallied Loyola\u2019s fifth and sixth points of the game, scoring in the paint at 12:13 to stop an 11-0 Siena run that had the Saints ahead 11-4. He then made a jumper at 6:31 that put the Greyhounds ahead 17-16 in the first half., 33151=The last time the Greyhounds won a game without making a 3-pointer was February 27, 1996, when they defeated Siena, 67-53, in Reitz Arena, a span of 438 games.
