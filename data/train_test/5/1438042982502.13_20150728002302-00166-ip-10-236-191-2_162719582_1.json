However his last year he did bat .382 and lead the league in triples at age 32 with 20. Ruth batted 4th that year in AL .376 with 54 HR's changing the game forever. I'd probably put him in because of the injustice of it. If it happened today not one of them would have been ban they actually won their court case and Kenesaw Mountain Landis ban them anyway for life. There was no official policy before Landis, at least not one that said they would be ban for life. Seems harsh now but it was probably the right thing to do for baseball.Watch Eight Men Out its a good movie. Just to give you an idea on how harsh the gambling policy is Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays, both retired and both in no way involved in baseball anymore, were banned in 1983 after they were hired by casinos in Atlantic City, as greeters and autograph signers. Bowie Kuhn opined that a casino was \"no place for a baseball hero and Hall of Famer\"; Mantle and Mays were reinstated by Peter Ueberroth in 1985.Rose thought that he would have no problem betting on baseball even after Mantle and Mays were banned for shaking hands at a casino? Rose \"great player\" but either unbelievably arrogant or dumb as a box of rocks or maybe both. Sorry Rose fans never, never, never getting in the HOF as long as he is alive., 101598=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

The were banned form attending any HOF ceremonies until they were reinstated. No gambling, ban for life! Every player knows this no one else besides Rose since 1920 has every had to be ban for this. Rose F'd up big time. Hey I loved the guy growing up even met him once. He probably could have worked out an arrangement with MLB if he had just come clean in the investigation but he lied his ass off even when they had damning evidence. When the HOF time limit for voting for him was just about to expire then he came clean. It really is very sad., 59935=Jack Morris' ERA is a little high for the Hall. He didn't pitch in the extreme pitchers' era of roughly 1960-1975 but also missed out on the steroid hitters' era. As for Pete Rose, if I were Commissioner, I would negotiate an abject apology for the betting in return for Rose being put back on the Hall list., 113806=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC.

Please use this thread to discuss any news of the day or other topics you wish to bring up with each other., 29277=SJM308I agree Larkin deserves to be voted in to the HOF this year. I would make McGwire wait a little longer at least until there seems to be some consensus on what to do about players who played in the \"steroid era\" and there will need to be some decision made soon because if they keep putting their names on the ballet and voters can only vote for 10 players by 2015 very few players will every get the 75% vote needed to get in. As for Rose I would never let him in as long as he is alive and I was a Charlie Hustle fan. He broke a cardinal rule in baseball one that every player knows. I doubt he ever threw a game, he says he always bet for the Reds to win, but there is a danger to consorting with gamblers. Players in financial trouble in debt to unscrupulous people is not good for sports. Maybe I put him in when he is dead this should be enough of a deterrent. I think Vinny Castilla is the first player who played on the Nationals to be on the HOF ballot. Vinny had a nice career 3 SS and an AS but not HOF material. Playing in Colorado probably helped his numbers too. I like FP and occasionally he picks up something I missed like when Detwiler pitched from the stretch with no one on base. I'm used to Carpenter and we could do a lot worse.}",
