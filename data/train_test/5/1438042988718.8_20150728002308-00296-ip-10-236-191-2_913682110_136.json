Our Ranger newspaper has actually just decided to come up with dorms for the Fall of 2013 and applications are being taken., 472563=They have a mall area, a fiesta room, and upstairs from that is a game room. Every week they have stands or people come out and it is a lot of fun. In December they have a snow day. They do karaoke, boxing matches and all sorts of kind of things., 387315=I do not live in dorms, but dorms are being built near the college as I speak. The colleges should be completed by 2014-Spring., 478728=12 credits cost me 800ish while 15 this semester is 1044 you better be a indistrict student, 364369=There are no dorms at San Antonio College. But in Fall 2013 there will be Tobin Lofts provided to students who would like to rent them. The lofts are conveniently positioned across the street from campus. From the looks of construction, the lofts will look amazing when complete., 561568=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 380237=Brand new dorms that are opening right next to campus in fall 2013., 27517=sac is offering so much more than what they first did when i attened in 2003. i love the fact that everything is spread out and doesnt seem so cluttered, and no one has to walk shoulder to shoulder like some colleges. also very clean!!!!, 429017=I started attending SAC in Spring 2013. I registered last minute and was running around like a chicken with its head cut off. It was a little stressful because I had no clue of what I was doing or where I should have been. If it hadn't been for my sister who had started a semester before me, I don't think I would have enrolled. But all in all, once the craziness settled down and I started my classes things were good. I would rate this school with 4 out of 5 stars., 442915=As San Antonio College is a community college, most of the students are commuting to and from. Beginning Fall 2013, SAC will open their own version of dorms called the Tobin Lofts. They're basically apartments, having different floor plans that can accommodate up to 4 persons comfortably, complete with WiFi, furnishing options, cafeteria, utilities, pool area, fitness center, etc. They also have a designated parking garage separate from the SAC garage. You don't actually have to be a SAC student to room there, as you can live there as long as you are enrolled at a college institution in San Antonio.}",

(It doesn't, trust me!) Those who are looking to save literally thousands of dollars on obtaining a higher education. Those who are not quite ready for the responsibilities associated with going off to a four year university (i.e. living by yourself, homesickness) Tips for prospective students Don't fret about the negative connotation community colleges have within the community of high school students planning on attending college, think about what is best for you financially, and if you could personally handle the shock of actual university life right off the bat. Remember, community college is just a starting point, you will get there eventually! Bang for the buck I cannot express enough how much of a 'steal' San Antonio College is. You are definitely not wasting your",
