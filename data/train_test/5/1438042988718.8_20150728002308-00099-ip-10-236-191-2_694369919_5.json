He'll do right-handed set-up work for the D-Backs in 2004, but he'll likely not be part of the closer mix., 41898=8/1/2013, 16009=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Advanced Stats, 52097=Lyon missed the entire year after undergoing nerve transposition surgery in his elbow in April. He was pitching in the minors by the end of the year, however, so he'll be ready for spring training. Check back in the spring to see whether the D-Backs plan to use Lyon as a starter or, more likely, long relief., 52045=2005, 46555=2013, 39916=2/20/2014, 44637=7/4/2013, 47734=2011, 51452=2006, 43714=7/9/2013, 45511=6/14/2013, 51010=2007, 49396=Lyon converted 26-of-31 save opportunities before being permanently replaced in the closer's role by Chad Qualls. He expressed interest in returning to the D-Backs via free agency, but Lyon will likely end up signing elsewhere as Arizona will have to wisely spend payroll with a number of young players due for significant salary increases. Lyon's effectiveness hinges heavily on where the opposition hits his pitches, as an inflated .355 BABIP is particularly costly when you don't have dominant stuff. That said, Lyon's strikeout rate swelled to a career-high 6.67 K/9IP in 2008 and in most circumstances, he should be able to reprise his role as a viable seventh- or eighth-inning set-up man in 2009. Just don't expect the opportunity for him to close regularly to be there, even though he may pick up the occasional save when the regular closer needs rest., 50357=Lyon led the National League with 35 holds last season, turning in his best campaign as a professional in the process. The D-Backs traded closer Jose Valverde to Houston in December, creating the opportunity for a competition during spring training between Lyon, Tony Pena and Chad Qualls for save situations. Looking at Lyon's strikeout rate (40 K in 74 IP), he seems best suited for a set-up role and given that he's improved his walk rate and home-run rate in each of the last two seasons, there's little reason to believe that he won't be a stable late-inning set-up man in Arizona again this season., 47111=Last year was a lost season for Lyon, who wound up on the shelf by June, with just four appearances after the month of April. Lyon is not a flamethrower, but has been reasonably successful at limiting the long ball in years past, which is important in late-inning, high-pressure situations. He will have competition again this year, even after Mark Melancon was traded to the Red Sox. Check Lyon's status in the spring: he may not be entirely pain-free by the start of the 2012 season, which means he will have an uphill batle to reclaim his role at the back of the bullpen., 46409=2015, 52455=2004, 51504=Lyon was on fire over the first two months of 2005, landing the closer role at the very end of spring training and leading the NL in saves in late May. Then he went down with an elbow injury and wasn't close to being effective when he finally got back in August. Worse yet, over the winter, Lyon wasn't sure if he was fully healthy yet and wondered aloud if he needed Tommy John surgery. Be very wary here; Lyon's got talent if he's healthy, but there are huge doubts about his arm right now., 47786=The Astros gave Lyon a huge contract before the start of the 2010 season, but a cyst on his shoulder prevented him from earning any of it right out of camp. When Lyon made it back, Matt Lindstrom had claimed the closer's role and Lyon was relegated to setting up. By the end of the season, that arrangement had flipped, in part because of Lyon's consistency and in part because of Lindstrom's injuries. Lyon is not a flamethrower like Lindstrom, and won't rack up the strikeouts even if he does close. Still, his ability to limit the long ball (just two in 78 innings), means his success is not entirely unfounded. Watch the spring headlines closely to see whether the team gives Lyon a chance to pickup where he left off in the ninth inning.
