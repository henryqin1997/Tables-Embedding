            "There is a pretty good variety of things to do here ranging from hiking, skiing, and tubing to stand-up comedians and theater performances.",
            "The food here is great. The dining facility ensures that you have as many options as possible for you to choose from. There are also several local restaurants that are awesome!",
            "I am a non-traditional student and live in the local area so I didn't live at school. The students that I know who have lived on campus have found their rooms comfortable and livable. I also know of some incidences where roommates haven't been compatible and the school has done a great job of trying to resolve those situations.",
            "I think that every major, no matter how different, has its challenges. I am a chemistry major with an option in biochemistry. My experiences in the classroom have been challenging but fulfilling. The professors have high expectations that are more than achievable when you put in the effort. The feeling of succeeding and overcoming challenges is worth it. You will learn that you are capable of so much more than you thought you were.",
            "If you are planning to attend Plymouth State University it is important for you to know the following: 1. The professors want you to succeed; they will challenge you because they believe that you are capable. 2. Take your education seriously; your future depends on the effort that you are willing to put into it. 3. Enjoy Plymouth and its surrounding towns. This is a beautiful area that offers so much. 4. Have fun while you are here! Get to know people at school and in the community. 5. Believe in yourself and your abilities. It is okay to ask for help and even when times seem tough and that your classes are hard, just remember that you'll be OK. All of this will pay off when you are a professional working in the field that you studied in college.",
            "Plymouth State University is a wonderful school that provides its students with everything they will need to succeed inside and outside of school. The small class sizes and available resources promote the development of relationships with fellow students as well as the faculty. In my experience, the professors are friendly, knowledgeable, passionate and respectful; serving as mentors who are guiding me as I transition from student to professional."

Along with academics there are plenty of clubs and sports teams you can join. It's just a great school in general. You'll love it here! Tips for prospective students Turn in you assignments on time. Get some sleep. Don't procrastinate. Don't be afraid to make some friends. Don't know how? Take your books or your laptop and study in the common area of your residence hall. Everyone studies out there. You're bound to make a friend or two. Bang for the buck This school is definitely worth it, but it's not exactly cheap. If I didn't love it, I wouldn't be here. Am enjoying being here I",
