            "IIT is great for a ton of different students, but if you dislike the thought of a conversation about the new sci-fi flick coming up this is not the place for you. We cater to many students needs but one universal trait is that we are all nerdy in our own fashions.",
            "Don't worry about the little things. Counselors will work with you to make sure you get everything in on time and if you need some in community college to make yourself more appealing, they will flat out tell you that. The counselors are very friendly and rather than string you along, they will help you in all the ways you need.",
            "When I first got accepted into IIT I received a 50% scholarship (which most students receive). Within two years I had increased that to a 100% tuition with an additional $2000 from various scholarships.",
            "Much like anything you do in life, student life is what you make it. If you choose to sit in your room and play video games all day, that is all you will get out of IIT. If instead you choose to get up and join a few organizations (of which there are over 100) you will really enjoy your time here.",
            "I am currently a third year business student here a IIT and I love my coursework. It really provides me with a lot of hands on experience rather than sitting in a huge class just listening to a lecture. In several job interviews I have talked about projects I have worked on in class and have impressed my employers by doing so."

The amount of experience that you will receive here in the end of course is worth it, since the graduating class of 2008 made in their first year between 80-90 grand. So IIT is worth it., 72079=I was a member of the Japanese Film and Animation Society and had a great time. I am actually in the Illinois Institute of Technology: A Vibrant Campus in a Global City video at 5:38 in the floppy hat. That was for Homecoming 2011 and we turned out cart into a cardboard tank., 171724=I'm a commuter. So a strong work ethic is essential, especially when traveling from home. The earlier the you arrive at school the better. This will allow you to prepare for your classes and be on time for your morning class. Make sure you get your eight hours of uninterrupted sleep. Just as school/work/thinking happens in steps, you must go through your five phase of sleep in order to be well-rested and ready to work the next day. For me I try to sleep by 10:00 pm and wake up at 5:30am. For first year students, especially commuter students, try to get involved in clubs so that you can make friends and build your network. Do not let it interfere with your course work! Balance is key. If you do not have a strong work ethic coming out of high school, develop one as soon as you can. I've depended mostly on books and online resources to learn. READ before class! Its hard work but once you get the hang of it, it saves you a LOT of time and stress in the long run. If you can, try and get your textbooks weeks before classes start and begin to read and study from them. This will leave you less stressed during the semester, feel more confident because you will have prepared before class and give you some extra time for activities you would like to do during the semester. Work hard in college! Understand that this is one of those rare periods in your life where you have a ability to change the world, learning new things, and have numerous opportunities. Once you're finished with college, there are seldom times where you will have the same enriching experience., 55840=Apply early, fill out your FAFSA on ASAP (January 1st), and make sure to personally visit campus. They'll give you a warm welcome in a very personal way. IIT is all about the people!, 10722=When I first got accepted into IIT I received a 50% scholarship (which most students receive). Within two years I had increased that to a 100% tuition with an additional $2000 from various scholarships., 43123=if you are not going for engineering, architecture (which is our top program w/ very few rivals in the area) and computer science, move on. most other majors are used to catch engineers who decided it wasn't their thing and can't transfer since our gen ed is tech specific. we have programs from the '40s that are still going through growing pains - psych, business and new ones from post 2000 - poli sci and socio - don't do it. you're paying for engineering lab fees and equipment and a technical name for a non-technical degree.}",

Those academic types. Students willing to work to get what they want. Students who know that hard work pays off. Those who like a close-knit community, a big city atmosphere, or both! Tips for prospective students 1.) Work hard in high school, but make sure that you take part in some extracurricular activities too. Colleges look at the whole package, and being in an engineering activity or student government could set you above the rest. 2.) Make sure you apply early to the college, I know it helped me. Also, visit the campus. This might be the place for you, or you might want something bigger. IIT is unique in its size, so make sure you check out many options. 3.) Make sure you are willing to put the work in if you want to",
