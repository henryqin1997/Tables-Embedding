    "textBeforeTable": "EPU and Energy Usage: To load the systems, WCG BOINC was running while also running OCCT PSU test. I was satisfied with the ease of use that was afforded with the bundled overclocking, tweaking and monitoring software. The AI Suite is a utility that allows access to the three components of the suite as well as a monitoring station for some temperatures, voltages and fan speeds. Software: The rear port arrangement is nothing out of the ordinary save for a couple of features. Many of the boards of today lack a separate PS2 Mouse and KB port, and as a big bonus this board includes coax and optical audio outputs. The two blue USB ports are 3.0 while the other 6 are USB 2.0. I must insert a little disclaimer: This is not really the ASUS setup for extreme cold and super clocks (it will work though). A 16+ phase ASUS design, or a high-end digital PWM solution, will give a better chance of sustaining higher clocks for longer periods of time. By using a little electronic know how, this ASUS motherboard does not generate the heat of many budget models and in turn allows for a smoother and possibly higher overclock. Your main limiting factors being the power supply",
    "textAfterTable": "Using EPU (It is not recommended to be used while overclocking) power usage can be lowered even more. The EPU tool is effective for the power miser. With customizable settings as well as presets the efficiency of your PC can be increased quite a bit. In testing this feature Allowing the program to use the presets and testing the extremes (Turbo and Max Savings) only the idle SLI stock draw was reduced by 4.88 watts, from 92.72 to 87.84 watts and the load was reduced a whopping 27 watts, from 170 to143 watts in max savings. In turbo the only change was an increase at load of 2 watts, from 170 to 172 watts. For the person sitting in a small room or on a budget this can make a significant difference. This could save up to 50 dollars a year depending on usage as well as keep the room cooler and quieter. These tests were run several times and the results were the same. Perhaps the video card has a higher idle draw than anticipated? Fan Xpert: will allow the user to have more control of their fan speeds, allowing for cooler or quieter conditions and perhaps both if setup to kick into high gear at a specific temperature.",
