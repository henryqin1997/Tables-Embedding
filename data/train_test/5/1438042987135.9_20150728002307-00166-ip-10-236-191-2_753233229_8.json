    "textAfterTable": "*Please note that delivery service timescales are a guide only, and not guaranteed. The courier's don't offer that sort of guarantee. Delivery Procedures and Timescales We are above all flexible and willing to take into account your situation to ensure your order gets to you in good time and without you having to take a day off work to wait for it! The normal procedure for delivery is as follows: Orders placed before 2 pm will normally be shipped that day for delivery the following working day unless you request otherwise. You will be advised by email on the evening of the day when your order is shipped. UK mainland deliveries are made via third-party courier on a next-working-day basis. Deliveries are during office hours. You will receive an SMS on the morning of your delivery with an estimated 1-hour timeslot (mobile number required). To avoid orders sitting in the courier's depot over the weekend, we do not ship orders on Fridays. Although in the large majority of cases we can achieve next-day delivery for orders placed before 2 pm, this is not a guaranteed service and delivery may take slightly longer in some cases. Although it is extremely rare that your order take more than a few days to reach you, please allow up to 7 days and please note that we do not provide a money-back guarantee for the next-day service. For example: (A) Goods ordered 11 am Thursday,",
