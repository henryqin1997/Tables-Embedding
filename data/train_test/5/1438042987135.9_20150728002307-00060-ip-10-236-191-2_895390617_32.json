            "The number of active clubs and student organizations varies from quarter to quarter, easily fluctuating between 50 and 80. There are also plenty of spots around campus to just get together with friends and hangout, both indoor and outdoor, such as the Main Quad, the Campus Center (cafeteria), the computer labs spread across campus, the patio dining area, etc. A lot of events also happen in the Main Quad and on the Patio Stage from time to time, so if anything, you can give De Anza an A for effort in that they make sure campus life is not boring in the slightest.",
            "The on-campus food is alright, but off-campus, we are surrounded by food places, and it all depends on whether or not you want to/can drive, or would prefer to walk. Plenty of food places abound, and most will accomodate a student discount, as all you have to do is ask and make sure you have your student ID on you.",
            "Seeing as how De Anza is a community college, there are no on-campus dorms so there isn't really a dorm life here, but many students do live very close to campus and simply walk over when it's time to go to school. It's in a convenient location for most, and even for those who have to commute from farther places, most would surprise you by saying that it is worth the drive.",
            "There is a fair balance between easy classes and hard classes, but then everyone has their strengths and weaknesses across different areas, and will develop their own specific skill set. Depending on which area of study the classes you take fall under, you can either have an easy but fulfilling schedule, or a hard but rewarding schedule.",
            "Do not be afraid to talk to anyone, or ask questions. Take the time to explore the campus, from the faculty to the places and even your fellow students.",
            "A great atmosphere that makes you want to learn. Academics that will challenge you, but will reward you if you are willing to put in the work. Full of surprises, as you can find and learn things that you would not expect to from this place."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{327685=In the past year, there were a few reports of sexual assault on campus. All the students in fall 2013 received emails about the first report, but I'm not sure if the suspects were caught. That obviously does not make me feel safe. However, if you are scared to walk to your class in the evening (or any time), you can call the police station on campus and they can drive you to your classroom via their police golf cart., 64075=If you are an early bird, sign up for 7:30 or 8:30AM classes. You will be able to have your choice of parking spaces. If you wait until 9:30, it will be harder to find parking, and you will end up having to leave the house earlier to get to class on time anyways. Be to your classes (and ON TIME) on the first day. If you aren't you can and probably will be dropped (yes, even if your late they can drop you). If you are waitlisted, still go to class for that week, even if the teacher keeps telling you they aren't adding anyone. Many students don't show up the 1st day, or drop it after a few days, which bumps you up., 66021=There is a ton of school spirit when it comes to current events, fundraisers, clubs, etc. Right now we are having the Walk a Mile in her Shoes march, and almost everyone in my classes is signed up and attending it. The same thing happened for the March on March 4th at the capitol (supporting teachers and school funding)., 329301=On campus food is actually pretty delicious, but at peak lunch hours (11:30 - 1:30pm), there'll be really long lines at the food court. Whether you are on a diet or not, the salads are to die for. There's an \u00c2\u00a1UnaMas! and asian styled food stations if you're looking for some variety and it's located in between the food court and the dining hall. De Anza also has two coffee shops on campus, but I prefer the Le Cafe that's downstairs. It's quieter than the dining area and they supply multiple power strips. Off campus food can be easily be found across from De Anza. There's ToGo's, Quickly, Jamba Juice, Coffee Society, Panda Express, and Hawaiian BBQ. Again, at peak lunch hours, it can get really crowded. Be patient., 339197=Many students at De Anza are eager to learn. I have been to De Anza's on-campus tutoring during the summer quarter of 2014, and the students in my psychology class were very motivated to understand the material., 316822=This California campus located in the heart of Silicon Valley boasts an extremely diverse student population. It is the number one California Community College of 2013, and for good reasons too. Come check us out, and see why our motto is Just what you need!, 357297=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Lauren from San Jose, CA 12/14/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 2 out of 2 people found this review useful. 2 of 84 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Great for all types of students. There are many different people at De Anza, both traditional and non-traditional. There are online and night classes for full-time workers as well as classes starting as early as 7:30am for morning people like me. Many classes available so timing should not be a problem with those who work. Tips for prospective students Register early! It's important to register at 5am on your chosen registration date. I know it sounds early but it's really important because it can make the difference between getting a class or not. Make sure to check the availability of the classes you want ahead of time so when registration comes, you won't be freaked out about what class you will take if you can't get the one you want. Also, be sure to sign into the MyDeAnza portal to register at around 4:45am because there are thousands of students signing on at the same time.",
