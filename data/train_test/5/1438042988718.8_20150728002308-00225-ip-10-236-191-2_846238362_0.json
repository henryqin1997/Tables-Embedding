    "textBeforeTable": "The Interface dictionary keys and values are summarized in Table 3-1, along with associated actions of configuration agents. In addition to the required keys, the Interface dictionary usually contains the UserDefinedName key, which holds the user-visible name of the network port. Note:\u00a0If the service is PPP, the value of the Type key must be PPP and a SubType key must be added to indicate the type of PPP, such as PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet). The Type key identifies the type of connection, which could be Ethernet, FireWire, PPP, or 6to4. The value of the Hardware key is a property of type CFString that names the type of hardware underlying the network connection, such as Ethernet or AirPort. You can view the contents of this dictionary as a reference to the hardware entity dictionary of the same name (for more information on hardware entity dictionaries, see Hardware Entity Dictionaries). The value of the DeviceName key supplies the BSD device name for the network connection, for example, en0 or en1. For serial-like devices, the value of the DeviceName key is the base name, minus any prefix. For example, the DeviceName value for a modem with the name cu.modem is modem. Currently, the System Configuration framework does not supply API to find all ports suitable for networking. See Programmatically Setting Preferences for",
    "textAfterTable": "Protocol Entity Dictionaries Each protocol entity dictionary contains the information the system needs to configure the protocol. For example, the ConfigMethod property in the IPv4 entity dictionary might tell the system to use DHCP to configure IPv4. Currently, the protocol entities that can be defined for a service are: AppleTalk DNS IPv4 IPv6 PPP For the most part, a service dictionary can contain any combination of these protocol entity dictionaries. If an interface does not support a protocol, however, the corresponding dictionary is ignored. For example, in OS X version 10.3, the AppleTalk dictionary is ignored for PPP services because OS X does not support AppleTalk over PPP. The contents of some protocol entity dictionaries (such as PPP) affect the contents of other members of a network service dictionary. The following sections describe the contents of each protocol entity dictionary, including any effect those contents might have on other properties. AppleTalk The AppleTalk protocol entity dictionary is an optional protocol entity dictionary. If it is present, it contains the following required key: ConfigMethod (kSCValNetAppleTalkConfigMethod) The possible values for the ConfigMethod key are: Node (kSCPropNetAppleTalkConfigMethodNode). The standard AppleTalk configuration, which is suitable for general workstations. Router (kSCPropNetAppleTalkConfigMethodRouter). Used for AppleTalk routers. SeedRouter (kSCPropNetAppleTalkConfigMethodSeedRouter). Used for AppleTalk seed routers. Depending on which configuration method you choose, other",
