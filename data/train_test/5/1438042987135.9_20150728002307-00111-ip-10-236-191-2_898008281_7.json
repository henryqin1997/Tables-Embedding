            "its impossible to be bored as a college student. your always busy or on the go. on campus you can socialize with friends in the food court. we have a game room in the cic upstairs. and down stairs if you are dorming, there is also a game room. i would rate it a 9.",
            "we have a variety of fast-food restuarants to satify your apetite. el pollo loco, carl's junior, and sabarro. there are a lot more options but because there are so many i can not remember them all. if you pay for the meal plan living in dorms, the food is also great. i would rate it a 8.5.",
            "living on your own is a great way to jump start the feeling of being independent in the future. you get a chance, based on your living arrangements, to live with 3-7 different girls. if its hard to find friends on campus, you start with your dorm mates, and expand from there. and right from class you can go home, rather than driving, waiting for a bus, or a ride, you can walk right down stairs. i would rate it a 8.5.",
            "it is critical at any college to maintain a good gpa. because it is a quarter system i must say it is fast paced. you must always stay on top of your work because you will fall behind very quickly. midterms are back to back, it seems like, because the term is so short. i would rate it a 7.",
            "if you wish to attend here, just do the basic requirements it is to get into any college. good grades, mininum of 1400 on the sat's and take some ap classes if you really want to get noticed. this school, personally, was pretty easy to get into. my gpa was 3.2 and my sat score was a 1450.",
            "cal state la is a commuting school, therefore you really dont get the experience you would expect the 'college experience' to be like. its very diverse. you see all types of ethnicities from mostly california. the teachers here are really considerate. there not what high school teachers exagerated them to be. and its easy to meet friends."

There are also some cool places like the Staple Center, shops, clubs, and more. For me, I realized that I like visiting but not living there but that's also because I'm not a big city person. But if you are, then you'll enjoy it all that it has to offer. Tips for prospective students If you decide to go here, make sure your financial aid is set. Make sure EVERYTHING is set: do your Promissory Note on FASFA Direct Loans, take the quiz on FASFA, and if you plan to live on campus, make sure you're on the plan where you pay every quarter and NOT every month. The housing department has three plans; 1, pay for the academic year, 2, pay quarterly, or 3, pay monthly. I did the monthly and so did the rest of my suite-mates; however, we should have paid",
