In this example, there are three VPNs associated with device PE1: red, blue, and green. From the perspective of device PE1, these VPNs are reachable remotely through BGP next hop neighbors PE2 (device ID: 12.12.12.12) and PE3 (device ID: 13.13.13.13). When the BGP next hop neighbor discovery process is enabled on device PE1, a database is generated based on the local VRF and global routing tables. The database in this example contains two BGP next hop device entries: PE2 12.12.12.12 and PE3 13.13.13.13. The routing entries are maintained per next hop device to distinguish which next hop devices belong within which particular VRF. For each next hop device entry, the IPv4 Forward Equivalence Class (FEC) of the BGP next hop device in the global routing table is provided so that it can be used by the MPLS LSP ping operation., 169769=The figure below illustrates a simple VPN scenario for an ISP. This network consists of a core MPLS VPN with four PE devices belonging to three VPNs: red, blue, and green. From the perspective of device PE1, these VPNs are reachable remotely through BGP next hop devices PE2 (device ID: 10.10.10.5), PE3 (device ID: 10.10.10.7), and PE4 (device ID: 10.10.10.8).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "The table below describes the conditions for which the operational status of an LSP discovery group can change. Whenever an individual IP SLAs LSP ping operation of an LSP discovery group is executed, a return code is generated. Depending on the value of the return code and the current status of the LSP discovery group, the group status can change. Return code is \u201cBroken\u201d or \u201cUnexplorable\u201d for all paths leading to the BGP next hop neighbor. Expiration of time allowed for a BGP next hop neighbor to respond to an LSP discovery request. Possible reasons for which LSP discovery can fail for a particular BGP next hop neighbor are as follows: Operational status of an LSP discovery group changes. LSP discovery for a particular BGP next hop neighbor fails. If the LSP discovery option for an LSP Health Monitor operation is enabled, SNMP trap notifications can be generated when one of the following events occurs: LSP Discovery Option Enabled Proactive threshold monitoring support for the LSP Health Monitor feature provides the capability for triggering SNMP trap notifications and syslog messages when user-defined",
    "textAfterTable": "OK--Indicates that the LSP is working properly. The customer VPN traffic will be sent across this path. Broken--Indicates that the LSP is broken. Customer VPN traffic will not be sent across this path and may be discarded. Unexplorable--Indicates that not all the paths to this PE neighbor have been discovered. This may be due to a disruption along the LSP or because the number of 127/8 IP addresses used for LSP selection has been exhausted. The status of an LSP discovery group can be one of the following: UNKNOWN--Indicates that group status has not yet been determined and that the paths belonging to the group are in the process of being tested for the first time. Once this initial test is complete, the group status will change to UP, PARTIAL, or DOWN. UP--Indicates that all the paths within the group are active and no operation failures have been detected. PARTIAL--Indicates that an operation failure has been detected for one or more, but not all, of the paths within the group. DOWN--Indicates that an operation failure has been detected for all the paths within the group.",
