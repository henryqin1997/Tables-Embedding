If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer Jean Paul Gaultier began his storied career at 18, working through the Esterelle, Patou, and Pierre Cardin houses before striking out to start his own design label 6 years later. In 1976, the Paris native sent his first line down the runway, and by the post-Blonde Ambition '80s, the Gaultier name was synonymous with stylish daring. With an eye for unexpected beauty in lowly, everyday places, Gaultier's wild, decadent aesthetic continues to evoke a potent blend of drama, seduction, and distinctive beauty.
