The Hunzib have their own language, but also speak the languages of neighboring nations. In the 4th-5th centuries they were evangelized by Georgian missionaries, but from the 15th-18th century they became Muslims. In 1813 this territory became part of Russia because of a contract between Iran and Russia. They are mainly cattle breeders, and raise cows, goats, sheep, horses and donkeys. They farm potatoes and corn. The Hunzib make many things from wool. The men and women of this region have their work separated by gender. There is a patriarch style of living. Family problems are usually taken to the mullah or the priest of the mosque. The mosque is usually located in the center of the village. This people group is very supportive of one another including their distant family. The husband controls the family, but the women are over the domestic things.}",
