A dense chip-size bare semiconductor device assembly 40 of low profile is produced for dense attachment to a circuit board or other substrate 42. 5. Use of known technology and equipment results in a lower assembly cost. No additional specially-designed equipment is required. 4. The heat sink/spreader/dissipater 52 of the invention results in better temperature control and increased reliability of the semiconductor device assembly 40. 3. Semiconductor dice or multiple chips 20 may be mounted on a single paddle frame metal strip 10, using equipment widely used by device manufacturers. Thus, reliable attachment of the semiconductor dice 20 to the metal paddles 22, testing (and burn-in) of the dice, separation of the paddle mounted semiconductor dice from the paddle frame metal strip 10, and mounting of the semiconductor dice on a substrate 42 may be easily accomplished using well-developed and common assembly equipment and methods. The readily aligned semiconductor die attach apparatus, test head, and lead excision apparatus enable accuracy and ease of operation in the device assembly. 2. Current methods of lead frame production may",
