            "I believe it's very safe, but anytime there's any need to feel not safe, they have ways to make sure everyone is by contact (if there's any need for any warning), and you can call the security (I never have.)",

            "It's great for anyone that's getting a basic education (and it transfers well), no matter your age. And it's great for nursing, culinary arts, technical studies, automotive studies, etc. http://www.otc.edu/ Just check for yourself!",
            "You definitely get more than what you pay for here. It's a very inexpensive college and you learn so much here.",

            "It's a great place. I'm glad I chose this college to start my learning for my career. I wouldn't go anywhere else for basic studies."

We also have a back to school festival too that has the same festivities as the fall festival. Bang for the buck The student service there is very helpful and they always seem to have the right answers to everything. What to do for fun There is a fitness center there if you really want to work out on your own time, and you can even request a personal trainer if you want as well. Also there is a great library there if you want to read or do your research there, and there are computer labs to go to to do other things as well as educational purposes. Food and Dining It",
