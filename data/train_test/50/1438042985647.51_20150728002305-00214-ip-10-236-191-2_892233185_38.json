            "Campus safety is one of the main goals here at Spring Arbor. There is always officers on duty to attend to the needs of the students. They can be called at any hour for any reason and they are always happy to help the students with any trouble that they come across.",
            "It is so easy to get involved in school clubs and activities here. In the first week of freshman year, the school throws a fair that represents all the many activities that the students have the opportunity to participate in.",
            "Spring Arbor is great for the students looking for a deeper relationship with Christ while getting the education they need for the future.",
            "Personally, I think this school is well worth the money I'm paying to attend. On the other hand, it is an expensive school which makes it difficult for many people to see past the dollar sign.",
            "Because the town is very small, most things to do must be either found on campus or you have to travel to the closest town for entertainment (which is only about 10 minutes away). The school tries to plan regular events for the students knowing that it is sometimes difficult to do. We have bowling and skating nights, as well as movies and open mics.",
            "Nothing can compare to a home-cooked meal, especially when the cooks are making meals for thousands of people. The Dining Commons are newly remodeled and beautifully done. There is a great variety of food that makes it easy for even the pickiest eaters to find a good meal.",
            "Every dorm here is all about the community. The resident assistants (or RA) make the halls a place to have fun, study, and make great life-long friends. Your floor becomes your family which is very comforting for people who come from out of state.",
            "Academically this school is right on check. They make scheduling classes and picking majors an easy and stress-free environment. Teachers are friendly and care about you and your grade which makes it an desirable learning experience.",
            "When looking for a school, make sure that not only the learning aspect is compatible but also the morals as well. The learning experience becomes much less stressful when your morals and values are not being tested and compromised.",
            "This school is amazing! Christian schools such as Spring Arbor take on the responsibility of taking a learning environment and making it a christian environment. Spring Arbor University does an excellent job balancing the two while creating a fun learning environment."

We always have an open salad and cereal (so when in doubt!). For those people that don't do gluten then there is always a gluten free option of the meal. The food is mostly always good. You will see the same meal every time throughout the semester but you will always get a surprise here or there. The dining is good (in Fall 2012 the new DC will be revealed). With the new DC there is going to be a lot of options of where to eat. What I find nice is that professor come and eat with us along with there families. It's always nice to see the theology department start a debate and students start crowding around.}",
