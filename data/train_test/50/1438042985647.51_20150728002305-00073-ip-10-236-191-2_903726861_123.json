            "I agree I am given the education and the knowledge equivalent to the dollar amount that I spent on my past courses, because with the motivation and drive to want to be successful I have noticed and big increase on where my life is headed just from attending this college. I went from working and a fast food shop to landing a job at an insurance company something I would have never been exposed to if I was not so active at my school.",
            "Valencia has plenty of opportunities and events that allow the student body to have fun and even help out the community. There are picnics, live bands, and fund raisers for causes such as breast cancer to cleft lips. I even had the chance to participate in a fundraiser to help victims of trafficking in April of 2011.",
            "I love the array of food choices. It works perfectly having class 3 days a week and being able to have a panini one day, chicken fingers and fries, the next, and even cheese danishes for a morning snack. I enjoy leaving from my morning class knowing I can look forward to an enjoyable lunch.",
            "Dorm life is what you make of it, I enjoy it for my personal time to sit aside either finish homework assignments or vision future career plans. The campus has plenty of places to seek any information you need from resources in the library to the answer center.",
            "Very strict. All teachers, and professors keep us focused on getting our education, and communicate with us very well their expectations of us.",
            "Study, study, study. Always be punctual for each and every class. Never taken education for granted it is the one thing no one can ever take away from you.",
            "Valencia is the perfect place for accomplishing goals and becoming successful. This school has helped me transition from high school to college and live a more adult structured lifestyle. I feel Valencia has also helped me jump start my future."
