            "the safety of this campus is really good. there are many phones all over the campus that will connect you to the campus police for escorts any time of the day. at night when you feel most vulnerable, this is very important whether you are walking to your car or to the dorm.",
            "in these bad economic times when everyone cares about the rising costs of everything, this campus is doing all it can to keep the educational costs down.",
            "there are weekend programs to let your hair down. there are themed activities as well games on the weekend. oh yeah, there can be found a party or two.",
            "the food is good and if you are bound and determined not to like it because it is not your mom's cooking there are a few fast-food chains in the student union and nearby so you won't starve :-).",
            "i am an off campus student, but from what i have heard dorm life is great!",
            "i believe that the rigor of the school is like any other school. it is hard enough that if you don't apply yourself, you will fail, but not so hard that every class sounds like greek. all the professors i have are interested in your learning by sharing their knowledge, instead of making you feel as if they are throwing you out in the deep and you sink or swim on your own.",
            "for your own success at csusb, involve yourself in all the resources that are availed to you. go to the professors office hours and all the study groups and you will find that you will excel in your courses.",
            "the motto of the school is if you go to csusb, you can go anywhere. though i am a new student here i believe that the preparation gotten here is top notch. the emphasises is placed on the success of the students."

My freshman year was amazing. I learned many things in class that I used outside of class. Professors take the time to answer questions students may have, and make convenient office hours for us. I know this school has a lot to offer to present and future students., 352783=California State University San Bernardino has great teaching staff, and very diverse student attendance. The ratio from boys to girls are 4:1. It's one of the safest campuses in the state of California., 267207=On a scale from 1-10 I would rate Cal State San Bernardino an 8 based off my recent experience of SOAR. At SOAR, which is an orientation for incoming freshman, the staff, students, and faculty made me feel welcome to their college and were filled with joy and enthusiasm to see the class of 2016. The students made sure we felt comfortable and had the best time at Cal State San Bernardino. Also this college is very diverse and mixed with all kinds of nationalities which makes meeting people even better., 576271=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 178411=Every year they have a walk against domestic violence in the month of May. It's not on campus but is near and is for a great cause!!}",

Tips for prospective students Be open minded on what other think and also be aware of the difrent view points people have. Bang for the buck Doming is chep and it is very low on cost compare to other cal states. Am enjoying being here Made many friends while I dormed here, plus you meet many people from diffrent backgrounds. Much of the campus is calm and quiet. Am learning a lot Most of the classes are very Informative and especially on the small clases. Made time for one on one conversations with the proffesor and instructor when I needed help.
