Usage Notes This is not an auto-commit SQL operation. CHECKIN Function doesn't have to take the same path name that was passed to CHECKOUT Procedure operation. However, the CHECKIN Function path name and the CHECKOUT Procedure path name must be of the same resource for the operations to function correctly. If the resource has been renamed, the new name must be used to CHECKIN Function because the old name is either invalid or is currently bound with a different resource. Exception is raised if the path name does not exist. If the path name has been changed, the new path name must be used to CHECKIN Function the resource. CHECKOUT Procedure This procedure checks out a VCR before updating or deleting it. Syntax",
