Jack F. | 03/03/2013 Read Full Review Beautiful Condo!! We stayed here and I don't normally write reviews, but I have to say that this condo is perfect. The decor, amenities, and everything were wonderful. Located on the second floor, it is perfectly situated to see the beautiful beach and ocean, while low enough to easily come down to the pool and beach. Great condo! --Message from Manager--",
