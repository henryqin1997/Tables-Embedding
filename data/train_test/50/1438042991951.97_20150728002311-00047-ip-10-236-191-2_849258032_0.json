An average of 1.83 runs/game.\u00a0The\u00a0team batting\u00a0average\u00a0is .199. What do you expect when a team of average (at best) bats faces some of the best pitchers in the league? Here are the opponents\u2019 starting pitchers for the Pirates\u2019 first twelve games.

    "textAfterTable": "Provided by Baseball-Reference.com: View Original Table Generated 4/11/2012. The Pirates face six of the ten starting pitchers to get votes as the best pitcher in the National League last year. When does it get easier? Matt Cain\u2018s one of the best pitchers in the league, Daniel Hudson has nasty stuff. Ian Kennedy broke out in a big way. Last year Ryan Vogelsong struck out 8 in 5.2 innings against the Pirates in the first start of his comeback year. The much-maligned Barry Zito threw a complete game shutout in Colorado in his\u00a0\u00a0last start. Joe Saunders threw seven shutout innings in his first start of the year. Seriously, the Pirates could easilty be looking at a 4-8 record when this stretch is over. If they want to be better, then: 1) Their own pitching needs to keep up the good work. Allowing\u00a0only 2.5 runs/game has kept the Pirates in every game so far. 2) The bats need to find a way to string some hits together. Also, take some more walks. You can be selective while still being\u00a0aggressive. Seven walks in six games is woeful. Let\u2019s hope they pick it up this weekend in San Francisco. The Pirates starters are slated to be James McDonald, Charlie Morton (season debut) and Kevin Correia. I\u2019ll see you Monday with the Weekend",
