Such a dry end 10 further allows the web 30 to be transferred from the TAD fabric 40 to the reel 70 without free draw. Minimal components forming the dry end 10 further provides a paper-making machine with a smaller footprint and also minimizes the necessary handling of the web 30. In addition, the configuration of the suction roll 90 with a separate mantle and one or more air devices disposed therein allows the mantle to be selectively segmented into variable suction and variable air emission zones, while enabling, for example, a common suction roll 90 having a diameter of about 1000 mm to about 1400 mm to be used, thereby conserving costs with respect to the machine. The described embodiments thus contribute to provide improved runability of the web 30 without free draw so as to provide an improved dry end 10 for a paper-making machine.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patentzitate Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. For example, the web-compressing device described in various embodiments of the present invention may be configured to form either a hard or a soft nip between the rolls comprising the device, wherein the rolls may be at ambient temperature or heated. For a soft nip web-compressing device, one of the rolls may have a cover comprised of a resilient material such as, for example, rubber. Further, a heated web-compressing device may be advantageous in achieving a more consistent thickness profile across the width of the web. In addition, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the present disclosure describes and otherwise supports methods associated with embodiments of the present invention such as, for instance, methods for making a tissue with enhanced tactile quality and facilitating reel-up of the tissue in a dry end of a tissue paper-making machine, as described and claimed herein. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not",
