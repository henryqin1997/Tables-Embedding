    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{5859=Constructed in 2008, Lucas Oil Stadium has distinguished itself as a versatile venue for sports events. The primary home of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts, the stadium can seat roughly 70,000. In addition to the general admission seating, there are 137 luxury suites of varying size that offers amenities expected of any high-end venue. The stadium's notable features include a mechanized retractable roof and a large windowed gate at the north end of the stadium. When both are opened, it can give the stadium an open air feel that few indoor stadiums can replicate. While the Colts are the primary tenant, the stadium regularly holds other types of events. From high school championship games, concerts, national band competitions, to the annual Ben Ten Football Champion game, other tenants besides the Colts extensively use the stadium grounds. The stadium's quality is evident in that it has been used in a number of high profile events. Luca Oil Stadium hosted Super Bowl XLVI in 2012 and received high marks as a host. The stadium was also a unique venue for the 2010 NCAA Men's Basketball Final Four, doing such a good job that the same event will be returning in 2015, with the woman's version coming in 2016. Conveniently located in downtown Indianapolis, the stadium is a great location to many other areas of the city, in addition to offering a spectacular view of the city skyline from the north end. Still one of the most advanced buildings of its kind, Lucas Oil Stadium can be counted on for a great experience., 2561=LL Cool J Tour 2013 Concert Tickets Concerts Videos LL Cool J Tour 2013 LL Cool J (fun fact: that's short for Ladies Love Cool James) continues his two-decade long career of smooth crooning, as he and crew set off on a \"Kings of the Mic Tour.\" There was a mini-preview of what's to come\u2026}",
