Onto the 8th.Dave, even major league pitchers make \"mistake\" pitches every now and then. In this case, it's anything not right down the middle on the first pitch to Werth.SO I actually did some digging and found an article that lays it out pretty well. If my quick scan got the info correctly, Werth is third from the bottom in the majors at swinging at first pitch fastballs (11.3%). If it's in the strike zone, he's next to last (17.9%). Ouside the zone, he's fourth from bottom (3.3%) \u2013 I guess that's good, at least.But get this \u2013 the article is from 2009. January of 2009. Two full seasons before Rizzo signed him. You can read it here.While I did that, the Nats went 1-2-3 in the 8th and Marquis gave up a leadoff single to Bourn, who was bunted over to second. You may now start asking to trade for him again., 201165=By the way, 224 comments for a fairly meaningless game in July. Tell me the Washington Nationals and Nationals Insider are not taking off!!!Go Nats!!, 206787=Marquis is making $7.5 mil this year. He's not even a class B free agent, so if/when he leaves at the end of this season, we get nothing in return. So, of course, everyone is eager to trade him, assuming he would ask for a 3-4 year deal which from us he will not get. However, he's said likes it here. I bet he would not mind being in a rotation with Strass and JZimm'nn, heading up. I say, Rizz, offer him 2 years. He might take it, you never know. People, there is nothing you, me, or the lamppost can do about Werth, and all the complaining in the world won't solve him. We (fans) moaned about GasCanrahan and Nyjer, and look where they are now. (OK, I didn't moan about Nyjer). Every team has someone not holding up their end, believe me, just look at their boards. Thanks, folks, for remembering Nook Logan and his being caught off third to end a game? It could be worse. This could be 2009. I say, just ignore Werth til things get better for him and in the meantime, we are the designated .500 team for MLB, so \u2014 savor it!!, 13275=Michael Bourn would be a great long-term center fielder for the Nationals. Since 2009, he's average .279 with a .350 on-base percentage and 60 steals. He's also won two straight Gold Gloves. The Astros need young players and Bourn, now 28, won't be around when the Astros again become competitive. And there is no question he's on the trade block.What would he cost? That's an interesting question. The Nationals seem willing to part with one of Drew Storen/Tyler Clippard but back-of-the-bullpen pitchers are the last thing a 100-loss team needs. It would probably take one of our young minor league starters, say Tom Milone or Brad Peacock, Derek Norris (who is now totally dispensable), a low-level prospect and either Tyler Moore or Bill Rhinehart. But they would also need a replacement in center, say Roger Bernadina.Bernadina, Milone and Derek Norris (plus one low-level prospect) for Bourn.I'd go for that kind of trade. Would you?, 12397=In 2010 (his rookie year) Ian Desmond hit .269. At the moment he has dropped to .226.Werth's career average is.265. He is currently hitting .213.Should Ian get a 7 year $126 million contract too?(Stats from Baseball-Reference.com), 48184=I am not sure why people keep panning the Willingham trade. Allstar Tyler Clippard \u2013 .6 WAR, HRod \u2013 .5 WAR (in less innings). Granted, he is still learning to command his stuff, and I would go with Clip right now in a tight situation, but they are not as far apart as it might seem. Plus, he has absolutely sick stuff, and 5 years of control left.As for CF, they really ought to go after Denard Span. Top 3 defensive CF and under control through 2015, I think. Bourjos is a little better defensively, but not as good a hitter. And I checked, the Twins have something like 1,200 OF prospects so he should be available if the right offer is made. They need a SS, and would probably be attracted to a package built around Desi. I like Desi, but CF is a black hole organizationally and you have to make that swap if you can get it.I don't see how you get a SS back, though. I mean, its kind of the point behind Desi having value, isn't it?, 1976=NATIONALS at ASTROS Where: Minute Maid Park Gametime: 8:05 p.m. TV: MASN2 Radio: WJFK (106.7 FM), WFED (1500 AM), XM 185 Weather: Partly cloudy, 89 degrees, Wind 9 mph out to LF, 101596=Exposremains said\u2026 and once again a guy that never wins for houston looks like Cy Young July 18, 2011 9:32 PM __________________________Time to pinch hit for Werth. How bad does he look?, 26050=Fixing Matt Stairs is not a big issue for this club, the guy is headed out to pasture. I think that they should not make a move for Bourn unless they can steal him, as the guy is kncoking on 30 (mid-season next year) and is not under control beyond next year. They can land a guy in FA that has good CF skills for 2012 \u2014 DeJesus, Patterson, Sizemore, Crisp \u2014 or try to work a deal for either a younger and/or higher up-side guy. Sending away a great arm under control for years to come in return for a year of Michael Bourn at something like $6M seems like a waste to me. dfh21, 47208=Farid, oh ok. I believed Josh didn't fit in due to the fact you couldn't count on him for 150 games a year. Josh was great April to June 15th last year and his numbers this year are good considering he missed over 20 games so far. On 162 games he projects at over 100 RBIs.Nix was a pleasant surprise and hope we get some more of what he did in May 2011., 239175=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 155303=Sec 3, My Sofa said\u2026 Why would he be sliding? He was standing on third when the ball got there. July 18, 2011 10:29 PM Really, the play was behind him and he went in standing up and his momentum almost took him off the bag., 59807=8:05, you missed the point, clean whiff.WERTH. Werth should be regressing (that is, returning, in the statistical sense) back to his career norms, but I don't hear a lot of that around here.We now return to the game. Thanks., 1655=The Astros send rookie Jordan Lyles (a promising right-hander) to the mound for his ninth career start. Lyles, a first-round pick in 2008, is still in search of his first big-league win., 226961=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern. You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 213692=Drew, you're right that it's not a hobby for Zuckerman. I can only speak for myself, but I (selfishly) just wish his job included fewer days off. I sort of feel like I need an emergency backup beat writer for when CSN won't spring for a ticket.For that matter, I also wish he hadn't been pulled off the Nats beat to write about hockey back in April. Sure, I got to save my buck-fifty this year, but life is about tradeoffs. I have my own thoughts on whether this one was worth it. (And our intrepid blogger doubtless has his own thoughts, I wish him well, he doesn't need to ask me before taking a job, etc., etc., no purchase necessary, void where prohibited.), 58471=Desmond may be playing himself into oblivion. The kid has looked much better of late, so maybe he's getting it together. But at this point, he is a long shot to be a quality every day SS in the bigs. Iffy glove, lousy bat, not very young.The Nats will have a shot at a bunch of mid-30's guys on one year deals in 2012, guys who can make the plays and hit around .250 if nothing else \u2014 or they could throw a bunch of money at Jose Reyes or at Jimmy Rollins to keep that over-pay for FA Phillies thing going, if they want to. There is no need to keep middle infield dpeth at this point. So, if they can move Demsond for something else they need, then they should be considering it. dfh21, 53389=Sec 3 (and whoever else that cares): Regarding the minor-league depth in the MI positions, consider this (numbers as of 07/17/11, via baseball-reference.com)\u2026 2B- (top 5)Espinosa, D (WSH, 24yo); 95GP, 392PA, .248/.336/.472 slash, .984FPct, 12SB. Lombardozzi, S (SYR-HAR, 22yo); 90GP, 409PA, .324/.368/.460 slash, 1.000FPct, 21SB. Antonelli, M (SYR-HAR, 26yo); 54GP, 228PA, .310/.388/.447 slash, .964FPct, 3SB.

SS \u2013 (top 5) Desmond, I (WSH, 25yo); 88GP, 361PA, .226/.269/.311 slash, .969FPct, 20SB. Bynum, S (SYR-AUB, 30yo); 47GP, 183PA, .265/.328/.434 slash, .958FPct, 7SB. McConnell, C (SYR-HAR, 25yo); 81GP, 272PA, .185/.253/.263 slash, .968FPct, 5SB. Soriano, F (GCL-POT, 24yo); 47GP, 172PA, .225/.351/.399 slash, .931FPct, 5SB. Hague, R (POT, 22yo); 4GP \u2013 Injured shoulder on slide into 2B, April, 2011 \u2013 out for 2011., 190264=And while we're on the subject: this is cold, but funny.Get an Ice Cold 16oz Pabst Blue Ribbon for Werth's Batting averagewww.duffysdc.com Duffy's is in DC, close to the 9:30 club. Some of you already know the joint.Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Duffys-Irish-Pub/98935539585, 28746=I too think the middle-infield depth is good enough to trade Desmond. Espinosa could be a near Gold Glove shortstop with a .250-25-90, 25 steal offense. Stephen Lombardozzi has, in four minor league seasons, averaged .301/.372/.439 with 20 steals. His defense is phenomenal. In 89 games this year, he has made just two errors.Wilson Ramos, Lombardozzi, Espinosa and Bourn make a solid up-the-middle defensive team with potentially explosive offense (I think Ramos will be a .275-22-75 hitter very soon). Yes, I know Bourn can walk in two years, but he's the type of guy worth a big contract. And I think a lot of these guys would love to play with Stephen Strasburg, Bryce Harper and (I pray every day) Matt Purke.I live in Idaho and saw Purke pitch against BYU. The guy is lights-out when he's healthy., 23096=JD said\u2026 Farid,I wouldn't go near that trade. Firstly; Norris is having an off year but is still considered a prospect and at a prime position (not dispensable), Milone may very well turn out to be your no. 4 starter for years and Bernadina while not spectacular is not that far away from Bourn to merit that sort of trade.Not to mention the salary you would be adding.I would do: Meyers, Uery Perez and Destin Hood for Bourn. July 18, 2011 6:03 PM ___________________________I agree with JD. Bourn is a 1 year rental. He is a Free Agent after 2012 so unless you get him extended beforehand, forget giving up much.Also his .277 batting average with a .344 OBP away from Houston shows what it is like not hitting in a very hitter friendly park like Minute Maid and has to be part of the methodology in analyzing whether he makes a lot of sense.Bernadina is not far from Bourn's numbers on the batting average when you compare Bernie to Bourn's road numbers. The bigger issue this team has is fixing Werth, Stairs and Burnett. Take care of that before trying to go in the wrong direction., 74803=Sec3 \u2014 I may be selling Desmond short but he is making it easy for me to think that he's not gonna make it, and there are guys out there who can play that the club can grab for 2012 and beyond. Desmond has never fielded his position well at any level. His range and arm are overrated as he does not make the plays he should make when the ball is hit right to him (how he can have great range and a lousy fileding percentage is a problem). Ichiro would likely have some great range there too, but there are reasons he does not play SS. Desmond had moments of greatness in 2009, followed by a nice, yet not spectacular, year at the plate 2010. Over his career at all levels he runs out there at less than a .700 OPS \u2014 he has never dominated \u2014 and he's gonna be 26 this fall. All those K's with no power. And in my eyes at least, when the game is on the line, he looks lost in the field and he swings 3-0 late in the game when the club needs a base runner and such. He is a very nice athlete, but the jury is still out in my mind as to whether the guy can play every day in the bigs. He does not hit enough to justify the iffy glove and he's had a lot of opportunity to get it all together at this point and he has never really been able to do it all at once, ever. So, maybe I'd be wrong to let the guy go, but if Desmond was getting it done, then I would not be thinking that the club should consider selling the guy.dfh21, 36738=Rendon doesn't count.Really?Jim Callis of Baseball America said this on July 11:\"Rendon, whom I believe is the best player in the draft, is a comparable hitter to Lawrie and a better defender at third base (though he'll probably have to move because the Nationals already have Ryan Zimmerman).\"Hmmmm. Let's see. Where might Rendon move?, 35875=Regarding Josh Willingham's trade, he's hitting .244-12-46 for Oakland (vs. Laynce Nix @ .274-12-33). Corey Brown wasn't the player I thought he was, but in essence they god Nix and H-Rod for Josh, who will be a free agent after this season., 43443=hope the punters go for it, but it is what it is. July 18, 2011 6:50 PM Farid Rushdi said\u2026 Regarding Josh Willingham's trade, he's hitting .244-12-46 for Oakland (vs. Laynce Nix @ .274-12-33). Corey Brown wasn't the player I thought he was, but in essence they god Nix and H-Rod for Josh, who will be a free agent after this season. July 18, 2011 6:51 PM_________________________Sorry, Farid, the trade was Corey Brown and HenRod for Willingham not Nix and HenRod for Willingham. Can't inter-change pieces like that., 34863=Farid, I think/hope Werth is having Cristian Guzman's 2005 season, and will eventually settle down, but his 2011 is already toast. In cooking, there are a lot of mistakes a clever cook can fix, but once something is burnt, there's no saving it. Give it a fancy French name and call it Blackened Cajun Whatever and hope the punters go for it, but it is what it is., 199422=The only criticism I have heard about Lombardozzi is that he does not have a decent arm to play SS or 3rd so he can't fill the utility role. I am guessing they will sign Rendon at the deadline (wish it were sooner) and if he is as good as people say we would have great depth along with Antonelli who has actually put up numbers as good as Lombardozzi and can play 3 positions. Seems to me you try and move one of the two minor leaguers now in some sort of package, then let Rendon show us what he can do in Arizona and spring training and only then do you think about moving Danny to SS. I do see that Desmond is not hitting but again, leave them alone for the rest of this year, not so Danny can win ROY but because you just don't want to make two switches this late in the season. These guys know their pitchers, they know where to line up for different hitters, they make the double play, they know who is the cutoff man, etc. I am not saying the new guys won't, its just silly to change now when we are having the best season since 2005. Just my opinion and I will stick with it as I play in traffic with no brain., 187085=sjm308 said\u2026 Gonat: has everyone forgotten that Todd Coffey was and has pitched pretty well the last few weeks but for some reason he has not thrown in four games? Detwiler was also fresh but Coffey would have been my choice. Agreed that everyone else was used up yesterday but what is the deal with Coffey??Zimmnn will only go 6 or 7 tomorrow but hopefully we will have a nice lead and Davey can mix and match since everyone should be available. July 18, 2011 11:06 PM____________________________Someone said that Coffey was banged up so something is up with that. I see your other comment that Davey said he was available., 88094=anon 8:05: Livo is 2nd on the staff with 11 quality starts in 20 chances, and about in-line with his 2010 results. That's 2nd to JZimm (14/18) this year, and ahead of everybody else on staff to date. If you look at IP/GS/QS for all starters, the rank is 1-JZimm (6.39, 18GS/115IP, 14QS), 2-Livo (6.27, 20GS/125.3IP, 11QS), 3-Marquis (5.93, 18GS/106.7IP, 9QS), 4-Lannan (5.72, 20GS, 9QS), 5-Gorzellany (5.69, 14GS/79.7IP, 6QS), NR-Detwiler (5.33, 1GS/5.33IP, 0QS), NR-Maya (4.92, 4GS/19.67IP, 1QS). If DJ is looking for a pitcher to move into a LR/6th starter role alongside Detwiler, either Maya or Stammen could fit the bill. It would just be a question of who moves off the 25-man roster to make room., 62306=anon 8:02: Bixler has picked up so much bench time since his promotion that his 2011 numbers are worth about as much as Hague's numbers w/POT. Maybe he'll replace Bynum or Hulett on the SYR roster, but he doesn't project strength at a MI position, imo., 33502=Regarding Worth, I was worried that he would hit .270-20-80 and the baseball world would mock the Nationals for paying him that crazy contract.I'd give almost anything to see him finish around those numbers now.I do think, though, that he'll have a hot second half and end up around .255-23-70 give or take. And his defense returns, that's good enough. If he can average .280-20-80 for the next three years, then I can live with whatever he produces in his late 30's.But what I'm really curious about is what the team will do at first next year. If LaRoche is healthy, his career numbers promise a .260-22-80 or so year with excellent defense. Put Morse back in left for a year and that's a pretty good tandem.}",
