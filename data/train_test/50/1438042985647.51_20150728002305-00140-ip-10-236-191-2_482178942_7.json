Also in the receiver of block 1973, components M1/M2 and M4/M5 comprise a two-stage amplifier biased by components M6/M7. The output 1981 of the receiver of block 1973, which output represents an un-demodulated 100 kHz carrier signal, is filtered using a single pole at 10 kHz (low pass) filter to produce a demodulated signal 1983 (i.e., a demodulation of the 100 kHz PWM transmission signal).}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{115226=The coupling from the transmit inductor 2107 to a physically separated receive inductor 2109 may selectively be weak. The coupling is dependent on the respective inductors' dimensions, their individual inductances, and very strongly on their separation distance. Empirically it has been found that the voltage input to voltage output coupling ratio is proportional to the core length of each inductor, roughly to the square root of the ratio of their core diameters, to the square root of the ratio of their inductances, and proportional roughly to the 2.75th power of their separation distance (at least for inductors of the approximate size and construction, and operated under the moderately separated distances and moderate frequencies studied). This can be expressed by the following empirical formula for inductors positioned end-to-end, where the dimensions are in millimeters and the result in decibels:, 121057=For inductors positioned side-to-side, the coupling is 6 dB less. At other orientations, coupling is variable, but can be at a null when the receive inductor 2109 core is aligned perpendicularly to the lines of flux of the transmitting inductor. For the PWM transmit and receive inductors 2107 and 2109, respectively, described more completely below, the loss given by the formula is predicted to be 25 dB at a 1 cm center-to-center spacing and 63 dB for a 5 cm spacing. The loss is greater for other relative orientations., 122334=A 0.1 uF coupling capacitor 2111 forms a high-pass filter with the transmit inductor 2107, rolling off the voltage applied to the transmit inductor 2107 at 12 dB/octave below 16 kHz. The frequency is chosen to be high enough to allow large attenuation of the baseband audio frequency content while being low enough to preserve the waveform shape of the rectangular signal applied to the transmit inductor 2107. The audio frequency components of the spectrum may be attenuated to avoid the large currents that would otherwise flow into the transmit inductor 2107, which has been sized for proper transmission of the much higher frequency carrier. The resulting rectangular voltage waveform which is applied to the transmit inductor 2107 changes its peak positive and negative levels under modulation along with its mark/space ratio such as to maintain a near zero average voltage level., 127971=For a 1.3 volt short range transmitter, low-loss 3 mH inductors wound on the cores previously described for the PWM transmitter may be used. These will have in-circuit resonances of 500 kHz, resulting in 1 usec pulses of approximately 13 volt peak amplitude, depending on battery voltage. Each of the inductors 2215 and 2217 can achieve peak currents of about 1.7 mA, yet the average battery drain of both inductor circuits, with efficient switches, is about 400 uA (exclusive of input and PWM circuitry)., 101688=More specifically, for example, if the transmission detector 1623 determines from the detector input signal 1629 that the input signal 1627 represents a desired transmission (e.g., a signal above a certain threshold value), the detector 1623 indicates to the electronic switch 1625, using control signal 1633, that a signal is present. The electronic switch 1625 in turn selects audio output 1631 (representative of the input signal 1627 from the secondary audio source) and provides the audio output 1631 as signal 1635 to hearing aid or other type of circuitry (not shown)., 110365=In the modulation/transmission block 2007, the modified signal from the gain block modulates a carrier of typically 100 kHz by some means for application to a transmitting inductor or other type of antenna. The transmitting inductor responsively generates a corresponding changing magnetic flux field. A reception/limiting block 2009 includes a receiving inductor some distance away from the transmitting inductor, which responds to the flux field at an attenuated level. The electrical signal produced by the receiving inductor is amplified by an amplifier sufficiently such that the amplifier output signal is limited (clipped) under normal operating conditions, and, thus, constant amplifier output signal level is maintained. The signal at this point is largely free of interfering noises, since the noises are attenuated greatly by the limiting action., 104355=If, on the other hand, the electronic switch 1743 does not receive the control signal 1747 from the receiver 1741, then the electronic switch selects audio output signal 1753 from the primary audio source (e.g., a hearing aid microphone), and provides the audio output signal 1753 as signal 1751 to the hearing aid circuitry (not shown)., 112814=A selector/combiner block 2015 receives the demodulated, filtered, inductively-coupled signal and a hearing aid microphone signal 2017. At rest (meaning that no high quality inductively coupled signal is being received), the selector/combiner block 2015 passes the hearing aid microphone signal through unchanged to the remainder of the hearing aid circuitry (see, output 2019), while blocking any received signal. When the signal sense block 2011 determines that a sufficiently high quality signal is being received, it causes the selector/combiner block 2015 to pass this signal through to the hearing aid circuitry. The hearing aid microphone signal may be attenuated to reduce interfering environmental sounds for the user. This attenuation could be total, but will most often be more useful if the attenuation is limited to about 15 dB or so. This allows an acoustic room presence to be maintained when the coupled signal does not contain this information (as would an eyeglass-mounted highly directional microphone, for example). When selected, the coupled signal will normally still dominate over the hearing aid microphone signal, irrespective of the nature or source of the signal., 111269=The reception/limiting block 2009 may or may not need to incorporate additional signal demodulation, depending on the modulation method employed, as will be seen in the descriptions of the following figures., 124421=The receive inductor 2109 voltage may be amplified approximately 70 dB, for example, by a multistage amplifier 2113 having a sufficiently wide bandwidth so as not to significantly degrade its input signal. (Some bandwidth tradeoff is possible between the amplifier and the inductor circuit: i.e., widening the inductor circuit bandwidth or increasing the Q slightly to allow some effective reductions in each of these by the amplifier.) The amplifier 2113 is designed such as to not exhibit behavioral problems over a very wide range of input signal levels, corresponding to differing transmit-receive inductor spacings and orientations. The amplifier 2113 is also designed to cleanly and stablely limit the output signal to consistent high and low levels. The high and low levels may be separated by two Shottky or PN junction diode drops. The amplifier 2113 will be in a limiting condition whenever the received signal is usable. By restoring consistent high and low levels to the PWM signal, the baseband audio frequency content is also restored. This can be considered a form of demodulation, in that only filtering to remove the (now unwanted) carrier signal is needed to restore the original audio frequency range signal., 134852=A receive inductor 2311 may be of a much higher value than with the other modulation approaches, which allows a significant increase in sensitivity. A 100 mH inductor wound on the steel bobbin previously described can have a 99 kHz resonance using a total circuit+inductor capacitor 2313 having a capacitance of 26 pF, for example. In conjunction with a resistor 2315 having 340 kOhm of total equivalent and actual parallel loading resistance, for example, a Q of just over 5 results. The combination of high inductor value and under-damped response allows a very high effective sensitivity. A limiting amplifier 2317 that follows can have significantly less gain than the previous systems. The limited amplifier output signal contains no base-band audio content and must be demodulated by a block 2319 using any of the known FM demodulation methods., 112197=The deemphasis/lowpass filter block 2013 employs a lowpass filter to substantially remove components of the high frequency carrier before application to the hearing aid circuitry, without substantially affecting the desired audio frequency signals. This filtering block may also provide some high frequency deemphasis (rolloff) to compensate for the initial transmitter preemphasis and restore a flat overall audio frequency range response. Such emphasis/deemphasis action reduces the higher frequency noise within the audio frequency range in the received, demodulated signal., 111516=The reception/limiting block 2009 feeds both a signal sense block 2011 and a deemphasis/lowpass filter block 2013. The signal sense block 2011 determines if there is a received signal of sufficient quality to enable passing the demodulated signal on to the hearing aid circuitry. The signal sense block 2011 will typically make the decision based on whether the output signal oft he previous block (i.e., block 2009) is firmly in limiting. It could also, for example, respond directly to received signal strength, respond to the level of demodulated ultrasonic noise, or could operate in some other manner., 123294=The receive inductor 2109 may have a value of about 10 mH at frequencies in the 100 kHz range and be wound on a steel bobbin of overall length 5.5 mm and bobbin diameter 0.6 mm. Receive inductor 2109 configured as such would have an equivalent parallel capacitance of about 9 pF. Together with other stray circuit capacitance, this will result in receive inductor 2109 input circuit with a resonance of about 500 kHz. The received PWM voltage waveform will have harmonics above this frequency rolled off, or equivalently, have its leading edges rounded. Sufficient parallel circuit loading may be added (typically about 50 kOhms) so that, in conjunction with the inductor core losses, the input circuit Q is about 0.7. This choice allows the sharpest leading edge transitions to be received to maintain sensitivity to narrow pulses, while minimizing overshoot and ringing. The overall receive inductor 2109 input circuit frequency response enables adequate waveform fidelity for pulse detection over a full range of transmitted mark/space ratios from 50/50 to 90/10., 108346=The switch in block 1977 is comprised of components M10, M11, M12, M17, M18 and M19. When the carrier frequency as determined at output 1985 is greater than 50 kHz, the switch selects signal 1983, representing the audio output of the receiver (from the secondary audio source). When the carrier frequency as determined at output 1985 is not greater than 50 kHz, the switch selects signal 1987, representing the output of the primary audio source. In either case, the selected signal is connected to output 1989, the output of the electronic switch, which in turn is connected to hearing aid circuitry., 103921=If the electronic switch 1743 receives the control signal 1747 from the receiver 1741, the electronic switch selects receiver output signal 1749, which is an audio output signal representative of input signal 1745 from the secondary audio source (not shown), and provides receiver output signal 1749 as signal 1751 to hearing aid circuitry (not shown)., 102373=If, on the other hand, the transmission detector 1623 determines from the detector input signal 1629 that the input signal 1629 is not representative of a desired signal (e.g., below a certain threshold value), the detector 1623 indicates to the electronic switch 1625, again using control signal 1633, that no signal is present. The switch then instead selects audio output signal 1637 from the primary audio source (e.g., a hearing aid microphone), and provides the audio output signal 1637 as signal 1635 to the hearing aid or other type of circuitry (not shown)., 39359=This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser.
