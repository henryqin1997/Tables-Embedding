Plenty of events such as concerts with Kendrick Lamar and Far East Movement awhile back. Everyone there is friendly or most of them are at least!, 90477=University of Massachusetts Boston is an excellent diverse campus. It's a great area to live in.

Food and Dining the caf has a lot of options and since there is no dorms the grocery store is right down the road in walking distance of the t and the apartments. Dorm Life their are no dorms but the apartments are right next door and they are really nice apartments. they are also in walking distance of the t. Academic Rigor personally i am in the college of liberal arts so my classes are not too rigorous. a lot of my friends are in the college of math and sciences though and they feel like the work while there being a lot of it they don't feel to overwhelmed. Tips for prospective students apply for scholarships even if you don't think you need it, every cent helps. this school doesn't have dorms so the school helps in finding roommates for the apartment complex next door but sometimes that doesn't always work, i'd suggest to meet people at new-student day and room",
