            "CSO's are UCSB's campus police. They patrol UCSB 24/7 to ensure the safety of students. Not only are they there, but we also have our own police station in our college town community. It gets even better because we have our own fire department station as well, located behind campus.",
            "UCSB has so much to offer! By The Arbor, there are always people out on tables and stands from different clubs and organizations. They have information out for people about themselves and constantly give away free items.",
            "If you work hard and play hard, UCSB is for you! The academics might be difficult, but life is so rewarding when you are a Gaucho. If you are outgoing, you are going to love all the friendly people in the Isla Vista community. If you are studious and are considering being an engineer, UCSB might want to be your pick. Its College of Engineering is ranked up high amongst MIT. If you are just a student looking for a vacation, there is no doubt that you will love UCSB and being able to live on the beach.",
            "UCSB has their traditional undie run every Wednesday during finals week. However, they do not do much running. They usually just run around during the library. Campus Point is one of the best known places at UCSB by the students. It's at the peak of the cliffs by the beach, just behind all the residential buildings. It's perfect for watching people surfer down below or enjoying the sight of the stars at night while listening to the waves crash.",
            "One of the perks of going to school at UCSB is having Isla Vista. Isla Vista is the the college town community for Gauchos. Friends constantly get together at each other's houses or gather around to play some games at the various parks around IV. The best thing Isla Vista has to offer is the beach; it surrounds the entire community. You can visit for some surfing, tanning, simply to enjoy the view, or whatever else meets the eye.",
            "Prospective students must know that UCSB is a large campus and therefore, the majority of students use a bike to get around campus. The bike routes are great, but you might get lost if you do not know the campus and routes all too well. You also need to take traffic and speedy bikers into consideration if you do not want to be late or get injured.",
            "This university is amazing; the campus is beautiful and the instructors are great. Instructors are really well informed and enthusiastic about the material they teach. The campus is always clean since it is constantly taken care of by active students. The courses might be hard, but they are not anything a lot of studying cannot defeat!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40863=There are four different dining commons at UCSB and each has its own specialty. De La Guerra (DLG) specializes in Mexican food, Ortega always has sushi at lunch and dinner, Carillo's specialty is Mongolian barbeque and Portola always has different types of bars (chili bar, burger bar). There are also always vegetarian and vegan options at every meal. Ortega provides take-out sack breakfasts or lunches for students who don't have time to sit down to a full meal in between classes (or if you want to have lunch on the beach after class with friends!). DLG also has late-night dining from 9pm to midnight on weeknights and serves everything that is not very healthy for you like burgers and fries (but that's all you really want at 9 o'clock at night anyway!). It's fun to take a break from cramming for finals to grab a bite to eat. The dining commons post their menus for the week online, which is nice because you can check which dining commons has the best food for that evening. Also, if you have certain allergies (nuts, gluten, milk, etc) or a food lifestyle (vegan or vegetarian) there is an online program where you can see what options fit your needs at each dining commons for that meal. All dining commons have a salad bar, fruit, breads, cereals, stuff to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and pizza. The quality of the food is actually quite good! I was expecting average cafeteria-style food and was pleasantly surprised with how good the food is. As far as meal plans go, students have several options. If you live on campus you are required to have a meal plan. Students can choose from have 10 meals per week, 14 meals per week, 17 meals per week or unlimited meals per week. I would recommend 14 meals per week because it keeps you covered by the dining commons meals, but is flexible enough that you can go out to eat with friends if you want. By meals these are meals you are allowed to use in the campus dining commons. You also have the option of adding $300, $600 or $900 to your ID card to use at the other campus dining locations such as Subway, Panda Express, Wahoo's Fish Tacos, Woodstock's, Root 217, Nicoletti's Coffee, and Jamba Juice. If you do not live on campus, you can get a meal plan if you wish (5 or 10 meals per week). The only thing I don't like about the dining at UCSB is that your leftover meals don't rollover and guest meals are not included in your plan-- you have to pay those separately. Other than that, dining is superb., 650979=Super beautiful school! Definitely hoping to attend UCSB in the fall of 2013 and become a Gaucho!, 568392=The university's average SAT score was 1923 and their average GPA was 4.07. UC Santa Barbara puts a strong emphasis on research, which may potentially allow a student to earn class credit or even money (in the form of grants, scholarships, or an assistant's pay)., 556116=I recently got my classes for Fall 2012, and I can say that I got all of the classes I wanted. It would be harder to do this at a community college., 563653=The average GPA of incoming students is about 3.9 and the average SAT score is 1900. So be prepared to endure that rigor!, 1140323=Duh,the beach. There`s also bowling,drive-in theater,butterflies that visit in February,hiking,social life in IV, and other great things., 896807=The Undie Run: happens once a quarter during finals week. Students donate their clothing and then run the campus in their undies! Beginning of the year and end of the year concerts: sponsored by the university students do not have to pay!! We've had Drake, Snoop Dog, Kendrick Lamar, Dada Life and more, 137167=If you are definitely coming to UCSB then my number one tip would be to attend the Freshman Summer Start Program (FSSP). It's the summer before you freshman year and it's basically summer school. If you're saying to yourself Ptch, yeah right. Why would I take summer school before I'm even in college? I'll just say it again... SIGN UP! I didn't do it and it's a huge regret of mine. It will make your life so much easier. Honestly no matter where you go I'm sure they have programs like this. I come from a really small town and I think I only came in with 8.0 units (the equivalent of two classes). There are kids coming in who are already sophomores because of all the AP classes they took in high school. And summer school is something you should do every year. First of all, it's insanely fun to be in Isla Vista over the summer. And second of all spreading your units over a few extra quarters will make your life immensely easier. It is almost a must if you're going to study abroad and is also essential if you're thinking about graduating early. Summer sessions are either six or three weeks long depending on which ones you choose and you take one or two classes. Classes over summer are WAY easier than they are during the regular school year. Have to take Chemistry or Biology? Finish it in six weeks instead of ten, it'll be easier, and you'll be able to have fun during the regular school year. Speaking of studying abroad, do it. I'm leaving for Thailand in August and I can't wait. I recommend doing it your Junior year which I would have done, except that I didn't do summer school so I had to finish enough units. Out of everyone I know who's graduated already, if any of them say they have regrets it's always that they didn't study abroad. Also, there is NOTHING WRONG with going to a community college for the first two years then transferring as a junior. Seriously. No matter where you go. You save so much money and General Ed classes are the same everywhere. If I had a chance to do it over again I would do that instead.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This school is perfect for students who want a balance of academics and a social life. There is state street just a bus or car ride away, with tons of restaurants and shopping to entertain any college student. There's also Isla Vista, with cheap, open late restaurants and plenty of places to experience college nightlife. UCSB is for students who are friendly, fun, and self-motivated. Living in such a beautiful place also means that there are many distractions to schoolwork, but if you can stay focused and maintain that balance between work and play, your experience at UCSB will be unrivaled by any other college. Tips for prospective students I highly suggest visiting the campus before making a final decision. Honestly, I was barely considering attending UCSB, but decided to visit the school just to make sure I could cross it off my list. After spending one day on the campus and talking to current students, I was completely infatuated with the school and very confident that UCSB was the place for me. Also, I recommend that all students opt to stay in the dorms for Freshman year. It is really the best way to meet people and start acclimating to college life. Bang for the buck This",
