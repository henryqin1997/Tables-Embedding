Each team has one of the top players in the country, and Benedictine attempts to avenge the 71-58 loss they suffered to Steve Smith's Warriors from a season ago.

The two power programs will square off on Wednesday, December 19th in the highly anticipated Dallas Dunkfest.

A 2007 Parade All-American that is ranked as the nation's top player according to ESPN, Jennings comes in with monster averages of 40.5 points, 9.6 assists and 6.8 steals per game. In my opinion, he's a future NBA player to join a long line of former Oak Hill Academy standouts to reach the pros. That list includes the likes of Denver Nuggets All-Star Carmelo Anthony, Seattle Sonics Rookie of the Year candidate Kevin Durant, Jerry Stackhouse, Ron Mercer, Marcus Williams, Josh Smith, Stephen Jackson, Jeff McInnis, Steve Blake, DeSagana Diop and Rajon Rondo.

A commit to Roy Williams and the University of North Carolina Tar Heels, Davis has excellent bloodlines. His father, Terry Davis, played in the NBA, spending ten seasons in the league. The five-star recruit is the 20th overall rated player in the country by Rivals.com, proving to be dominant over the summer and spring while playing for Boo Williams' 17&U AAU travel team. Cadets Head Coach Sean McAloon and company will need to figure out a way to slow down a lethal Oak Hill attack that is averaging over 95 points per game entering the Warriors' game on Thursday. Against Booker T. Washington last week, Jennings poured in 45 points in his team's 96-61 rout, prompting Bookers Head Coach Darren Sanderlin to describe him as \"incredibly poised.\" The talented",
