The E&S, amongst others, say that Ashworth met with the 60 year old Italian last week as the club work through a shortlist of those best suited to replace Roy Hodgson. It's also suggested that Ranieri, via his agent, made the first move to get in touch. They say the club are hopeful of having a new appointment before the end of May, but that there are other interviews lined up as the Baggies assess our options. Other expected candidates include Chris Hughton who was interviewed prior to Roy's appointment, and having impressed back then, depending how his future looks with Birmingham, it's suggested he will be a strong frontrunner if he becomes an option. Alan Curbishley is also being touted as being in the frame for the short list.
