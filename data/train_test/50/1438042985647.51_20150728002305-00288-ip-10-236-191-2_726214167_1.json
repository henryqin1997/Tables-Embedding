    "textAfterTable": "In depth Verdict GABRIAL'S KING is proving a real Polytrack specialist and appears particularly effective around here. He won over 2m at Kempton last month and, only 3lb higher today, is the one to beat in this with his weight-for-age allowance. Fourth Generation is another recent Kempton winner with solid claims and will make life tough for the selection but Woolfall Treasure always seems to find at least one too good on the Flat and over hurdles while Zakatal and Adiynara are possibly better over jumps. Activate was only third in a seller here earlier in the week and isn't the force of old. Formwatch Woolfall Treasure 20-1 (9-12) Prominent, went 2nd over 2f out, soon every chance, no extra inside final furlong, 5th of 13, 2l behind Fourth Generation (9-7) at Kempton 2m hcp 0-85 (4) pol.
