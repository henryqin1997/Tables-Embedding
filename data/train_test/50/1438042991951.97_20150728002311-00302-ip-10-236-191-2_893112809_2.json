            "Well secured and in a good area away from the hustle and bustle. I wouldn't leave my car door unlocked, but I feel safe and confident enough to focus and invest my full attention in my classes.",

            "We have chapters of national organizations that are specific to each major.",
            "Business, Law and Education Majors! These are the golden three that Humphreys wants to equip and send out into the community to make it a better place.",
            "Study groups. I can't speak for all of the majors and different graduating classes who have gone through here -maybe it is because we have small campuses, but our study groups really look out for each other. We share resources, push each other out of bed and to show up in classes, quiz each other ... we truly do have fellowship and support in an environment where that is encouraged and supported.",
            "Humphreys is a non-profit college who truly believes in their mission statement to better it's students and send them out into the community well trained. If you take three classes in a quarter, and push yourself to take one more, the school gives you that fourth class for free! Plus all of your electives are FREE! ... I had a scholarship to go out of state (Full Ride to Berea College in Kentucky) but I turned it down to stay home, work and still gain a great education at a steal of a price.",
            "Field Trips to the Court House! Prison Tours and the Shooting Range! :D",
            "Decent, but there are also many near by restaurants and fast food joints.",
            "I don't live in the dorms - space is limited, but from what I hear from those who do, it is well accommodated and frugal - which is just what a college student could hope for.",
            "Definitely not a diploma mill - they are hard graders but it's worth it cause you gotta earn it.",
            "Humphreys College is not a well known institution beyond the Stockton and Modesto, California region, but it is highly regarded in the community as having produced high achieving business entrepreneurs and even a few judges who serve on the bench right now. The cost of tuition is one of the cheapest around and its stringent, so you are sure to be well trained in your field. They have numerous Associates and Bachelors Degree programs, plus one Masters Program and one Doctorate Program.",
            "A very welcoming and encouraging environment, but more challenging and with a higher level of expectation than my community college. I have no doubt that it's success is in it's standards of education and training, I will definitely leave Humphreys College with the proper training for the legal field. What's more is that they have a great tuition plan, if you take 3 classes in a quarter, the fourth one is free if you push yourself to take that fourth; plus, all of your electives are free."
