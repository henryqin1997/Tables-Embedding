Why not a \"fest like\" tour at a few of the sheds with perhaps a major US act as the healiner. Perhaps Def Leppard, Deep Purple, Poison as the main to catch the USA casual fans eye plus 4 or 5 of these bands. I KNOW that fans in the USA that have no idea who they are if promoted as a \"real rock, not alternative style\" rock music you would get new fans. PLUS the many of us in the USA would get to see these great bands live here. Instead of the horrible OZ Fest in which Ozzy's wife make him play with artists that fans of him and Sabbath sit there with our ears plugged and mouths open....
