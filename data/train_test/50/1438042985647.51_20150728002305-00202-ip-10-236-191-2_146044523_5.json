I bought it new in Feb. of \u201812. It is currently on my table saw, and has been lightly used for the year I\u2019ve had it. I have all the parts/pieces, manual and even the DVD that came with it. I don\u2019t have the original box though. I am selling it basically just because I prefer my Biesemeyer fence. The incra is an amazing fence system, but just isn\u2019t right for me. These things sell for +$400 on amazon, I am looking for $300 + actual shipping for mine. I can take some photos if anyone is interested. http://www.amazon.com/INCRA-LS32-TS-TS-L...ncra+fence, 4222=#1 posted 02-25-2013 01:19 AM, 22907=#13 posted 03-11-2013 04:33 PM, 8581=#4 posted 02-25-2013 07:14 PM, 17699=#10 posted 03-11-2013 01:16 AM}",
