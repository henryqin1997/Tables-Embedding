            "MSJC is very secure with campus safety. There are around the clock security and a campus police station. Being a student who takes classes late at night it is important that I feel safe on campus and MSJC does just that.",
            "I am not aware of much Greek life on campus I know there is one Greek campus sorority.",
            "Although I am not currently in any clubs, they do look promising and I look forward into joining them. they range from many diversities and offer many opportunities to their students.",
            "Great for students look to earn certificates, AA, AS, or a transfer to a 4-year college.",
            "To my knowledge there is nothing I have found strange or unusual on campus just yet.",
            "MSJC offers a wide variety of financial aid programs to help you get more bang for your buck!",
            "For fun MSJC offers a wide variety of clubs that range from honors, sorority, cultural, and dance. These offer and give the students time to interact with the community and our fellow peers whom share similar interest. Also there is sports such as good old fashion American football.",
            "Food and dinning are those typical of cafeteria food. Not completely horrible but nonetheless it is food.",
            "There is no dorm life offered so for that reason i rate it one.",
            "Considering I am only a freshman the academic rigor seems appropriate and accurate for the education level offered at",
            "The most important tip to take into account id DO NOT PROCRASTINATE! Keep on top of deadlines especially when it comes to registering for classes. Also look into all programs that MSJC has to offer, you'll be surprised how much there is to help you financially, educationally and personaly.",

Compared to a university, it is very cheap. There is also a board of governors wavier that one could apply for in order to have their classes paid for. One just has to show that they financially struggling., 30491=I would check out some other junior colleges in the area as well. Like Palomar or RCC. MSJC is a good school, its just really impacted and hard to get into classes. It would probably be a good idea to register for classes at a couple different places if you can, or just be okay with the fact that an AA/AS could take you 3 - 5 years., 159767=Class units cost $48 as of Oct. 2012. Way more affordable than starting off at a University. Pay close attention to which units transfer and which don't., 117121=As of now they are asking i believe $36 a unit which is just over $100 a class which is a whole lot cheaper for your general education then if you were going to a Four-year institution paying almost a $1000 or more per class. I say your going to get more band for your buck here then at a Four-year, 277808=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 104405=Units will increase beginning Fall 2012 to $49 a unit}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students This school is great for any type of student, but is best for students who do not have a lot of money and are looking for a top-notch education. Even top students in high school will learn as much at this school as if they went to a 4 year university. Tips for prospective students Buy the books from somewhere online or from other students. I paid for all my books new and they were all over $60. Bang for the buck The tuition is extremely cheap. I LOVE how cheap it is. Compared to other schools, going to Mount San Jacinto is like going to school for free, which in this economy is mind blowing! The cafe is also very cheap but it serves delicious food. Am enjoying being here The faculty is extremely nice and open with the student population and even the students are friendly and open-minded. I love being close to the mountain even though the weather can sometimes be hot, but the campus is small and it is very easy to locate classes. Am learning a lot Ever since I first",
