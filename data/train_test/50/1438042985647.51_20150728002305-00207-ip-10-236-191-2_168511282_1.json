He really went retro with the throwback uniforms, to a time before jerseys had numbers. Wait, there were numbers on those uniforms? One of the first things you learn when you start preparing powerpoint charts is don't use a yellow font color on a white background. (Another thing is make your fonts large enough for your audience to see them - and yes, this is a reference to the mini-numbers on the front of the UTL jerseys.)I would have thought that a marketing genius would know that. Maybe if they had made the blue border a little wider, the number would have stood out, or at least been visible. I think the problem was getting into business with Adidas in the first place. My wife bought me a couple pair of sweatpants for Christmas, because it gets cold at the Badminton Club in January. They were made by Adidas and the tags called them, \"Weekender Pants.\" I tried on a pair and had a strange urge to move to Florida and start playing shuffleboard. In keeping with the SitCom theme of the season, I'll share a quote from Seinfeld regarding sweatpants, \"You know the message you're sending out to the world with these sweatpants? You're telling the world, 'I give up. I can't compete in normal society. I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable.'\" That sums up Adidas and our \"wow\" jerseys., 21736=Moar Numberz * We had 24 first downs to their 17, and 38 minutes TOP to their 22. This was like the Indiana game a few years ago, except we were Indiana. We were grinding it out, 10 yards at a time. The problem with that is you need to be perfect. Any little holding penalty or hands-to-the-face penalty stops your drive. * Time of possession was 10+ minutes for Michigan in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quarters, but only 6:31 in the 4th quarter. Instead of tiring out their defense, I guess our offense got tired. * Net yards rushing, M: 141, SC: 85. That usually correlates with a victory, but being -1 in TO margin and giving up the punt return TD negates that advantage. * Clowney had 4 tackles, two TFLs, and the hit that SportsCenter is showing on a continuous loop. It must suck being an O-linemen. You stop a guy for 81 plays, have a miscommunication on the 82nd, and the D-linemen ends up on all the highlight shows and gets picked first overall in the draft next year. I'm sure Lewan and Clowney will meet again at the next level. Those are two outstanding football players. I wanted Muppets, but all I got was Bozo the Clowney., 33990=2009-10, 35587=2012-13, 31861=2005-06, 34522=2010-11, 11375=(stolen from http://www.fbschedules.com/ncaa-13/big-ten/2013-michigan-wolverines-football-schedule.php\u00a0), 31328=2004-05, 12308=I think that next year will be a good year for the Wolverines.\u00a0 I still think that 2015-2016 is when we are reaping the fruits of this recruiting, so I cannot call us world beaters next year, but we should be the front runner to get to the BTCG.\u00a0 Kinnick is a hard place to play, but Iowa is a tire fire.\u00a0 Sparty gon' Spart.\u00a0 We are likely looking at Notre Dame,\u00a0Nebraska, and Ohio as defining our season.\u00a0 We CAN win all those games.\u00a0 We should win at least one of them.\u00a0 I think that if we get a lot luck, we can go 13-0, as there are no huge threats on our schedule.\u00a0 I see that 13-0 as being the same as ND or OSU this year.\u00a0 Those were very soft unbeaten schedules (one of them will be cut short in a few days).\u00a0 I can also reasonably see us losing 3 games, at 9-3.\u00a0 So that is my likely range, and going off the schedule, the conference, the recruiting, and the players coming back, I don't see that as being overly optimistic., 33457=2008-09, 35055=2011-12, 32393=2006-07, 38762=% Change (2011-12 to 2012-13):, 32925=2007-08, 30796=2003-04}",

    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 DATA AND RESULTS: So you can see the trends between the first two seasons with this coaching staff, I figured out the percent change along the six metric between the two years, but then I also did this for the \u201cHoke Era\u201d, if you will, versus the previous eight years so it is possible to see, at a high level, some of the effects of the change. I added the South Carolina data into the figuring of seasonal averages for rushing offense and defense, passing offense and defense and scoring offense and defense. I then split the ten seasons into \u201cthe previous eight\u201d versus \u201cthe last two\u201d and provided separate averages for these. Granted, an average of two numbers isn\u2019t exceedingly meaningful, but it aids in approximating a few other items. More specifically, increases or decreases in productivity between the two periods. Recognizing the dangers of the \u201caverage of averages\u201d, given that there are so many data points involved, I will accept the summary statistics as a decent approximation and a good basis for discussion. After an afternoon of disappointment followed by reflection, I decided to take a look at the last ten years of Michigan football and conduct a little \u201cthen and now\u201d look at it. I had most of this data already, so it was reasonably convenient for me. \u201cA HIGH-LEVEL LOOK AT OVERALL PRODUCTION\u201d football Filed under:",
    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 DISCUSSION: There shouldn\u2019t be too much in here that you didn\u2019t already surmise. For one thing, in some of the numbers anyway, you will clearly note what has been called \u201cThe Denard Effect\u201d around these parts when it comes to offensive production, particularly rushing and scoring offense. \u00a0Between this season and last, the 17.9% decrease in average rushing can be explained by injuries and by role and scheme changes in the offense. It will be interesting to revisit this analysis next year for this reason. The other thing that will not shock anyone is the drop in passing overall during the current regime, but the uptick from last year to this year, mainly due to \u201cthe Gardner effect\u201d, if you will. An interesting statistic to me as well is that, despite appearances, the pass defense did get better this year compared to last despite what I would term the absence of pure pass rusher, at least in my opinion. The rush defense actually took a step back statistically, although you watching the games makes that difficult to believe for me sometimes. There are plenty of springboards for discussion in this, I believe, but I am interested in what the MGoCommunity thinks.
