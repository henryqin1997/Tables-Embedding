For example, a device may include a shell or container configured for being immobilized, including recesses which may be tied or otherwise connected to in-vivo tissue, including clamps, pins, etc. A device may be attached to a cord or band from which it is hung from a relatively stationary position in-vivo, for example within the esophagus, or which may be tied to connected to an in-vivo site. Reference is now made to FIG. 2B in which device 100 (or devices 10 or 20) is attached to the wall of a body lumen 300 (such as a section of the GI tract) with an elastic band 150 or other suitable extension or cord which, in turn, is placed around a protuberance 154 in the wall of the body lumen 300. Device 100 then hangs down into the body lumen 300 and measures the pH over a pre-defined period of time, such as, for example, 24 hours. Other suitable time periods may be used. Other known methods for positioning and immobilizing a device to a body lumen wall may be used in accordance with embodiments of the invention and other body lumens besides the esophagus may be sensed. Examples of devices which may be immobilized or which are configured to be immobilized in-vivo, and some systems and methods for immobilizing a device in-vivo are described in WO 02/26103 published on Apr. 4, 2002, and published application US-2002-0042562-A1, which are assigned to the common assignee of the present invention and which are hereby incorporated by reference. Other systems and method of immobilizing an in-vivo device may be used.}",

In block 450, the output of the sensors may be compared so as to determine the cross correlation between the output of the sensors. Other suitable comparisons of data may be performed. Based on analysis of the comparison between the output of the sensors and the cross correlation, as for example is described herein, flow may be detected (460). In a case where flow is detected, the direction of the flow (470) and velocity of the flow (480) may be determined. Based on the determinations made and possibly other suitable parameters, in-vivo conditions such as for example, GERD, may be determined. Other operations and series of operations may be used.
