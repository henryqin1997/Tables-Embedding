This work combines mathematical modeling with experiments designed to understand how the nervous system solves the purported \"problem\" of motor redundancy to learn and achieve successful functional movement tasks. This work has focused to date on the coordination of postural tasks (standing and sit-to-stand) and more skilled upper extremity activities such as reaching, pointing and drawing tasks. Another line of investigation studies recovery of walking in individuals surviving a stroke by using a novel approach combining",
