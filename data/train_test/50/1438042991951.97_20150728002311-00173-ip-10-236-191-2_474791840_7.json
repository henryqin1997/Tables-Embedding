As noted above, each corresponding Early Boot Installer process may determine from an override flag, resiliency flag, or a version database 106 whether a firmware install is desired. If the corresponding Early Boot Installer process determines that a firmware install is desired, the corresponding Early Boot Installer may utilize various file types 202 from the corresponding firmware package, stored on the non-operational storage area 101, and overwrite the live copy of firmware the corresponding subsystem within the device 101 is running. FIG. 5 The fifth step 504 in the method embodiment shown in is to determine in parallel whether a firmware install to one or more subsystem of the device is desired. As noted above, a corresponding Early Boot: Installer process may read the value of corresponding resiliency flag and make a decision as whether to re-install the corresponding firmware package from the non-operational storage area if the previous install did not complete. Further, as noted above, each Early Boot Installer may read an override flag to determine whether to force an install. If the override flag value reflects to force an install, then it will always be determined that an install is desired. If the override flag value does not reflect a force install, then each Early Boot Installer process may compare the corresponding",
