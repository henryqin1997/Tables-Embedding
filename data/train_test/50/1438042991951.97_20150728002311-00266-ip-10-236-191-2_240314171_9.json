            "Identification and removal of policy barriers can improve access to medicinal plants by local people and double the benefits; can be a model sub-sector for SMD",
            "Enabling communities to participate in planning, designing, implementing and monitoring of NRM at local level can empower and lead to improved resource governance",
            "Good model of forest resource governance enabling farmers to improve livelihoods and participate in and benefit from REDD+; CF of Nepal is a good practice case for SMD as it gives ?triple dividend?: improved environment in terms of watershed management and biodiversity conservation, enhanced local income and carbon sequestration -adaptation, mitigation and poverty reduction",
            "Important source of income to local community with relatively more distributive effect achieving income equity.",
            "Generate multiple products such as clean energy, compost, fodder banks; carbon co-benefits (REDD) and lead to biodiversity conservation",
            "CO2sequestration; helps to develop new forestry institutions; benefits and sharing are issues that need to be addressed.",
            "Improved agro-ecosystem resilience, soil organic carbon deposits; reduced costs; increased net income; high community acceptance.",
            "A good program promoting massive peoples? participation; significant social and economic benefits (carbon credits being paid) and recognised environmental benefits (CDM board has awarded CER certificate).",
            "Low-cost, clean and sustainable source of energy for remote mountain communities (off-grid locations) offsetting carbon emissions and generating and trading CERs under a UNFCCC recognised CDM programme.",
            "Watershed conservation in catchment areas of a major storage and hydroelectricity dams has multiple benefits; Policy weaknesses have led to poor sectoral coordination and thematic integration of social and environmental pillars; future potentials are high including that through REDD+"

HKH regional area (Total estimated area: 3,441,719 sq.km) The HKH region spreads over 3.44 million sq. km. and has a population of around 210.5 million (ICIMOD 2009). 1.2.2 Geographic features of the HKH Mountains The Himalayan range alone has the snow and ice cover of 35,110 sq.km containing 3,735 cu. km. of eternal snow and ice (Qin 2002). The total snow and ice cover for the HKH region is about 60,000 sq. km. (ICIMOD 2011). Hills and mountains, particularly the HKH mountain system, have been the sites of adaptation, mitigation, and resilience of the local people. Since time immemorial, they have maintained a rich cultural identity, food security and biogenetic diversity within the parameters of their own traditions. Figure 2. The ten river basins of the HKH region (UNDESA: Please Reference Full Submission for Figure) The geographic qualifier 'Hindu Kush-Himalaya' is not very precise. The region extends 3,500 km over all or parts of eight countries from Afghanistan in the west to Myanmar in the east and is the source of 10 major Asian river systems -? the Amu Darya, Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra (Yarlungtsanpo), Irrawaddy, Salween (Nu), Mekong (Lancang), Yangtse (Jinsha), Yellow River (Huanghe), and Tarim (Dayan). These rivers provide water, ecosystem services, and the basis for livelihoods to about 210.5 million people (see Figure 2). People living in the basins of these rivers directly depend on the water mainly for irrigation, drinking, sanitation, and industrial uses (Jianchu et al 2009).",
