Sure, the Celtics are 12 games under .500, but that is still in the playoff hunt in the East. So Boston used the trade deadline to actually get better. They traded Marcus Thornton and a 2016 first round pick to the Phoenix Suns for point guard Isaiah Thomas. Thomas is a pretty good point guard and has a reasonable contract - less than $20 million for the next three years., 15962=The massive TD Garden was finished in 1995 for a cost of $160 million. Originally known as the Shawmut Center, the TD Garden is now home to two of the most successful sports teams in North America: the Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics. The Celtics last won the NBA Championship in 2008 while the Bruins brought home the Stanley Cup in 2011. The arena is also home to the NLL's Boston Blazers. TD Garden underwent a major overhaul in 2006. New feature included a new, beautiful HD entertainment board and video advertising boards that replaced the original scrolling panels. A vintage siren was also added as a goal horn for hockey games. In the past, the arena has also hosted Northeastern University's commencement, UFC events, Wrestlemania and several other WWF events, and some of the nation's biggest concerts. TD Garden is built on top of Boston's North Station, a major transportation hub, so getting to games and concerts is a breeze., 15494=The Boston Celtics have been a perennial powerhouse in the Eastern Conference since the arrival of Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in 2007. With the help of longtime Celtic Paul Pierce, the 'Big Three' were able to bring a Championship to Boston in 2008. The Eastern Conference is really heating up this season, so make sure you buy Boston Celtics tickets so you don't miss out on the action., 18147=New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics First Round Preview New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics NBA Playoffs Tickets New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics First Round Preview The New York Knicks have not won a playoff series since the 1999-2000 NBA Playoffs - quite some time for one of the major markets and marquee franchises\u2026, 13416=5/18/12 The Boston Celtics bounced back from their Game 2 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers with a big 107-91 win on the road in Game 3. Kevin Garnett partied like it was 2008 in putting up 27 points, 13 rebounds and 4 assists. Garnett looked to be almost five years younger in dominating the Sixers in the low-post as well as making them pay with his patented mid-range jumper. Back in control now with a 2-1 series lead, the Celtics will look to put themselves firmly in the driver's seat with another win in Game 4 at the Wells Fargo Center on Friday night., 14965=Boston Celtics tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of the NBA's most storied franchises work to return to the finals after winning it all in 2008. Founded in 1946, the Celtics' record 17 NBA championships are the most of any NBA franchise and just one more than the rival L.A. Lakers. The Celtics play their games at TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. Watch as the Celts add to their legacy and work to bring another NBA Championship to Boston!, 6067=1/21/15: All the sports teams in Boston are vulnerable to intense media pressure, particularly when they are losing. Perhaps the Celtics have gotten a bit of a break lately because the New England Patriots are rolling through the playoffs, but that does not escape the fact that they have less than 15 wins and it is getting into late January. The \"T\" word (tanking) is being thrown around, but no one knows for sure. In any case the Celtics have made a number of trades recently and then gotten rid of guys they have gotten back. That includes Jameer Nelson, Chris Douglas-Roberts and Brandan Write. Yes, this is frustrating right now, but it should build a better team in the future., 17491=Get ready to catch your favorite Celtics players in action for the 2011-12 NBA season. You'll be glued to the screen watching Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo, Paul Pierce, Jermaine O'Neal, Jeff Green, Avery Bradley and the rest of the team. Let's see if they will be able to bring home the trophy again as they did in the 2008 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers., 16984=Boston Celtics tickets ensure that fans see the Celtics playing top contenders throughout the entire NBA season. The Celtics have a solid shot at winning the Atlantic Division in 2011. With matchups against great teams like the Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks and non-divisional meetings with Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers, the Celtics are sure to be tested all season long. Grab your Celtics tickets now and don't miss the action!}",
