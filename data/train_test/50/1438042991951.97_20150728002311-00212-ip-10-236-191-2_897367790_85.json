Also, there are 1400 emergency call stations across campus which allow immediate Police assistance with the push of a button., 430279=Due to it being so close to downtown Chicago, UIC campus security is very efficient in the sense that they do the best job possible to keep students safe. You do get the crime alert reports but most of the time it's because a student was being risky and was walking at 3:00 am by himself., 329234=My Freshmen yr in 2010, food was crappy, however returning my sophomore year the CAF was completely redone and the food got alot better. The staff is very friendly and its best to develop close relationships with them!, 295429=The professors are brilliant, campus is nice, it's in the city, and it's right next to the train! I took the summer program offered for incoming freshman and met so many new people, I already feel comfortable going to college and I'll be a freshman this August.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The teachers are very knowledgeable. A lot of them encourage everyone to take advantage of their office hours, and they are always there when they say they will be. It is always important to check out your professors on ratemyprofessors.com as some teachers are definitely a lot better than others. Each teacher has his own teaching style and expectations, so make sure you are clear on what exactly those are and you will be fine.
