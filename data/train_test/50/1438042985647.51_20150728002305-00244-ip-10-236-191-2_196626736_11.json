Five EA Sports titles (more or less) grace the list this week as well as a double entry for an RPG down at the very bottom there.

But this has nothing to do with the Top Ten so let's move on, shall we? Sly Cooper's third escapade debuts at 5th place, Mortal Kombat's adventure game at 8th, and FPS Far Cry for Xbox at 4th. \u00a0Currents Top Ten I've just returned from watching the new Wallace and Gromit movie.
