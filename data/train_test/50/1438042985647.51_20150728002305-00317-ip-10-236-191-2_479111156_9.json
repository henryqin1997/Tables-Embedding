One goal in treating stroke is removal of the blockage caused by the thrombus or clot as soon as possible. It is widely believed that if the blockage can be removed within the first six hours after the stroke, the chances for patient recovery with little or no neurological deficit is significantly increased. Many practitioners believe the window of opportunity is limited to the first three hours. One method of thrombus removal has included a step of dislodging the thrombus from walls of a vascular system and then removing the thrombus from the vascular system with a suction device. The Willard et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,419,774, issuing May 30, 1995, describes a method and a device for removing a thrombus from a vascular system using this general approach. The device is used in a saphenous vein graft and is introduced without a guide wire in order to avoid a possible dislodgment of the thrombus prematurely. With this device, thrombus material is pulled into a chamber at a distal end of a catheter. The rate of pulling is regulated by pressure exerted on an irrigation solution as well as a level of vacuum pressure applied to a discharge lumen and the timing and speed of a cutter stroke., 30534=The Kotula et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,275, issuing Oct. 29, 1996, describes a thrombus macerating device that includes an elongate, flexible shaft which can be guided along a vascular path. A rotor or impeller with blades is affixed to the shaft adjacent to its distal end. A drive mechanism is provided for rotating the shaft and the rotor which is attached to the shaft. The rotor is retained within a rotor housing and rotates within the housing. The rotor housing includes a cylindrical wall that surrounds the rotor and that has at least three ports spaced angularly about the circumference of the housing. As the rotor is rotated, it will tend to draw blood into the housing in a proximal direction and expel the blood out through the ports. The blood then tends to be drawn back into the distal end of the housing and through the rotor again. This movement sets up a recirculating vortex which repeatedly passes the blood across the blades., 31999=The Kotula et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,284,486, issuing Feb. 8, 1994, describes a mechanism for breaking down a thrombus with rotating blades. The thrombus is broken down into particles which are fine enough to be left in the vascular system without a significant risk of forming additional thrombi. The mechanism also includes another mechanism to ensure that rotating blades of the mechanism do not directly contact walls of a vessel, but remain centered within the vessel. The mechanism includes an elongate, flexible shaft with a rotor or impeller having blades affixed to the shaft adjacent its distal end. A drive mechanism is provided for rapidly rotating the shaft and the rotor attached to the shaft. The rotor is retained within a rotor housing and rotates within the housing. The rotor housing includes a generally cylindrical wall that is substantially surrounding the rotor and that has at least three ports spaced angularly about the circumference of the housing. As the rotor is rotated, it will tend to draw blood into the housing in a proximal direction and expel the blood out through the ports. The blood then tends to be drawn back into the distal end of the housing and through the rotor again. This activity sets up a recirculating vortex which repeatedly passes the blood across the blades.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or central attributes thereof. In that the foregoing description of the present invention discloses only exemplary embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that other variations are contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited in the particular embodiments which have been described in detail therein. Rather, reference should be made to the appended claims as indicative of the scope and content of the present invention. In order to expand or buckle the strips 102 and 104, the core wire 110 is retracted. As the core wire 110 is retracted, the coils 114 close the slits in the polymer sleeve 112. This action permits the macerator strips 102 and 104 to buckle outwardly, creating the macerator ribs. The macerator microcatheter 100 also includes a polymer sleeve 112 and coils 114 which are substantially covered by the polymer sleeve. A core wire 110 is enclosed by the coils 114 and the sleeve 112. The polymer sleeve 112 is extruded or heat shrunk over the coils. The polymer sleeve 112 defines slits that allow the macerator strips 102 and 104 to expand or buckle. One of the slits is positioned along a length shown at 116 in FIG. 9. As the core wire 110 is",
