            "13 social clubs. Stuff gets intense. There's a spot for everyone. Theta Psi is the best though!",
            "Many. Lots of fun. There are so many people either engaging in the activities and groups around campus or actually setting them up! It's awesome!!",
            "Christians, Non-Christians. Jocks, Geeks. Wealthy and Poor. Everyone basically. Don't come if you ... Nope! I can't think of anything!",
            "Many! You will just have to come here to find out what they are. A list of a few of the biggest ones are: Stompfest Campus Dodgeball Singarama Cowboy Show Paint the Herd Actually spray painting the Bison Statue Jersey Thursday Battle of the Boulevard Tuesday Gathering Full Moon Festival AND MUCH MUCH MORE",
            "This depends fully on how much one is willing to engage and how hard they work.",
            "Besides on campus activities, Lipscomb is located in Nashville, which has tons of fun things to do ranging from concerts and shows to relaxing low-key parks to amazing food places!",
            "Its ok right now. It is improving.",
            "As an RA, I absolutely love dorm life. It is where you meet the people who you will get closest to.",

I have made many friends here that I know will be friends for life. Lipscomb's Student Government Association plans 4-5 activities per semester to help students stay involved on campus. The biggest event SGA planned in the 2010 fall semester was Lipscomb's first Paint Rave. With over 600 students in attendance, the rave was a huge success! Also, Garner Goode with Lipscomb in Motion (the student life events planner), has events on the school calendar almost every night. From free food in Arlo's to a movie night in Alumni Auditorium, students are never without access to a good time. Social clubs (Lipscomb's alternative to sororities/fraternities) and athletic events also give students a chance to interact outside of the classroom and spend time together. Lipscomb's service clubs give students the chance to enjoy some of the same aspects of a social club, while finding ways to give back to the community. Lipscomb is located in Nashville, giving students total access to the famous, music city. Within minutes of the Grand Ole Opry, Opryland, Green Hills mall, Sweet CeCe's and so much more, students are able to have fun off campus without having to use up a lot of gas., 159808=If you plan to commute, plan on 8:00 classes or plan to park off-campus and hike to class. Also, consider that this is a Christian school. If you're uncomfortable with Christianity/Christians/religion in general, you may not feel comfortable, as it is very open about its stand on faith (though never shove-it-down-your-throat) and you are required to get chapel credits by attending chapel/chapel-like events., 120796=Be prepared to pay at least $2000 in hidden fees. Get used to studying a a lot. Have fun!, 59337=the dorms look amazing and I already got a roommate. I get to move into my dorm in august., 168009=The food id pretty predictable and the cafe closes at 7:30 so that's a struggle., 247965=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

The faith background of Lipscomb gives Christian students the chance to be open about their beliefs without feeling ridiculed. Lipscomb is considered to be a more liberal Church of Christ university than others, which can play a small part in the decision process. Tips for prospective students If you are considering Lipscomb, you're on the right track! Make sure you visit www.golipscomb.com to find out more information about admission, scholarships and financial aid. One of the things I love best about Lipscomb's admission process is that you don't have to write any essays! (Yea! We all know how much high school students are not interested in writing more essays!) Instead of an essay, Lipscomb asks prospective",
