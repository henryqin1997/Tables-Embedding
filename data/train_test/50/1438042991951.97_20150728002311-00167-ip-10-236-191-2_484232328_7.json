The electronic dictionary and language interpreter differs from any conventional type of electronic device in that the former is of a unique structure which provides for efficient and rapid retrieval of word information stored in a memory. An example of such electronic dictionaries and language interpreters was disclosed in Levy, U.S. Pat.

Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. FIG. 7 shows a circuit diagram of another type of the inflection control circuit suitable for the keyboard of FIG. 6. In FIG. 7, three registers R1 ', R2 ' and R3 ' are provided. The remaining circuit elements similar to those of FIG. 2 are omitted. In FIG. 6, as compared to FIG. 1, keys for the attributive use and the singular are omitted. Unless the plural key 98 is actuated, it leads to the detection that the singular is selected. Unless the predicative use key 94 is operated, the attributive use is regarded as having been selected. While the shift key switch 80 is not actuated, the actuation of a key switch, say, 81 means that the introduction of the indicative mood present as marked in the upper position is enabled. Once the shift key switch 80 is operated, the actuation of the key switch 81 means that the introduction of the positive as marked in the lower position is enabled.
