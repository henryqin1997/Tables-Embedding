This obviously due to the now-demolished Metrodome. In fact, all but 4 of 13 meetings between the two at the Metrodome were NOT played at night. (sidenote: Michigan never lost once in the Metrodome. 13-0 against the Gophers in that building). The 1991 and 2003 Michigan-Minnesota games were played on Friday nights due to a Metrodome scheduling conflict with the Minnesota Twins who were in the MLB Playoffs in those years. Those two Friday night games against Minnesota are Michigan's only two non-Saturday regular season games in the last 98 years.
