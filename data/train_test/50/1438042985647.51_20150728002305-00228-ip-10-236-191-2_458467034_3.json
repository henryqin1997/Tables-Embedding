The data series in the compressed ASCII files of quarterly data are organized in the same way as in the releases and in the Flow of Funds coded tables. You can separately retrieve each of the table files, which have been grouped for convenience into five categories: 2005 to 2008 (304 KB PDF) 1995 to 2004 (396 KB PDF) 1985 to 1994 (377 KB PDF) 1975 to 1984 (360 KB PDF) 1965 to 1974 (334 KB PDF) 1955 to 1964 (311 KB PDF) 1945 to 1954 (299 KB PDF) The Flow of Funds Z.1 files provide the full set of historical data that correspond to the statistics in the Z.1 release. Two data frequencies are available--annual and quarterly. (1) Annual: For amounts outstanding, from 1945 forward; for flows, from 1946 forward.

The data files were compressed with PKZIP, version 2.04; the software to expand the files is available from PKWARE's Web site. Each file name contains the number of the table in that file. For example, the data for table F.117 (seasonally adjusted flows for life insurance companies) is in the file named atab117d.prn (the \"d\" identifies a DOS file).
