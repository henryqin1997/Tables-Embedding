As fuel is combusted, a pulsating flow of atomization fluid exits combustion chamber 12 and passes into resonance tube(s) 16. The stream of atomization fluid leaving combustion chamber 12 is at a sufficient velocity so as to atomize the fuel being injected or provided by additional fuel introduction means 20. After the atomization fluid meets the fuel to be atomized, fuel is atomized and travels along resonance tube(s) 16 gaining further speed until the atomized fuel is provided to a main combustor cavity or other application.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although preferred embodiments of the invention have been described using specific terms, devices, concentrations, and methods, such description is for illustrative purposes only. The words used are words of description rather than of limitation. It is to be understood that changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or the scope of the following claims. As shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, fuel that has been atomized by pulse combustion means 10 may be supplied to a main combustor cavity 50. In addition, atomized fuel produced by the present apparatus may be supplied to a gasification device as generally known in the art and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,404. The main combustor cavity may consist of a further pulse combustion means or may, instead, be a typical conventional combustion unit. In another embodiment of the present invention, a pulse combustion atomizer may be operated under a pressurized or supercharged inlet air condition. As depicted in FIG. 5, an air plenum 24 may be connected through conduits to a supercharger 26. Supercharger 26 may be a forced draft fan employed for supplying primary air to air plenum 24. Air plenum 24 operates as a capacitor and seeks to provide primary air to pulse combustion means 10 at approximately constant static pressure. The pressure boost developed due to pulse combustion within the present embodiment allows a reduction in the size, power requirements, and cost",
