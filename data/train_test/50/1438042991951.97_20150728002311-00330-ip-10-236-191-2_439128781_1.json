Team USA kept up a strong attack at the net and held off a second-set rally by France as it defeated the European side. USA\u2019s Matt Anderson, who was named Player of the Match, led all scorers with 22 points on 17 kills, three blocks and two aces. \"We were technically weak, especially in our serving. We weren't ready and we are looking forward to the next game,\u201d said Korea\u2019s coach Ki-Won Park. Korea accepted weakness in their 0-3 loss (25-19, 25-10, 25-18) against home-team Canada. Korea started set one with some promise, but Canada regained its composure and confidence to win by six points in the first set, eventually taking the second and third sets. \"Times New Roman\";color:#222222;mso-fareast-language:FR-CH\">\u00a0 All teams will meet again this weekend, with Japan and Finland also joining week three matches on Saturday.span>",
