            "The campus is extremely safe. Concordia is in a gated community and has security. I have never felt unsafe here.",
            "There are so many things to do for fun. Concordia is a half hour or less from multiple beaches, a few outdoor shopping places, and disneyland and downtown disney. There is always something to do in the city.",
            "The food is pretty good. They change it up a lot, so there are always new options. The dining halls is nice to, but might need to be bigger soon as our school is growing.",
            "The dorms at Concordia are great! The living spaces are really nice. The activities and events with your hall can be a lot of fun if you choose to participate and get to know the other residents in your hall.",
            "The academics at Concordia are very good. The classes are challenging but do able if you work hard. The professors are also great and very willing to help you do the best of your ability in their class.",
            "Concordia is a great school. The campus is beautiful and has great a location,the academics are rigorous and worth the money, and the dorm life is great. Concordia is definitely a school worth looking at."

From everyone in Admissions to the Professors to the Woman's Basketball Coach, I have received such a warm welcome and I am very excited to start in August 2009., 10015=Concordia is pretty price-y seeing that it is a private Christian college, but the curriculum here is incredible. The food here is also amazing. they have food for everybody. vegetarian and vegan included. the professor to student ratio in the class room is 1:16. So your professor knows when you aren't there and they will email you asking why you didn't show up. haha well that's what I have heard but i have not really missed any classes. oh! don't fall asleep in your class either because the Prof. will see you. That's pretty much the only downfall to having small class sizes. But this gives you a better chance to connect with your Prof. more and have a relationship with them. This can help when it comes to graduating and trying to get into graduate college and needing a reference from your Profs., 113320=1. Don't let this campus' size fool you. This place has got connections all over the world, and because you can get to know your professors very easily, you can find those connections fast. 2. Don't let the price tag fool you, either. Concordia offers automatic scholarships for anyone (including international students) with a GPA between 3.0 and 4.0 and a SAT score above 1000. If your GPA is 3.9 or 4.0, make SURE you apply for the Presidential Scholarship. You could get full tuition paid. 3. If you come here, plan to take at least one trip abroad. Don't put that on your maybe list. Study abroad isn't your only option either... Concordia is well-regarded for its missions trips... and the cherry on top, the Around-the-World Semester. 4. Freshmen can't have cars on campus, but make a friend who has one. Public transportation is pretty slim. 5. Know that Concordia is a Dry Campus. Go off-campus if you need alcohol that badly, but don't return to campus drunk., 2616=The ratio of student to Professor at Concordia is about 15:1. This means that each student receives personal attention. The Professors and other faculty really get to know each student. When it comes time to ask for a Professors Recommendation Letter, you will actually get a Letter written by a Prof who knows you and what kind of a future emplyee you would make. A high percentage of Concordia graduates get employment in their field soon after they graduate., 152834=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "03/04/2011 Reviewer is A current student here. 7 out of 7 people found this review useful. 2 of 36 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Concordia is great for students who want to have a close relationship with their professors (One of my professors actually lives in the residential community around Concordia and he had the class over for a movie last year). Most professors teach more than one class here and chances are you will have them again. At Concordia, you aren't just a face in the crowd. Tips for prospective students Be outgoing and meet new people. If a student knows someone who is going to Concordia them, they tend to stay inside the little bubble with that friend. Don't be afraid to say hi to some random person-- Students at Concordia are very friendly! Bang for the buck There are always things to do on campus and off campus if you get involved. Going to Concordia Irvine means opening up a world of opportunities for your life and your future. Am enjoying being here",
