Can a policy be made that would allow the Argonne Guest House to keep open a certain number of rooms for users? \u00a0 A user called to reserve a room and was told that up to 200 rooms were currently being blocked in reserve for a conference. Yes, we will check the links and make any corrections necessary to show the correct current schedule. Regarding Long Range Operations schedules that are posted to the web can a link be fixed to point to the current run on the current schedule? The current schedule is actually linked to Upcoming Schedules. There was \u00a0a question if messages can be more instructive. \u00a0 One user suggested that we give a minimum time to repair which would allow a user to leave and return when the problem has been corrected. \u00a0 Greg Banks has stated that the MCR states the minimum time to recover at the present time.
