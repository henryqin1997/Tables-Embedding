Lynn walked out at No.4 in the second innings with the Bulls in big trouble against Western Australia and added an impressive 139 out of 285 - and his century arrived with a six. Only Andrew Symonds, Jimmy Maher and Martin Love have reached three figures for Queensland at a younger age. In three matches, including the final, he earned 220 runs, and his season also involved debuts in the one-day and Twenty20 formats.
