    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33252=dorm life at mount holyoke is what you make of it. some of the halls are simply in a better location on campus than others, so if you are in one of the halls on the outskirts (ham/mcgregor, dickinson, 1837, the delles,etc) it can be frustrating. however, all the dorm restrooms and common spaces are kept up with by housekeeping. the hall presidents and advisers are always on hand to help handle problems as they arise., 49951=We have several dining hall selections on campus; we have seven all-you-can-eat buffet-style dining halls (located within dorms), and one cash-value Cafe (I am the manager at this dining hall). The dorm dining halls have hot breakfast each morning, and any dorms without dining halls have a continental breakfast Monday through Friday mornings. The food is very good, as far as college food goes; it's much better than food I've eaten at other colleges. The only downside is the dining halls get VERY crowded, particularly from 12:20 to 1 and from 6 to 7., 194668=There is a goose called Jorge who lives with the ducks in the stream beside Prospect Hall. There is a rumor that he is replaced every few years to keep the tradition alive. Also every Sunday through Thursday night at 9:30 there are M&C (Milk and Cookies) that are served. It's nice to have a snack while doing homework., 173672=Mount Holyoke is FILLED with wonderful traditions, some silly and some inspiring. There are M&Cs, Elfing, the Laurel Parade, Mountain Day, May Day, DisOrientation, Pangynaskeia (lovingly known as Pangy Day), and most importantly: the tradition of women helping women., 100625=Pangy Day! It's pretty much like a May Day festival held towards the end of the year out on the green., 230975=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 190133=The Octagon Room in the library is hard to get to, but productivity emanates from its walls. On school nights, from 9:30 to 10:00, the school puts out assorted snacks in the kitchen or dining halls as a study break. Traditionally known as M&Cs.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Strong women who are looking to be leaders and are prepared for a challenge. Tips for prospective students Definitely check it out first! And even though it's an all women's college, don't scratch it off your list! It's Five College Consortium gives you plenty of chances to meet other people! Bang for the buck Mount Holyoke definitely isn't as cheap as some schools but i believe every dollar invested here will be worth it. The opportunities it provides you with are endless. Will enjoy being here I actually did an overnight and i loved it! The dorms are very reasonably sized and comfortably fit the residents. There was so much to do on campus i couldn't decide, and everyone was willing to hang out and chat with me like i already went there instead of treating me as some random high school kid. Everyone made me feel as if I was already apart of the school. Will learn a lot I've visited the school twice and all the students I had met are driven and excited about the academics! They told me",
