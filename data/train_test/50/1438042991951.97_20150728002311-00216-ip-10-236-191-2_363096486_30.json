The NASDAQ criteria include various objective standards and a subjective test. A member of the Board of Directors is not considered independent under the objective standards if, for example, he or she is employed by Cisco or Cisco paid his or her family member more than $100,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months within the past three years. Mr. Chambers and Mr. Carter are not independent because they are Cisco employees. Mr. Powell is not independent because in 2005 his father received compensation in excess of $100,000 from Cisco in connection with two speaking engagements. The subjective test requires that each independent director not have a relationship which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director., 116714=Employees (including employee directors and executive officers) and consultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-employee directors of Cisco are eligible to participate in the Stock Incentive Plan. Accordingly, each non-employee member of the Board of Directors, each executive officer and each person who previously served as an executive officer during fiscal 2007 and remains employed by Cisco has an interest in Proposal No. 2. As of July 28, 2007, approximately 61,535 employees (including employee directors and executive officers) and ten non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Stock Incentive Plan., 66096=This committee held nine meetings during the last fiscal year. Each member of this committee is an independent director under applicable NASDAQ listing standards, an \u201coutside director\u201d as defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and a \u201cnon-employee director\u201d as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., 22480=Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names may vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mailing a completed proxy card as an alternative to voting in person at the annual meeting. Instructions for voting via the Internet or by telephone are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. To vote by mailing a proxy card, sign and return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed prepaid and addressed envelope, and your shares will be voted at the annual meeting in the manner you direct. In the event that you return a signed proxy card on which no directions are specified, your shares will be voted FOR each of the nominees of the Board of Directors (Proposal No. 1), FOR the amendment and extension of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (Proposal No. 2), FOR the adoption of the Equity Incentive Plan with respect to current and future covered employees, and executive officers (Proposal No. 3), FOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Cisco\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending July 26, 2008 (Proposal No. 4), AGAINST each of the four proposals submitted by shareholders (Proposals Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8), and in the discretion of the proxy holders as to any other matters that may properly come before the annual meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the annual meeting., 260175=Historically, Cisco has implemented the typical Silicon Valley pay model of providing total compensation consisting of base salaries, annual cash bonuses and annual stock options to its named executive officers. Under this pay model, cash compensation is low relative to annual stock option awards. As noted above, the Compensation Committee retained FWC to provide, among other things, its recommendations on competitive Peer Group pay practices. FWC conducted a study of Peer Group pay practices to develop its recommendations, and concluded that base salaries and target bonuses for the named executive officers were below the 50th percentile of the Peer Group. Through this study, FWC also determined that fiscal 2007 long-term, equity-based incentive grant values for named executive officers were at the 50th percentile of the Peer Group on average, but well below the targeted 75th percentile. The three material elements of Cisco\u2019s executive officer compensation continue to be: (i) base salary, (ii) variable cash incentive awards and (iii) long-term, equity-based incentive awards. As reflected in the \u201cSummary Compensation Table\u2014Fiscal 2007\u201d below, for fiscal 2007 over 90% of actual total compensation paid to each named executive officer was performance-based, reflecting Cisco\u2019s core compensation philosophy to pay for performance., 176004=All awards to executive officers are based on actual performance during fiscal 2008 and are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Therefore, the benefits and amounts that will be received or allocated under the EIP are not determinable at this time. The following table is for illustrative purposes only and provides certain summary information concerning dollar amounts of bonus plan benefits that would have hypothetically been payable under the EIP if it had been in effect in fiscal 2007. As such, these hypothetical amounts are not necessarily indicative of the amounts, if any, that will be paid under the EIP for fiscal 2008 performance. We have calculated these amounts using the maximum customer satisfaction factors under the EIP for fiscal 2008, the individual performance factors for fiscal 2007 (with a factor of 2.0 for the Chief Executive Officer), the year over year percentage increase in worldwide revenue and profits before interest and taxes for fiscal 2007 (applied against the percentage increase in revenue and operating income goals under the EIP for fiscal 2008) and participants\u2019 target award percentages under the EIP for fiscal 2008. We have also used participants\u2019 base salaries as of the beginning of fiscal 2008 (except that for the base salary of the Chief Executive Officer Cisco has used the market median base salary for chief executive officers in the peer group, which is $1,121,000), which in the case of non-executive officer participants is an approximation since their bonuses will be calculated by reference to their fiscal year end base salary, which information is not currently available., 352950=7/15/2012 (19), 277381=Pursuant to the EIP, a target award has been established for each participating named executive officer at 125% of the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary, resulting in a maximum award of 560% of the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary assuming maximum levels for the other performance factors. See the New Plan Benefits section of Proposal No. 3 on page 30 of this Proxy Statement, which provides summary information concerning dollar amounts of cash benefits that would have hypothetically been payable if the EIP had been in effect in fiscal 2007. While it is difficult to predict Cisco\u2019s future financial performance, over the past six years Cisco has satisfied the financial performance conditions necessary to pay bonuses at or above target levels and has exceeded its customer satisfaction goals. Because the Compensation Committee has taken a similar approach to establishing financial performance conditions and customer satisfaction goals for fiscal 2008 as it has in the past, it is probable that the fiscal 2008 targets will be achieved. Whether or not Cisco achieves it fiscal 2008 targets is only a prediction and is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified under \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d in Cisco\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2007 fiscal year. Actual results could differ materially and Cisco encourages you to review the risk factors contained in Cisco\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2007 fiscal year., 164148=Cisco is requesting that shareholders approve the Cisco Systems, Inc. Executive Incentive Plan (\u201cEIP\u201d), which was adopted by the Board on September 13, 2007, subject to shareholder approval with respect to current and future covered employees (\u201ccovered employees\u201d) under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) and executive officers within the meaning of Rule 3b-7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cexecutive officers\u201d)., 366110=8/23/2013 (23), 454807=Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Cisco\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2007 fiscal year for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission., 46134=Cisco\u2019s policies and practices reflect corporate governance initiatives that are compliant with the listing requirements of NASDAQ and the corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including:, 81323=The following table provides information as to compensation for services of the non-employee directors during fiscal 2007., 349628=5/14/2010 (9), 16280=These proxy materials are provided in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc., a California corporation, for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on Thursday, November 15, 2007, at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Elizabeth A. Hangs Theater, located at 5001 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, California, and at any adjournments or postponements of the annual meeting. These proxy materials were first sent on or about September 26, 2007 to all shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting., 342916=The following table shows the number of Cisco common shares covered by exercisable and unexercisable stock options and the number of Cisco unvested restricted stock units held by Cisco\u2019s named executive officers as of July 28, 2007., 386515=$15.2200, 432875=Amounts deferred by each participant pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited to a bookkeeping account maintained on behalf of that participant. Amounts credited to each participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan are periodically adjusted for earnings and/or losses at a rate that is equal to one or more of the measurement funds selected by the 401(k) Plan Committee and elected by a participant. Currently, the measurement funds consist of the following: Fidelity Money Market Fund; iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund; SPDR Trust, Series 1; Mid Cap SPDR Trust, Series 1; iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund; iShares MCSI EAFE Index Fund; Fidelity Freedom 2010 Fund; Fidelity Freedom 2020 Fund; Fidelity Freedom 2030 Fund; and Fidelity Freedom 2040 Fund. In addition, Cisco may credit additional matching amounts to a participant\u2019s account for any plan year as determined by the Compensation Committee and for the first plan year there is a matching contribution on deferrals over the IRS limitation on compensation that may be taken into account under the 401(k) Plan ($225,000). The matching rate for calendar year 2007 (100% of compensation up to 4%) is the same rate as in the 401(k) Plan. On September 13, 2007, the Compensation Committee approved a matching contribution under the Deferred Compensation Plan for calendar year 2008. Generally, the 2008 calendar year matching contribution will be 4% of eligible compensation over the Code Section 401(a)(17) limit with a $1,500,000 cap on eligible compensation. Participants must be actively employed by Cisco on the last day of a calendar year to receive a matching contribution under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Distributions are made in accordance with elections filed by participants at the time of their initial deferrals and distributions generally are expected to occur after a participant\u2019s separation of service., 45171=Mr. Yang, 38, has been a member of the Board of Directors since July 2000. He is a founder of Yahoo! Inc. and has served as a member of the board of directors and an officer of Yahoo! since March 1995. He was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of Yahoo! in June 2007., 458321=In addition, the proxy solicited by the Board of Directors for the 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will confer discretionary authority to vote on (i) any proposal presented by a shareholder at that meeting for which Cisco has not been provided with notice on or prior to July 28, 2008 and (ii) any proposal made in accordance with the bylaw provisions, if the 2008 proxy statement briefly describes the matter and how management\u2019s proxy holders intend to vote on it, if the shareholder does not comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-4(c)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934., 355438=9/21/2015 (26), 459797=Cisco will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the annual report and the proxy statement to any shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of either of those documents was delivered. To receive a separate copy of the annual report or proxy statement, you may write or call Cisco\u2019s Investor Relations Department at Cisco Systems, Inc., 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, Attention: Investor Relations, telephone (408) 526-6945. You may also access Cisco\u2019s annual report and proxy statement on the Investor Relations section of Cisco\u2019s website at www.cisco.com., 246700=Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Cisco\u2019s executive officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of Cisco\u2019s common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These persons are required to provide Cisco with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file. Based solely on Cisco\u2019s review of these forms and written representations from the executive officers and directors, Cisco believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were met during fiscal 2007. A late report was filed on behalf of Roderick C. McGeary relating to two fiscal 2006 transactions, each involving 324 shares. This report was promptly filed upon discovery that a report covering such transactions was not filed on time., 357841=1/19/2009 (4), 12620=The Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Cisco Systems, Inc. will be held at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Elizabeth A. Hangs Theater, located at 5001 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, California on Thursday, November 15, 2007, at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time for the following purposes:, 222350=On February 15, 2006, Cisco Systems, Yahoo, Google and Microsoft testified before the Committee on International Relations of the U.S. House of Representatives about alleged complicity in human rights violations in China;, 112210=If the amendment and extension of the Stock Incentive Plan is approved, the aggregate number of shares of Cisco common stock that will be available for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan would increase to 363 million shares, based on the estimates set forth above, and which number does not take into account awards that may be forfeited under the 1996 Plan, the SA Acquisition Plan or the WebEx Acquisition Plan. As of September 20, 2007, awards covering 1.13 billion shares were outstanding under the 1996 Plan, the SA Acquisition Plan and the WebEx Acquisition Plan. If awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan are forfeited or terminate before being exercised, then the shares underlying those awards will again become available for awards under the Stock Incentive Plan. Stock appreciation rights will be counted in full against the number of shares available for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan, regardless of the number of shares issued upon settlement of the stock appreciation rights., 184065=The following is a summary of the fees billed to Cisco by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for professional services rendered for the fiscal years ended July 28, 2007 and July 29, 2006:, 244388=(9) Includes 5,022 shares held in the Hennessy 1993 Revocable Trust, and options to purchase 120,000 shares., 455402=SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2008 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS, 192332=John C. Harrington, 1001 2nd Street, Suite 325, Napa, California 94559, a beneficial owner of 300 shares of Cisco common stock, joined by other filers (whose names, addresses and shareholdings will be provided by Cisco promptly upon receipt by Cisco Investor Relations of any oral or written request), have notified us that they intend to present the following proposal at the annual meeting:, 232412=The following table sets forth information known to Cisco with respect to beneficial ownership of Cisco common stock as of July 28, 2007 for (i) each director and nominee, (ii) each holder of 5.0% or greater of Cisco common stock, (iii) Cisco\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the three most highly compensated executive officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) named in the table entitled \u201cSummary Compensation Table\u2014Fiscal 2007\u201d below (the \u201cnamed executive officers\u201d) and (iv) all executive officers and directors as a group., 463121=Dated: September 21, 2007, 168986=Individuals eligible for EIP awards are officers and key employees of Cisco (as determined by the Compensation Committee), which include Cisco\u2019s covered employees and executive officers. Each executive officer and each person who previously served as an executive officer during fiscal 2007 and remains employed by Cisco and is an eligible employee, has an interest in Proposal No. 3. The number of key employees who will participate in the EIP and the amount of EIP awards are not presently determinable., 310913=The following table provides information on stock options, restricted stock units and cash-based performance awards granted in fiscal 2007 to each of Cisco\u2019s named executive officers. There can be no assurance that the Grant Date Fair Value of the Stock Option and Stock Unit Awards will ever be realized. The amounts of these awards that were expensed during fiscal 2007 are included in the \u201cStock Awards\u201d and \u201cOption Awards\u201d columns of the Summary Compensation Table., 288842=Cisco\u2019s variable cash incentive and long-term, equity-based incentive award plans generally provide for forfeiture if a named executive officer participates in activities detrimental to Cisco or is terminated for misconduct. Additionally, consistent with statutory requirements, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the principles of responsible oversight, and depending upon the specific facts and circumstances of each situation, the Compensation Committee would review performance-based compensation where a restatement of financial results for a prior performance period could affect the factors determining payment of an incentive award., 390787=8/12/2014 (24), 103025=Cisco is requesting that shareholders approve the amendment and extension of the Cisco Systems, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201cStock Incentive Plan\u201d), which amendment and extension was approved by the Board of Directors on September 13, 2007, subject to shareholder approval. The 2005 Stock Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2005 Annual Meeting, and unless extended as proposed will terminate at the 2007 Annual Meeting., 296797=The Compensation and Management Development Committee has reviewed and discussed the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section of this Proxy Statement with Cisco\u2019s management. Based on that review and those discussions, the Compensation and Management Development Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into Cisco\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its 2007 fiscal year., 307271=(1) On August 6, 2007, Mr. Powell notified Cisco of his decision to retire from his current position, effective around mid-February 2008., 352117=4/10/2012 (18), 18530=Only shareholders of record of Cisco common stock on September 17, 2007, the record date, will be entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Each shareholder of record will be entitled to one vote on each matter for each share of common stock held on the record date. On the record date, there were 6,099,187,245 shares of common stock outstanding. A majority of the outstanding shares of common stock must be present or represented by proxy at the annual meeting in order to have a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as shares present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when a bank, broker or other shareholder of record holding shares for a beneficial owner submits a proxy for the annual meeting but does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. In the election of directors, a nominee will be elected if the votes cast \u201cfor\u201d the nominee constitute a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the meeting and also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum. Shareholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors. The other proposals also require the approval of the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the annual meeting, together with the affirmative vote of a majority of the required quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect on the determination of whether a nominee or any of the proposals has received the vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the meeting. However, with respect to the election of directors and each of the other proposals, abstentions and broker non-votes could prevent the election of a director or the approval of a proposal where the number of affirmative votes, though a majority of the votes represented and cast, does not constitute a majority of the required quorum. If the persons present or represented by proxy at the annual meeting constitute the holders of less than a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the record date, the annual meeting may be adjourned to a subsequent date for the purpose of obtaining a quorum. The inspector of elections appointed for the annual meeting will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes., 308245=(4) The amounts reflect the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2007, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 123(R), or FAS 123(R), of restricted stock unit awards issued pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan. For restricted stock unit awards, fair value is calculated using the closing price on the grant date as if these awards were vested and issued on the grant date. No stock awards were forfeited by any of our named executive officers during the fiscal year. See the \u201cGrant of Plan-Based Awards\u2014Fiscal 2007\u201d table for information on restricted stock unit awards made in fiscal 2007. These amounts reflect Cisco\u2019s accounting expense for these awards, and do not correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the named executive officers., 290314=Deferred Compensation Plan. In March 2007, the Board approved a new nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the Cisco Systems, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the \u201cDeferred Compensation Plan\u201d), which was effective June 25, 2007. The adoption of the Deferred Compensation Plan by the Board resulted from a review of the prevalence of similar deferred compensation plans operated by Cisco\u2019s Peer Group and a recommendation from the Compensation Committee that the Deferred Compensation Plan should be adopted. The Deferred Compensation Plan is available to all employees with a title of director or above, including the executive officers. A primary rationale for adopting the plan was to provide an opportunity for individual retirement savings on a tax- and cost-effective basis, recognizing that Cisco does not sponsor a pension plan on behalf of the named executive officers or other employees covered by the plan. It was also decided that Cisco would begin making matching contributions in fiscal 2008 as described in the footnote to the \u201cNonqualified Deferred Compensation\u2014Fiscal 2007\u201d table below, based on this same rationale. The Deferred Compensation Plan administrator is Cisco\u2019s 401(k) Plan Administration Committee., 105631=The Compensation Committee has a targeted budget of 185 million shares for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan for fiscal 2008. Despite an expanding work force of 26.6% per year on average from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2007, Cisco has reduced long-term equity incentive grants from 230 million in fiscal 2005 to 200 million in fiscal 2007 with a budget of 185 million for fiscal 2008. In addition, in fiscal 2007, over 80% of all equity awards were granted to employees below the vice president level, demonstrating Cisco\u2019s strong commitment to align not just executive compensation but employee compensation generally with Cisco\u2019s long-term stock performance and shareholders\u2019 interests. The Compensation Committee has awarded to executive officers in fiscal 2008 the right to receive future grants of restricted stock units based on Cisco\u2019s financial performance in fiscal 2008. If this Stock Incentive Plan is approved by shareholders, Cisco will no longer grant awards from the SA Acquisition Plan or the WebEx Acquisition Plan., 89888=(1) Larry R. Carter, a director, is an executive officer of Cisco (other than a named executive officer). Mr. Carter does not receive any compensation for services provided as a director. John P. Morgridge, who served as Chairman of the Board through November 15, 2006, the date of Cisco\u2019s 2006 annual meeting of shareholders, became Chairman Emeritus effective on that date. Mr. Morgridge is an employee of Cisco and receives nominal compensation. Mr. Morgridge did not receive any compensation for services provided as a director., 110533=Remaining shares available for grant as of September 20, 2007 (and estimated to be available on November 14, 2007) under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, 153001=(7) As of July 28, 2007, 276,665,032 shares were available for future issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan, 8,391,914 shares were available for future issuance under the SA Acquisition Plan, 2,497,109 shares were available for future issuance under the WebEx Acquisition Plan, and 5,843,125 shares were available for future issuance under the Supplemental Plan for an aggregate total of 294,397,180 shares available for future issuance under stock incentive plans, as reported in Cisco\u2019s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The shares available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan were 81,621,483 shares, as reported in Cisco\u2019s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K., 291604=CEO Compensation. During most of fiscal 2007, Mr. Chambers\u2019 base salary was $350,000 and it was increased to $375,000 effective July 27, 2007. The Compensation Committee targeted Mr. Chambers\u2019 base salary at less than the 50th percentile of base salaries paid to the chief executive officers of the Peer Group in consideration of Mr. Chambers\u2019 request that a greater percentage of his total cash compensation be at risk and tied to Cisco performance. The Chief Executive Officer will continue to have an annual base salary that is significantly below the 50th percentile of the Peer Group in fiscal 2008; however, his total cash compensation is targeted at the 50th percentile of the Peer Group., 339565=(1) These awards were granted under the Professional and Leadership Incentive Plan for fiscal 2007 and are further described above in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section of this Proxy Statement. The actual payments from these awards are included in the \u201cNon-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation\u201d column in the Summary Compensation Table above. The target and maximum values are calculated by multiplying 125% and 570%, respectively, by the executive\u2019s annual base salary in effect at the end of the 2007 fiscal year. As described in the \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section of this Proxy Statement and the Summary Compensation Table above, in determining the awards under the Professional and Leadership Incentive Plan for fiscal 2007, in June 2007, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion by increasing the target percentage from 60% to 125% which resulted in the maximum percentage increasing from 274% to 570%. The Professional and Leadership Incentive Plan for fiscal 2007 did not contain any threshold value., 383207=$17.2600, 407536=* The market value of the restricted stock units that have not vested is calculated by multiplying the number of units that have not vested by the closing price of our common stock at July 28, 2007, which was $28.97., 74904=During the 2007 fiscal year, cash fees earned by non-employee directors were as follows:, 370962=1/12/2009 (3), 297802=The members of the Compensation Committee during the 2007 fiscal year were: Carol A.

The shares subject to the options vest in two equal annual installments upon the completion of each year of board service and the restricted stock will fully vest upon the completion of one year of board service. The 2005 Stock Incentive Plan does not provide for automatic grants to non-employee directors, but instead provides for discretionary awards to non-employee directors which may not exceed 50,000 shares for any non-employee director in any fiscal year., 365281=9/2/2012 (20), 108901=As of September 20, 2007, the fair market value of a share of Cisco common stock was $32.21., 155609=In connection with Cisco\u2019s acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. on February 24, 2006, Cisco assumed, amended and restated the Scientific-Atlanta\u2019s 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan (renaming it the Cisco Systems, Inc.

In general, awards cease vesting in the event a participant\u2019s employment or services with Cisco or its subsidiaries terminates. Each outstanding award under this plan that is subject to vesting provisions will vest in full and, if applicable, become immediately exercisable in the event that Cisco is acquired by merger or asset sale, unless the award or related agreement is assumed or replaced by the acquiring entity, or in the event there is a hostile change in control or ownership of Cisco, whether through a tender or exchange offer for more than 35% of Cisco\u2019s outstanding voting securities which the Board of Directors does not recommend the shareholders to accept, or a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors as a result of one or more contested elections for board membership.

For fiscal 2007, the Compensation Committee engaged its independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (\u201cFWC\u201d), to provide advice and recommendations on competitive market practices and specific compensation decisions. For purposes of evaluating competitive practices, the Compensation Committee, with assistance from FWC, identified criteria to select a list of 26 companies which comprise the Peer Group. The Peer Group consists of major information technology companies with related Global Industrial Classification System (GICS) codes, market capitalizations greater than $25 billion and revenues greater than $5 billion, and general industry peer companies with market capitalizations of greater than $100 billion that have similar pay models and practices. The Peer Group is as follows:, 182791=Cisco is asking the shareholders to ratify the Audit Committee\u2019s appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Cisco\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending July 26, 2008. In the event the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider this appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in Cisco\u2019s and its shareholders\u2019 best interests., 351285=1/7/2011 (12), 354610=9/29/2014 (25), 383327=11/2/2010 (11), 262998=Base Salary. Annual base salaries for the named executive officers have traditionally been set in the context of providing appropriate performance-based total compensation. FWC conducted a study for the Compensation Committee in 2007 which concluded that base salaries have significantly trailed median competitive practice for the Peer Group. Based on the study, adjustments have been made to the annual base salaries of the named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer for fiscal 2008 to more closely align them with market medians of the Peer Group. Effective July 27, 2007, the annual base salaries for the named executive officers were increased as follows: Dennis D. Powell from $425,000 to $575,000; Richard J. Justice from $450,000 to $750,000; Charles H. Giancarlo from $450,000 to $750,000; and Randy Pond from $450,000 to $575,000. These adjustments allow for continued emphasis on pay for performance with better external competitive alignment and internal equity in relation to other Cisco executives. The Chief Executive Officer will continue to have an annual base salary that is significantly below the 50th percentile of the Peer Group in fiscal 2008, however, his total cash compensation is targeted at the 50th percentile of the Peer Group. This results in the Chief Executive Officer having a greater percentage of his total cash compensation at risk than the other named executive officers., 347933=1/24/2009 (5), 16048=170 West Tasman Drive San Jose, California 95134-1706 PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS, 158572=In connection with Cisco\u2019s acquisition of WebEx Communications, Inc. on May 25, 2007, Cisco assumed, amended and restated the WebEx Communications, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (renaming it the Cisco Systems, Inc. WebEx Acquisition Long-Term Incentive Plan). The Board of Directors has reserved an aggregate of 15,378,787 shares of Cisco common stock for issuance under this plan (including 12,496,382 shares subject to outstanding awards assumed in connection with the acquisition, which become or have become available for grant under this plan to the extent such awards expire unexercised or are cancelled). Only employees of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates who (i) had been employed by WebEx Communications, Inc. or its subsidiaries on or after the acquisition, and (ii) were not employed by Cisco or its subsidiaries at the time of the acquisition, may receive awards under this plan. The plan permits the award of non-statutory stock options, stock grants, stock units and stock appreciation rights. Stock options and stock appreciation rights under this plan may be granted for periods of up to nine years and at prices no less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. Stock grants may and stock units must be issued for no consideration. Stock appreciation rights and stock units may be exercised for or settled in cash, shares of Cisco common stock or a combination of cash and shares. Each award may be subject to vesting. In general, awards cease vesting in the event a participant\u2019s employment or services with Cisco or its subsidiaries terminates. Each outstanding award under this plan that is subject to vesting provisions will vest in full and, if applicable, become immediately exercisable in the event that Cisco is acquired by merger or asset sale, unless the award or related agreement is assumed or replaced by the acquiring entity, or in the event there is a hostile change in control or ownership of Cisco, whether through a tender or exchange offer for more than 35% of Cisco\u2019s outstanding voting securities which the Board of Directors does not recommend the shareholders to accept, or a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors as a result of one or more contested elections for board membership.

The per share exercise price of the stock options is equal to the closing price of a Cisco common share on the grant date, which was $26.60. The shares subject to these options vest in two successive equal annual installments upon the completion of each year of board service. The restricted stock awards vest upon the completion of one year of board service., 301512=2007, 307468=(2) Effective July 27, 2007, each named executive officer above received an increase in annual base salary to the following amounts: Mr. Chambers, $375,000; Mr. Powell, $575,000; Mr. Justice, $750,000; Mr. Giancarlo, $750,000; and Mr. Pond, $575,000.

As part of this transaction, options to purchase Latitude common stock held by employees who continued to be employed by Cisco or Latitude following the transaction were cancelled and replaced with an aggregate of 492,985 options to purchase shares of Cisco common stock. The shares subject to the Latitude replacement options vest on the same vesting schedule as the shares subject to the cancelled options, and have a maximum term of nine (9) years. Each Latitude replacement option has accelerated with respect to 50% of the then-unvested shares if the related employee was terminated under certain circumstances within two years of the effective date of the transaction., 425062=Nonqualified Deferred Compensation \u2014 Fiscal 2007, 42522=Mr. McGeary, 57, has been a member of the Board of Directors since July 2003. He has served as Chairman of the Board of BearingPoint, Inc. since November 2004. From November 2004 to March 2005, he also served as interim Chief Executive Officer of BearingPoint, Inc.

Long-term incentives are the central element of Cisco\u2019s market based executive compensation program. Cisco continues to rely primarily on stock options as its long-term incentive vehicle of choice, and grants stock options to a large employee population to better align the interest of employees with those of shareholders. Over 80% of all equity awards in fiscal 2007 were granted to employees below the vice president level. Because of business strategy considerations and market compensation trends, the Compensation Committee is analyzing grant practices both with respect to the mix of stock options and use of restricted stock/units with different types of performance measures for determining award levels and vesting. In fiscal 2007, the Compensation Committee for the first time granted restricted stock units to its named executive officers, with five year vesting schedules. These grants are desirable for retention purposes and create company ownership since they are full value awards that have value to the holder even if the stock price does not appreciate., 435237=As described above in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, each outstanding award to all employees under the Stock Incentive Plan and the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan that is subject to vesting provisions, and each right to receive future grants of restricted stock units based on satisfaction of performance goals awarded by the Compensation Committee in September 2007, will vest in full (at target with respect to the right to receive future grants) and, if applicable, become immediately exercisable in the event that Cisco is acquired by merger or asset sale, unless the award or related agreement is assumed or replaced by the acquiring entity, or in the event there is a hostile change in control or ownership of Cisco, whether through a tender or exchange offer for more than 35% of Cisco\u2019s outstanding voting securities which the Board of Directors does not recommend the shareholders to accept, or a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors as a result of one or more contested elections for board membership., 243555=(5) Includes 2,588 shares held by the Carter Revocable Trust dated October 18, 1994 and options to purchase 3,449,333 shares. Mr. Carter holds one share in a Cisco subsidiary to meet local statutory shareholder requirements., 12325=170 West Tasman Drive San Jose, California 95134-1706 NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS To Be Held November 15, 2007, 361023=$16.1500, 29314=The Board of Directors appointed Brian L. Halla and Michael K. Powell to the Board of Directors in January 2007 and March 2007, respectively, upon the recommendation of the Nomination and Governance Committee. Mr. Halla and Mr. Powell were brought to the attention of the Nomination and Governance Committee as potential candidates during general discussions by the Nomination and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors., 92137=(4) The amounts reflect the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2007, in accordance with FAS 123(R), of stock option awards issued pursuant to the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and predecessor stock option plans and thus include amounts from outstanding stock option awards granted during and prior to fiscal 2007. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in the notes to Cisco\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2007 as included in Cisco\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 18, 2007. The amounts shown disregard estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. No stock options were forfeited by any of our non-employee directors during the fiscal year other than James C. Morgan who forfeited 10,000 options upon his cessation of service on the board of directors. There is no dollar amount recognized in the table relating to those forfeited options because there was no accounting expense relating to those options in fiscal 2007. The grant date fair value of the option granted on November 15, 2006 to each non-employee director re-elected on that date was $107,550; the grant date fair value of the option granted to Mr. Halla was $419,500, and the grant date fair value of the option granted to Mr. Powell was $397,500. For information regarding the number of stock options held by each non-employee director as of July 28, 2007, see the column \u201cStock Options Outstanding\u201d in the table below. These amounts reflect Cisco\u2019s accounting expense for these awards, and do not correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the non-employee directors., 109761=Shares originally authorized under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan on November 15, 2005, 111990=Note: As of September 20, 2007, Cisco had 1,353,242,571 options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $27.38 and a weighted average life of 5.05 years., 311442=Grants of Plan-Based Awards \u2014 Fiscal 2007, 310710=(7) The amounts represent matching contributions that Cisco made to Cisco\u2019s 401(k) plan during fiscal 2007 on behalf of each named executive officer., 91063=(3) The amounts reflect the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2007, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 123(R), or FAS 123(R), of restricted stock awards issued pursuant to the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. For stock awards, fair value is calculated using the closing price on the grant date as if these awards were vested and issued on the grant date. No stock awards were forfeited by any of our non-employee directors during the fiscal year. The grant date fair value of the stock award granted on November 15, 2006 to each non-employee director re-elected on that date was $133,000. For information regarding the number of stock awards held by each non-employee director as of July 28, 2007, see the column \u201cRestricted Stock Outstanding\u201d in the table below. These amounts reflect Cisco\u2019s accounting expense for these awards, and do not correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the non-employee directors., 211635=Christian Brothers Investment Services, Inc., 90 Park Avenue, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10016-1301, a beneficial owner of 595,095 shares of Cisco common stock, joined by other filers (whose names, addresses and shareholdings will be provided by Cisco promptly upon receipt by Cisco Investor Relations of any oral or written request), have notified us that they intend to present the following proposal at the annual meeting:, 437946=In the event of (a) a hostile change in control of Cisco or change in control in which the awards are not assumed or replaced by the acquiror, or (b) the death or terminal illness of the named executive officer (or permanent disability in the case of the August 23, 2004 option grant to Mr. Chambers), that in either case hypothetically occurred on the last business day of fiscal 2007 and further assuming that as a result all then-unvested equity awards became fully vested, the named executive officers would derive the following intrinsic value (the value based upon the fiscal 2007 year-end closing price for a Cisco common share of $28.97, and in the case of stock options minus the exercise price) from such equity awards:, 397283=8/4/2009 (7), 451715=A son of Richard J. Justice, an executive officer of Cisco, is employed by Cisco as the manager of regional sales for the Phoenix metro region. Mr. Justice\u2019s son received total compensation of $279,994 for fiscal 2007, calculated in the same manner as in the Summary Compensation Table. The total compensation includes salary, commissions, option awards, relocation expenses and matching contributions under Cisco\u2019s 401(k) plan., 39915=Mr. Chambers, 58, has served as a member of the Board of Directors since November 1993 and as Chairman of the Board since November 2006. He joined Cisco as Senior Vice President in January 1991, was promoted to Executive Vice President in June 1994 and to Chief Executive Officer as of January 31, 1995. He also served as President from January 31, 1995 until November 2006. Before joining Cisco, he was employed by Wang Laboratories, Inc. for eight years, where, in his last role, he was the Senior Vice President of U.S. Operations., 419768=Outstanding Options, other than August 23, 2004 Grant to Mr. Chambers, 225136=Legislation was introduced in the House prohibiting, \u201cbusiness from cooperating with officials of Internet-restricting countries in effecting the political censorship of on-line content.\u201d The proposed legislation currently provides for both fines and jail time (The Global Online Freedom Act of 2006 (H.R. 4780))., 143894=The following table provides information as of July 28, 2007 with respect to the shares of Cisco common stock that may be issued under existing equity compensation plans. The category \u201cEquity compensation plans approved by security holders\u201d in the table below consists of the Stock Incentive Plan, the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and its sub-plan, the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The category \u201cEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders\u201d in the table below consists of the 1997 Supplemental Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201cSupplemental Plan\u201d), the SA Acquisition Plan that was adopted in connection with Cisco\u2019s acquisition of Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. in accordance with applicable NASDAQ listing standards, the WebEx Acquisition Plan that was adopted in connection with Cisco\u2019s acquisition of WebEx Communications, Inc. in accordance with applicable NASDAQ listing standards and options to purchase shares of Cisco common stock that were issued to replace cancelled options in connection with Cisco\u2019s acquisition of Latitude Communications, Inc.

In addition, the table does not include information with respect to shares subject to outstanding awards granted under other equity compensation arrangements assumed by Cisco in connection with mergers and acquisitions of the companies that originally granted those awards and does include shares we are proposing to add to the Stock Incentive Plan in Proposal No. 2., 287213=Each right to receive future grants of restricted stock units described in the preceding paragraph granted in September 2007 and each outstanding award under Cisco\u2019s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (and 1996 Stock Incentive Plan) that is subject to vesting provisions will vest in full (at target with respect to the right to receive future grants) and, if applicable, become immediately exercisable in the event that Cisco is acquired by merger or asset sale, unless the award or related agreement is assumed or replaced by the acquiring entity, or in the event there is a hostile change in control or ownership of Cisco, whether through a tender or exchange offer for more than 35% of Cisco\u2019s outstanding voting securities which the Board of Directors does not recommend the shareholders to accept, or a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors as a result of one or more contested elections for board membership. Cisco believes that \u201csingle trigger\u201d equity vesting is appropriate under the circumstances described above to ensure that employees are not deprived of their equity when Cisco may not be able to arrange for appropriate vesting continuation terms and conditions. Cisco does not provide for any excise tax \u201cgross-up\u201d arrangements for its named executive officers, nor does it provide employment agreements with cash severance provisions.

The EIP does not have a fixed termination date and may be terminated by the Compensation Committee at any time, provided that such termination will not affect the payment of any award accrued prior to the time of termination. The Compensation Committee may amend or suspend, and reinstate, the EIP at any time, provided that any such amendment or reinstatement shall be subject to shareholder approval if required by Code Section 162(m), or any other applicable laws, rules or regulations., 78078=In connection with their appointments to the Board during fiscal 2007, Mr. Halla and Mr. Powell each received a stock option grant to purchase 50,000 shares under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan at a per share exercise price equal to the closing price of a share of Cisco common stock on the date of grant. The shares subject to each option will vest in four successive equal annual installments upon the completion of each year of board service over the four-year period measured from the grant date.

The address of Barclays Global Investors, NA is 45 Fremont Street, San Francisco, CA 94105., 170266=Bonus payments under the EIP may be made in cash only. The payment to each participant is based on an individual bonus target for the performance period set by the Compensation Committee in writing and is directly related to the satisfaction of the applicable performance goal(s) set by the Compensation Committee for such performance period. A performance goal is an objective formula or standard utilizing one or more of the following factors and any objectively verifiable adjustment(s) thereto permitted and preestablished by the Compensation Committee in accordance with Code Section 162(m): (i) operating income; (ii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (iii) earnings; (iv) cash flow; (v) market share; (vi) sales, (vii) revenue; (viii) profits before interest and taxes; (ix) expenses; (x) cost of goods sold; (xi) profit/loss or profit margin; (xii) working capital; (xiii) return on capital, equity or assets; (xiv) earnings per share; (xv) economic value added; (xvi) stock price; (xvii) price/earnings ratio; (xviii) debt or debt-to-equity; (xix) accounts receivable; (xx) write-offs; (xxi) cash; (xxii) assets; (xxiii) liquidity; (xxiv) operations; (xxv) intellectual property (e.g., patents); (xxvi) product development; (xxvii) regulatory activity; (xxviii) manufacturing, production or inventory; (xxix) mergers and acquisitions or divestitures; (xxx) financings and/or (xxxi) customer satisfaction, each with respect to Cisco and/or one or more of its affiliates or operating units.

The bonus payable to a participant who is not a covered employee may also be based on other factors (including subjective factors). A performance period is any period up to 36 months in duration. The performance period(s) individual bonus target(s) and performance goal(s) will be adopted by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion with respect to each performance period and, with respect to covered employees, must be adopted no later than the latest time permitted by the Internal Revenue Code in order for bonus payments pursuant to the EIP to be deductible under Code Section 162(m)., 153738=The 1997 Supplemental Stock Incentive Plan, 265072=The annual cash incentive awards for named executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer whose annual cash incentive award is described in the subsequent section entitled \u201cCEO Compensation,\u201d for fiscal 2007 were determined under Cisco\u2019s 2007 Professional and Leadership Incentive Plan (the \u201cPLI Plan\u201d) with reference to Cisco\u2019s achievement of established financial performance goals, customer satisfaction criteria and the executive\u2019s individual contribution. The Compensation Committee established the financial performance goals so that they are consistent with the goals that are in Cisco\u2019s fiscal 2007 business plan established by the Board of Directors. The cash awards under the PLI Plan are calculated by multiplying annual base salary at fiscal year-end by the individual\u2019s target award percentage multiplied by a financial performance factor, a customer satisfaction factor and an individual performance factor. The financial performance factor ranges from 0.0 to 2.0, the customer satisfaction factor ranges from 0.0 to 1.14 and the individual performance factor ranges from 0.0 to 2.0, with the target for each of the factors being 1.0. For fiscal 2007, a target award was established for each participating named executive officer and such target award was set at 60% of the executive officer\u2019s annual base salary. As noted above, FWC conducted a study for the Compensation Committee in June 2007 which was also used to review the fiscal 2007 target awards for the named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. The study concluded that 2007 target awards of 60% were significantly below the 50th percentile of the Peer Group. Based on this study and for retention and internal equity purposes, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion under the PLI Plan to increase target awards percentages from 60% to 125% to achieve the 50th percentile target annual cash compensation philosophy overall. This means that annual cash incentive awards for the named executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer, which were set with reference to the median for comparable positions of the Peer Group, are 125% of base salaries. The maximum awards could be 570% of base salaries assuming maximum financial performance, customer satisfaction and individual performance factors., 350456=8/21/2010 (10), 233050=Beneficial ownership is determined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Except as indicated in the footnotes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property laws, to Cisco\u2019s knowledge the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned. The number of shares beneficially owned by each person or group as of July 28, 2007 includes shares of common stock that such person or group had the right to acquire on or within 60 days after July 28, 2007, including, but not limited to, upon the exercise of options or the vesting of restricted stock units. References to options in the footnotes of the table below include only options to purchase shares that were exercisable on or within 60 days after July 28, 2007 and references to restricted stock units in the footnotes of the table below include only restricted stock units that would vest and settle on or within 60 days after July 28, 2007. For each individual and group included in the table below, percentage ownership is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person or group by the sum of the 6,100,297,000 shares of common stock outstanding on July 28, 2007 plus the number of shares of common stock that such person or group had the right to acquire on or within 60 days after July 28, 2007., 347105=4/16/2008 (2), 15877=San Jose, California September 21, 2007, 229546=In 2005, we issued our first annual Corporate Citizenship Report, which addresses our performance in areas including human rights generally, our progress towards the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, employee welfare, diversity, training and development, supplier diversity and ethics, environmental impact of product design and lifecycle and our facilities and operations, and our social investments across the world. We plan to publish our third annual Corporate Citizenship Report in the fall of 2007, and we intend to issue regular updates thereafter which are expected to provide updated comparative data of our objectives, goals, targets and measures. We believe the preparation and issuance of this report, together with future updates, addresses the intent of the proponents\u2019 proposal., 267453=Actual awards, calculated as described in the preceding paragraph, are based on the extent to which Cisco achieves its financial performance goals, the level of customer satisfaction and an assessment of each executive\u2019s individual contribution. In fiscal 2007, based on customer responses to a survey with questions relating to customer satisfaction, the Compensation Committee determined that Cisco exceeded its customer satisfaction goal resulting in a multiplier of 1.14. The Compensation Committee also determined that Cisco exceeded its financial performance goals, with worldwide revenue for Cisco (excluding the effects of Cisco\u2019s acquisitions of Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., WebEx Communications, Inc. and IronPort Systems, Inc.) increasing 16.7% over fiscal 2006 from $27.495 billion to $32.080 billion, and profit before interest and taxes up 14.8% year over year from $8.590 billion to $9.865 billion, resulting in a multiplier of 1.09. Profit before interest and taxes was Cisco\u2019s GAAP operating income excluding the following: in-process research and development, payroll tax on stock option exercises, employee share-based compensation expense, compensation expense related to acquisitions and investments, amortization of purchased intangible assets, impact to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory, certain property or real estate gains or losses, and the effects of Cisco\u2019s acquisitions of Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., WebEx Communications, Inc. and IronPort Systems, Inc. For fiscal 2007, the worldwide revenue target was $30.475 billion and actual results were $32.080 billion, and the profit before interest and taxes target was $9.069 billion and actual results were $9.865 billion. If actual results had equaled the targets, the financial performance multiplier would have been 1.0. The awards paid reflect actual results achieved along with the recognition of individual contributions which vary for each named executive officer as noted in the table below. Each named executive officer was evaluated and scored by the Chief Executive Officer based on performance categories including contribution to successful achievement of fiscal 2007 Cisco revenue and operating income growth, customer growth, leadership at Cisco and in his/her area of responsibility, strategic planning and implementation and innovation. The Chief Executive Officer\u2019s individual performance evaluations of the named executive officers are presented to the Compensation Committee for review and approval. Based on the strong performance of each of the named executive officers in fiscal 2007, the Compensation Committee approved the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s above-target recommendations set forth below. Bonus payments for fiscal 2007 pursuant to the PLI Plan to the named executive officers were made as follows:, 188402=Tax Fees. Consists of fees billed for professional services for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and international tax compliance, assistance with tax reporting requirements and audit compliance, assistance with customs and duties compliance, value-added tax compliance, mergers and acquisitions tax compliance, and tax advice on international, federal and state tax matters. None of these services were provided under contingent fee arrangements. Tax compliance fees were $1,367,000 and $979,000 in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. All other tax fees were $36,000 and $7,000 in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively., 205781=Our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee support performance-based compensation arrangements as a cornerstone component of executive compensation. One of the central principles underlying our incentive programs and compensation philosophy is pay for performance. A significant portion of our total direct compensation for executive officers consists of performance-based compensation in the form of annual bonuses and stock options and/or restricted stock or stock units, and the Compensation Committee benchmarks against a relevant peer group of companies. The base salary for our Chief Executive Officer is targeted at or below the 50th percentile of our peer group and the base salaries for other named executive officers are targeted at the 50th percentile of our peer group. For fiscal 2008, the bonuses for executive officers are expected to be paid pursuant to a plan compliant with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode Section 162(m)\u201d) that is performance-based and subject to shareholder approval (see Proposal No. 3 on page 27). In addition, stock options are inherently performance-based because they only have value to the recipients if the price of Cisco\u2019s common stock appreciates after the options are granted., 196488=Cisco strives to treat employees, and the communities in which we operate, with respect and dignity. We are a supporter of the United Nations Global Compact, and have participated in this initiative since 2001. In 2005, we began issuing annually a Corporate Citizenship Report that addresses our performance in areas including human rights generally, our progress towards the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, employee welfare, diversity, training and development, supplier diversity and ethics, environmental impact of product design and lifecycle and our facilities and operations, and our social investments across the world. We plan to publish our third annual Corporate Citizenship Report in the fall of 2007, and we intend to issue regular updates thereafter which are expected to provide updated comparative data of our objectives, goals, targets and measures., 130456=All awards to directors, executive officers, employees and consultants are made at the discretion of the Stock Incentive Plan administrator. Therefore, the benefits and amounts that will be received or allocated under the Stock Incentive Plan as amended and extended are not determinable at this time. The following table is for illustrative purposes only and provides certain summary information concerning equity awards made in fiscal 2007., 295143=In September 2007, the Compensation Committee also made an annual stock option grant to Mr. Chambers to purchase up to 900,000 shares of Common Stock, and the right to receive a target of 200,000 future restricted stock units based on Cisco\u2019s financial performance in fiscal 2008. The option and restricted stock units have the same vesting and other conditions as awards granted to the other named executive officers. Based on Cisco\u2019s record financial performance and outstanding shareholder return in fiscal 2007, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Chambers\u2019 awards at the 50th percentile level of equity grants provided to chief executive officers of the Peer Group. A portion of Mr. Chambers\u2019 award was structured as a right to receive future performance-based restricted stock units for retention and internal equity reasons., 452196=In January 2002, Cisco loaned $1,648,750 to Wim Elfrink, currently Executive Vice President, Customer Advocacy and Chief Globalization Officer and an executive officer, in connection with his relocation to the United States at a time when he was not an executive officer of Cisco. Since the beginning of Cisco\u2019s last fiscal year through February 2007, the loan had an interest rate of 2.76% and an interest rate of 4.87% thereafter. The loan was secured by a deed of trust on real property. Since the beginning of Cisco\u2019s last fiscal year, the original principal amount of the loan was the largest principal amount outstanding and the amount of interest paid was $288,747. The loan, including all accrued interest, was paid in full in connection with his appointment as an executive officer., 348799=11/13/2009 (8), 90480=(2) Includes the value of fully vested shares of Cisco common stock received in lieu of a specified portion of the non-employee director\u2019s regular annual cash retainer based on the fair market value of the shares on November 15, 2006, the date the regular annual cash retainer would otherwise have been paid. Based on each director\u2019s prior election, Ms. Bartz, Ms. Burns and Mr. West each received 704 shares with a value of $18,726, and Mr. Capellas, Dr. Hennessy and Mr. Yang each received 1,409 shares with a value of $37,479., 293550=During fiscal 2007, as part of the on-going companywide grant, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Chambers an option to purchase up to 1,300,000 shares of Cisco common stock at an exercise price of $23.01 per share. The Compensation Committee considered Mr. Chambers\u2019 request that his grant amount be the same as the prior fiscal year. The Compensation Committee concluded that this option grant was appropriate given Mr. Chambers\u2019 equity compensation gain accumulations over time in relation to Cisco\u2019s corresponding growth in value under his leadership, Cisco\u2019s financial results for fiscal 2006, and the resulting total compensation value which remains well below the 50th percentile of the Peer Group. The exercise price represented the closing selling price per share of Cisco\u2019s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the grant date. The option grant places a significant portion of Mr. Chambers\u2019 total compensation at risk, since the option grant delivers a return only if Cisco\u2019s share price appreciates over the option\u2019s exercisable term., 221521=Boston Common Asset Management, LLC, 84 State Street, Suite 1000, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, a beneficial owner of 133,468 shares of Cisco common stock, joined by other filers (whose names, addresses and shareholdings will be provided by Cisco promptly upon receipt by Cisco Investor Relations of any oral or written request), have notified us that they intend to present the following proposal at the meeting:, 420254=August 23, 2004 Option Grant to Mr. Chambers, 353658=$19.1800, 456517=Requirements for Shareholder Proposals to be Brought Before the Annual Meeting. Cisco\u2019s bylaws provide that, except in the case of proposals made in accordance with Rule 14a-8, for shareholder nominations to the Board of Directors or other proposals to be considered at an annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of Cisco not less than sixty nor more than ninety calendar days prior to the anniversary of the date on which Cisco first mailed its proxy materials for its immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders (as specified in Cisco\u2019s proxy materials for its immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders). To be timely for the 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a shareholder\u2019s notice must be delivered or mailed to and received by Cisco\u2019s Secretary at the principal executive offices of Cisco between June 28, 2008 and July 28, 2008. However, in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty calendar days of the anniversary of the date on which the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders was called, to be timely, notice by the shareholder must be so received not later than the close of business on the tenth calendar day following the date on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made. In no event will the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting of shareholders commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholder\u2019s notice as provided above. A shareholder\u2019s notice to Cisco\u2019s Secretary must set forth the information required by Cisco\u2019s bylaws with respect to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting., 125174=Awards under the Stock Incentive Plan may be made subject to performance conditions as well as time-vesting conditions. Such performance conditions may be established and administered in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), for awards intended to qualify as \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d thereunder. To the extent that performance conditions under the Stock Incentive Plan are applied to awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m), such performance conditions shall be based on an objective formula or standard utilizing one or more of the following factors and any objectively verifiable adjustment(s) thereto permitted and preestablished by the Compensation Committee in accordance with Code Section 162(m): (i) operating income; (ii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (iii) earnings; (iv) cash flow; (v) market share; (vi) sales; (vii) revenue; (viii) profit before interest and taxes; (ix) expenses; (x) cost of goods sold; (xi) profit/loss or profit margin; (xii) working capital; (xiii) return on capital, equity or assets; (xiv) earnings per share; (xv) economic value added; (xvi) stock price; (xvii) price/earnings ratio; (xviii) debt or debt-to-equity; (xix) accounts receivable; (xx) write-offs; (xxi) cash; (xxii) assets; (xxiii) liquidity; (xxiv) operations; (xxv) intellectual property (e.g., patents); (xxvi) product development; (xxvii) regulatory activity; (xxviii) manufacturing, production or inventory; (xxix) mergers and acquisitions or divestitures; (xxx) financings; and/or (xxxi) customer satisfaction, each with respect to Cisco and/or one or more of its operating units. For example, see \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u2014Long-Term, Equity-Based Incentive Awards\u201d on page 49 of this Proxy Statement for the fiscal 2008 performance conditions and objectively verifiable adjustments preestablished by the Compensation Committee for the rights to receive future grants of restricted stock units., 14013=The foregoing items of business are more fully described in the Proxy Statement accompanying this Notice. The record date for determining those shareholders who will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting and at any adjournments or postponements thereof is September 17, 2007. The stock transfer books will not be closed between the record date and the date of the annual meeting. A list of shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting will be available for inspection at Cisco\u2019s principal executive offices at the address listed above., 453829=The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with Cisco\u2019s management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the audited consolidated financial statements of Cisco contained in Cisco\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 2007 fiscal year. The Audit Committee has also discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the matters required to be discussed by SAS No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1. AU section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T., 386635=1/10/2012 (17), 110111=Shares granted (less available cancellations) and shares expired from July 30, 2005 through September 20, 2007 from the 1996 and 2005 Stock Incentive Plans, 149910=(2) Includes shares available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan including its sub-plan, the International Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of July 28, 2007, as reported in Cisco\u2019s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, an aggregate of 81,621,483 shares of common stock were available for future issuance under this purchase plan. Also includes up to 27,722,222 shares that may be issued as stock grants, stock units or stock appreciation rights under the Stock Incentive Plan. Under the Stock Incentive Plan, non-employee directors may also elect to receive fully vested shares of common stock (and if the amendment and extension of the Stock Incentive Plan is approved, stock units) in lieu of all or a specified portion of their regular annual cash retainer based on the fair market value of the shares on the date any regular annual cash retainer would otherwise be paid., 244550=(10) Includes 9,460 shares held by the 1990 Justice Family Trust, options to purchase 2,147,917 shares and 20,000 shares subject to restricted stock units. Mr. Justice holds one share in a Cisco subsidiary to meet local statutory shareholder requirements., 184666=Fiscal 2007 Fees, 283143=During fiscal 2007, the Compensation Committee made option grants to Cisco\u2019s named executive officers under Cisco\u2019s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. Each grant allows the executive officer to acquire shares of Cisco\u2019s common stock at the closing selling price of Cisco\u2019s common stock on the grant date. The option grants will provide a return only if Cisco\u2019s share price appreciates over the option term. During fiscal 2007, in addition to option grants, the Compensation Committee granted restricted stock units to the named executive officers. These restricted stock unit grants were part of a program designed to retain key executives and top performers. Long-term incentives granted to named executive officers in fiscal 2007 were reasonable and appropriate in light of Cisco\u2019s shareholder returns relative to the Peer Group. We refer you to the table entitled \u201cGrants of Plan-Based Awards\u2014Fiscal 2007\u201d on page 56 of this Proxy Statement for additional information regarding equity awards to Cisco\u2019s named executive officers in fiscal 2007., 284234=In September 2007, the Compensation Committee made its fiscal 2008 annual awards to Cisco\u2019s named executive officers under Cisco\u2019s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. Grants of stock options, and the right to receive future grants of restricted stock units based on Cisco\u2019s financial performance in fiscal 2008, were made to the named executive officers as follows: Mr. Justice, 570,000 stock options and a target of 126,666 future restricted stock units; Mr. Giancarlo, 570,000 stock options and a target of 126,666 future restricted stock units; and Mr. Pond, 480,000 stock options and a target of 106,666 future restricted stock units. No awards were granted to Mr. Powell in fiscal 2008 in light of his pending retirement. The Compensation Committee\u2019s philosophy for these grants is that 60% of the total grants be in stock options, which have value only if Cisco\u2019s share price increases over the option term and the remaining 40% consists of the right to receive future performance-based restricted stock units, which have retention value if Cisco achieves its financial performance goals because of a four-year vesting schedule thereafter. The Compensation Committee determined to structure the equity awards so that a significant portion of these awards have retention value if performance goals are achieved. The Compensation Committee selected future performance-based restricted stock units because these amounts increase the named executive officer\u2019s equity interest in Cisco which is in direct alignment with shareholder interests. The amounts of these awards were determined based on the 75th percentile of the Peer Group. The grant of the right to receive future restricted stock units is based on a conversion ratio that one restricted stock unit is equivalent to three stock options. The Compensation Committee believes this conversion ratio is appropriate in light of the Compensation Committee\u2019s targeting the 75th percentile of the Peer Group. Operating income (excluding the same factors as described above for the variable cash incentive awards) is the performance factor for the right to receive the restricted stock units, which like the variable cash incentive award factors discussed above, aligns with Cisco\u2019s financial growth strategy. Depending on Cisco\u2019s annual operating income growth in fiscal 2008 and assuming shareholders approve the amendment and extension of the Stock Incentive Plan (see Proposal No. 2 in this Proxy Statement), 0% to 120% of the restricted stock units will actually be granted. Based on Cisco\u2019s financial performance in prior years, the Compensation Committee believes that there is an 80% to 95% chance that at least 50% of the restricted stock units will be granted, a 50% to 60% chance that at least 100% of the restricted stock units (the target number of shares described above) will be granted and a 15% to 25% chance that 120% of the restricted stock units will be granted., 309146=(5) The amounts reflect the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2007, in accordance with FAS 123(R) of stock option awards issued pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan and predecessor stock option plans and thus includes amounts from outstanding stock option awards granted during and prior to fiscal 2007. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in the notes to Cisco\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 28, 2007 as included in Cisco\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 18, 2007. The amounts shown disregard estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions. No stock options were forfeited by any of our named executive officers during the fiscal year. See the \u201cGrant of Plan-Based Awards\u2014Fiscal 2007\u201d table for information on stock option grants made in fiscal 2007. These amounts reflect Cisco\u2019s accounting expense for these awards, and do not correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the named executive officers., 361143=4/5/2011 (13), 292362=For fiscal 2007, Mr. Chambers\u2019 annual bonus of $3,500,000 was determined in the Compensation Committee\u2019s sole discretion. The Compensation Committee considers this amount of annual bonus, which is above the 50th percentile of actual bonuses paid for the comparable position in the Peer Group, to be appropriate given Cisco\u2019s record financial results in fiscal 2007 and Mr. Chambers\u2019 performance and leadership in achieving these results. The fiscal 2007 bonus together with the fiscal 2007 base salary puts Mr. Chambers\u2019 total cash compensation slightly below the 50th percentile of actual total cash compensation paid for the comparable position in the Peer Group. For fiscal 2008, Mr. Chambers will participate in Cisco\u2019s new Executive Incentive Plan, subject to shareholder approval, and his target bonus percentage will be 185% of the market median of chief executive officers\u2019 base salary of the Peer Group (which median is $1,121,000) rather than based on his current annual base salary of $375,000. Mr. Chambers\u2019 target bonus was established by the Compensation Committee with reference to the 50th percentile of the Peer Group., 151433=(4) Excludes options, warrants and other equity rights assumed by Cisco in connection with mergers and acquisitions, other than assumed under the SA Acquisition Plan and the WebEx Acquisition Plan. As of July 28, 2007, a total of 38,916,023 shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options under those other assumed arrangements. The weighted average exercise price of those outstanding options is $15.23 per share. No additional awards may be granted under those assumed arrangements., 29796=Cisco\u2019s bylaws and Corporate Governance Policies were amended in March 2007 to change the voting standard for uncontested elections of directors to what is referred to as a majority voting standard. As a result, in an election where the Board of Directors has determined that the number of nominees for director does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, a nominee for director will be elected to the Board of Directors to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders, and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, if the number of shares voted for the nominee exceeds the number of shares voted against the nominee and also represents the affirmative vote of a majority of the required quorum. The required quorum for a meeting of Cisco shareholders is a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock. The majority voting standard does not apply, however, if the Board of Directors has determined that the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected. In that case, the nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting will be elected., 436342=In addition, pursuant to a Compensation Committee policy (the \u201cDeath and Terminal Illness Policy\u201d) which applies to each outstanding award to all employees (other than as described in the last sentence of this paragraph) and to the rights to receive grants of restricted stock units based on satisfaction of performance goals awarded by the Compensation Committee in September 2007, and which can be revoked or changed at any time, if the holder of such an award dies or becomes terminally ill, his or her aggregate awards will generally vest in an amount equal to the greater of 100% of the unvested shares subject to the awards up to a total value of $10 million, net of aggregate exercise or purchase price, or up to one year of vesting from the date of death or determination of terminal illness. For purposes of this policy, shares subject to each award are valued based on the closing price per share of common stock on the date of death or determination of terminal illness. The dollar limit under the Death and Terminal Illness Policy does not apply to an option grant made to Mr. Chambers on August 23, 2004 to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of Cisco common stock at an exercise price of $19.18 that vests in full upon Mr. Chambers\u2019 death or permanent disability. In addition, for purposes of the stock option agreement relating to the August 23, 2004 grant, \u201cservice\u201d includes providing services directly to Cisco or employment by educational or governmental institutions if those institutions\u2019 policies preclude continued service to Cisco., 183469=PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited Cisco\u2019s consolidated financial statements annually since Cisco\u2019s 1988 fiscal year. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. It is also expected that those representatives will be available to respond to appropriate questions., 74680=This section provides information regarding the compensation policies for non-employee directors and amounts paid and securities awarded to these directors in fiscal 2007., 53603=During Cisco\u2019s fiscal year ended July 28, 2007, the Board of Directors held seven meetings. During this period, all of the incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of Directors on which each such director served, during the period for which each such director served. Cisco\u2019s directors are strongly encouraged to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. Ten of Cisco\u2019s directors attended last year\u2019s annual meeting., 424673=In fiscal 2007, the Board of Directors approved a new nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the Cisco Systems, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan. The following table shows each named executive officer\u2019s contributions and earnings during fiscal 2007, and account balance as of July 28, 2007, under the Deferred Compensation Plan., 363621=10/10/2011 (16), 153843=The Supplemental Plan was implemented by the Board of Directors on July 31, 1997 and expires on December 31, 2007. The Supplemental Plan is a non-shareholder approved plan, and Cisco will no longer make option grants or share issuances under the Supplemental Plan. Options were only granted and direct share issuances of common stock were only made under the Supplemental Plan to employees of Cisco (or any parent or subsidiary corporation) who were neither officers nor board members at the time of grant. The Board of Directors authorized 9,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Supplemental Plan. All option grants have an exercise price per share, and all share issuances have a purchase price per share, equal to the closing price per share of common stock on the grant or issuance date. Each option or share issuance may be subject to vesting. Any unvested options or share issuances will immediately vest and become exercisable in full upon certain changes in ownership of Cisco if the options are not assumed or replaced by the acquiring entity or the repurchase rights relating to share issuances are not assigned to the acquiring entity, as applicable. All options are non-statutory options under the federal tax law. As of July 28, 2007, options covering 2,266,135 shares of common stock were outstanding under the Supplemental Plan, 5,843,125 shares remained available for future option grants or share issuances, and options covering 890,740 shares had been exercised. No option grants or share issuances were made in fiscal 2007 under the Supplemental Plan., 128872=The Board of Directors may amend the Stock Incentive Plan at any time and for any reason, provided that any such amendment will be subject to shareholder approval to the extent shareholder approval is required by applicable laws, regulations, or rules. The Board of Directors may terminate the Stock Incentive Plan at any time and for any reason, and the Stock Incentive Plan is currently set to terminate at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders unless re-adopted or extended by the shareholders prior to or on such date. The termination or amendment of the Stock Incentive Plan will not impair the rights or obligations of any participant under any award previously made under the Stock Incentive Plan without the participant\u2019s consent., 94144=Each of the below non-employee directors (and former non-employee directors) owned the following number of restricted shares and stock options as of July 28, 2007., 41616=Mr. Kovacevich, 63, has been a member of the Board of Directors since January 2005. He currently serves as Chairman of the Board of Wells Fargo & Company, which position he has held since April 2001. He also served as Chief Executive Officer of Wells Fargo & Company from November 1998 to June 2007, and as President from November 1998 to July 2005. From January 1993 to November 1998, he served as Chief Executive Officer of Norwest Corporation, which merged with Wells Fargo & Company in November 1998. He also served as President of Norwest Corporation from January 1993 through January 1997 and as Chairman of the Board of Norwest Corporation from May 1995 to November 1998. He became a member of the board of directors of Norwest Corporation in 1986. Mr. Kovacevich also currently serves on the board of directors of Target Corporation., 72721=In particular, for the Nominating and Governance Committee to consider a candidate recommended by a shareholder for nomination at the 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the recommendation must be delivered or mailed to and received by Cisco\u2019s Secretary between June 28, 2008 and July 28, 2008 (or, if the 2008 annual meeting is not held within 30 calendar days of the anniversary of the date of the 2007 annual meeting, within 10 calendar days after Cisco\u2019s public announcement of the date of the 2008 annual meeting). The recommendation must include the same information as is specified in Cisco\u2019s bylaws for shareholder nominees to be considered at an annual meeting, including the following:, 420850=The following table shows the number of shares acquired by the exercise of stock options by each of the named executive officers during fiscal 2007 along with the value realized on such exercises as calculated based on the difference between the market price of Cisco\u2019s stock at exercise and the option exercise price. None of the named executive officers had any vesting of restricted stock unit awards during fiscal 2007., 296181=The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be \u201csoliciting material,\u201d to be \u201cfiled\u201d with the SEC or be subject to Regulation 14A or Regulation 14C (other than as provided in Item 407 of Regulation S-K) or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC except to the extent that Cisco specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.}",
