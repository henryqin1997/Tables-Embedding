    "textAfterTable": "Fast Facts > This Time It's Not Vigneault's Fault: The Canucks will enjoy some more line juggling tonight. We know Raymond is back after missing one game with a bum shoulder. That move will demote Tambellini to the fourth line where it's a toss up between him and deadline acquisition Chris Higgins. I suspect Vigneault wants to get the new guy in there, meaning Tambo takes a seat. If Higgins is a go, will he get sheltered fourth line duties or could he move up, especially if the Canucks are playing from behind and Raymond's shoulder injury returns? At least we know the Sedin line is safe. > Special Teams Limping: The Sharks PK has had a rough go recently, some of which can be attributed to the loss of Dan Boyle to an upper body injury. This too has affected their otherwise proficient power play which has gone 2-for-14 since Boyle's been out. McLellanhas spread the tough minutes around the rest of the blueline, but if the Canucks can counter with strong puck possession (as they displayed against the Kings for instance) they may be able to keep San Jose on their heels most of the game. The Sharks play strong on the puck as well and, though their goals per game is off from last year, no team shoots more at even strength (33.9). Schneider will see no",
