            "Lots of hobos and reports of violence/robbery. It's probably safer than it seems but I'm international after all so I worry.",
            "Huge variety, and lots of freedom to start one if you have something specific in mind.",
            "....study. LOOOL. It's Berkeley after all. And eat. Lots of good restaurants! Emeryville is a bus ride away if you want to shop, not to mention all the amazing SF spots made accessible by BART! Six Flags is an adventure park that's short drive away, and you can also take lessons at the on-campus ropes course or the Berkeley marina.",
            "Quite expensive imo. But there are a lot of options and good cafes scattered around campus.",
            "Really depends on your luck. I was in a double mini-suite, which means I don't have to share a public bathroom with an entire floor but also that everyone tends to keep their doors closed and we get SIGNIFICANTLY less time to interact with my floormates. Some people get good floors and some people don't. Really depends. As for furnishing, cleanliness etc.... it's standard.",
            "In every subject, there's going to be intense people setting the curve high, and professors are quite ruthless in grading. You have to realize that in every class, there are geniuses in that subject matter who are ALSO hardworking, and it's hard to compete with them when you're not putting 100% effort in the class. Also, number of units are sometimes not reflective of the effort you have to put in in order to succeed in the class. What matters more is whether it's a technical class or not. But of course, there are easy A classes if you know where to look. They're just also quite useless.",
            "1. Be prepared for the slight cultural shock if your high school doesn't have a lot of Asians. 2. If you're a person of faith, fellowship-hop until you find one that feels right in your gut! There are loads of big churches here and you'd be missing out if you settle down too soon. Although there seems to be pressure to commit and be loyal to your home church, most are open to the idea of church-hopping, especially if you're a freshman. 3. Set your priorities straight, and revise them every semester. Cal is the kind of school where everyone seems to be doing everything perfectly and still find the time to party hard. After 3 semesters of devoting myself to various leadership positions I finally decided to focus on studies and strengthening my faith. It pays to realize early that you CANNOT do everything at once. Trust me, you think it's simple, but its SO easy to forget once you get here. 4. Put yourself out there!! Cal is an incredibly big school and the quicker you find your core group of friends, the happier you'll be. 5. Talk to academic advisors about your academic plans, and be open to trying new subjects. 6. L&S Discovery Courses are the best if you're looking for a fabulous professor and interesting topics. Also keep your eyes open for courses taught by professors that won awards.",
            "An amazing school with ambitious, driven, and incredibly smart students in almost every field. Perhaps due to my prospective majors (Econ / Biz with an IEOR minor), most of friends are Asians with a very similar -- albeit a bit narrow -- view of what success is. However, I truly believe that everyone can find a place for themselves here, thanks to its free and tolerant culture: I, for one, found my second home my first semester here."

A lot of it comes from the fact that it is in the bay area which is usually expensive to live in, but the quality of education here makes it worth it. There is a lot of financial aid available, so it is easy to come up with the money to pay for it. I'm paying about $1000 for the whole year out of pocket and it is definitely worth it, especially for being the number one public university in the world!, 698157=Holi happens every year in April on campus, it is a huge paint fight put on by the Indian Students Association. The lower plaza of campus become plastered with pink and purple. Of course don't forget the huge production of Big Game Week!!, 506096=My dream school since I was thirteen, and I through hard work I was accepted for the Spring 2013, 49183=Living 30 minutes outside of San Francisco certainly has its benefits. Fisherman's Whart, Alcatraz, Union Square, all a short BART trip away. Berkeley itself, however, can be low on the entertainment. There's a lot of places to eat, but not a lot to do. With a few hiking trails, sunny weekends can be put to good use, but considering that it rains most of the time, that option only exists for August/September., 931855=Best Cal tradition is definitely Berkeley Time. Basically, all classes start 10 minutes after the scheduled time. For example, 8 AMs don't actually begin until 8:10 (sometimes even later if you have a pretty chill professor). You could, theoretically, wake up at 8 for your 8 AM. Though I wouldn't suggest doing that for the first few days of class, especially if you don't know the campus very well., 160154=Berkeley offers a great selection of a variety of subjects -- you're sure to find something that you're interested in, and there are a lot of resources available even to people who are undecided. In fact, you're expected to take all sorts of classes! They truly want you to have a full education here, and not just march through a bunch of courses and come out with a diploma. Even in the large classes, professors are friendly and truly want you to be able to succeed., 918577=Get your SAT and GPA scores up! I scored a 2200 and am still nowhere near the top of their prospective class due to a somewhat subpar 3.85 GPA., 1066887=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 83811=Compared to private school tuition, the tuition at UC Berkeley is considerably affordable for in-state students. (Out-of-state pay 3 times as much as in-state.) That being said, tuition has doubled since I started college in 2009. These tuition hikes by the UC Regents have been causing a stir at all the UC campuses. Many of my lectures have 300-500 people and I have been one of 15 or 20 regulars at a professor\u2019s office hours (the average class size of some small liberal arts colleges). Dorm and apartment living is also pretty expensive, but I wouldn\u2019t expect much less living in the bay area. If you are willing to pay to be taught by some of the world\u2019s leading minds but do not necessarily care about a lot of one-on-one interaction with professors, then you won\u2019t be disappointed.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Students who are open-minded to all different types of people, students who want a large campus atmosphere, students who aren't bothered by crazy people with portable amplifiers talking about religion or global warming, students who want to get an amazing education in an amazing place, students who want great opportunities. But no matter if you are a crazy overachiever or just a normal student, Berkeley has everything for you. Just know that if you come here, you gotta study sometimes. So it's best for the people who know how to keep a balanced schedule. You are going to want to do a lot and being organized in prioritizing things helps keep you balanced. Tips for prospective students There are so many great things to know about Berkeley that you will experience on your own, but here is just a few things: - Your professors care about you. If you are unsure about things, be sure to go to their office hours and ask questions! You will stand out AND know the material better. Also, your professors are usually bored out of their minds in office hours. They HAVE to be there and no one ever walks in for help. - Berkeley is its own culture so there are certain abbreviations and slang that you will discover around the school. Asian Ghetto, Gourmet Ghetto, CARS, and VLSB are just a few",
