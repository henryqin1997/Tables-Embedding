            "In reviewing the Europe 2020 strategy the Commission should ensure that it adequately reflects the importance of Business Services, both for the business environment and for Europe as a whole. A major initiative for Business Services is required to raise awareness and increase economic, environmental and societal impact of Business Services.",
            "The Commission should increase efforts to engage firms involved in Business Services in the Horizon 2020 programme. The programme offers significant opportunities, but is still perceived to favour product and technology development.",
            "In international trade negotiations the Commission should pay particular attention to Business Services, and ensure that business services markets in third countries are open to European service providers, including for services being offered by manufacturing firms. Servitization offers an opportunity to render the European manufacturing sector more capable of competing and prospering internationally.",
            "The Commission, in partnership with business, should focus on identifying the key barriers to international trade in Business Services, recognizing the diversity of organisations involved in Business Services. The outcomes should inform DG Trade in future trade negotiations and agreements.",
            "Industrial and services policies need closer integration \u2013 given the increasing importance of services in manufacturing \u2013 the mutual dependency between manufacturing and services needs to be pro-actively considered in both industrial and services policies.",
            "Build on the existing Point of Single Contact to put forward a legislation that would set a regulatory framework for the Member States to create true universal business portals, delivering what is relevant in order for companies to establish, operate or temporarily do business in a given EU market.",
            "Within the strategy for completion of the internal market make proposals to optimize the regulatory framework and standards conditions for Business Services. Pay particular attention to specific issues that affect Business Services, such as: excessive bureaucracy and fragmented legislation (which could be tackled by mutual recognition principle enshrined in the European legislation); barriers to entry (especially for SMEs) and taxation and insurance regimes that inhibit cross-border trade.",
            "Encourage the creation of European rather than national service standards (where appropriate), as well as promote best practice use of standards. These standards should be developed with the full involvement of relevant stakeholders.",
            "Working with Member States, the Commission must ensure implementation of the new procurement directives, focusing on outcomes, through life cost, value for society, quality and innovation, rather than lowest cost.",
            "Ensure that the best use is made of sources of business support and advice in Member States, including the collection of best practices on public procurement and promotion of relevant standards and common practices and rules across countries in order to reduce barriers to cross-border trade.",
            "Continue to develop support for SMEs to increase their participation in public and private tenders. For example, reduce procurement participation costs by promoting aggregation, collaboration and standards for procurement across Europe.",
            "The Commission should create a flagship programme of common European interest that brings together manufacturing and services firms across Europe to create a shared, single, open platform that will enable much easier and more open sharing of the data and information that facilitates innovation and productivity gains in Business Services throughout the EU. In its pilot phase this programme should focus on creating a shared virtual services marketplace for Europe.",
            "The Commission should work with Member States to promote the use of open data, especially public data, across Europe. Making these data more widely available can increase the rate of innovation and creativity in Business Services.",
            "The Commission should take a lead to develop mechanisms to promote accessibility and standardisation of data \u2013 technologically enabled Business Services are constrained by the lack of interoperable data standards.",
            "Within the European skills strategy there should be explicit attention to Business Services - with a particular focus on building the balance of technological, commercial and entrepreneurial skills required to grow Business Services. A key requirement of the skills strategy would be to forecast and match the demand and supply sides. It is essential that this Skills Strategy takes a long-term forward look, recognizing the changing nature of Business Services and the implied future skills requirements.",
            "Provide support for eLeader programmes designed for Business Service firms \u2013 these programmes should be directed at helping Business Service firms reskill and upskill existing employees so they are able to take advantage of new technologies and innovation applicable to Business Services.",
            "Establish a partnership with stakeholders, including senior industrialists, SMEs, trade unions, academics and Member States where appropriate. This partnership should support the implementation of the recommendations of the High Level Group and ensure the development of a Business Services scorecard that can be used to assess the health, success and contribution of European Business Services.",
            "Fragmentation in Business Services is a critical issue affecting both the Commission and industry. The Commission should seek mechanisms to create greater coherence for Business Services. Mechanisms might include Commission organization and structure \u2013 a single DG for Business Services \u2013 and industry representation \u2013 creation of an inclusive European partnership for Business Services, covering the entire range of organisations involved in offering Business Services."

    "textBeforeTable": "European Commission MEMO Brussels, 9 April 2014 High Level Group on Business Services: frequently asked questions 1. What are business services? Business services are services where one business supports another in the execution of its activities. They are also known as \u201cbusiness to business\u201d activities. Typical examples of business services are: professional services such as management consultancies or legal services; technical services such as design, engineering or technical maintenance services; and operational services such as recruitment, security and industrial services. 2. Why is the Commission active in the field of business services? The global business services market is estimated at more than \u20ac3.5 trillion and is believed to have doubled in size in the last decade. In Europe, business services account for 11.7% of GDP and 12% of employment (1 in 8 jobs in Europe is in business services). Furthermore, since 1999, business services have been growing more than twice as fast (2.4% yearly average growth rate) as the average of all other EU sectors (1.1%). The numbers are even more impressive when looking at employment: employment in business services grew at a yearly rate of 3.5%, compared to 0.8% on average for all other sectors of the EU economy. Taking into account the importance of business services for the competitiveness of the economy, their diversity and overall impact on the way we produce and consume, the Commission sees business services as a",
    "textAfterTable": "2. Recommendations for the Member States Action Date To support companies with cross-border trade, Member States should further develop Points of Single Contact into true universal business portals (see recommendation 3a), thus reducing the information deficit and allowing for electronic procedures so that companies can establish, operate or temporarily do business in a given EU market. 2015 Working with the Commission, Member States must ensure implementation of the new procurement directives, focusing on outcomes, through life cost, value for society, quality and innovation, rather than lowest cost. 2018 The European Commission, Member States, Business Service providers and the insurance sector should work together to address issues of recognition, equivalence and availability of cross-border insurance. 2018 Member States should ensure that public procurement competitions encourage the provision of innovative Business Services. To do so, Member States should enhance the skills of public procurement officials so they are best placed to design appropriate procurement competitions that will drive innovation in Business Services. 2018 Member States should support the development of a European skills strategy, with explicit attention to Business Services.",
