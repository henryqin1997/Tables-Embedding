Manual Datasheet Choose from a range of Tektronix RF Power Meters to meet your needs. The PSM3000 Series power meter/sensor provides true average power measurements, giving accurate power measurements independent of signal modulation and bandwidth. The PSM4000 Series power meter/sensor delivers average power (CW) measurements, and adds pulse and peak power measurements for gathering basic data on pulsed RF and microwave signals. The PSM5000 Series power meter/sensor provides the same measurements as the PSM4000 but comes with added pulse profiling capability",
