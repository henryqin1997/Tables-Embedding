Details of major storages in the Ord region are listed in Table P2, and a map of their location within the region is shown in Figure P5. Major storages Surface water resources of the Ord region are highly developed due to the Ord River Irrigation Scheme. Lake Argyle is used to supply water to irrigated agriculture and forestry. Other minor storages and tributaries are used to supply townships and self-supply irrigators. Surface water Groundwater resources in the region are primarily used for mine dewatering and operations (95%) and urban supply (5%). Surface water resources support the main water users in the region, including irrigated agriculture (80% of water abstracted), commercial forestry (10%) and urban and self-supply licencees (5%). Tributaries of the Ord River, both upstream and downstream of Lake Argyle, provide additional water resources. aquifers of Halls Creek. aquifers of Kununurra and There are two groundwater resources in the Ord region: Moochalabra Dam, on the King River.

Map of major storages in the Ord region Lake Argyle Lake Argyle is formed by the Ord River Dam, and collects runoff from the Ord River catchment. Annual runoff varies dramatically \u2013 a reflection of the highly variable nature of rainfall and runoff across the region. Water is released from Lake Argyle for hydro-electric power generation, and the resulting flows are used to supply downstream users and meet environmental water provisions in the lower Ord River. The Argyle Diamond Mine can also abstract water under licence from Lake Argyle if their private water storages provide insufficient water.\u00a0 Lake Kununurra Lake Kununurra is formed by the Kununurra Diversion Dam, and the majority of inflows come from water released from Lake Argyle.
