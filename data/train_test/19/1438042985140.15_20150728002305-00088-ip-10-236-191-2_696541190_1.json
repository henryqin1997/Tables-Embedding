The March 9 deadline, which was already put back by the club to allow more fans to snap up season tickets, has now been extended to April 9 after some supporters 'voice. difficulties' over committing to a new season ticket. Fans who also purchase before this deadline, and those who've already bought their season tickets, will also receive a price promise which will see the price of their ticket be 'no greater' than this year's price for three years. Owls chairman Lee Strafford told the official SWFC website: 'We have been really encouraged by Wednesdayites' response to our new season ticket sales dates. However, we have received a lot of feedback from fans getting used to this shift who are encountering difficulties in committing at this time so we have decided to make one final extension to the deadline.' More than 5,000 season tickets have already been sold and the club are hoping to achieve a figure of 16,500 before the start of next season., 14372=Loanee Sasso Comments on His Commitment to Owls and Aims (Tuesday July 28 2015), 19535=Time: 7:08PM, 12851=Show Two - Pre-Season 2015/16 Wednesday Week Podcast (Friday July 24 2015), 14567=St Mirren Tickets Available Now (Tuesday July 28 2015), 14151=Ipswich Vs Wednesday - Away Fans Ticket Info (Tuesday July 28 2015), 13943=Wednesday Set To Raid Nacional Again For Young Striker?
