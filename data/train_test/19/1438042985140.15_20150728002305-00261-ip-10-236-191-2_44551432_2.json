These servers are intended for larger businesses or sites that receive a great deal of traffic that would otherwise leave a site lagging or crashing under other alternatives. A dedicated server is one that is for you alone, not shared. Depending on your level of expertise, there are different options for the level of control you desire. Managed hosting will allow for basic control but leave all the technical aspects to the hosting provider. Unmanaged allows for complete server control.

These servers allow for the load of traffic to fluctuate without performance loss and without the need for a dedicated server. VPS is the perfect solution for a site that has large spikes in traffic or finds that shared hosting is too slow but dedicated hosting is too costly. Another advantage to VPS is that it allows for a great deal of customization.
