This is the next step in the journey for me to achieve it. I\u2019m ready to show what I\u2019ve got.\u201d, 27144=With Chicago Fire players scheduled to report for duty in 10 days and the first match of 2013 scheduled to kick off in 54 days, one player hoping to make the Fire roster will be December\u2019s Open Tryout winner, Sam Archer. \u00a0 Archer emerged from a group of more than 150 players during last month\u2019s two-day tryout to garner an invitation to the first phase of preseason training camp in Ave Maria, Fla. beginning Sunday, Jan. 20.}",
