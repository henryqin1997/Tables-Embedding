            "\u201cfirst, these fruit trees bear fruit \u2018after their kind,\u2019 a peculiar and definite limitation, which all those understand best who have seen how the \u2018kind\u2019 sets limitations upon all who would mix kinds and cross them.\u201d \u201cThe accomplishment of the things ordered in v. 11 is reported in this verse in terms that are not a wooden repetition of v. 11; for after \u2018seed\u2019 is inserted \u2018after their kind\u2019 to emphasize how the \u2018kind\u2019 limitation also applies to the herbs, though this had not been mentioned previously.\u201d \u201cAnother distinctive thought conveyed by this half of the verse is the added assertion that these creatures appeared \u2018after their kind,\u2019 a phrase not new but as important in its bearing as above. (v. 12) and allowing for no transmutation of species.\u201d \u201cA double \u2018after their kind,\u2019 first applying to \u2018the living creatures\u2019 as a whole then to the three classes separately, impresses this distinctive limitation upon all these creatures\u2014a truth amply confirmed as not to be eradicated, as all who have engaged in crossbreeding of animals can abundantly testify.\u201d",

            "\u201cIf therefore we inquire, how it happens that the earth is fruitful, that the germ is produced from the seed, that fruits come to maturity, and their various kinds are annually reproduced\u201d \u201cthat Moses declares animals were created \u2018according to their species\u2019: for this distribution carried with it something stable. It may even hence be inferred, that the offspring of animals was included. For to what purpose do distinct species exist, unless that individuals, by their several kinds, may be multiplied?\u201d",

    "textBeforeTable": "But first, let\u2019s jump back to a time when taxonomy (classifying living things) really developed. Swedish creationist Carl Linnaeus was the founder of the modern classification system in the 1700s. Linnaeus original classification was: Common features mean common designer. Common features mean common ancestry. In modern creationists\u2019 studies, there is a field called baraminology that works to find the boundaries of the created kinds. The field is very much in its infancy, and we strive to encourage the research. From a big picture, it boils down to a difference of how things are viewed: Classification Then and Now . . . Why? It is nice to hear from you. You hit the nail on the head when it comes to taxonomy. Part of the problem with the current secular classification system is the heavy influence of evolution and evolutionary relationships. It is assumed, on the secular side, that life evolved from a single-celled organism, and this does not mesh with the biblical view. In the Bible, God created all animals after their kinds. \u2014M.W., U.S. Information is left out in most sites and books on these topics, and so these areas are made out to be \u201cfuzzy\u201d So my question is there a credible place I can go to get concrete info on this topic? I know absolutely that every animal can easily be placed into a specific group of animals...but because of this evolutionary bias, it's getting harder",
    "textAfterTable": "Infraorder Superfamily Family Genus Species The Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament says of the word kind (min in Hebrew): Some have argued that when God created m\u00een, he thereby fixed the \u201cspecies.\u201d This is a gratuitous assumption because a link between the word m\u00een with the biologist\u2019s descriptive term species cannot be substantiated, and because there are as many definitions of species as there are biologists. In light of the distinctions made in #Ge 1, such as the distinction between herbs and grasses which are, however, members of the same class (Angiosperms), it is possible that in some cases the biblical term m\u00een may indicate a broader group, such as an order. Elsewhere, in #Le 11:14,15,16,19,22 (four times), #Le 11:29, m\u00een appears consistently as equivalent to nothing broader than genus. However, #Le 11:4 \u201cthe falcon after its kind,\u201d and #Le 11:16 \u201cthe hawk after its kind,\u201d refer to divisions within the order Falconiformes, yet both have subdivisions called m\u00een. Likewise, as Payne points out, the locust, bald locust, cricket, and grasshopper all belong to the order Orthoptera and the locust, bald locust, and grasshopper belong to the family Acridiidae, but again each has its subdivisions called m\u00een (genus?). God created the basic forms of life called m\u00een which can be classified according to modern biologists and zoologists as sometimes species, sometimes genus, sometimes family or order.
