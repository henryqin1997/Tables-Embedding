I always saw security guards and campus police in squad cars patrolling., 285941=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 100786=Have never seen/heard about any fights. (From the 2011-2012 Student Handbook): Main Campus-2010: 7 Aggravated Assault/Battery; 80 Theft; 1 Motor Vehicle Theft; 3 Theft from Motor Vehicle; 3 Drug Abuse/Violations; 4 Arrest: Drug Law Violations ZERO: murders, sex offenses, arson, robbery, burglary, liquor law violations, hate crimes, weapons violations, arrests: illegal weapons, arrests: liquor law violations. JJC is a really friendly environment and everybody is very welcoming., 84849=If you live in district, full time can be anywhere from $1500-$2300, much better then $10000-$20000 at a university., 212023=It is an awesome school for money because the classes are relatively low price so to get your general requirements done it is wonderful. It is better than going to a big school and paying thousands of dollars for what JJC offers at maybe two thousand, and that is a high price at our school. Average is about $1500 dollars a semester., 96675=The food is good, but it can be a little expensive. They offer many choices of food. You can consider sub sandwiches, the grill station, healthy foods, grab-n-go items, salad bar and vending. You can also choose smoothies, hot chocolate, coffee and many other drinks. The cafeteria is clean and new. It's a great spot to hang out with friends and to have lunch. You can also dine outside in our picnic area. The cafeteria stay open from 7 am - 7 pm Monday - Thursday. On Fridays it stays open from 7am - 2:30 pm., 95993=There are many fun and exciting activities to get involved in. A wide range of activities to attend are talent shows, dances, theatre productions, sporting events, daytime activities on the bridge and many more. The last week in April for Spring Fling week is not to miss. There many activities going on during that week such as free food, free earth day t-shirt giveaways and fun activities.}",

    "textAfterTable": "The teachers are great, and the class sizes are small. Tuition is only about $100 per credit hour (for in-district residents), and you get a lot for your money. On more than one occasion, I had teachers that used to teach at big four year schools- it's like getting the same quality for much less money! For example, my economics teacher used to teach at a popular four year college and started teaching at JJC when he moved into the suburbs. Apart from this, the teachers are all required to have office hours, and if you can't attend their office hours, most are more than willing to set up an appointment with you if you need extra help! They also have an honors program, through which you can take even smaller classes with honors-geared coursework. JJC also offers free tutoring and writing assistance for all students, in several subjects. I used to go to the math center a lot, and their assistance is part of what helped me get an A in my math class. I also went to the writing center once or twice, to have someone look over my college application essay. They were very helpful. Another great thing about JJC is that their credits are highly transferrable to four-year universities. This means that once you transfer, you are much less likely to have to spend the time and money retaking a class that you already took",
