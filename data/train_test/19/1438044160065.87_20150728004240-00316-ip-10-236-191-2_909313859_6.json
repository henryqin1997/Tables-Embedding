            "If you want to get a solid education but make memories on the way there this is the school. I knew very little of the school but once I study up on it and went to Oneonta I loved it. It gets cold here but hey cold weather, warm hearts!",
            "This goes for any college but I feel it is true, make sure to get a high GPA in your freshman year. Also, learn to manage your time and don't allow the party life to consume you. If you can do these things you are going to leave Oneonta with a nice degree and memories for a lifetime.",
            "The fact that this school tuition is less then 5500, and it is ranked higher than most private colleges in New York speaks a lot for the bang for the buck part. Want to live off campus but don't feel like paying a lot for your four years of exploration? Go SUNY, better than the City colleges but up there with the private schools.",
            "I have met a lot of great friends from classes, clubs, athletic events, greek life, heck even at random from the dining hall. Also weekends it isn't hard to find something to do, maybe a movie, a party, and even the schools sets up some sort of activity to keep you busy.",
            "The professors are great, don't let this school fool you! It is becoming recognized nationally for it's academics and the fact that the professors want to see you succeed only adds to this schools growing reputation."

After just two semesters at Oneonta, I can already say that I have learned an immense amount of material. Many of my classes have included trips out into the field and the practical experience aids tremendously in the classroom. I was not an Anthropology major when I arrived, however, through the General Education requirements, I was able to take a couple classes in the disciple and become fascinated with it. Along with my classes, I am now in the process of conducting two or three independent research projects with faculty guidance and that is something you won\u2019t find in most schools. I\u2019ve also been able to go on a few trips including a week traveling from Oneonta to Cape Cod studying Geology. I also went on a three week trip to the Southern Rockies studying Geology and Ecology, and April I will be spending a week in Peru for Anthropology. What I am trying to say with all this is that Oneonta has provided me with a whole host of additional learning experiences that I would not be able to get in the classroom alone. Learning at Oneonta is not just limited to academics either. The school provides a plethora of guest lecturers covering topics such as filming in Iraq, to Forensic Anthropology and many topics in between. The campus generally has a leadership conference every year where one can sign up for seminars. The clubs themselves often take trips, put on workshops and other activities that all result in a greater education., 76881=Passing through the pillars is an unusual tradition but it is fun. http://www.oneontaalumni.com/s/885/index-plain.aspx?sid=885&gid=1&pgid=1172, 125047=There are so many clubs that are offered here at Oneonta. I'm already a part of 4 clubs! It's easy to get involved. There's also Greek Life if you're interested in joining a fraternity or sorority. The school offers buses that can take you into town where you can grab something to eat. If you're looking to go shopping, there's also a bus that takes you to the mall, Walgreens, Walmart, the movie theater, and many more places. Even at the school, there are weekly movie screenings and even concerts. Last week we had rapper Childish Gambino and in October The Gym Class Heroes are coming!}",

The professors are accomplished and the city of Oneonta has a great music scene as well. Students who are interested in fashion but do not yet wish to move to the city can do really well here. Oneonta has a cooperative program with FIT. Education is also another popular major here at SUNY Oneonta. My friends in the department have nothing but good things to say about their experiences in all of their education classes. Tips for prospective students Any student considering Oneonta should absolutely visit the campus. During your venture to the valley, don't forget to check out the actual town itself. Downtown Oneonta is very quaint and says a lot about the townspeople here. Do not be afraid to ask questions on the tour, after all, you",
