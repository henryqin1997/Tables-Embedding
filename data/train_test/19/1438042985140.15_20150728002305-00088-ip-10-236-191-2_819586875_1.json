The poll was suggested by Vital regular zaki1140 and posed the question how many will Zaki get this season, well 82% of voters thought he would bag 20+ The Egypt international has made a sensational start to life in the Premier League scoring on his debut at West Ham, following that up with a Carling Cup goal against Notts County and knocking in a brace last weekend away at Hull City, Chelsea at home being the only game that he hasn`t scored in. Zaki celebrates his opener at Hull City If he continues to score at this rate he will reach 20 by Christmas and we could well see a fantastic return of goals for him by the end of the season. For the record the votes were: 20 + - 82% 15 - 20 - 9% 10 - 15 - 7% Under 10 - 2% There is a new poll for you to vote on and it is available on the right side of this page. The new poll is a result of an article in the Mail written by some anonymous scribe under the name of Hatchet Man, and he is very critical of Latics midfield player Michael Brown and he is suggesting that Brownie isn`t fit to be a Premier League player. So the poll is asking plain and simple: Michael Brown Hero or Villain Vital Latics It's easy to join us at Vital Latics to register , simply click the link and enjoy getting involved, 13349=Reece James Joins The Latics From Man U (Wednesday July 22 2015), 12737=Tavernier And Waghorn Unveiled At Rangers (Monday July 20 2015), 12931=JPT Celebrates Ten Years - Wigan (Tuesday July 21 2015), 21756=Time: 6:23PM}",
