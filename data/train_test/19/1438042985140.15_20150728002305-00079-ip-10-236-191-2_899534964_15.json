Tips for prospective students Visit the campus and learn about the programs here that relate to what you are interested in majoring in. If you are set on Columbia College, I recommend making a four year plan and also try to get involved in at least one club or extra curricular activity here at CC. Bang for the buck I'd say Columbia College's tuition",
