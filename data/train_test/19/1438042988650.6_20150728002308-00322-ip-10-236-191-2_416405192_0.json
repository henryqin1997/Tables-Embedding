            "I purchased extra virgin coconut oil from Trader Joes and began using it today. I placed a tablespoon in my smoothie this morning. I have been reading a lot for other ideas on how to use it and am looking forward to trying it. Does anyone have any input on that particular brand from Trader Joes? Thanks, -D \u2014 Anonymous",

            "I am always reluctant to post about diet ideas because it is really a more complicated process than to say something works or doesn't work but that said I had to chime in on the coconut oil. Like another poster , I had also lost some weight through walking and diet changes over the last few years but then leveled off. I read about the Butter in the coffee thing which was surprisingly good, but then replaced it with coconut oil. I have lost 11.5 lbs in two and a half weeks. I have it in morning coffee in the place of cream (which had some fat and calories anyway) and decreased sugar use from 3-4 teaspoons to one teaspoon (also saved some calories there). I feel an incredible energy boost after the coffee, and I also feel less hungry. I try to make sure I eat something by 2pm to keep my metabolism going but I am not really starving by that time. I have totally replaced the urge for coffee with cream and sugar or sugary coffee drinks from starbucks (in cans) with this system and I am feeling so much better. While the fat and calories might seem like a lot in the Coconut oil think about this, no cream , less sugar for me, less eating overall, no binge snacking and no glycemic issues so now highs and lows with sugar etc. I have been gradually making changes over the last few years and it is not a simple process. I now eat as much as possible from local farm markets and avoid the grocery store nearly completely. I drink mainly water, my coffee with Coconut oil in it and occasional diet drinks but not too often. I walk about 2 miles a day 5 times a week (for 2 years now), I go swimming etc. I wish everyone luck with their efforts. I do think coconut oil can play a valuable role in your plan. \u2014 Anonymous",

    "textBeforeTable": "Download a FREE 5-Day 1,500-Calorie Meal Plan to Lose Weight! Bottom Line: The extra calorie burn produced by coconut oil might give you a slight edge, but only if you make room by eating less of something else. A tablespoon of any oil sets you back around 120 calories. Even if coconut oil does help people lose weight, few nutrition experts recommend it, since coconut oil is loaded with saturated fat: 12 grams in 1 tablespoon versus 7 grams in a tablespoon of butter. But there is no scientific evidence to show that consuming coconut oil helps people lose weight. There is one recent study, however, using an MCT oil, which suggests coconut oil may work in the same way. In the study, 31 overweight men and women followed a low-calorie diet that included just over a tablespoon for women and just under two tablespoons for men each day of either an MCT oil or olive oil. After four months, the MCT-oil users lost an average of 7 pounds; the olive oil group just 3 pounds. The investigators suggested that the metabolic boost produced by the MCT oil likely played a role. It comes down to the molecular structure of the oil and how the body digests it. The fatty acids in coconut oil (called medium-chain triacylglycerols, or MCT) are shorter and more water-soluble than those in other oils, such as olive or canola. \u201cSo",
