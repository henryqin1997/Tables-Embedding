    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{77859=All content \u00a9 1997 - 2012 Digital Camera Resource Page LLC (R) All trademarks are property of their respective owners., 41383=Let's \"move\" on to the RX100's movie recording talents now. The RX100 records Full HD video at 1920 x 1080 / 60 frames/second (60p) with stereo sound, at a bit rate of 28 MBps. You can keep recording for up to 29 minutes, for which you'll need an 8GB memory card. If, for some reason, you want interlaced video, a 1080/60i setting is also available, with bit rates of 17 and 24 MBps., 68507=Most of Sony's popular features can be found on the Cyber-shot DSC-RX100. For point-and-shooters, that includes two Auto modes which will select a scene mode for you, with Superior Auto mode also using multi-shot features that reduce image blur and noise. Other handy automatic features include Anti Motion Blur (and its sibling, Handheld Night Scene) and Sweep Panorama. You can use the D-Range Optimizer feature to brighten shadows, and the HDR feature to improve contrast in heavily backlit photos. There are plenty of manual controls available too, including those for shutter speed, aperture, white balance, and focus. Manual white balance adjustments, focus peaking, and an electronic level are also available. Naturally, the RAW image format is supported. The control ring around the lens normally controls things like exposure or zoom, but plenty of other choices are also available. The RX100 also offers a customizable Function (shortcut) menu, and several buttons on the back of the camera can have their function redefined, if you wish. In movie mode you can record Full HD video at 1080/60p with stereo sound, use of the optical zoom, continuous autofocus, and manual exposure control. After all that good stuff, I find the RX100's playback mode to be quite lackluster, with no editing features of note, and stills separated from movies., 54788=The first three crops look nearly identical. Noise first becomes noticeable at ISO 400, but it's not too bad. That trend continues one stop higher, with detail loss now becoming an issue. Even with that, a mid-sized or perhaps larger print is still very possible. The ISO 1600 has pretty obvious detail loss, so I'd stop here (and stick to small prints), or switch to RAW. The top two sensitivities -- ISO 3200 and 6400 -- are best avoided, at least if you're using JPEGs. Do note that you can use Multi Frame NR at higher ISOs (though not when shooting RAW images, which I was doing here), which may result in slightly better high ISO images., 43355=Click to play converted movie (1920 x 1080, 60 fps, 50.9 MB, QuickTime/H.264 format) Click to download original MTS file (42.9 MB), 41806=While AVCHD movies look great on your HDTV, editing and sharing them isn't so easy. Heck, just finding them on your memory card is a pain. Thankfully, Sony also supports the MPEG-4 codec, which is much easier to work with. The bad news is that there are two resolutions available with MP4: 1440 x 1080 and 640 x 480 (both at 30 fps), and recording ends when the file size reaches 2GB., 43923=The RX100 has an unremarkable playback mode, with no editing features to speak of, for either stills or videos. An annoyance that's been inherited from Sony's NEX models it that the camera separates stills and movies (even down to the codec level). What that means is that you can't flip through photos and videos at the same time. You have to either go to the playback menu or to the thumbnail screen (and the bar on the left) to switch between stills, AVCHD movies, and MP4 movies., 7269=Sony uses two different codecs for video recording on the RX100: AVCHD and MPEG-4. PlayMemories Home can be used to view videos produced by the camera, and it can remove unwanted footage from your clip, and save the results as an MTS (AVCHD) file. While it can convert videos to WMV format, they'll be VGA quality. PMH can also burn videos to Blu-ray or DVD discs. Mac users can edit both MPEG-4 and AVCHD videos with ease, using iMovie or Final Cut Pro X. Do note that not all third-party video editing suites will be able to work with the AVCHD Progressive (1080/60p) video files that the RX100 can produce., 42886=One other thing the DSC-RX100 allows it for still shooting while a movie is being recorded, though only at 1080/60i or below. The resolution of the images can be up to 17 Megapixel., 62965=Everything is buttery smooth through ISO 800, with a tiny bit of noise appearing at ISO 1600. Noise levels remain quite low at ISO 3200, and even ISO 6400 is usable. If you turn on the Multi Frame NR feature you can shoot as high as ISO 25600 (though only for JPEGs). There's a slight improvement at ISO 6400 if you use that feature, but I'd pass on the top two sensitivities, as they're far too soft and noisy to be usable. The RX100 definitely impressed here, posting some of the best test results I've seen from a compact camera.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The RX100 uses the brand spankin' new NP-BX1 lithium-ion battery. This battery holds 4.5 Wh of energy, which is fairly good for a camera this size. Here's how that translates into battery life: Like most premium compacts, the DSC-RX100 doesn't have any built-in memory, so you'll need to pick up a memory card yourself. The RX100 can use both SD/SDHC/SDXC as well as Memory Stick Pro Duo cards. I'd recommend an 8GB card if you're mostly taking stills, and 16GB or larger if Full HD movies are your thing. A high speed card (Class 6 or higher) is strongly recommended for best performance. 34 page basic manual (printed) USB cable Shoulder strap adapter Wrist strap AC adapter NP-BX1 lithium-ion battery The 20.2 effective Megapixel Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 digital camera The Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 comes in a pretty fancy box, though the actual contents aren't any different than what you'd find in a camera costing hundreds less.

Other features on the RX100 include a fast F1.8-4.9, 3.6X optical zoom Carl Zeiss T* lens, a super-sharp LCD, full manual controls (with RAW support), a customizable ring around the lens, lots of useful \"bells and whistles\", and 1080/60p video recording. As you can see from the above chart,",
    "textAfterTable": "Something I don't like about the battery situation is how it's charged. Rather than using an external charger, the battery is charged internally, over a USB cable (plugged into the wall or your PC). Charging times aren't much worse than an external charger (155 minutes), but you lose the convenience of being able to have a spare battery charged at all times. An faster, external charger -- model name BC-TRX -- should be available at some point soon. And speaking of optional extras, here's a table showing the small set of available accessories: Accessory Model # Price * Description External battery charger BC-TRX ?? Lets you charge the battery outside the camera, in about 90 minutes. LCD cover PCK-LM12 From $12 Protect your screen from scratches -- or worse. Shoulder strap STP-XSG1/B From $35 A leather shoulder strap. Adapters included with the camera will let you hook it up. Jacket case LCJ-RXA/B From $85 This polyurethane case attaches via the tripod mount and lets you use the camera with the case attached. * Prices were accurate at time of publication",
