That\u2019s the basic. The plot is absurd. It is absolutely predictable, ex. When the grandmother took the will, it was absolutely predictable that Nan Cho was going to take it away from her, or the moment when Nan Cho went to the hospital, it was absolutely predictable that she was going to do something to Yoo Jung\u2019s mother. This are only some of the things that come in my mind. There are a lot of \u201cdramatic\u201d series out there which make a lot of sense. This one is full of birth secrets and other elements that make your nerves wrack. (it is a bad written makjang). And please read the comment -134 from ptsh836 : \u201cone thing abt this drama\u2026.uve gotta take it like \u2018oh my, ive sooo much time to waste n nothing better to do, so im watching\u201d! hahaha! otherwise one will drown in one\u2019s own exasperation n not live to tell it\u2026:))\u201d Jun Kwang Ryu and Jun Mi Sun were together in another drama , which is super dramatic and super fantastic : King of baking Kim Tak Goo. That one Is a well written drama. There are birth secrets, but the story flows wonderfully. In this case the rating were super high. If you haven\u2019t watched it yet, you should, and then you\u2019ll see the difference. I\u2019m not arguing about the Passion in their love, or why this drama is called Passionate Love, because that is another story. I understand the case of ex husband and wife, but I can\u2019t see the passion in a relationship which was never consumed (between MY and YJ). The only thing I like in this drama is Kang Moon Hee and her cute love story. \u2026\u2026 THIS IS JUST MY HUMBLE OPINION\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Respect and peace to everyone !!!, 92885=May You have all your best wishes come true\u2026luck, love, health, wealth and happiness., 73772=@Mar I always love to read your comments. I also do agree with your above comment.}",
