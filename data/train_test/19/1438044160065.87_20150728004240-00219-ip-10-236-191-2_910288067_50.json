            "As someone who has spent two weeks on campus, I can testify that the food at Notre Dame is delicious and varied. While off-campus options are not abundant, more are arising.",
            "The dorm life program is one of my favorite aspects of the University of Notre Dame. Since you spend all four years in the same dorm, the dorm becomes your home-away-from-home. You form wonderful bonds with members of your dorm community and plan special activities unique to your dorm. Dorm pride is certainly characteristic of Notre Dame.",
            "Notre Dame classes are certainly challenging but the passionate professors make them rewarding."

Being Catholic doesn't hurt, considering the school's Catholic values and reputation effuses through everything at Notre Dame. Tips for prospective students APPLY EARLY--I applied early action and it was great to know in *December* that I had gotten in. Waiting until March or April is not fun, as I learned with other college applications. Bang for the buck Considering the about $50,000/year price tag (and the low financial aid for anyone who has parents who make over $100,000 annually), I can't make myself giving five out of five stars here.
