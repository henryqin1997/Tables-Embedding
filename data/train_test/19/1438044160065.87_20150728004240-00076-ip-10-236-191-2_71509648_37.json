Assume that the ledger currency for this company's ledger is Chilean pesos and that the account balances are composed of amounts entered in Chilean pesos. Assume also that the year end for the company is December 31, 2000. Example for adjusting balances based on a price index Using Inflation Adjustment Based on a Price Index In Chile, companies are legally required to calculate inflation rates with a precision of three decimal positions. To meet this requirement, you must define the JL: Inflation Ratio Precision profile option in the System Profile Values window of the System Administrator responsibility before you use the price index inflation adjustment method for Chile. Assign this profile option a value of 3. Defining Inflation Ratio Precision The Chilean government only requires companies to report inflation-adjusted balances; you do not need to report historical balances. You can satisfy Chilean reporting requirements by keeping your transactions in a single ledger that you adjust for inflation. Follow the prerequisite steps for the adjusted-only option described in the Common Country Features topics in this guide. Prerequisites Oracle General Ledger for Chile provides a method for you to adjust your non-monetary accounts for inflation based on a price index. The price index values are used to calculate the correction factor that",

You can calculate the PTD balance for a period by subtracting the balance at the beginning of the period from the balance at the end of the period. The inflation adjustment amount for the periods January through April is calculated as follows: April Adjustment = (Previous Year Ending Balance * Dec-Apr Correction Factor) + (Jan PTD Balance * Jan-Apr Correction Factor) + (Feb PTD Balance * Feb-Apr Correction Factor) + (Mar PTD Balance * Mar-Apr Correction Factor) April Adjustment = (10,000 * 0.060) + (20,000 * 0.048) + (30,000 * 0.034) + (40,000 * 0.025) April Adjustment = 3,580 This table shows the journal entry to adjust the Goodwill account for inflation:",
