            "Cal State Fullerton is a very safe campus! I've taken night classes here before and I never had any problems walking to the parking lot alone at night. There were even days where I chose to stay late on campus and didn't experience any sort of danger/threats. If you forgot where you parked, you can call campus security...they are also available to walk you to your car if you are afraid at night.",
            "I personally did not think that there were a lot of sororities and fraternities to choose from. If you happen to be interested in them, great! If not, don't worry...there are off-campus open sororities and fraternities to check out. These do not require that you are enrolled in their specific college, but they may have other requirements such as a 2.5 GPA or better, or enrollment in at least 6 or more units at any college. For more information on Greek Life, there are many organizations that set their booths up during Discoverfest in the beginning of each semester. Discoverfest is an event where students get to walk around from table to table to get more information on the clubs on campus.",
            "If you feel like you're missing out on a college social life, you have to make the effort to get involved! Otherwise, you'll be commuting to school, going to work, and studying for exams/class assignments. If that is the life that you want, that's fine. But if it's not, I highly recommend that you get involved. You do not want to graduate and think of Cal State Fullerton as 'just another four or more years in school'. On a different note, if you like to work out, we have a really nice gym that you can check out! You enter by typing in your Campus Wide ID number, followed by a handprint scan. Lockers are provided--there is no need for additional locks because each locker comes with a number lock where you can create your own four-digit password for the entire time you plan to use the locker for. The equipments are also nice! Machines such as the treadmill offer a t.v. with cable channels, so you don't have to watch the same channel on one tv with everyone else in the room. Just plug in your earphones and change the channel to whatever you want and you're set! Free towels are offered at the counters if you need them, and if you're interested in playing racquetball, there are plenty of rooms available.",
            "Anyone who is interested in having fun while earning a degree!",
            "CSUF is very diverse...we have cultural events on campus, as well as people giving speeches to inform other students about religions, etc.",
            "Most places are pretty decently priced...I live about 20-30 minutes away from Fullerton, and I always make sure that I fill up a full tank of gas from the gas stations in Fullerton before I go home. It is about 20-30 cents cheaper than where I live. Also, there are student discounts to a variety of theme parks, shows, etc. For more information on that, please visit the student union on campus. For food, I prefer to go to the Gastronome dining common, located near the dorms. It is less than $10 for lunch (breakfast is cheaper, and dinner is a little more expensive), but it is all you can eat! For medicine, our health center offers prescribed medicine for $1!",
            "Two words: JOIN CLUBS/GET INVOLVED! It definitely helps you get more out of your college experience and we have lots of clubs to choose from. Find one that interests you, and always keep an open mind about it in the process. Sometimes you may not find a certain club interesting, but it'll surprise you. By the end of the semester, you'll be creating fun events with the other members! The clubs also offer seasonal events such as winter retreats (snowboarding, etc) and summer retreats (roadtrips, etc) depending on the club that you're involved in.",
            "We have SO many foods places all around campus AND off campus. Most places are within walking distances, so if you're hungry and don't feel like walking all the way to the student union to get food, there are restaurants all around no matter where you are.",
            "Personally, I don't have experience with this, but most of my friends and classmates that dorm, LOVE it! We have newly furnished dorms along with a brand new dining common that feels like you're eating at a buffet! For more information, you can google CSUF Gastronome on all the foods that we offer.",
            "College is not a joke...if you don't keep up your grades, you might end up on academic probation, followed by academic disqualification. It's a lot harder to get into college now than it was 10 years ago, so make sure you keep up your game! The professors challenge you to think critically, and if you pay attention in class and motivate yourself to study hard enough to pass, you'll be fine. If you find yourself struggling, DO NOT BE AFRAID to talk to your professors. If you make the effort to keep an open communication with them and show them that you really want to pass, they will do everything in their power to help you get there. *Four stars because some classes can be hard while others are easy, but no matter the level of difficulty you'll learn a lot more than you can imagine.",
            "Parking can be crazy during school hours, but if you commute long enough, you learn easy tricks to get a spot without going through the hassle. Also, if you need help on ANYTHING, there are A LOT of resources on campus to help you out (financial counseling, personal counseling, academic counseling, advice, tutoring, etc).",
            "Cal State Fullerton is a commuter school. As a commuter student, I feel like most commuter students just want to go to school, and leave when they're done. However, like everything else in life, you have to put in a little effort to make the most of it in order to gain the college experience you want; it's all about what you make of it: the more you put in, the more you get out in the end."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{966479=Many on campus places are good and there is nice variety on and off campus, but i must give this category two stars for unresolved issue that affects the students. The eatery that the campus requires students that dorm to eat at is called the Gastronome. The Gastronome currently has a food safety rating of a D and has had this rating since July of 2013. Making it mandatory to purchase a meal plan to at a facility that D is quite unacceptable., 312126=I'm not a student yet until the fall of 2012, but from what I've heard Cal State Fullerton's standards seems to be at a high level., 246244=Overall, I feel safe on this campus. We have campus police that patrols the campus. I can walk around at 3 o'clock in the morning and still feel safe., 419338=I have been accepted to California State University of Fullerton and plan on attending this fall of 2012. I have heard wonderful things about this campus and have had a great experiences with guidance from the counselors at the school so far! I will be majoring in Kinesiology and am excited because I heard they have an outstanding Kinesiology program at CSUF!, 719207=Get to school before 9:00 if you want to park., 279892=I have never lived on campus but I have friends who have. They say it is a great way to be more involved in school. Since this is a commuter school, those who live in the dorms have more chances of being more involved. New dorms opened in 2011-2012 term., 140352=I can't complain about a whole lot. Parking permits are $220 a semester, and trying to find a parking spot anywhere between 8:30-12:45 is a nightmare, good luck! I did get most of the classes that I wanted for the spring semester, except they are all at undesirable times. I can't wait to get priority registration; getting all of my classes will be a breeze! :), 49252=CSUF is fairly cheap compared to other schools. The state budget crisis for the 2009-2010 school year has however made the cost rise. Although it has been hectic registering for classes as well as paying for classes this year, I still feel like the education at this school is worth the money. Some people go to community colleges before a university, but I personally think that holds students back and it usually takes them 5 years to graduate. Going to CSUF straight out of high school is definitely worth the money., 465367=California State University, Fullerton is a very cozy campus with everything the college student needs. The student-professor ratio (in my classes) is about 24:1, which is excellent for those who need easier access to their professor. There is a variety of places to study on campus and as well as places to relax after a stressful day at in class., 368412=I believe the campus safety to be pretty good. I take at least one night class a semester and haven't felt unsafe walking a few blocks to my car between 9:30 and 10:00 at night., 805026=The underdog of the california colleges. May not be our first choices at first, but it is the right choice in the end., 337240=I have never dormed at Fullerton, but, I am considering this Fall 2012. Especially because I live a little far from the campus. But, I believe it will be worthed., 736044=A campus tradition is that during finals or tests, if you rub the fallen Statue of David's butt cheek you'll get good luck haha. I've done it and I got an A! Also there's snow day, in October they bring snow into the quad and you can go sledding. There's also the annual spring concert in may, last year we had Mike Posner and Hunter Hayes., 607466=Cal State Fullerton is the perfect school if you want to get involved. May your intentions be for social and friendships or if you want to volunteer or advocate., 1130577=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 643863=This school is expensive. The parking pass for one semester is $220. Tuition fees usually increase every semester and have doubled since I started in 2007., 697434=AMAZING! They just completed a new set of dorms in 2010 and they are beautiful and modern. The community is unrivaled. I met countless life long friends there and even my husband!, 660772=When I visited California State University, Fullerton in September 2012, I knew that I wanted this to be my future school. The resources that the schools provides to its students drew me in. I love the history of the campus, as well as its surroundings., 5103=Sign up for a Freshman Program after you get accepted, because you will receive priority registration for your first semester and help you adjust better your first semester because you are enrolled in a University 100 class with helpful professors, mentors, and CSUF staff. Sign up for the Finish in Four program around October of your first semester because that enables you to have priority registration during your 4 years at this institution. Having priority registration is a big deal because it's very difficult to get the classes you need with the budget cuts (they cut lots of classes). Also, look your professors up on RateMyProfessor.com because having a good professor makes a BIG difference., 660157=Unsure yet, but I will be living in the apartments on campus beginning in January 2013., 947501=My first semester as a returning transfer student at Cal State Fullerton was more than I could have asked for. I first attended CSUF as a freshman in 2006 and did not apply myself. This time I felt as though a new world of education had been opened up to me and I love it!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The classes at Cal State University, Fullerton are fairly easy. I had expected college to be a lot more difficult, but CSUF has proved otherwise. Although the classes are not difficult, they have allowed me to grow intellectually. The professors don't necessarily assign huge work loads, instead they assign assignments and projects that are relevant to the class and real life. The professors help you develop your critical thinking skills by opening your eyes to seeing things from different perspectives by encouraging classroom and group discussions. Many of the professors have unique teaching styles that are very effective in having their students learn.
