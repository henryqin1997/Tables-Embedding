            "The worst crime on campus is bike theft. We do have bike police on top of the campus police, which makes for a super safe campus. I have not heard of any recent intense safety issues, but I do hear sirens at night.",
            "I myself have not rushed, but I know many who have and love their sororities/fraternities. Greek life is a great way to meet new people and form families. Not all are social based, there are many that are based on major, religion, race, programs, and so on. So don't automatically write them all off as partyers!",
            "I keep myself busy going from classes to events and clubs. As I mentioned earlier, I get weekly e-mails from The Aggie Reader that informs students about all the main activities going on around campus that week and clubs are really good about sending out e-mail reminders detailing when and where meetings and activities are. So, I believe it is really easy to manage when to go to class, when to study, and when to go to events because it is pretty active activities-wise. I am never bored and I love how there are so many clubs to chose from (and it's no big deal if you cannot attend stuff, they understand!)",
            "UC Davis is great for laid-back students who are not going to college to try and snub other people or compete their way to the top. If anyone is looking for a sense of community and belonging, they are totally welcomed with open arms.",
            "UC Davis is best known for its Picnic Day celebration, so for any prospective students trying to get a feel for the town and campus's environment, I suggest you check that day out! It's held in April on the Arboratem, which is basically the prettiest place you'll ever see. Also, the campus gets all four seasons (which is a huge plus for me, having grown up in So-Cal).",
            "The cost of going to UC Davis is definitely worth it. Also, it is actually cheaper to live off campus than on campus and since it is a college town, it is not hard to find a place to rent that is close to campus.",
            "There are so many events going on around campus that are listed in weekly e-mails called The Aggie Reader. If going to events and clubs is too hard to keep track of, there is always the cheap arcade/bowling alley in the Memorial Union; the Activities and Recreation Center (basically our gym which has all the usual machines but with a technological twist of TV, Internet, and gaming options, plus an indoor track, racquetball courts, rock climbing wall, and so on); free night dance classes (Tuesdays at least for Segundo, which feature zumba, salsa, hip-hop, etc.); activities hosted by the dorm resident advisers; ping pong in the services center; free movies on the online housing website; food places downtown; movies at the movie theatres; bike rides; visit the cows; shop at the university mall (Forever 21 and stores like that); or even take a free YOLO bus to Sacramento and exploit all the state capitol has to offer!",
            "I absolutely love the dining commons. There are so many choices, and for a person who does not eat beef (or any red meat in my roommate's case), that is a blessing. I get to try out so many new types of food every day and as soon as you walk in the DC, there is a display of all the dishes available with a complete description of what it is, ingredients, calorie counts, other nutrition facts, and where it can be found. Also, each display card is color coated, the color indicating whether it is vegan, vegetarian, spicy, a favorite, etc. Also, for picky eaters who do not want to try the Mongolian BBQ, falafels, or other exotic foods can always chose to eat burgers, pizza, sandwiches, and salad. And the best part: dessert. All I can say about that is save plenty of room and eat it three times a day because I have not once eaten a sweet that I did not like.",
            "Unlike other schools, when applying for housing at UC Davis, students do not fill out a personality survey. Instead, we filled out three room preferences, each with criteria including which dorm we wanted to live in, room occupancy, single sex or co-ed floor, program or non-program, and room style (suite, standard, etc.). Due to an abundance of housing applicants, I now live in a triple in the Segundo housing area (which was in my opinion the best out of all the choices). Online, my room is listed as a double because that was what it was originally intended for; however, this room would be a huge double because even with three people and all our stuff, we still have a lot of room space (I live in a corner room, so that might be why). Also, my floormates are super friendly and there are kitchens, common rooms, and music rooms in every dorm. Floor activities put on by the resident advisors and intramural sports are also a great way to meet people.",
            "I never was one to look at ranking systems before choosing which colleges I would go to because I never quite understood how ranking could be such a big deciding factor for others. I mean, shouldn't the person who goes there rank it for themselves on their own scale? Anyway, regardless of how UC Davis is portrayed ranking-wise, I am learning so much here after only about a month and though the calculus, chemistry, and sociology classes I am taking are rigorous, I am receiving all the help I could possibly need by going to drop-in tutoring, office hours, academic advising, and so on.",
            "As most people know, Davis is known for being a bike-friendly campus. I would advise any prospective students to take into account how they are going to travel around campus or downtown at whatever college they choose, because all things worth going to, in Davis at least, are easily accessible by bike, car, bus, or even on foot. Although bike circles look intimidating, I would suggest using the first couple of days after move-in day (when the upper-classmen have not arrived yet) to get used to the idea of bike circles because in reality, they are not scary at all!",
            "Davis has such a college-town atmosphere about it , which enhances my experience here at UC Davis. All the people I meet are very nice and friendly and there is no threat of intense competition or sabotage here like there is at other UC schools. I chose to commit to UC Davis because I was impressed with how there were zero-waste bin options instead of trash cans, recycled paper towels in all of the bathrooms, organic student-grown gardens, bicycle-friendly campus and town (totally flat campus!), and comfortable sense of community."

Everything happens for a reason and never ever lose hope. If there's a will there's a way., 746350=There are over 500 active organizations at UC Davis, so there is already a huge variety of clubs that are based on interests, academics, politics, sexual identity, race, religion, and more. But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis. If you come to Davis, your residence hall will put on socials, like the residence hall winter formal (Dormal), and the Dining Commons will put on special events as well. And then, there\u00e2??s the glorious madness of Picnic Day every April (see my \u00e2??What to do for fun\u00e2??). The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. It\u00e2??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer. With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD., 43033=I live in Tercero Wall Hall which is right next to a farm of very handsome cows. There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation. It's difficult sitting that long but for a school to do something like that and to give you so many resources in case you're ever in trouble, it shows that they REALLY REALLY care. Last but not least, BEST GYM EVERRRR and its free!!, 866686=UC Davis is best known for its Picnic Day celebration, so for any prospective students trying to get a feel for the town and campus's environment, I suggest you check that day out! It's held in April on the Arboratem, which is basically the prettiest place you'll ever see. Also, the campus gets all four seasons (which is a huge plus for me, having grown up in So-Cal)., 69398=The college town of Davis has places where students can go for fun. There are local movie theaters in Downtown Davis--all within walking or biking distance. There are many local boutiques and major fashion chains like Forever 21 for shoppers. There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more. UC Davis hosts an annual Picnic Day where various organizations provide fun games and offer food for a day full of fun for all ages. The annual Chemistry Magic Show is one that people should not miss!, 615788=UC Davis is a wonderful college located in the heart of Davis, California. It's an excellent school with many opportunities. The ratio of cows to bicycles here seems to be 1:1., 131694=The campus host the Whole Earth Festival, usually in May, where there is live music and cool crafts being sold all week. It is truly a unique UCD experience. Even more popular than that is Picnic Day, the university's open house, with fun things to do in all the departments, a big parade in the morning, and the Band-uh! battling it out at the Arboretum all afternoon against other college bands. It's a town-wide event and always endless amounts of fun., 236860=I will not attend UC Davis until September, but their reputation is phenomenal. I am a pre-vet animal science major, and UC Davis has the best veterinarian program in all of California and most parts of the world. During my visits everyone has been very nice and accommodating, as well as genuinely interested in prospective students., 41713=I was able to get a lot of financial aid, almost a full scholarship for the 2011-2012 year. Especially if your family's income is low-middle class to low, Davis does it's best to keep you from spending $10,000 out of pocket which means no emptying savings or taking private bank loans. They have the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan which provided me with and extra $5,000. Look it up. It's amazing. The other private school I wanted to attend asked me to take $10,000 out of various federal loans and and an additional $25,000. Davis offers the same great opportunities plus some since it's bigger at a cheaper school. I definitely feel grateful I had the option of picking this one instead. The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years. When i was admitted in Fall of 2007, my tuition per quarter was about $2800; now it has skyrocketed to $4600 per quarter., 542848=First make friends with your roommates. Buy a bike with fenders or get fenders for your tires, they come in great use all of Oct. through February. Make the most from eating at the dining commons, it will be only time you won't be thinking what your next meal will be., 321820=Because it's a UC, it's a bit on the pricey side. Out of pocket, I paid about $3500 my freshman year with the help of all the grants I got. The university itself gave me about $1500 last year. I refused to get loans., 424078=picnic day is held in april and is the largest event that every student (or non-student) looks forward to! :), 891985=Get a bike! Don't get 7:30 classes. Go easy the first quarter, 533254=Jeremiah 29:11 For He knows the plans he has for you, to give you a hope & a future., 503477=For the third time, Picnic Day! Also, the football games are fun to attend if you get in the Aggie Pack. The Whole Earth Festival is fun to check out too. Ask around about the Death Star. Did you know there's a pub on campus? Go to the Silo, and right next door is a convenient little pub. At least it was back in 2006.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot As a freshman this past school year, I noticed that the staff and faculty at UC Davis was very knowledgeable, helpful, and accommodating to the schedules of students. I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasn\u2019t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis there\u2019s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.
