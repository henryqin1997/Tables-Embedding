The campus is gorgeous and the friendliness and personable staff is just overwhelming and extremely encouraging! The curriculums for my double majors in Criminology and Martial Arts are interesting, informative, and very modern., 2386=Within the University of Bridgeport, the classroom ratio, students to teacher, is 17:1. The classroom has very little students in each class. For example, if you are taking an English 101 class there are about 20 english 101 classes giving during the semester so that no class is over booked. That is a benefit for each student as well as the teacher., 177548=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Did enjoy being here i had a great time at this school. i found a home away from home there. there is a huge variety of clubs, organizations, and extracurricular activities available to choose from. if you get out your dorm room and get involved you won't have a dull moment. they also have great parties for the party lovers. Did learn a lot The classrooms were moderately sized and the teachers care about their students. if you have any problem you could talk to your teacher and they will help you. Teachers are also very knowledgeable about whatever course they teach and they are eager to pass it on to you!
