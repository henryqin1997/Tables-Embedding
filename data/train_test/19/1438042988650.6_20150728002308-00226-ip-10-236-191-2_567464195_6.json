His novel is in this sense a work of paranoid genius, a magnificent necropolis that will take its place amidst the grand detritus of our culture. Its teetering structure is greater by far than the many surrounding literary shacks and hovels. But we must look to other writers for food and warmth. \u00a0 National Book Foundation, Casey Hicks (Jul 30, 2009) added by Shortride | edit Those who have read",
