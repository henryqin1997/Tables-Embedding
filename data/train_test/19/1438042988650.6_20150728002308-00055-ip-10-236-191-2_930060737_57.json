            "A great thing about UNH is that it has campus alerts that can be sent directly to students phones. There are also blue lights within view no matter where you are on campus that have distress buttons.",
            "Greek life is always booming at UNH. There's a large number of fraternities and sororities so that if you want to be a part of a UNH Greek family, there are many within reach.",
            "There are so many clubs at UNH. There's always something to do on campus because there are so many clubs that you can find just about anything that interests you.",
            "Students who love to be involved and outgoing would love UNH. Most of the activities and clubs on campus help people open up and meet a lot of marvelous students.",
            "There is an amazing coffee shop called Breaking New Grounds right in downtown Durham, which is tasty as well as relaxing. The down-town area is right on campus so everything that you could need is in reach.",
            "UNH can be expensive for out-of-state students, but being one myself I have felt that I have been given many openings and opportunities to attend the university at an affordable price.",
            "UNH is known for their lively sporting events. The athletes and atmosphere brings everyone together during games. If I am not at a game, I like to hang out with friends on and off campus.",
            "UNH has a great dining service. There are no restrictions on how often you can go into the dining hall, even with the cheapest meal plan. The food is always delicious, no matter which of the three dining halls you eat at.",
            "The dorm that I lived in last year was so involved and fun. My residential advisers were amazing people who were more my friends than anything else. As a dorm we participated on sports teams together and bonded so that I always felt like there was a friend nearby.",
            "Professors truly want you to do well at UNH. Classes are filled with interesting information that is not hard to retain. All of my experiences have been slightly tough in course work, but definitely manageable.",
            "Definitely the place to be if you want to be surrounded by a lot of intelligent people. The campus is just small enough so that you can get across it quickly, but big enough so that it is not at all cramped.",
            "UNH is an amazing school filled with many opportunities. Not only do they have a wide array of interesting classes, but there are numerous study abroad programs. The food and people are also fantastic!"

UNH does offer much of everything though and also offers many times to try and get into that class you want. UNH also offers J-term (January Term) or classes during the rest of the university's winter vacation time. Class can range and I'm positive that everyone has found one class that has inspired them, intrigued them, or challenged them; but nonetheless I'm sure they loved it., 148322=College is expensive, that's hard to get around, but I really feel that my money is going to good use. Just since I started in the fall of 2011 I feel that I am a totally transformed person. I have learned so much and feel really lucky to be a student at a university that offers so much., 2055=One the first night that freshmen come to school, there\u2019s an event called \u201cWildActs.\u201d It\u2019s an improv show that focuses on many aspects of college life. There\u2019s a lot of school spirit during Basketball and football games. Also, there\u2019s Jukebox, which brings students to learn about extracurricular activities, raffles, and IHOP gives out free pancakes, and you get a lot of free stuff. Also, there\u2019s an annual parade where everyone, including the school\u2019s fraternities and sororities make floats for prizes. There are endless possibilities-all you have to do is get involved. Every time you go to the MUB, they have events open to the public that are informative. Also they are big concerts near the end of the semester. I was told last year that there was a Snoop Dogg concert, and that this year Lupe Fiasco concert is going to be sold out. Sometimes, they also invite people to give lectures-I met Angela Davis during the Martin Luther King Celebration in January., 12192=I am really enjoying attending UNH. There are so many clubs and organizations to get involved in, ranging from the College Democrats, to the Organic Gardening Club, to Greek Life, to Fencing. There is truly a niche for everyone, and there is always something going on. Aside from academics, concerts and guests are brought to UNH to perform. In December, the comedian Bo Burnham came to the Whittemore Center. The dorms are above average and although campus incidents occur, as is inevitable with a school the size of UNH, I feel safe on campus. There is a free bus for students which travels to surrounding towns such as Portsmouth, Dover and Newmarket, and the nearby train station travels throughout the northeast (Boston, Portland, etc.) Even though UNH is situated in Durham, New Hampshire, I have never felt isolated whatsoever. I enjoy the classes, I enjoy the community, and I enjoy the social aspect of UNH., 250911=DHOP is the place to be on a weekend night around 12:30 am., 227553=The campus' three dining halls are well-placed, and the availability of food is exceptionally good. During the week, at least one dining hall is always open from 7:30 am straight through to 11:00 pm. Food quality is excellent, and eating healthy is definitely an option, aided by nutrition guides. The staff is accommodating to diners with special dietary needs as long as the student is willing to consistently stay in contact with dining hall administrators., 122084=unh has three dining halls that always have freshly cooked food everyday and always have variety. the dining halls often participate in holidays and theme nights (such as valentine's day, mardi gras, march madness, etc), which give the students a refreshing dining experience. one thing that sets unh dining apart from other colleges is that unh dining has a messaging system called \u201cnapkin notes.\u201d with napkin notes, students can write questions, suggestions, and comments on napkins and deposit them into a box to await a response. the napkin notes are then responded to by the dining hall manager an pinned up on a bulletin board outside of the dining hall for everyone to see. i think that it is a very clever way for students to express their opinions and comments directly to the person who is in charge of their food. the manager often takes students' suggestions and does whatever it takes to give unh students pleasant, satisfactory dining experiences., 87694=The tips i have from when i visited were that it is better to have a high GPA and a 1900 on the SATs to get the best scholarships. The lowest score for a scholarship is 1780.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The classes are amazing and there is so much to choose from and UNH really tries to cater the classes so that individuals are actually interested in the classes they are attending and want to be there. For example, I'm a HUGE horse person but not a big history buff and I discovered that UNH offered a class that studied the use of the horse in history that I could take for the history requirement. You can even find work study jobs that cater to your major as well (as a pre-vet major I work in the NH State Diagnostic Lab on campus with veterinarians and get to observe interactive necropsies (animal autopsies) where the vets ask for your ideas and opinions and it's ok to say I don't know because they'll fill you in.
