In general, it is reasonable to consider that electro-oxidation makes sense when renewable energy is used. This has recently been highlighted by several authors [47,48,49,50]., 33905=The landfill studied is located in Piedmont (northern Italy) and consists of three lots. Two lots are full and are in the post-cultivation phase; one lot is currently in use. The cultivation was carried out in lot 1 from 1988 until 1994, and in lot 2, from 1994 until 2000. The landfill receives approximately 25,000 tonnes of MSW per year., 87454=Figure 4 and Figure 5 compare the discharge limits set by Italian regulations (Leg. Dec. No. 152/2006) [42] with the samples before and after the 7-day treatment, respectively., 34805=Lot 3 is wider than the first two, is physically separate from lots 1 and 2, and is basically a separate landfill in terms of storage capacity, leachate, rainwater, and road network. It was dug in three stages (called the 1st, 2nd and 3rd hydraulic sectors), from east to west, and the last stage was completed in 2006. From a management point of view, the most western point (which corresponds to the first stage and part of the second stage) is almost full, and the western part, which began operating following completion of the third stage, is currently being used. The overall area of lot 3 is approximately 30,600 m2., 18456=Sustainability 2013, 5(9), 3960-3975; doi:10.3390/su5093960, 136788=\u00a9 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.
