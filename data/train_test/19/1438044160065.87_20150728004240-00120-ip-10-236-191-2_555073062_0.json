I\u2019ll even go further; it\u2019s pocketable-small, quite inexpensive, reasonably sharp in the center, and has very little distortion. If you\u2019re camera has an AF motor built in, it\u2019s not a bad choice at all. But be aware: it vignettes a fair bit, the corners aren\u2019t all that sharp, and it has a lot of purple fringing.
