    "textBeforeTable": "Pirates under pressure \"It has been a very challenging park for him,\" Hurdle said. \"If this was any other venue, he would have gotten the ball. But for me in this venue, this game, Cole is going to be our guy.\" Burnett lasted only two-plus innings in the series opener at Busch Stadium, where he was also pounded on Sept. 6 and Aug. 15. Hurdle admitted he wasn't willing to give his Opening Day starter another start in St. Louis. \"It's a difficult decision, because [Burnett] has meant so much, we've asked so much of him while he's been here,\" Hurdle said. \"\u2026 A.J. wants the ball every day he's scheduled to pitch. That's one of the things that's gotten him to this point in his career and having the success that he's had. You want to treat men professionally. Sometimes we don't agree on things. We have to find a way to get this together to give our team the opportunity to win in all aspects.\" The Pirates have been a tight corps of \"men,\" as Hurdle always takes pains to call his players, since leaving Florida. Hurdle hated telling Burnett, the pitching staff's leader, that he was being skipped for the 23-year-old Cole, even if everyone knows that Cole is Pittsburgh's version of Wacha. Hurdle delivered that news after Wacha,",
    "textAfterTable": "He had to be. It's been clear since Cole shut down the Cardinals in Game 2 -- two hits, one run (on a Yadier Molina homer) in six highly poised innings -- that he would be the smart pick to start a deciding fifth game. And the Pirates have won Cole's past six starts. For what it's worth, this would have been a really difficult call a year ago, but the latest update to the playoff format added a travel day between Game 4 and Game 5, which means Cole will be on normal rest when he faces Adam Wainwright, who buried the Bucs in Game 1. Pittsburgh had hoped to avoid a return trip to St. Louis -- \"I don't want to have to take another road trip,\" Jason Grilli said before the game -- but the home team was dismantled by Wacha, who didn't seem to mind his role as a baseball buzzkill. \"We're the new team,\" Andrew McCutchen had proclaimed Sunday after the Pirates' 5-3 win in Game 3. \"The Rays, the Oakland A's have been here. I guess you can say we're fresh meat. Everybody wants a piece, wants to see what the Pirates are all about, and it gets me excited.\" While the Cards' image is as old school as it gets, they've got their own set of analysts and a scouting department that about 29 other organizations would like to",
