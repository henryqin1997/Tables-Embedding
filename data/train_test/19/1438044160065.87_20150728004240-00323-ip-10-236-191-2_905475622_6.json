            "The campus contains raquetball courts and a climbing and bouldering wall, a student field for football or soccer, and a game room with ping pong, foosball, and pool tables. There are lots of fun things to do in the Springfield area (25 minutes away) and there are lots of unused bridges and creeks in the area as well as a park. Get creative :)",
            "The cafeteria food is quite acceptable and favorable. There are few things off-limits.",
            "Most at Southwest Baptist are Christians and are therefore pretty friendly people. Many will leave their doors open and are open for socializing and having new faces in their rooms. In addition, the dorm staff usually put on several social events a semester.",
            "Programs are not impossible but still stretching, challenging, and time consuming.",
            "Continue to apply for scholarships in college during breaks and when you have downtime in your schoolwork.",
            "Southwest Baptist University is a great private school with reasonable tuition and plenty of scholarship opportunities. More importantly, the professors are first-class with high degrees of education and also caring personalities that desire to see you succeed. The campus life and students are mostly positive as it is a private Christian institution with many opportunities for social, physical, and spiritual growth."

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Part of Southwest Baptist University's credo is that they are caring. This is a completely true statement. I am a rather shy person at first and I always felt welcome every time I came to visit before school started last year. The students waved to me. The ambassadors were warm and friendly. Several times, doors were opened for me by gentlemanly students here. The teachers make you feel comfortable and are very engaging. Yes it is a small school and yes it is in a tiny community, but the education and the social experiences you have here are worth it! I'm making memories and gaining to knowledge to last a life time! I love the chapel services. I love the Thursday night worship service in the tiny chapel in the middle of campus. Assassins week was a blast! And all of the student faculty (RA's, etc.) really make an effort to make you feel like you're a part of a family. By the way, they have an amazing city park in Bolivar. Seriously, it's gorgeous in summer and they decorate it up really well in the winter. You are going to enjoy it a lot. Am learning a lot As a double major I began taking the maximum load possible my second semester of freshman year. One of my majors is",
