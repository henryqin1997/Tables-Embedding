    "textBeforeTable": "Big 12 Big 12 = 24.1 Big East = 23.9 Big Ten = 24.1 Let\u2019s take a look at the top 10 most productive players for each conference, ranked by TIQ per 40 minutes. Here are the conference averages. In addition to scoring at a very efficient rate, Woodall has been one of the best floor leaders in Division I thus far, averaging 8.3 apg. The cherry on top is Woodall\u2019s 3.4 rpg. He\u2019s got four double-doubles already this season, coming three rebounds short of a triple-double in the Panthers\u2019 86-78 win against Rider in the second game of the season. Although the Big 12 and Big Ten have the slight edge, the Big East has the most productive player of any power conference team. Pittsburgh\u2019s Travon Woodall has been in beast mode all season, at least until a groin injury and abdominal tear forced Woodall to the sidelines for one month. That\u2019s about the only thing that\u2019s been able to stop Woodall, who is shooting 52 percent from the field, 46 percent from 3-point range and 85 percent from the free throw line. If the average Total Impact Quotient means anything, the Big 12 and Big Ten have a slight edge over the Big East. Our player rating system credits players for all the various contributions they make during a game, such as points scored, assists, blocks, steals, etc.",
