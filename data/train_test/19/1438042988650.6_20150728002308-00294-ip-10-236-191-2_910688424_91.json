            "There is a lot of great hiking trails and nature areas to see. There is also a pretty good night life on campus. If you are really into going to shows and concerts, it's not the best city because we don't have an arena or anything for it so generally if you want to go to a show, you have to go to Portland. Which is a hassle.",
            "I don't dine on campus because I don't have a meal plan. I pick up a delicious scone every once in a while though.",
            "I have not lived in a dorm so I am unsure of the experience although I have heard some horror stories. I have also heard that the dorm experience is really nice for a lot of reasons.",
            "1. Be sure that a big University is right for you. 2. Don't be afraid to contact your professors outside of class. They like to see the effort and it's also really helpful.",
            "University is a large university with a large student body. There is a lot of diversity and a lot of amazing programs to get involved with. The University of Oregon staff are helpful and knowledgeable."

Whatever type of student you are, you will be able to find others like you at U of O., 410761=I toured the campus this summer during July, and absolutely fell IN LOVE with this school. The school spirit, the excessive friendliness emanating from people on every corner, how much there was to do and get involved in and the academic rigor they portrayed. Also, the campus is absolutely beautiful, and there seems like something to do for everyone, and there's no one specific stereotype at the U of O., 53173=Get your FAFSA in on time and if you are coming from a different state make sure you get it in by March 1st.

Anyone who has a will to continue their education will fit in and grow at this university. Tips for prospective students Do as best as you can in high school and apply early to the university. There are more and more students applying each year and that makes it a little more hard to get accepted. Having a strong high school transcript helps along with extra circular actives. Bang for the buck Oregon utilizes their tax money and puts a large effort into education. In-State tuition is affordable for the majority of families and encourages people to get a college degree. Am enjoying being here Eugene is a wonderful place to start your life. It is a very nice community and a great college town. The school itself is small enough to feel the individual attention yet large enough to surround you with positive enforcement.
