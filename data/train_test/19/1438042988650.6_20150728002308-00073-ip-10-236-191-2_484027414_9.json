These particles are ideal for feeding into tabletting dies. They are easily moved by machine and provide optimum flowability., 42424=Polydextrose is also contemplated for use as a carrier. Polydextrose is a non-sucrose, essentially non-nutritive carbohydrate substitute. It can be prepared through polymerization of glucose in the presence of polycarboxylic acid catalyst and polyols. Generally, polydextrose is known to be commercially available in three forms: polydextrose A and polydextrose K, which are powdered solids, and polydextrose N supplied as a 70% solution. Each of these products also contain some low molecular weight components, such as glucose, sorbitol and certain oligomers. Regarding polydextrose, Applicants incorporate herein the contents of co-pending, U.S. application Ser. No. 07/881,612 filed May 12, 1992, REFILED as continuation U.S. application Ser. No. 08/120,171 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,858., 62338=The data reported in Table 8 demonstrates the uniformity of particles produced as a result of the present invention and the virtual elimination of fines normally present in tabletting processes. In particular, a quick review of the particle sizes resulting from the flash flow procedures employed in Examples 2-7 show that there are virtually no particles produced which are course, i.e., in the range of 2000 microns, or in the range of fine particles (at about 150 microns)., 18737=The present application is a continuation in part application of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/847,595 filed Mar. 5, 1992, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,431 on Feb. 7,1995, and U.S. application Ser. No. 07/881,612, now abandoned, filed May 12, 1992, which was subsequently refiled as continuation application bearing U.S. Ser. No. 08/120,171 on Sep. 10, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,858 issued Mar. 26, 1996., 41398=The feedstock can also include maltooligo-saccharides produced by selective hydrolysis of cornstarch followed by removal of high and low molecular weight compounds. The general description of malto-oligosaccharides as contemplated herein is set forth in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 07/847,595 filed Mar. 5, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,387,431., 45911=The flash shear process can be carried out in an apparatus which has means for increasing the temperature of a non-solubilized feedstock and means for simultaneously advancing it for ejection. A multiple heating zone twin screw extruder can be used for increasing the temperature of the non-solubilized feedstock. A second element of the apparatus is an ejector which provides the feedstock in a condition for shearing. The ejector is in fluid communication with the means for increasing the temperature and is arranged at a point to receive the feedstock while it is in internal flow condition. The ejector is preferably a nozzle which provides high pressure ejection of the feedstock material. See co-pending commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 965,804 filed Oct. 23, 1992 entitled \"Process For Making Shearform Matrix,\" which is incorporated herein by reference.}",

The resulting product represents a delivery system for delivery of an active ingredient which was not subjected to neither high temperature processing nor high compression during production. The tablets were prepared using 97% of the drug-bearing free form aggregates set forth above at a rate of 97% along with 2% magnesium stearate and 1% talc. The above mixture was processed on a flash flow machine at 3600 rpm at a temperature setting of 140\ufffd C. (temperature of flash flow material 123\ufffd C.). White fluffy granules resulted which were used in tabletting. ______________________________________ACETAMINOPHEN TABLEIngredient % Content______________________________________Acetaminophen (APAP) 50.0%Sorbitol 4.0%Malti-sorbo (Roquette) 17.5%Maltodextin (MALTRON 365) 17.5%Lecithin 1.0%Medium Chain Triglyceride 3.0%(NEOBEEM 5)Polyethylene Glycol 2.0%Dicalcium Phosphate 5.0% 100.0%______________________________________ A free form aggregate was formed from a feedstock which was prepared in accordance with the following composition.
