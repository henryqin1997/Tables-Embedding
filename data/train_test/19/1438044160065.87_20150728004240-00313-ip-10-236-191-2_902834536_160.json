            "I feel pretty safe on campus. At night, it is well lit and there are emergency phones all over campus. If you are a girl walking on campus at night and you get too scared, there is a number you can text/call and you can get a police escort to where ever you need to go which is way cool!",
            "To be honest, I don't know a whole lot about this, but we do have a street where all of the Frat houses and Sorority houses are. I know they have opportunities for you to go sign up for them. They also hold a lot of parties that anyone can go to, although they usually cost a little. I know a few people in both and I know that they love it.",
            "I am not in any clubs up here, but I know that if you get a group together of about ten people, you can make up your own club. There are a few opportunities each semester to get familiar with the clubs and just to see what is out there. We have Day On The Quad the first week of school where you go to the Quad and all of the clubs have booths set up where you can go check them all out, get free stuff, get food, and also sign up for any clubs that interest you.",
            "This school is great for students who want to move away from home, get a good education, and still have a lot of fun while do so. You need to be able to get your homework done and still balance your social life and the amount of sleep you get. It would be good to be outgoing, but you can still be semi-shy and meet new people.",
            "Some unusual traditions? Well, there is always the True Aggie nights. There is a statue platform where you go and kiss someone under a full moon and you become a True Aggie. They are entertaining to go to and it is just a cool tradition up there.",
            "I would have to say you get quite a bang for you buck at Utah State. Even though it is really expensive to go here, you definitely get a very good education. My major is extremely competitive and the best in the state. It would also help me get a job quickly because big companies look to hire graduates from Utah State in my major because they know how competitive it is, how hard they work us, and how much we really have to work to do well.",
            "There is so much to do in Logan for fun. There are restaurants to go to, playing all kinds of sports at the Hyper. You can go into the canyon and rock climb, hike, bike ride, or even head up to Bear Lake for a raspberry shake. You can go to all sorts of parks, the ice skating rink, go to any of the Aggie games, or go see a movie. There is swing dancing Wednesday nights and bowling at the Fun Park. There are lots of stores to shop at downtown. It is quite a blast!",
            "I haven't eaten much on campus, but the place I go to is fantastic. I go to the Quadside Cafe and they have the best wraps in the world! There is also a lot of food options in Logan that are to die for good. The great thing about Logan is that is has a lot of individual local restaurants that are very good. My favorite would have to be The Crepery. Their crepes are the best and so is their hot cocoa. There is also a fantastic Italian place called Le Nonne and the delicious local diner called Angie's which is famous for clean the sink challenge and the Tripe-Double burger. Logan also has a lot of the popular restaurants ranging from McDonald's and Wendy's to The Olive Garden and Texas Roadhouse.",
            "I haven't ever lived in a dorm, but where I have stayed is off-campus and it is so much fun! There are so many people to meet and a lot of parties to attend. The social level definitely lowers in the winter because it is so cold, but when it is warm, people have their doors open, they are always playing football, chatting in the sun, and so much more. There is so much to do with others even when it's cold.",
            "I would say depending on the classes, it could be between four to five stars. My major is pretty intense and all of those classes have been had. My generals have also been a lot harder than I ever expected. It especially makes it hard when you don't really care about the subject.",
            "It is really helpful to know what your major is before you come to college. That way, you can start your degree right off and get done in the time you want. I would live off-campus as well. They say that as a Freshman you should live on-campus because you are more involved. That is not true. I have only ever lived off-campus and it is a blast! Plus, you get to meet more older people which is really fun. Make sure you get your homework done. I know this is hard to do, but if you get it done early, you can party more.",
            "Utah State is a very fun place to be and is in a very pretty part of Utah in the Logan, Cache Valley area. You can come up here to get an amazing education while also getting to have fun and meet new people. This is such a great school to go to and I would never want to go anywhere else."

The average student spends about 8-12 grand a year for both semester on living here and that's if money is no option. That is about an average of 2000 on tuition each semester, 1600 on housing, 1000 on food, and about 500 for books and what not. The travel here by the way is completely free. All bus systems for city and campus are free for all to ride. Believe me this is really worth your money, 181862=Apply now! If you apply before the December 1st deadline, you automatically receive academic scholarships if you're eligible. I currently have half tuition because I applied early. Also, live on campus for at least your first year. There's a lot that you can get involved in with Housing and Residence Life, AND you're close to your classes. I could wake up five minutes before class any day of the week and still get to class on time - it's reassuring. Get involved and go to events, because they happen alllll the time and they're an absolute blast! Also, pay attention when anybody or anything says the words free Aggie Ice Cream, because they are said often, and they are beautiful. Aggie Ice Cream is like food for your soul. 26 flavors of goodness., 1118057=You can go hiking, ice skating indoors or outdoors in the winter, skiing (there is a fantastic ski resort in Logan Canyon about 45 minutes from campus), showshoeing, sledding, go to a show at the Ellen Eccles Theater, thrift shop, volunteer at numerous charitable organizations, attend free events and activities at the Logan Tabernacle (a community church/fine arts events center), shop at local businesses including antique book stores, organic markets, global trade gift shops, fashion boutiques, etc., you can take community classes, visit the local gardener's market from April to October, go yard-saleing, attend local religious services and events, get involved with the Deaf community, volunteer with our chapter of Special Olympics, spend time with the elderly, party at the White Owl (the only bar here that I know of), etc., 38363=Utah State University touts a friendly atmosphere, intimate campus, world-class research faculty and ready opportunities to work with them, and accessible professors. While the professors are readily available and glad to explain difficult courses during office hours, my professors explain concepts very poorly in class. Instruction seems to emphasize superficial examples and applications, and the deeper theory is rarely taught. My electrical engineering and statics lectures are 100% example, 0% theory, and the required textbooks only superficially explain things. The science professors are much better at explaining theory, but still emphasize sample problems instead of symbolic exploration. However, learning opportunities outside of class are much better. Though only a freshman, I\u2019ve been able to work with the university\u2019s Microgravity Research Team from day one, so I\u2019ve picked up a little heat transfer theory and have written ten pages of the team\u2019s proposal for a 2011 experiment. Almost any faculty member will set you up in a research project if you ask them, or at least tell you what to study so that you can contribute as soon as possible. They are happy to accept volunteer lab workers. The USU library is an excellent learning environment. It has quiet zones, group study rooms, several large open computer labs and conversational study areas, and an excellent collection. Besides, it boasts a flood of natural light in the daytime, so you don\u2019t feel locked up and confined inside. Overall, I\u2019d say USU is a pretty average learning environment. The facilities are good and the opportunities to learn outside of class are great, but these strengths are balanced by its remarkably poor lecturers., 917991=To become an Ultimate Aggie, one must run across the entire campus from the time first snow falls in November to February. The participant has to do so naked, evade campus police, and ride the huge metal bull statue. Oh yeah, and you have to be photographed for proof., 874751=They have movies held at the main building for student all through out the year which is nice because it gets cold in Logan. Sledding is an option through out the whole year. Utah State has The Howl every October and is way fun. Also the End of the Year Bash where they have bands and artist come perform. Can't forget about the football and basketball games that are a blast., 235153=the greek community has been steadily growing for the passed couple of years. fall of 2012 will welcome another fraternity and hopefully another sorority.}",
