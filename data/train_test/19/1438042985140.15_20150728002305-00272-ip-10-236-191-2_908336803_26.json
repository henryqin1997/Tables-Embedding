            "Those who are more comfortable in a smaller setting and whom like to actually be known by their professor by name will enjoy this college. As well as those who enjoy presentations and writing.",
            "Be prepared to learn and work hard. Be prepared for class and do not miss class. Also just be friendly and outgoing and it will be easy to make friends.",
            "I find it a bit overpriced but it is a private institution so I can understand. However, I wish they would stop raising the tuition or if they do they should also evaluate the current awarded scholarships and increase their values as well.",
            "I enjoy that it is a small college. I also particularly enjoy the atmosphere of the lake in the summer and fall. Its a beautiful campus and I enjoy being outdoors. It is also quite peaceful. Not only that but for the most part the professors are friendly and enjoyable as well as the students.",
            "At times certain professors can go off on many tangents rather than keeping to the material. Although they may be interesting they are not always useful or relevant."

The professors know who you are and when you are attending class. It is great for students who wish to be known by their professors and would like to ask for extra help at certain times. Tips for prospective students Carthage College is a great school if you want to come to class. With larger schools, you can not show up for class and the professor will probably not notice, however, at Carthage, the professors know who you are and will know if you are missing. Carthage is also great if you want personal attention and may need or want extra help and advice after class hours. Bang for the buck",
