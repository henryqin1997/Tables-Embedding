Forty-three percent agree that the tax cuts helped make the economic downturn shorter and less severe, but 44 percent say the tax cuts didn\u2019t help. Not surprisingly, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to attribute the tax cuts with soothing the country\u2019s economic ills., 4116=\"Helping the economy recover\" barely bests \"protecting the country from terrorism\" when the two priorities are pitted directly against each other (32 percent to 29 percent respectively), but a plurality (37 percent) says \"both\" are important priorities for the government to work on right now. This is a shift from almost a year ago, when only 22 percent said \"helping the economy,\" 24 percent said \"protecting\" from terrorism and 51 percent put them on equal footing (December 2002)., 2977=\"Virtually everything in this survey suggests the deep and almost even partisan divisions of the country that we saw in 2000 are back,\" comments Opinion Dynamics President John Gorman. \"Two years ago there was talk that the events of 9/11 would bring the nation together; events since then have clearly reopened partisan chasms.\", 379=Polling was conducted by telephone September 9-10, 2003 in the evenings.

Ten percent think the country would be in the same shape. While there are only slight gender differences on these questions, Democrats are over seven times more likely than Republicans to think things would be better today under former President Clinton. Finally, about one-third of Americans say they would feel better if\u00a0Bill Clinton (search)\u00a0were president today while almost half (48 percent) say they would feel worse. Only nine percent say they would feel the same. President Bush\u2019s overall job approval rating continues to hold in the high 50s, about where it has been for the last two months. While his overall rating is 58 percent approve, Bush receives only 47 percent approval for the job he\u2019s doing managing the economy.
