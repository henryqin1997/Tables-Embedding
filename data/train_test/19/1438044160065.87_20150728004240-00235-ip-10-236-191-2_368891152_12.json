It supersedes the printed first edition of 1995 and all previous electronic editions. It is to be read with a Web browser such as Firefox or Internet Explorer. This edition documents Kermit 95 2.1.3., 17089=First Printing: September 1995 Revised: February 1997; June 1998; March 2000, April-October 2002, January 2003 Printed in the United States of America, 636=Kermit 95 2.0 (June 2002) was the first release of K95 with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) (available for Windows only). Version 2.1 is a minor update to version 2.0 that fixes some problems that were reported and adds some new features, mostly to the FTP client. Releases before 2.0 were Console-mode programs for portability to other operating systems. Version 2.0 is available in both GUI and Console versions. In this document, we refer to the GUI version of K95 as K95G. Most of the features of the GUI and Console versions are the same; the following table summarizes the differences:}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{253541=In Windows NT/2000/XP, and on any Windows version with the GUI version of K95, it is possible to display characters from many different writing systems on the same screen at once, since the console screen is Unicode based, but when using the Console version of K95 in Windows 95/98/ME (and in OS/2), where the console uses a regular PC code page, only the characters from that code page can be displayed., 358537=NOTE: \"hostmode\" is simply a Batch program (HOSTMODE.BAT) that starts K95.EXE (K2.EXE in OS/2) and has it execute the host-mode management script, HOSTMODE.KSC. In K95 1.1.21 or later (new installations only, not patched ones), the HOSTMODE.BAT program is normally in the \\v(common) directory and is started most easily from the desktop shortcut that is created by the K95 Install script., 215211=Kermit 95 1.1.21 and later also support the rather rare combination of 8-bit data bytes with one parity bit. The command for this would be:, 324329=Lucky you, this section has been removed. As of version 1.1.21, K95 detects whether each file is text or binary when uploading, switches to the appropriate mode automatically, and informs its Kermit partner on the other end of the connection of the transfer mode for each file. For details see Section 4 of the C-Kermit 8.0 Update Notes., 167514=Notes: K95 DATE does not set the date, it only shows it (and the time). If you give it a date or time or date-time operand (in almost any format), it gives it back to you in standard format. It can also be used to do date/time arithmetic, e.g. \"date 1 january 2002 +1000days\". HELP DATE for details., 275174=K95 1.1.21 and later supports direct entry of 16-bit Unicode UCS-2 values via the new Unicode Compose Key, Alt-N by default. In this case, you must type exactly four hexadecimal digits denoting the code value of the desired character. This feature is useful to those who have Unicode charts handy, either in the Unicode Standard (a book) or on any of various websites including the Unicode one, or a simple one HERE at the Kermit website. As with the regular Compose key, you can use the space bar to cancel a compose sequence and you can use Alt-H while in Unicode Compose mode to get a popup help screen., 257734=As a compromise, a new font developed especially for Kermit 95 by Everson Typography, Everson Mono Terminal (EMT), supports most of the non-Han characters in the Base Multilingual Plane of Unicode, including Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Coptic, Armenian, Georgian, Runes, Ogham, Canadian Syllabics, Cherokee, Tibetan, Math, Symbols, Line and Box Drawing, Dingbats, and APL (not supported, besides Han, are Indic, Hangul, Ethiopic, Syriac, Thai, Lao, Myanmar, and Braille). This is not a free font; it comes with Kermit 95 2.x but may not be further redistributed. CLICK HERE for a sample., 262340=When using UTF8 as your terminal character-set, you should be aware of some new wrinkles. First of all, there is no ISO 2022 character-set switching because (a) UTF8 is incompatible with ISO 2022 (except insofar as ISO 2022 can be used to switch into and out of UTF8), and (b) UTF8 doesn't need to switch character sets, since by definition, it already contains all the characters that are in any set you would switch to. However, this also means that host-based software that uses ISO 2022 to put up forms, math, and so on, doesn't work when your terminal character-set is UTF8. In other words, for anything beyond ordinary plain-text display, UTF8-aware host applications are required., 274782=Windows 95/98/NT/ME/2000/XP support the installation of multiple keyboard layouts via the Keyboard Control Panel. This feature allows you to install any combination of layouts which is useful if you need to use German for some applications and U.S. English for others. Pressing the Left Alt key and the Left Shift key at the same time switches among the installed keyboard layouts., 263705=Of course host-based forms-filling applications can be written using UTF-8 rather than ISO 2022, but you probably won't find any, except maybe in new or experimental versions of Linux, or maybe in Plan 9., 31504=You can start the Kermit 95 Dialer with the K95G Dial Toolbar button, or from a desktop shortcut or the Start menu if you elected these at install time, as well as from a command prompt or Start \u2192 Run box as K95DIAL.EXE in the K95 program directory. No matter how you start it, only one copy of the Dialer may be active at a time (the version 1.1.21 and later Dialer enforces this policy)., 315658=Kermit 95 normally optimizes screen updates by writing only those cells that changed in situations where it knows this is safe. It appears to be safe in Windows NT/2000/XP and OS/2 (all versions, all screen sizes), and in Windows 95 if the screen size is 80 by 25, 43, or 50; with any other dimensions, this form of screen update could cause a General Protection Fault in the Windows 95 (and maybe 98 and ME) kernel, and thus we don't attempt it in Windows 9x/ME except with the screen sizes listed., 199704=In the Console version... Just below the Title bar is a Tool bar (Windows 95/98/ME only). On the left is your font size control. If the writing in the Terminal screen is too small for you, just click on the little arrow button to open up the font-size menu to pick a bigger size. Pick any size you want, even a teeny-weeny size and see the tiny little Terminal screen, just right for a mouse. In Windows NT/2000/XP and OS/2, use the \"Font...\" entry on the System menu. Warning: If you see an \"Auto\" entry in the font list, do not choose it. See Item 9 in the K95 Bugs List for details., 299134=Unlike PCTERM, which is a special keyboard mode that can be used with any terminal type, VTNT is specific to the Microsoft Windows 2000 and XP Services for UNIX, in which each key event sends a Windows-specific data structure, allowing keystrokes to be interpreted by the server as if they were coming from its local keyboard, with all its locale-specific information about character sets and keyboard layouts. Once the VTNT terminal starts there is no method for returning to the Kermit 95 command prompt since every key event is used by VTNT already., 40138=In Windows, Kermit 95 supports two kinds of dialout devices: TAPI and \"physical\". TAPI is Microsoft's Telephony Application Programming Interface, in which dialout devices are abstractions similar to Kermit 95's \"modems\", and are known by long descriptive names such as \"Compaq Presario 56K-DF\". Physical devices are known by a combination of the PC communications port device name, such as COM1, and the type of modem that is attached to it, such as Hayes-2400., 388726=Then, if any connections came in on port 1000, a \"chat mode\" session would be started. Connections coming in on port 2000 would get a Kermit server, and connections on port 3000 would get a host-mode session., 353042=The location of the hostmode files depends on which version of K95 you installed originally. If it was 1.1.20 or earlier, the host mode files are in the Kermit 95 program tree (e.g. C:\\K95), along with all the other Kermit 95 files. However, K95 1.1.21 introduces a new directory layout, described in the README. When a new copy K95 1.1.21 or later is installed (as opposed to patching up from an older release), the hostmode pieces are parceled out as follows:, 340789=If your PC text is (or is to be) in Unicode, use UCS-2 as Kermit 95's file character-set and either UCS-2 or UTF-8 as the transfer character set (of course this works only if the other Kermit program also supports Unicode; so far only Kermit 95 1.1.19 and C-Kermit 7.0 do). Unicode is well-supported across Windows 2000 / Office 2000 applications, including in Word, WordPad, and NotePad, in both UCS-2 and UTF-8 forms (so in this case you could also use UTF-8 as Kermit 95's file character-set). Unicode is less well supported in earlier Windows versions. UCS-2 works across more Windows versions and applications than UTF-8., 186530=Before proceeding, let's look at a gallery of K95 Terminal screen samples, captured from K95 1.1.21 and 2.0 on Windows XP. Click on any screen to see the full-size image. Most screens are 24x80, but of course K95 can also handle tall or wide screens. A few of the many user-selectable fore- and background color combinations are shown., 263052=To illustrate, you can use UTF8 safely to TYPE (cat) files, read email, and so on, but you can't use ANSI X3.64 / ISO 2022 forms-based software with UTF8 as your terminal-character-set. It's also problematic in text editors like EMACS (at least prior to UTF8-aware versions) or VI, because they don't know (for example) that three bytes make one character -- they think it's three characters -- so screen positioning and formatting don't work as you might expect, nor do character deletion or other character operations. Entering UTF8 characters (anything beyond ASCII) into applications might or might not work, depending on the application., 336311=A mixture of text and binary files can be downloaded if the other Kermit supports this feature: C-Kermit 7.0, MS-DOS Kermit 3.16, or Kermit 95 1.1.16 are the minimum versions as of this writing. Otherwise you should send files from the remote Kermit in separate groups for text and binary., 172294=When the FTP client was added to Kermit in 2002, this behavior seemed unnatural to users of text-mode FTP clients. Thus the notion of Locus was introduced: Local means that unprefixed file management commands are executed on the local computer; Remote means they are sent to the remote FTP or Kermit server for execution. By default, Kermit switches Locus automatically every time you make or break a connection, depending on what kind of connection it is. When you make an FTP connection, Kermit switches its Locus to Remote. When you make any other kind of connection, or when you break any connection, its Locus switches back to Local., 92094=For XMODEM and YMODEM protocol the packet length applies in the sending direction; 128 and 1024 are the possible values (others may be given, but only 128 and 1024 are used). For ZMODEM, which does not have packets per se, the packet length is the ZMODEM \"window size\"., 260591=Note that the character-set combo box does not reflect host-initiated character-set switching since, in certain applications, this could change on a per-character basis, e.g. with ISO 2022 line/box-drawing applications. It shows the latest user-selected character set, either by the combo box or by the SET TERMINAL CHARACTER-SET or SET TERMINAL REMOTE-CHARACTER-SET command, or when implied by a terminal emulation selection (such as ANSI, which expects the host character set to be CP437). You can see the current detailed character set assignments with the SHOW CHARACTER-SETS command., 354574=Kermit 95's host mode feature is entirely self-contained and does not make any use at all of the Windows Registry or Windows or OS/2 user IDs or passwords. Therefore it is not to be run as a Windows NT/2000/XP Service under the Service Manager unadvisedly (if you have Windows NT, 2000, or XP, you should consider using WIKSD instead of host mode).}",

In this document, we refer to the GUI version of K95 as K95G. Most of the features of the GUI and Console versions are the same; the following table summarizes the differences: Contrary to what you might read in the popular press, text-based services are very much alive -- in corporations, universities, hospitals, government agencies, laboratories -- due to their stability, ease and universality of access, ease of automation, openness, long history, and wealth of applications (EMACS, VI, EDT, EVE, and other text editors; Pine, MM, and other e-mail programs; TeX, Scribe, Troff, and other text formatting/typesetting systems; rn, trn, tin, and other news readers; Lynx, IRC, Telnet, FTP, the many standard UNIX \"building block\" utilities, bibliographic databases and online library catalogs, legal/medical databases, statistical packages, math/scientific packages, compilers, system and network administration tools, and so on, plus countless custom text-based data entry / inquiry, office, and other applications).

The Un-Windowed Kermit for Veterans In case you have used other Kermit software before, or you just plain hate graphical user interfaces, you might be interested to know that the K-95 \"communications engine\" is a command-driven Kermit program that can be used without menus and clicking, just like other Kermit programs. In Windows, run K95.EXE either from a Command prompt or from Start \u2192 Run dialog on the Taskbar.
