That won't change. Only your data throughput speed may change if you exceed 3GB in one billing cycle on a 3G or 4G smartphone or 5GB or more on a 4G LTE smartphone. Speeds will only be reduced when using data services at times and in areas that are experiencing network congestion Each time you exceed 3GB (3G/4G) or 5GB (4G LTE) in a billing cycle, your data speeds may be reduced for the rest of that billing cycle and then go back to normal You'll receive a text message during each billing cycle when your usage reaches 75% of 3GB (3G/4G) or 5GB (4G LTE) so you have enough time to adjust your usage to avoid network management practices that may result in slower data speeds If you have a smartphone that works on our 3G/4G or 4G LTE network and still have an unlimited data plan: What you need to know...",
