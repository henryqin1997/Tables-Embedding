And who would want to share a body with someone else?!?! I guess I'm just upset wiht the ending, the series over all was okay though. ________________ I dare you to click this >=)",

Have to say that I liked the ending myself. Agreed, Nana didn't come back, it was just the \"Nana\" part of Yaya's personality that fought."
