ToString Saves the changes made to the DataControlField view state since the time the page was posted back to the server. SaveViewState Raises the FieldChanged event.

    "textAfterTable": "Top Remarks The DataControlField class serves as the base class for all data control field types. Data control fields are used by data-bound controls to represent a field of data, similar to how a DataGridColumn object represents a type of column in the DataGrid control. Use the classes that are derived from DataControlField to control how a field of data is displayed in a data-bound control such as DetailsView or GridView. The following table lists the different data control field types provided by ASP.NET. Column field type Description BoundField Displays the value of a field in a data source as text. ButtonField Displays a command button in a data-bound control. Depending on the control, this allows you to display either a row or a column with a custom button control, such as an Add or a Remove button. CheckBoxField Displays a check box in a data-bound control. This data control field type is commonly used to display fields with a Boolean value. CommandField Displays built-in command buttons to perform edit, insert, or delete operations in a data-bound control. HyperLinkField Displays the value of a field in a data source as a hyperlink.
