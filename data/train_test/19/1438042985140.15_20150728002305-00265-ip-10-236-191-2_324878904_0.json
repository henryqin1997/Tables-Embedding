    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32641=Business Response: On\u00a0June 15th, 2013 ***** *** ******* ****** purchased a 2002 Jaguar from Stan Egan's Auto World and as I understand are enjoying it with no complaints. It was purchased without a warranty. On June 29th, 2013 ***** and ******* ****** purchased a 2003 Saab from Stan Egan's Auto World and\u00a0although it had low miles on it (approximately 79k) it developed some mechanical issues. It was purchased without a warranty also. On October 12th,2013 ***** and ******* ****** purchased a 2007 Chrysler PT Cruiser from Stan Egan's Auto World again without a warranty. \u00a0Since the mechanic was trying to help the customer get used parts for their Saab to reduce their costs he has taken a little extra time in repairing it; plus, the customer has gone back and forth about whether they wanted to keep their Saab. After I talked with ***** ****** the other day I asked him if he wanted me to help them by paying to have it fixed and then selling the car for them or them keeping it. I agreed to him that I would get the car fixed at my cost and returning it to them. \u00a0Hopefully, this should resolve the problem however, I will get a release signed by the ******s accepting this as satisfactory to them and not \u00a0holding \u00a0Stan Egan's Auto World liable for any future repairs or problems that may occur.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**** ****., 27706=Complaint: I purchased my car in June of this year. Mr.Egan helped get us financed through Credit Acceptance. In November, I was due to have surgery and needed another car. My husband and I made the decision to borrow against his 401k to pay off the existing loan, buy another car and pay for my surgery. We gave Mr.Egan the payoff amount because he said that he could expedite it and we wouldn't have to make any more steps. In the 6 months that he has had the money, Credit Acceptance has called me multiple times threatening to repossess the car. I would call Mr. Egan, and he would make a payment to them. He has yet to pay off the car. He has made numerous promises of when it will be paid for and he has yet to live up to any of them. My credit score is getting worse and at this point, I just need my money back for the car and my name off of the loan. He isn't paying the car off and I don't believe that he intends to either., 30380=Complaint: We purchased a Saab 9-3 from Stan Egan in June of this year. We made the mistake of going by his reputation for being fair and a fair Christian man. He had sold me a Jaguar previously and it ran great so we had no reason to think that the Saab we purchased was bad. He even told us that it came from a mechanic that only worked on Saabs. On August 29 of this year within 2 months, we were stranded. I had noticed that it was acting a little funny by the a/c going off and the car acting sluggish. it also had a loud hum after it reached over 70mph. When we talked to Stan, he had no idea. Then, when we were stranded, he told us to take it to the same place that he purchased the car. There we found out that crankshaft was destroyed. We went back to **** after hearing that there was no way that the car's crankshaft could have gone out in the time period.\u00a0**** acted angry and said that he was going to make this right. He said that he was going to get to the bottom of it. he gave us a loaner car and for 2 months after we kept calling, he kept stalling. My husband got money out of his 401k to save money and pay it off. When we asked**** about the car, he said that he would have an answer the next morning. I called again and he stalled again by saying that it may have more wrong with it. Then he asked what we were planning on doing with the car. I told him that we could not afford to have it fixed and he said that he would pay to have the car fixed and then resale it for us so that we could purchase another car from him. The mechanic said that **** had only called twice and came down once and that was the week before we came in to pay it off. **** insists that if he pays to fix it, then he will resale the car and give us the money after he gets his money back for the repairs. I think that this is unfair. We trusted him and he won't keep his word about making this right., 29699=Consumer Response: CONFERENCE CALL SCHEDULED FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 10 @ 10:00 AM}",
