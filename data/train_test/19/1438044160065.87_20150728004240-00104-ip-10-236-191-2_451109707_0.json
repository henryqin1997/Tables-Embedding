    "textBeforeTable": "Should we not invest, then, until we have a tidy target price? Well, that usually doesn't work so well. I gathered a few old research reports from around about a year ago, curious as to how close some Wall Street analysts came with their price targets: For example, when I recommended Fairmont Hotels & Resorts to Hidden Gems members, I'd assessed its competitive position against other hotel giants. I also had a good idea of where the company's real estate should be valued, and that number was far greater than its market capitalization. I thought that at $33.50, the stock was undervalued. But did this mean it would be worth $40, $50, or $60 soon? I didn't know. The answer depended on how Fairmont's executives managed the process of extracting value from the company's assets, among loads of other variables. Beware false precision Little did I know how this quotidian experience would reflect our investment philosophy and approach to valuation in our Motley Fool Hidden Gems small-cap service. Valuing businesses is an exercise in false precision for the same reason that you can't determine exactly how long it'll take to get across town. You will never have information accurate and complete enough to let you precisely divine the future. In our work, we simply want to put the probabilities of success in our favor. I then proceeded to miss not a single green light and arrived in less than 10 minutes. We got our widgets and whozits, and",
    "textAfterTable": "Let me say straight up that I'm not out to make any of the analysts look bad. It's just that they have an impossible task in trying to consistently nail a price target like that, and frankly, I don't think they should be trying. Sometimes they'll be close; sometimes they won't. A better way Instead, in Fairmont's case, I came up with a range of fair prices between $38 and $76, based on assumptions tapped into the valuation tools at my disposal. Of course, that's a huge disparity -- a difference between Fairmont having a market cap of $2.6 billion and $5.5 billion. But it did tell me that Fairmont would not have been attractive if its shares were priced at, say, $51. With my fair value of $38 to $76 per share, that would open up the possibility of anywhere from a 25% loss to a 40% gain. I don't like those situations. If you're 15 minutes away from a critical meeting and the drive could take from eight to 30 minutes, you'll be driving with anxiety. I don't like to drive, or invest, anxiously. Fortunately, Fairmont's stock was trading at $33.50, below my fair-price window of $38 to $76 per share. I recommended it, and we enjoyed a 34% gain before the company was acquired by Kingdom Hotels and Colony Capital. Stacking the odds This is how Tom Gardner and I approach our recommendations in Hidden Gems. We create a range of potential fair values and",
