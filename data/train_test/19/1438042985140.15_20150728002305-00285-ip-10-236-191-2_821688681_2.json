Note that the entity names for these characters aren't recognized in Navigator 4, so you are recommended to stick to the numeric entities instead. Linking into the middle of Web pages Imagine you have written a long Web page with a table of contents near the start. How do you make the entries in the table contents into hypertext links to the corresponding sections? Let's assume that each section starts with a heading, for instance:  <h2>Local Night Spots</h2> You make the heading into a potential target for a hypertext link by enclosing its contents with <a\u00a0name=identifier> .... </a>  <h2><a name=\"night-spots\">Local Night Spots</a></h2> The name attribute specifies the name you will use to identify the link target, in this case: \"night-spots\". The table of contents can now include a hypertext link using this name, for instance:  <ul> ... <li><a href=\"#night-spots\">Local Night Spots</a></li> ... </ul> The # character is needed before the target name. If the target is in a different document, then you need to place the web address of that document before the # character. For example if the document is in \"http://www.bath.co.uk/\", then the link becomes:  <a href=\"http://www.bath.co.uk/#night-spots\">Local Night Spots</a> In the future, you will eventually be able to define link targets without the need for",
