            "If you want to get some GEN ED's out of the way without having to waste all that money. If you are undecided about what major or career you want to take or if you don't have enough means to afford a 4 year university at this point i do recommend looking into Wright. I honestly thought I was going to hate it there because it wasn't in my original plan to go there. But you just have to accept things that come your way and have an open mind. You have to be willing to give things a chance and work hard to reach your goals. You are making a wise decision by attending a community college that will cut the cost of college by more than half! Saves you money and you get credits taken care of for when you actually do transfer to a 4 year university.",
            "Wright is really undermined and underrated. It has a great faculty and professors that are willing to get you to where you want to be. The environment is nice and everyone is very friendly and not only that but it is so affordable!"
