            "Campus feels moderately safe, and it helps to have campus police so close. Pleasant Hill PD and the campus police are observant, as well as teachers and admin are usually walking around the campus, so it helps to keep down crime and issues.",
            "Non-existent, as this is a community college, with the exception of the Honor society, who has taken greek letters to represent themselves.",
            "Very active on clubs at this campus. Many clubs for many walks of life, so join one and have some fun!",
            "Students who can push through the poor teachers to find the good ones. Do not lose focus as I did or you may find yourself coming back later to do courses that you could have finished long before!",
            "Unknown.",
            "Costs rise and fall so make sure you talk to your teachers to see which books you must buy the most current edition, and which ones you can go onto Amazon to get an older edition and save some money. If you plan on possibly dropping any classes, ensure you do it before the refund date so that you get that money back.",
            "Located near a mall and a few supermarkets, this place is pretty close to most things. Movie theaters are down the way as well as clubs just in the next city over (Walnut Creek).",
            "Food is alright, and pretty typical of what you find at a 7-11. The Nord Cafe here though, which is run by the Culinary program, is outstanding and worth checking out a few different times to enjoy a slice of excellent quality food at a fairly reasonable price.",
            "Some teachers are very strict and give loads of homework, while others give you four books to read for a semester that you won't crack open until an essay is assigned. The teachers are all over the map, so truly rating rigor is a harder task than it seems. Make sure you talk to friends and family who have taken classes here as well as checking on review sites to see what people had to say about your upcoming teachers.",
            "Make sure you know exactly what you want to do and meet with your academic counselor to ensure you are taking the right classes. With the rising costs of books and tuition, along with the teachers, your counselors are your last line of defense against the multitude of classes that you may or may not need to complete. Work hard and it could definitely pay off here.",
            "This school is very hit or miss, with some teachers being the cream of the crop, and some being the left overs who barely passed Junior High. The financial aid department definitely takes its time, and even with the large amount of students attending this school, it sure seems as if they like to push things back farther than necessary. Get your general eds done here and run to another college as this college has an excellent transfer record."
