While the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in it is not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention. It will be understood that each of the features described above, or two or more together, may find a useful application in other types of wireless local area network and data communications system differing from the types described above. In response to the Sleep command, the radio section 30 stops whatever operations it may have been carrying out, in the minimum amount of time, and then goes to a low power suspend mode. When the radio section 30 receives a Resume message, it then reverts back to normal PSP mode. In response to the Awake for Host command, the radio section 30 sets the ready flag. This allows the terminal section 40 to communicate directly with the radio section 30, to receive messages, to",
