Reviewer has been to campus. 9 out of 9 people found this review useful. 2 of 42 Categories Comments Bang for the buck if you are an Alabama native and plan to go into business this is the best deal you can get. Will enjoy being here the people at and around the college are great. i have lived in this area most of my life so i can tell you that Montgomery is not the most exciting city so you might find your self bored from time to time. Will learn a lot this college has one of the best business programs world wide, and coupled with the fact that most classes have 30 or less students in them the education is second to none. Login",
