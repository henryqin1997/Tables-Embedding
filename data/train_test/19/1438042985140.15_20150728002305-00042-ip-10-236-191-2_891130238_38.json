            "The police are scared to patrol at night and do not inform you of any incidences and the emergency boxes are horrible placed. Someone is robbed daily here.",
            "Greek life is really big here.",
            "Lots of clubs and activities.",
            "Great if you participate in Greek life.",
            "Valdosta state has no pride and no traditions. The only traditions is through greek life.",
            "For all the money that school costs especially Valdosta it is not worth it.",
            "The only things to do for fun are go to the front lawn and play pick up games of football and soccer and stuff.",
            "Food was actually pretty good but the hours are horrible and the staff is usually pretty rude.",
            "For me Dorm life was horrible, however I lived in the worst dorm on campus and had to deal with disgusting bathrooms shared by the whole floor. Dorm life was also very loud and obnoxious and I felt rather unsafe as well.",
            "The academic rigor was fairly easy.",
            "Definitely try to live of campus if possible and make sure you have lots of food since the dining services are really bad. Be prepared to deal with people you don't like.",
            "Valdosta State is a pretty good school when it comes to education and the teaching staff. Valdosta definitely needs to improve housing and dining services since they are really lacking. Overall I would not tell someone to avoid Valdosta but would not tell them it's the greatest choice either."

I have had the pleasure of visiting the campus and it is very pretty. The dorms are nice and they have a lot for you to do on campus. The campus itself is easy to get around and is convenient for those like me, who don't have a car. So far, the faculty that I came in contact with are very friendly and helpful. I am satisfied with VSU so far and I look forward to attending., 226831=Relay for Life, March of Dimes, Car washes, Community service and soooo much more., 231751=YOU GO TO SCHOOL 5:30 TO 10:15 AND YOU GET YOUR CLASSES DONE IN 8 WEEKS. ITS A GREAT WAY TO GET AHEAD!!, 563444=I love the campus! Really small city though, not much to do. Weather is okay, it can get real hot in august/september.. I mean REAL hot., 336934=A big tradition here at Valdosta State is Breast Cancer Awareness, as well as No-Shave November. Join in on the many activities and become a part of a wonderful community., 437968=Wild Adventures is a theme park that is located about 15 minutes from campus. We even get to go one day during Homecoming week in October., 93016=We call November No shave November you can infer from that what you can, 257019=I don' t know much about the dining halls, but the food in the student union is great! Currently there is Nathan's and Starbucks to choose from, but we're suppose to be getting a Chick Fil A come August of 2012., 551269=There are a variety of food options. The dining halls, however, seem very repetitive. It always the same things in different forms everyday. Also, not too many healthy options except for the salad bar and fruits. Though, in January 2014, there will be renovations done in the hall to include more healthy eating options that seems promising.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Valdosta State's staff is about as friendly a group of people as you will find anywhere else. I am in my second year here, and I feel more confident about reaching my goals every day. Being an Honors student, I worried about the potential workload. Every single one of my classes has been thought-provoking, challenging (at times), and most definately rewarding.

Tips for prospective students Do not stay in your dorm all the time, of course you are supposed to come to college to get an education but it is supposed to be memorable! Get out there and have fun! Be sure to know how to balance",
