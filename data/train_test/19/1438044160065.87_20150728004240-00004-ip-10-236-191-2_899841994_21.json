            "Campus security is always actively traveling through the campus. Even if campus security isn't around you do have the safety poles which have a button you can press that will alert campus security to your location.",
            "There are plenty of clubs and activities that any student can be part of with a little determination. From the Glee club to the TAMIU Band there are many options for everybody. Even if you can't find the club that is right for you, all you need is a few friends willing to be part of your organization, a few more steps after that and you will have your own club on campus.",
            "From campus events like soccer and basketball games to just hanging out with your friends there is always something you can do. Spending time at Starbucks, studying in the library or just appreciating the splendor of the campus you will always find yourself somewhere.",
            "When it comes to the food and dining at TAMIU you will always have options. You can either choose from the actual cafeteria where the food is made or you can choose from the restaurants there such as Subway or Comfort Foods. If you don't want to eat something exactly healthy you have options and if you want to eat healthier you do have those options as well.",
            "I don't live on campus but every new student that has orientation at TAMIU has to stay on campus and the dorms are pretty good. They are not like those expected dorms where both your dorm mate and you sleep in the same room. You have your own individual room and the only accommodations that you share are the bathroom (toilet & shower).",
            "When it comes to your major you'll always find your classes interesting and pretty easy. Even if you don't find some of your classes easy the professors are very open and welcoming encouraging you to ask them questions about the class either before, during or after class.",
            "If you ever need any help, whether it be with your class assignments or you're just having general problems, you always have somebody there whether it be the faculty, staff or the friends that you make in classes.",
            "The campus has a very ecstatic vibe that rubs off onto everyone. People might always seem busy, but if you need help at all anyone is practically willing to aid you in whatever you need. The campus has many helpful tools that are there when and if you ever need them so you never feel alone in whatever endeavors you're seeking to pursue."

    "textAfterTable": "Campus Safety The one thing this university has is safety. Campus police is top of every rule. Keep an eye out for them they can be your best friend or foe. Greek Life Don't think this like the movies, the university is new to the Greek life so it is in its growing stage but they do have a lot of thing for its members. Clubs and Activities There are a few clubs for students they are a lot of fun some hold concerts while others have midnight paintball, scavenger hunts and other activities for its members. Great for these types of students Great for students who want to a great education at a low price. A laid back student who doesn't mind having some fun from time to time. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus You will have to learn about from experience. Bang for the buck You will definitely get your moneys worth here. Does not even come close to other universities when it comes to cost. What to do for fun It is",
