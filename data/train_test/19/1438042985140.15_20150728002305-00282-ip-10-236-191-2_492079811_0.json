Economic conditions in the dairy industry have changed since 2010. Feed costs, heifer values and milk prices have all shifted, and updates to NM$ are needed to help us make more economical selection decisions., 12874=An expanded structure NM$ only included five traits when it came on the scene in 1994. Those were milk, protein and fat yield, productive life, and somatic cell score. We now have nine categories included in the index and can anticipate more. At some point, adding traits will result in an index that is unwieldy and it will become more difficult to conceptualize what the index is intended to accomplish. That consideration is leading to some discussion about whether a new structure for NM$ is warranted., 13219=There is one more reason that makes the timing good . . . the genetic base is also scheduled to be updated in 2015. While a base change is not justification for NM$ revisions, it does make sense to implement changes at that time because we will be expecting and more mentally prepared for shifts in sire and cow evaluations., 14098=The Lifetime Net Merit index (NM$) was introduced in 1994 with revisions made in 2000, 2003, 2006 and 2010. I think we can anticipate another revision to NM$ in the near future and there is some discussion of the formula taking a slightly different shape compared to previous versions.}",
