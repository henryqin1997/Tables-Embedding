The advantage of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 of a magnetic valve according to the invention is that only two permanent magnets 29 are used, with the same mode of operation as that attained in an embodiment having four permanent magnets 21 as shown in FIG. 2. The flat permanent magnets 29 are magnetically induced and installed in such a manner that that the flat sides forming facing poles each have the same polarity. The outward-facing flat sides of the permanent magnets 29 likewise have the same polarity. The connection between the cores 4 and the first outer pole pieces 30, 34 cooperating with them, or the first center pole piece 31, is brought about in the same manner as in the first exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 1, that is, in a U-shaped first conductor body 16. The permanent magnets 29 are inserted into the first pole body 7 in such a way that their flat sides extend parallel to the particular two first conductor bodies 16 that contain the first central pole piece 31. A particularly advantageously designed embodiment of the magnetic valve acording to the invention, having four magnetic coils 3, is shown in FIG.",
