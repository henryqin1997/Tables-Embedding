Yes, I am talking about Anderson and Steven Gerrard. Though Fergie's new-found rotation policy means it's impossible to guess who will start in midfield I very much hope Anderson will be on the pitch from the first whistle so that he gets the chance to get the better of Gerrard once again. 'The atmosphere amongst the two teams and the determination both sides had to win the game at Anfield was unbelievable,' Anderson told United Review. 'It`s difficult to describe the emotion that I experienced in that match - it was amazing. And I`m sure it`ll be the same on Sunday.' Most fans would probably agree with me saying he should start along Hargreaves, a combination that worked so well almost every time we tried it. But regardless of Fergie's decision that he will make about Anderson, Old Trafford will surely wheel out the song made for the Brazilian. 'I find it difficult to describe how it feels to hear the fans sing my name - it`s amazing.' 'It gives me extra strength on the pitch and makes me want to do my best to repay them for the fantastic support they have shown me. I hope I can do that on Sunday.' We hope, too - it would be difficult to describe how great it would to win thanks to a goal from Anderson., 11265=Two Huge United Bids Made for Bale?
