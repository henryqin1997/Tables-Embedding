Well I didn't need to worry about that on campus as the campus is really lit up at night and walking to my vehicle I always saw at least 1 or 2 security people checking out campus, so that was always a great feeling knowing that someone was out there keeping it safe., 356061=MNSU is a great school. I've been to the campus & its great.The students are relaxed & so nice. The faculty are willing to help with anything you need. Can't wait to start school Spring 2014.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students The one thing you need to focus on is time management because there are tons of things to do and a lot of free time to do your class work. School comes first. So take care of it first, finish your class work then go out after. Do not think that you will never have the opportunity to do something again, because chances are you will. So never feel rushed, take your time and take care of what you have to do. There are so many resources available, which means you have to go out there and look for them. Once you have found them, use them wisely, they help you much more than you think. Bang for the buck The great thing about coming to Mankato is that many students get a lot of financial aid. So turn in your FAFSA in early so you get all the money possible. Even though all together it is around 16,000 or so, you pay so much less, it even can even compare to going to a community college near home, depending how well you did in high school and how many scholarships you have. This is really good because you get a good experience moving away from home to grow up for not that much money. Am enjoying being here",
