            "Campus safety is awesome! there is even a course for self defense offered on campus that will give you units for the semester which is awesome! Also if you stayed late on campus or a certain building police services will escort you to where ever you need to go.",
            "Lots of oncampus activities this year AfroJack performed on campus there are also multiple clubs. Associated Student Government is great.",
            "CSUN has few clubs as compared to schools such as UCLA but I have heard greats things form them.",
            "If you are a social person who likes to meet new people CSUN is the campus for you there are multiple events where being friendly and meeting new people comes up.",
            "The matador statue: When finals and midterms come around and people do well some people will place a rose on the matador statue",
            "College life is quite expensive but CSUN has a pretty good financial aid program that will make your expenses pretty affordable.",
            "I don't live on campus but from those people who live on campus I have heard that there is plenty of locations off campus that are good!",
            "CSUN has quite a few of dining/food options I would say that the cafeteria in sierra hall is the best.",
            "I don't live on campus but I have heard from multiple peers who live on campus that it is great although the dorms are quite small the experience of getting to know people on your floor is amazing.",
            "in my little time attending CSUN I would say csun has great professors most willing to help you if you approach them after class or talk to them during their office hours.",
            "A few tips I would give to prospective students are the following Although CSUN's class sizes are relatively small do not think professors will automatically know your name or baby you like they did in high school. College is much different the professors don't really care if you do/do not show up to class or if you do your homework this is all about adult life and you need to learn to stay on top of your stuff.Same goes with homework in college there is little homework which sounds awesome but in reality thats not a good thing the less homework you have the more impact that is made by your test scores and final so make sure you know and understand everything that is being discussed in class.",
            "CSUN has an absolutely beautiful campus at first it may seem a bit intimidating but once you get used to it you'll grow to love it. Also there are multiple resources available to you on campus that will help you be successful in your academic career. Advisements for freshman are extremely beneficial."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{136352=I highly recommend the dorms to the newly incoming freshmen so they can start many new people and have a great sense of community within the dorm life. Also there is events sponsors by the RA (Residental Advisor) with free movie screenings, ice cream parties, and even peer advisement. For exercise, their are volleyball nets, a small field for soccer, and basketball courts. The only downside is that the Matador Patrol closes the gates at 7:30 pm so if you need to enter to the dorms, you have to sign and verify with matador patrol before you enter., 1103142=As an Alumni, class of 2012, i really took advantage of all the opportunities that were offered to me in the School of Sociology. The professors are great and really allow you to learn skills that are practiced in the classroom so that you can immediately start using in the workforce. Professor Morgaine, Hatkoff, and Debose were my mentors, teachers, life coaches, and friends., 56915=I love CSUN,but if I were living on campus I would have a lot more fun.The sports are fun and it is easy to get involved with activities.The campus is beautiful and they are building a new Art center which is suppose to open in 2011.I also love the library because I always can find what I am looking for in there if I can't find it at my local library., 675507=I don't dorm, but I do live across the dorms, there is a curfew for getting inside without having to be checked in, they close the gates at 7:30. Also they are fairly overpriced, but I do still wish I dormed to meet new people., 235458=there are many fun events held at c.su.n. such as concerts by well known artists like b.o.b. and the cataracs, who performed in the fall semester, 2011. they recently built the student recreational center where students can become fit and active. best part it is free for students! during the hot weathers c.s.u.n. has a big pool where students can cool off., 75282=Great school. May not have the prestige of other schools like the UCs but it is one of the best CSUs in the state and has a great business program., 874348=I had no fun time. I tranferred in 2006 Fall semester from Mission College and I Graduated from CSUN in Spring 2008. My goal was to complete my BA as soon as possible because I was having a baby in Sep 2008. I had no time to see or do fun things at school... but study,go to class and take exams., 740882=I've been a student majoring in Civil Engineering here at Cal State Northridge since the Fall of 2007. I have seen the campus grow with student life and expand. CSUN has just finished building a new student recreation center, parking structures, updated technology in classrooms, and improved student life on campus. Overall I have enjoyed my years here and despite the large majority of peers commuting to and from, the student body can connect on campus. Go Matadors!, 714536=CSUN has an entire escort system that guards the library and personally approaches students to walk them either to their car or back to the dorms. Security guards have two shacks on the outskirts of Student Housing and patrol from 7:30 pm- 3:00 am. The guards are pretty cool, they actually like chatting with students and asking what's going on with them. They also patrol inside of Student Housing too., 597215=They are not acceptng new applicants until 2013., 739714=CSUN has updated their dormitory life since 2007 and provided better meals for on campus dining., 122576=This year 2012 the hired various security! Its really good., 987137=It`s no wonder than CSUN is ranked 68th in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities (West) by US News. This school offers incredibly small class sizes which are ideal for getting the best of lecture time. CSUN`s vast variety of degree programs ensures than just about anyone can attend CSUN and study what he or she wishes.}",
