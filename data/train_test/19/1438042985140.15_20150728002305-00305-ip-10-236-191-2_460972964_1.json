It is maybe one of the most critical system components as nearly everything on a Funtoo system depends on this component (including the Python interpreter which executes the vairous Python scripts at the heart of the Funtoo core utilities and package management system).",

To fix portage manually the following steps required:  Fixing broken portage At this point, you can set up bind mounts (see /mnt/rescue example earlier in this document for those steps), chroot inside /mnt/broken, and perform a few tests to determine if your issue has been resolved.  You will see a note about the trailing garbage at the end of the file being ignored. This is normal -- tar is ignoring the Portage .tbz2 metadata that is tacked on to the end of the file.  # tar xjpvf gcc-4.4.5.tbz2 -C /mnt/broken  Then, use the following commands to extract the .tbz2 archive to your broken filesystem that you mounted at /mnt/broken:  # mount /dev/sdaY /mnt/broken/usr # mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/broken #",
