            "Van Winkle Gates: Only go through them when you enter Brown (as a first-year) and when you leave Brown (as a graduate). There are superstitions about passing through more than twice in your life, and that's why they're locked year round. Same with the Pembroke Campus Seal on the steps outside Alumni Hall.",
            "Culture around campus is great. Get involved!",
            "Join a club/organization Watch a show (there are plenty of talented people here) Walk around campus (beautiful) Go Downtown (it's nearby)",
            "Your money goes a long way in dining halls and campus eateries.",
            "Hard for a student to find privacy and quiet in a dorm; other students have disrespectfully damaged property and yet these problems have not been aptly handled by Residential Life (ie the problems continue, rules don't change and keep getting broken, university is slow to respond). Decent environment if you enjoy partying and socializing in dorms. Difficult environment if you intend to study (or sleep) in dorms.",
            "Though Brown takes certain steps to ensure students are not intimidated by difficult classes (no GPA calculation, no failures on transcripts, etc), classes certainly are not to be toyed with. Teachers are involved and have high expectations of students, yet are not above meeting students where they are. Resources are available in plenty, but only available to those who take advantage. It's a very grown up experience, making students accountable for the high level of education they are receiving. With the rigor, Brown earns its merit among Harvard, Yale and Princeton of the Ivies.",
            "It's a fun/relaxed Ivy League, not an easy one.",
            "Engaged and reliable professors. Exuberant student body (to say the least). Quality education."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Brown University really emphasizes the learning experience for undergraduate students. With no core curriculum, students have the opportunity to explore courses in fields they would not have the opportunity to at other colleges. As a result, a student can obtain as specific or as broad an education as he or she chooses. Additionally, with the option to take courses for a grade, or pass/fail, Brown takes off the competitive pressure and simply encourages its students to try different things and put themselves out of their comfort zone without running the risk of damaging one's transcript and resume for graduate school education. But learning at Brown goes well beyond the classroom - almost all of which are taught directly by professors as opposed to teaching assistants, and which vary in size to accommodate all modes of learning. The extracurricular opportunities at Brown are incredible. There are a lot of service programs through the Swearer Center or other organizations, as well as many opportunities to learn about new subjects - whether that be through attending a guest lecture or debate, or just walking through the main green to see the displays.
