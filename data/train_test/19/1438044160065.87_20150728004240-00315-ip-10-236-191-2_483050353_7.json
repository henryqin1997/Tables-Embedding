    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The industrial applicability of the chip and wafer configuration and testing method for LSI circuits described above are believed to be obvious. LSI Chips, designed incorporating the configuration and testing method suggested by the invention, will be testable on-wafer and later on also on-module, which it may be expected will greatly simplify and facilitate the testing and debugging of chips, modules and systems and will thus greatly help to reduce their manufacturing costs. It is believed that the testing scheme will, at the price of some moderate wafer real-estate expenditure, allow great savings to be made in the costs of test equipment and testing time. Through the proposed extensions in chip-image design which will make on-module chip testing also practicable, the existing concept of LSSD testing has been greatly improved upon, in that the dependence of the testability of all parts of a system upon the proper functioning of all the latches in the system can be drastically reduced and that a faster and finer location of hardware malfunctions will be feasible. A general summary of the various arrangements and approaches for the testing scheme is",
