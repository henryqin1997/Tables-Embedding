Danny as for yourself keep plugging away - artistic integrity is the most important thing. And as for ECHOMAN hailing from Sweden, I love the band AMAZE ME and their brilliant album WONDERLAND from your contryman on the z records label. If they released any of the songs on this album under the BON JOVI name it would be huge.

It's obscene that Bon Jovi can just crank up the publicity machine and sell millions after having a 4 year sabbatical whilst bands like Danny Danzi's with equal (or better) quality sell say 10000.
