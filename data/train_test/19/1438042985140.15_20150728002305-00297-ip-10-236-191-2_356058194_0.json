This makes seemingly-encouraging improvements easier to come by and apparently more substantial than they really are., 4777=During the first quarter of 2015, U.S. consumers paid down $34.7 billion in amounts owed to credit card companies. And though first quarter debt paydowns are the norm \u2013 as consumers are fueled by annual salary bonuses, tax refunds and New Year\u2019s Resolutions \u2013 this year\u2019s debt reduction was 7% larger than those of the past two years.

Figures included in each Main Findings section reflect the information that was available at the time of that quarterly study being conducted, while the Data & Graphs section reflects the most recent data available. Data & Graphs If the average household transferred their credit card balances to the Chase Slate Card \u2013 the best 0% transfer offer on the market \u2013 they would save $1,257 in finances if they could make the $355 monthly payment required to get out of debt in 24 months. If paying $256 per month over the course of three years is more realistic, the Citi Diamond Preferred Card \u2013 with its 21-month 0% intro rate and 3% transfer fee \u2013 would save the average household $1,696 in finance charges. Despite our first quarter improvements, U.S. credit card habits show signs of regression to pre-recession levels. The second quarter of 2015 will therefore offer a lot of context to our current trajectory, enabling us to better authenticate trends that appear to be emerging. Credit card defaults also declined by more than $350 million in Q1 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, bringing the first quarter",
