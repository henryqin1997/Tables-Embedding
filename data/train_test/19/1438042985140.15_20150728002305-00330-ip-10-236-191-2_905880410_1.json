Clubs and Activities at gmc milledgeville there are loads of different clubs and activities: gmc weekly (newspaper), history club, student government association, officers of christian fellowship, apo, art club, creative thinking club, pre-nursing club, humanist club, math club, rifle team, and many more. if you can think of it they have it, and if not then you can start it by stopping by the student activities center.
