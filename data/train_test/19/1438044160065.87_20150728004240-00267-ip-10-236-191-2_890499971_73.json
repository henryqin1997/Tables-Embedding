            "There are many emergency phones located around campus that can help police reach you in time of need. Crime alerts are sent out to every student so they are aware of issues happening on campus. There is also a night time door to door service that will pick you up and take you to your dorm after about 7 o clock. Though issues do occur, I have never felt nervous or unsafe about Miami's campus.",
            "I do not know much about Greek life and find Miami's Greek life to be too big on partying and not big enough on the service projects they tend to advertise.",
            "There are so many clubs and activities to get involved in. During my first three years at Miami I worked with the radio station, Practiced Tae Kwon Doh, Participated in a Guatemalan service organization, Did Habitat for Humanity Service projects, Residence Assistant for the Global Connections Hall, attended services with Campus Crusade for Christ organization, and was an editor for Inklings literary magazine. Just from that you can see there is so much that students could get involved in.",
            "Miami is great for active students who have an activist type of personality. Many of the important things that happen on our campus are concerning rights, equality, unity, and awareness. It is not essential but would be great for students who are concerned with issues of that nature.",
            "Don't step on the seal! There is a seal located in the Universities Hub. The seal holds the University motto and it is said that those who step on it will fail their next exam :) Be careful.",
            "Miami Univeristy's tuition is relatively reasonable and many aspects like their computer rental service, convenient bus transportation and awesome recreational amenities make it even more reasonable.",
            "Miami always has a great ton of programming going on. Look out for musical, theater and band performances that happen at hall auditorium. It is also a tradition of mine to go to Miami's Spring Concert. Last year they brought The Fray and the year before Lupe Fiasco. The university does a great job at bringing in currently relevent speakers from across the globe, which is always enjoyable. The neighboring community also has a lot of fun things that students can get involved in, like Painting Pottery on High Street, etc.",
            "Miami has a great food selection. There are many great markets and restaraunts on campus. The dinning halls have a great variety and I have many favorites. Food prices are fairly reasonable as well.",
            "Dorm life has its negative stigma, but as far as Miami's dorm life I would not have it any other way. Their Living Learning Community Program helps you to live near other students who have similar interests. I actually became a residents assistant so i can continue enjoying the on-campus residence life experience.",
            "Miami has a challenging academic curriculum. The challenge is not impossible due to their outstanding staff and faculty, who have made great influences on my life.",
            "Any new place is often difficult to adapt to. Do not get discouraged. The easiest way to find your niche is to join student clubs and organizations that interest you. There you will make some of the best friends you could as for.",
            "Miami University is a wonderful educational community heavily focused on undergraduate programming. It offers many opportunities and can accommodate many interests with its vast array of on-campus clubs and organizations. I would recommend it to anyone."

One reason being that every student is required to take Miami Plan courses, which contribute to Miami's liberal style of education. Not only have I learned more in college than I did high school, but the Miami Plan allows me to take a variety of different classes and learn things that I would not normally learn if I were to take classes that only pertained to my major/minor. For example, I took a southeast Asian art class fall semester 2010 and ended up learning about the different styles of art and along with the religions that go with them: Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. The second reason for my increased knowledge is quality of teaching that Miami provides. U.S. News rated Miami #2 in undergraduate teaching, meaning that the professors compare to those of some of the most prestigious schools in the country. In my experiences, the professors are a fantastic resource because they really focus on making sure that the students understand the information provided to them. Thus, I have been able to learn more in my classes and I feel vastly more educated than I did a year ago as a result of my professors being a great resource. What I love about Miami is how education can roll outside of the classroom. Miami offers undergraduate research, which is a very rare opportunity in undergraduate education. There are also seminars and guest speakers that visit Miami all the time. This past year, the Dalai Lama visited and spoke to students and other guests, which was extremely educational because I was able to learn things from a religious leader's perspective., 768648=On campus are various seals that you can NEVER step on or fail your exams, there is a sundial in the center of campus that you're supposed to rub before your exams to ensure you ace them, but the best (and maybe cutest) of all is the famous arch. On valentines day especially, it is said that if you kiss someone under the Upham Hall archway then you two will be happily in love forever. Needless to say, there is always a line there on February 14th. Then there is a somewhat shocking reality on campus, the sport of choice here is not football, basketball or the usual high school stars--it's hockey. Nationally ranked nearly every year, Miami Hockey is a very, very big deal. Every student waits in line for days before each home game to get tickets and cheer on the Redhawks., 445101=Being that it's an old school, Miami has many traditions. 1809, remember that. That's the year Miami was founded. Commit it to memory. DO NOT STEP ON THE SEAL. It doesn't matter if you fail your next exam or not. It's a matter of respect. So just don't. If you've found love at this school (and you might since our marriage rate is 33%) make sure to give your sweetheart a kiss under the Upham Arch at midnight and you'll be sure to tie the knot. Oh, and if your a male student living in Peabody Hall, watch out for Helen Peabody, or rather her ghost, she's not a fan of guys., 494559=If you want to know where you will be living prior to three weeks before move-in, I would suggest finding a roommate and not going random because they won't give out random roommates until the end of July., 819004=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 677076=Overall, the food is good, but by the end of second semester you never want to eat it again. Try the salads at Dividends in the Farmer School of Business-- they are my favorite! Also, Bell Tower and 1809 are good places to eat on campus with the meal plan! I try to avoid the all you can eat dining halls as much as possible., 504045=Our school was established in 1809, so there are many traditions on this campus. Take a tour, or look on the website to look at all the cool history we have.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot In my experience, the professors at Miami are passionate about their topics and really want the students to do well. Professors are readily available outside of class and eager to help the student learn. Students are heavily encouraged to be more than just students. Although the curriculum is challenging, it opened my mind to new ideas, concepts, and perspectives.

Active students can really branch out here if they're interested. Student government, study abroad, Greek life, and internships are only the beginning. Shy: Miami is a great place to grow and develop as a person. You can really start to come out of your shell without going hog wild. Don't let the party scene scare you off. There are a",
