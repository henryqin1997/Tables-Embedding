My review of Pros and Cons: Pros: Sexy and stylish looks Glossy finish Black looks good. Expandable upto 64GB. 8 MP Front Camera Cons: For this price you can go for the new Micromax A250 Turbo. Only 1GB RAM - All phones are coming with 1.5 to 2 GB ram and zen is still on 1GB. Camera quality cannot be trusted. 1.5 GHz Quad Core - expected more clock speed 2050 mAh Battery - Really disappointed. Battery of only 2050?!! Not sure about its after sales service so would opt for other competitive phones such as micromax a250 or put in another 3k and buy nexus 4.}",
