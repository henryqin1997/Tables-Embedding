If a flow has been active for a long time, it is usually desirable to age it out (starting a new flow for any subsequent packets in the flow). This age out process allows the monitoring application that is receiving the exports to remain up to date. By default this timeout is 1800 seconds (30 minutes), but it can be adjusted according to system requirements. A larger value ensures that long-lived flows are accounted for in a single flow record; a smaller value results in a shorter delay between starting a new long-lived flow and exporting some data for it., 13795=Specifies the update timeout, in seconds, for a permanent flow cache.

This behavior is similar to the active timeout, except that it does not result in the removal of the cache entry from the cache.
