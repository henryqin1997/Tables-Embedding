The deposition completely fills via hole 304 with tungsten. The deposition forms a thick tungsten layer over ILD 302. A slight dimple 309 may result in the top portion of tungsten layer 308 over via hole 304. Tungsten layer 308 is formed to a thickness of approximately 8500\u212b for an 8000\u212b diameter plug. Tungsten layer 308 can be formed by CVD using hydrogen (H2) reduction of tungsten hexafluoride (WF6) wherein the ratio of H2 to WF6 is approximately 7:1. The tungsten layer adheres well to underlying tungsten-silicide layer 306 and forms a good ohmic contact with conductive layer 300. An Applied Materials Precision 5000 deposition system can be used for depositing tungsten layer 308., 22221=As an alternative to titanium nitride adhesion layers, tungsten silicide (WSix) adhesion layers have been proposed. Unfortunately, a tungsten via formed with a tungsten silicide adhesion layer suffers from \"etch out\" as shown in FIG. 2. (See \"Underlying Dependence Of Thin Film Stresses In Blanket CVD Tungsten\", Tungsten and Other Refractory Metals for VLSI Applications III; Published by Materials Research Society: 1988, pgs. 407-414.) That is, presently there is no plasma etch chemistry which can be used to etch back the tungsten layer which does not preferentially attack the tungsten silicide adhesion layer and cause etch out. If the adhesion layer is etched away, the tungsten metal can \"pop out\" and cause a failure. Another problem with the plasma etchback process shown in FIG. 2 is that the tungsten metals 204 can become recessed into the via hole during etchback. Such a recessed plug can adversely effect the planarization of subsequently formed interconnect layers. Thus, the use of a tungsten via in conjunction with a tungsten silicide adhesion layer is presently an unreliable process., 18576=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/040,657, filed Mar. 31, 1993 now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Thus, a novel process for forming a reliable, planar, tungsten plug or interconnect layer for an integrated circuit has been described. It is to be appreciated that the teachings of the present invention can be applied to fill-in grooves other than contacts or vias. For example, the teachings of the present invention can be applied to the formation of a tungsten interconnect layer. In this embodiment, an insulating layer is patterned to provide openings or grooves where interconnect lines are to be formed. A tungsten silicide layer is then formed over the insulating layer and into the grooves covering the sides and the bottom of the groove. A tungsten layer is then formed over the tungsten silicide layer and deposited until the grooves are substantially filled. The tungsten and tungsten silicide layer on the top surface of the insulating layer are then chemically-mechanically polished back as before. The result is a planar, reliable, tungsten interconnect layer. Next, as shown in FIG. 3e, an interconnect line 312 is formed on ILD 302 and on tungsten plug 310. Interconnect line 312 can be formed by blanket depositing a conductive layer of, for example, aluminum alloys, tungsten, copper, etc., over ILD 302 and tungsten plug 310. The conductive layer is then covered by a photoresist layer which is then masked, exposed, and developed with processes well known in the art, to define the location of interconnect 312. The",
