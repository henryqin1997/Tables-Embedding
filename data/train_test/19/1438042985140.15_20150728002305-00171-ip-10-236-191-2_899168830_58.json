            "The campus police service is active and open. Highly keen to the politics and habits of its students, it is always on the defensive.",
            "The fraternities and sororities on campus are many and active, though many of the students decline to become a part of them due to their bad reputation. On the other hand, some students seek them out because of that.",
            "There are multitudinous events to attend, so there is always bound to be one that suits your interests.",
            "The truth is that MSU best nurtures hard workers. The less motivated are able to succeed, but the quality that the establishment prevails with is best utilized and represented by students who take the initiative.",
            "The campus duck pond is a favorite location for many students, but the campus' many lawns are also well loved as good places to enjoy the open air and sunshine (while it lasts before winter of course).",
            "Bozeman as a city provides an abundance of opportunities for anyone and everyone to live the lifestyle they choose. The University does the same: you can get a phenomenal education if you choose to pursue it in the right ways.",
            "Get outside: go hiking, skiing, fly fishing, rafting, kayaking, swimming. Or stay inside: read poetry with the local literature groups, join a science club, or become a frequent attendee of the library's facilities.",
            "The food halls have friendly staff and a healthy variety, and frequently have themed nights and giveaways.",
            "Dorm life is average. Very few students opt to stay living on campus due to the abundance of affordable places to live off campus.",
            "Every student decides how seriously they want to take their work. At MSU, it is encouraged that you take every step that you can.",
            "Take advantage of the resources they give you, and even if you choose not to get involved in the college life don't lose touch with what he university itself stands for.",
            "MSU Bozeman is a diverse campus, full of the arts as much as it is the sciences. Engineers mingle with painters, architects with writers. The open mountain air leaves more than enough room for everyone."

Students run a 5k race in their underwear every November., 585210=If you love to ski/snowboard, and I mean REALLY love the snow, MSU is the place for you. In my first year here, there has been snow cover since november with temps in the -20s. Great, friendly people, and a great atmosphere for learning with lots of outlets for help in every class., 153188=Bring warm clothes! It's a lot colder starting in September than I would have imagined., 512599=If you like the outdoors, MSU is the place for you! Almost every one here rides a bike, skateboards, hikes, skis, snowboards, or all of the above! Also, MSU has a great engineering program, ranking very high in the US. There will also be a new business college in 2015 that focuses especially on those looking into entrepreneurship!, 543495=Get a good winter coat. Bozeman is sunny and beautiful all through september and most of october but after that the temperature drops rapidly, the snow flies, and the skiers come out of hibernation, 217645=There is an undies run in September where everyone goes running in their underwear even when it's snowing., 11810=If you are looking for great research or internship opportunities this is the place to be. Montana State is within the Nation's top tier for this! If you are a minority this would be a great place to go if interesting in the hard sciences, math, engineering, etc. But I would also like to add that with the past few years MSU lost about 9 million in funding. This is significant because programs across campus have been cut completely, some altered(budget cuts), some merged into other programs, and some may lose all funding in 2012., 20575=No doubt, I am learning a ton! The vacations are longer: Winter break is 17-Jan11 and summer starts May 5. Despite these relatively short semesters, the professors pile on the homework and I think that they truly care about theit students., 82463=They start placing people into the residence halls as soon as March so sign up early for housing in order to get the placement you want. Make sure to ask questions because everyone is willing to answer but they won't really double check to make sure everyone is doing fine. Talk to your professors.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot My classes here are amazing. Most professors are really flexible with office hours and love to have students stop by, which is so great. They are such good resources to take advantage of. They also push you to your limits and make you really think about what you know and what you're learning, which makes it that much better.
