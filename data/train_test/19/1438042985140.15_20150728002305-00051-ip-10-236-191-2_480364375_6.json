If they do measure total HX, they are heavy, expensive, and hard to maintain, calibrate and use. Typical collection methods, including pre-evacuated grab sample containers, condensation traps, adsorption tubes, and plastic grab bags, suffer from sample loss prior to analysis and are not suitable for real-time monitoring of HX gases Bailey, R. R. et al., Analytic Chemistry, 1976, 48, 1818!., 28737=Polyaniline may exist in different stable forms which vary with electrical potential and pH. Under ambient conditions (i.e., 1 atmosphere pressure, at room temperature), the polymer was found (Genies E. M. et al., Synthetic Metals, 1990, 36, 139) to be most stable in its emeraldine oxidation state. The emeraldine base (EB) form of polyaniline consists of equal numbers of the reduced repeat units --(C6 H4)--N(H)--(C6 H4)--N(H)--! and the deprotonated oxidized repeat units --(C6 H4)--N\u2550(C6 H4)\u2550N--!. The emeraldine base form of polyaniline has a blue color and its conductivity is less than 10-8 S/cm. The emeraldine base can be doped to the metallic conducting regime by aqueous protonic acid. The resulting emeraldine salt (ES) has a green color and its conductivity is greater than 1 S/cm. The doping percentage or doping level can be calculated based or the following equation:, 49084=Polyaniline film was electrochemically deposited on an Abtech IME 1550-M interdigitated electrode by cycling the potential of the electrode between -0.2 V and +0.8 V vs. SCE for 13 cycles in a 1M HCl solution containing 0.2M aniline. Pyrolytic graphite was used as a counter-electrode for the synthesis of polyaniline. The basic pattern of the interdigitated electrodes consisted of two platinum electrodes deposited on a borosilicate glass plate. Each electrode has 50 sets of interlaced lines. The line length, width, and spacing are 0.5 cm, 15 \u03bcm, and 15 \u03bcm, respectively. The polymer was allowed to grow across the fine interelectrode gap. The resulting polyaniline film was then de-doped in a 0.1M NH4 OH solution to produce emeraldine base and dried in an oven at 75\ufffd C., 37658=The essential ingredient in the electroactive matrix is polyaniline (FIG. 1), its derivatives, and its copolymers of these derivatives. In general, polyaniline for use in this invention is a homopolymer derived from polymerization of aniline. Substituted anilines can be conveniently used in the practice of this invention. Useful polyanilines can be prepared through use of chemical and electrochemical synthetic procedures. One form can be prepared by treating aniline with ammonium persulfate in excess aqueous 1M hydrochloric acid at 0\ufffd-5\ufffd C. This powdered form is blue-green in color. After washing with 1M HCl and air drying, this material, emeraldine hydrochloride, has a conductivity of 1-10 S/cm, depending on its moisture content. This conductive form of polyaniline and indeed all conductive forms, can be treated with 0.1M ammonium hydroxide in water to form a non-conductive form of polyaniline, emeraldine base. Numerous other chemical procedures for preparing various chemical forms of polyaniline have been reviewed in detail, (Genies et al., Synthetic Metals, 1990, 36, 139)., 17113=Polyaniline is an electroactive and electrically conducting polymer, one member of a class of organic polymers that can be used in chemical sensing. The use of conducting polymers such as polyaniline, polypyrrole and poly(3-hexylthiophene) as chemical sensors for vapors such as ammonia Hirata, M et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,292 and Selampinar, F. et al., Synthetic Metals 1995, 68, 109!, methanol Boyle, A. et al., Synthetic Metals 1989, 28, C769!, water, NO2, and hydrazine Ellis, D. L. et al., P. M. S. E. 1994, 71, 590! is known. There are comprehensive reviews on the use of electroactive polymers in chemical sensors Bidan, G., Sensors and Actuators B 1992, 6, 45 and Miasik, J. J. et al., \"Conducting Polymers\", Alcacer, L. ed. D. Reidel Publishing Co. Boston, 1987, pp189-1981!. Wrighton et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,717,673, teaches thiophene polymer-based devices which may be used as electrical energy storage devices or as sensors of changes in chemical concentration or pH. A species detector utilizing conductive polymers such as polyaniline is described in Zakin et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,645. A method of orienting polyaniline films in order to increase their electrical conductivity is taught by Theophilou et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,650., 44665=Polyaniline was synthesized according to the chemical method described by MacDiarmid, A. G. et al. (Conducting Polymers, Alcacer, L. ed. 1987, pp105-120). The resulting conductive polyaniline (emeraldine hydrochloride) was suspended in 0.1M NH4 OH to produce emeraldine base., 21017=Reversible ammonia gas sensors can be accomplished by dispersing a polyaniline in a matrix of a conductive high molecular weight polymer (U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,292). Conductive,high molecular weight polymers may contain ionic side chains or an electrolyte. The resistance of composite films made of conductive high molecular weight polymers increases after exposure to ammonia gas in the ppm range. Miasik et al. (\"Electronically Conducting Polymer Gas Sensors\", Conducting Polymers, Luis Alcacar, ed., 1987, D. Reidel Pub. Co., pp 189-198) demonstrated that the sensors can be fabricated using polypyrrole for the ambient temperature detection of several industrially important gases, such as ammonia and nitrogen dioxide., 48324=An HCl sensor consisting of two platinum foils as electrodes, a polyester film as spacer and poly(ethylaniline) as sensing material was fabricated according to the method described in Example 2. The length of platinum electrode exposed was 4 mm. For the poly(ethylaniline) film predoped in a pH=3.03 HCl solution, the resistance of the polymer film decreased from 3.81\ufffd1010 \u03a9 to 3.25\ufffd1010 \u03a9 when exposed to a HCl gas produced by evaporating 1 mL 3 mM of HCl-ether solution in a 4.4 L glass flask. The resistance change of poly(ethylaniline) film was lower than that of polyaniline or poly(o-toluidine) when exposed to the same concentration of HCl gas., 30484=The resistivity of a poly(aromatic amine) decreases upon exposure to acids in both the aqueous Salaneck, W. R. et al., Synthetic Metals 1987, 18, 291! and vapor phases. This invention utilizes this change in resistance of poly(aromatic amine) film to monitor the concentration of acid/base. The acid/base sensor system of this invention comprises arrays of basic sensor cells. The sensing material is a substituted or unsubstituted polyaniline. The basic sensor cells consist of poly(aromatic amine) coatings with doping level varying from 0 to 50% (i.e., dopant anion/aniline=1/2). A preferred acid sensor is one wherein the poly(aromatic amine) is emeraldine base which has been doped at pH 7.0-2.5, more preferably at pH 4.0-2.5. A sensor suitable for detecting HCl in ppb concentrations is one wherein the poly(aromatic amine) is emeraldine base which has been doped at pH 3.3-2.5. A preferred base sensor is one wherein the poly(aromatic amine) is emeraldine base which has been doped at pH 0-2.5, more preferably at pH 1.7-2.5. Poly(aromatic amine) films with different doping levels can be prepared by equilibrating the polymer films with solutions of various pH values or by using different solution mixtures of poly(aromatic amine) and dopant to prepare the polymer films., 39222=Useful forms of poly(aromatic amine) can also be prepared electrochemically. For example, polyaniline can be prepared by electrochemical oxidation of aniline in aqueous acids on a platinum foil electrode. Electrochemical procedures for preparing polyaniline have also been reviewed in Genies et al., Synthetic Metals, 1990, 36, 139. One advantage of the electrochemical method is that thin films can be deposited on one of the electrodes of the device and that their thickness can be controlled. Another advantage is increased speed of fabricating the device. The resulting polymers can be dissolved in an organic solvent and coated on the substrates consisting of at least two electrodes. The polyaniline can also be electrochemically deposited on and between the electrodes on insulating substrates., 35754=When the sensor array is exposed to a low concentration of acids (HCl, HF, HBr, etc.), the resistance change of the lightly doped poly(aromatic amines) is much higher than the heavily doped and emeraldine base forms of the polymers. On the other hand, the resistance of all sensor cells will decrease rapidly when exposed to a high concentration of acids. The acid concentration can be estimated by (1) the number of sensor cells whose conductivity reach a preset value, and/or (2) the resistance change of each sensor cell, and/or (3) the rate or resistance change of each sensor cell. For example, each sensor cell can be designed to be used as on/off switch of a light bulb. The switch will turn on when the resistance of the polymer film decreases to a certain value or change at a certain rate. The concentration of acid, therefore, can be measured based on the number of lights that are on. The electrodes for resistance measurements can be interdigitated electrodes (such as AAI Model 1550 series, Abtech, Yardley, Pa.) or any other types; for example, a rectangular poly(aromatic amine) film sandwiched between electrodes.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Polyaniline film can also be used for monitoring HF and HBr gases. The emeraldine base solution of Example 1 was deposited on an interdigitated electrode. The electrode was the same as the one used in Example 4. When the polyaniline was exposed to HF or HBr gases for about 1 minute, its resistivity decreased about 8-9 orders magnitude. EXAMPLE 8 The effects of HCl vapor on the optical properties of poly(o-toluidine) were investigated. The polymer film was deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass by in-situ polymerization in a chemical reaction chamber. The polymer film was exposed to HCl vapor which was generated by bubbling nitrogen gas through 0.66M HCl aqueous solution at a flow rate of about 2.2 L/min. FIG. 8 represents the absorbance-time profiles of the polymer film. This indicates that poly(aromatic amines) can be incorporated into optical fiber technology to fabricate an HCl gas sensor. EXAMPLE 7 Polyaniline thin film can also be obtained by known spin coating techniques. A very uniform coating was obtained by this technique. This also improved the performance of the gas sensor. FIG. 7 shows the response of a spin coated polyaniline film on an interdigitated electrode at various HCl concentrations. EXAMPLE 6 The emeraldine base solution of Example 1 was deposited on an interdigitated electrode. The electrode was similar to the one used in Example 4 expect that the line",
