Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as limited by the foregoing description but is only limited by the scope of the appended claims. [0057] The processing system 500 illustrated in FIG. 4 is only an exemplary processing system with which the invention may be used. While FIG. 4 illustrates a processing architecture especially suitable for a general purpose computer, such as a personal computer or a workstation, it should be recognized that well known modifications could be made to configure the processing system 500 to become more suitable for use in a variety of applications. For example, many electronic devices that require processing may be implemented using a simpler architecture that relies on a CPU 501 coupled to memory components 508 and/or memory buffer devices 504. These electronic devices may include, but are not limited to audio/video processors and recorders, gaming consoles, digital television sets, wired or wireless telephones, navigation devices (including system based on the global positioning system GPS and/or inertial navigation), and digital cameras and/or recorders. The modifications may include, for example, elimination of unnecessary components, addition of specialized devices or circuits, and/or integration of a plurality of devices.",
