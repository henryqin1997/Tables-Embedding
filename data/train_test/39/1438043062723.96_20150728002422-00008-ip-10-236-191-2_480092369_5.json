Other objects and advantages of the invention can be obtained by a review of the claims and the figures. The operation of the above invention is as follows. Initially, the tape 26 is retracted inside the housing 22. The zero switch 32 is pushed to zero the display. The brake release button 42 is pushed and the tape is withdrawn from the housing so that the measurement can be made. A measurement is then put on the display 24 and can be saved by pushing the memory switch 40. Further, by pushing the extend button 34, a reading including the length of the tape extracted from the housing, and the length of the housing can be made. Industrial Applicability An alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 8. This embodiment is intended for use by one who wishes to make measurements, for example, over a long distance. This embodiment might for example be used when measuring between two points on a roadway or for determining right-of-ways and the like. In this embodiment, the actual measuring arrangement 120 is located at the end of a handle 122. A traction wheel 124 extends from the measurement arrangement 120. The traction wheel engages and causes to turn a capstan such",
