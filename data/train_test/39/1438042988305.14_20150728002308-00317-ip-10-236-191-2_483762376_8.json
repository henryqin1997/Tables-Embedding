Detailed forms of such systems have been proposed in association with computers to provide various services, and one such system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,792,968 issued Dec. 20, 1988, to Ronald A. Katz from an application Ser. No. 07/018,244 filed Feb. 24, 1987., 28761=To consider a specific example, systems have been proposed in the past for interfacing individual telephone terminals with computers, as for sales applications. Individual callers might dial to accomplish a computer interface, then provide ordering data by actuating the telephone terminal buttons to specify goods or services. One such system is disclosed in a co-pending related patent application entitled \"Telephone Interface Statistical Analysis System\", filed May 16, 1988, and bearing a Ser. No. 07/194,258 (now U.S. Pat. No. 4,845,739) and a related prior application, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,792,968. In the use of such systems, the need is recognized for improved capability regarding audio data.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the above description, it will be apparent that the system of the present invention may be effectively used in telephonic interfaces to accommodate flexibility and control by a caller. Although the disclosed embodiment is directed to a sales operation, it will be apparent that the system may be variously embodied to accommodate any of a variety of telephonic interface operations, e.g. poll, game format, information service and so on. Furthermore, it will be apparent that while the disclosed embodiment comprises specific elements and configurations, any of a variety of structure might well be utilized. Accordingly, the scope hereof is deemed to be as set forth in the claims below. It may be seen that the system accomplishes telephonic interfaces utilizing various operations in accordance with control signals prompted by cues from a voice generator. That is, the system alternately may cue a caller to provide: digital data, control data or audio data. Concurrent with the cueing operations, the system assumes a state for compatibly processing responses. Specifically, if control signals are cued, the system is controlled accordingly. If data signals are cued, the system registers such data in either an audio or non-audio format. Furthermore, depending upon the detailed operation of the system, order data is developed as in individual cells for subsequent off-line processing. Individual packets or cells of such data are classified as disclosed above, and such classifications may be effectively",
