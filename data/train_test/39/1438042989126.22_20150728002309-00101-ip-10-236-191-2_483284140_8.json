    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Many other embodiments of the invention may be made differing in matters of detail only from that described above and without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the consistory statements. It will be appreciated that because of its construction the luminaire (1) has a relatively small height and can therefore be accommodated in a ceiling having a plenum of relatively small height. Because the lamp holder carriers (11) are mounted directly on the reflector unit (8), the lamps (9) are accurately positioned relative to the reflector unit (8), which ensures maximum performance of the luminaire. Also, as described earlier, it is a relatively simple matter to replace the lamps (9) and starters (12) of the luminaire and this can easily be done without the use of a ladder. In use, the slot accommodates the `V` of the reflector wall, and the lateral vertical flanges engage the reflector wall edge. The horizontal shelf operates to move the carrier flange free of the reflector during raising and lowering thereof. Referring to FIGS. 8 and 9, an alternative head for use in opening and closing the above described luminaire is shown. The head has an operatively vertical rectangular flange (30), with a deep `V` slot (31) in the middle, and lateral short flanges (32) extending operatively vertically to each side of the slot. Extending passed the bottom of each lateral flange, is a further flange",
