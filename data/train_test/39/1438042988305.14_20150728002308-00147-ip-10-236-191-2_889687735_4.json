    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{8937=Journey and Steve Miller Band have are set to wrap an epic 2014 summer tour that kicked off May 15 at the Sleep Train Amphitheatre in Chula Vista, California with special guest Tower of Power. The tour, which was produced by Live Nation, rolled through more than 30 cities across North America, including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit and more., 6813=If you're Journey and Rascal Flatts, the next logical step would be taking that show on the road. Luckily for the fans, that's exactly what they did. The guys put a show together in Hershey, PA that drew overwhelming fan interest and led to an additional show booked in Atlantic City. Other dates on Journey's current tour (which kicked off June 28th in Hollywood, Florida) ran into the beginning of September. Other scattered dates have since been added, with the band most recently playing at the America's Cup Pavilion in San Francisco., 4748=The band's most recent album, \"Eclipse,\" was released in the United States and Canada on May 24, 2011. Critical reception was chilly, with one Rolling Stone Magazine critic calling the album bloated and noting that it took 17 minutes and 39 seconds to find a Journey-sounding moment. Still, the album was a commercial success. It sold 21,400 copies in the U.S. in its debut week, landing at #13 on the Billboard 200. It also charted inside the top 40 in five different countries, and was nominated for the best album of the year in the Classicrock Roll of Honour Awards 2011., 6256=What else has Journey in the headlines? Neal Schon was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame on August 23 in Tulsa, prior to a concert at the Joint Hard Rock Event Center. As the only constant member of Journey since its inception, Schon has co-written some of the group's biggest songs like \"Don't Stop Believin',\" \"Any Way You Want It,\" \"Lights\" and \"Wheel In The Sky.\", 5585=Journey has experienced a bit of a Renaissance since the turn of the century. The band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on January 21, 2005. That same year they would release a new album, \"Generations,\" and embarked on a 30th anniversary tour. The concerts would make headlines for two reasons \u2013 most of them were more than three hours long, and each show was divided into two sets. One focused most exclusively on pre-\"Escape\" material, and the other on post-\"Escape\" material., 5045=By 2007, Journey was recruiting a new frontman and found him in Arnel Pineda, a Filipino vocalist discovered thanks to his YouTube video posts. Pineda made his debut with the band in 2008, the same year they released their next successful studio project, \"Revelation.\", 8574=\"We are all so looking forward to playing again for you in 2014 with the great company of the Steve Miller Band and Tower of Power,\" said members of Journey back in the spring. \"It's going to be a San Francisco musical delight from the past and present, moving full speed ahead into the future.\", 7626=Beyond the tour, Journey guitarist Neal Schon has been busy teaming up with Marco Mendoza and Deen Castronovo on a new album. The Schon Music website (SchonMusic.com) also went live on June 1st., 8241=Steve Miller went so far as to call the tour a \"not to be missed trifecta,\" and it seems that fans agreed. They packed every stop along the way, with the tour unofficially wrapping up on August 1 at Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas. (We say 'unofficially' because the Chicago stop at First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre had to be postponed due to bad weather. The stop has been rescheduled for Wednesday, September 10th. Tickets for the original show will be honored on the new date, while ticketholders unable to attend the new date can receive a refund at point of purchase)., 4144=In November 2011, Journey released their second greatest hits compilation titled \"Journey: Greatest Hits: Volume 2.\" In 2012, the TriBeCa Film Festival premiered a documentary on the story of how Journey found its current lead singer. Journey is still touring, and is set to appear onstage together with Whitesnake for the first time ever in May 2013. They will play eight dates across the UK, with tickets already on sale., 7277=If you've been following news of Journey over the last year or so, you'll know they first performed with country music trio Rascal Flatts on the 2012 CMT Music Awards, where they closed the show with the megahit \"Don't Stop Believin'.\" The two groups later crossed paths again by participating in a special edition of the critically-acclaimed CMT Crossroads series during Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. Of course, where do you go from there?, 1903=Steve Miller Band & Journey Tour Dates Concerts Videos Steve Miller Band & Journey Tour Too early to plan out your summer concert experiences? We think not, and we\u2019ve got just the show for you to plan your whole summer around: Journey and Steve Miller Band are going on tour! Starting off on May 15\u2026, 3618=What can be written about this band of rockers that hasn't been written, said, sung or hummed before? Well, 80 million albums sold worldwide just has to be at least some clue to Journey's continuing and ever-expanding popularity. Although their top-selling self-titled debut album was released in 1975, with their spectacular run of hit after popular hit in the early-to-mid eighties the band, originally from San Francisco, solidified their place in rock/pop history with their very special blend of power and passion matched to the singular, soaring vocals of Steve Perry and who can ever forget- \"Don't Stop Believin'\", \"Open Arms,\" \"Who's Cryin' Now,\" and \"Faithfully\"- just to name but a few of their irresistibly infectious pop/rock anthems. Perhaps their greatest success was with their multi-platinum selling 1981 album, \"Escape,\" which soared all the way to number one but the band continues to enjoy a passionate fanbase and continues to touch new listeners in often unexpected ways. Their hit \"Don't Stop Believin'\" was the team fight song of the 2005 World Champion Chicago White Sox and reached generations of new music lovers through its generous play on hit television shows such as The Sopranos and most recently Glee. The band may look slightly different but Journey tickets are still the event fans have been waiting for., 5818=Journey's latest project, the documentary called \"Don't Stop Believin': Everyman's Journey\" was released on DVD back on August 20, 2013.}",
