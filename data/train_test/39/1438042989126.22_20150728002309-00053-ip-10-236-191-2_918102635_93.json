            "If you join a sorority or fraternity there will be social events or service events to do with your group. The Student Activities Board seems to always have something going on, and there are free movies every week. Parties definitely happen, but you can go downtown in Lexington, go someplace just off campus, etc. Football games in the fall are big social events and if you can actually get basketball tickets through the lottery system the games are a lot of fun! There are clubs that sponsor events, and if you get involved in different organizations there will be different meetings and events for you to go to. Also, intramural sports are a good way to meet people and stay active!",
            "UK has good options for meal plans, and there is one that can fit everyone's needs. The cafeteria style dining halls have a lot of variety all of the time and are all you can eat for one meal swipe. The food is generally good but the same options are presented almost every day. Some of the other restaurant-type dining places offer more variety, and basically everything can be cooked to order or changed in some way. There is a good selection of other restaurants (Subway, Panda Express, Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Qdoba, Sbarro) that are on campus and there other restaurants that are a little more expensive right on/off campus that have better food.",
            "The dorm situation depends on where you live. South Campus is where a lot of socializing goes on but the Kirwan-Blanding Complex (2 towers and low-rises for each) is very old. New dorms are in the process of being built, so if you want new dorms make sure you turn your forms in early! The towers aren't bad (2 person rooms) but they have communal bathrooms that are very old, and the elevators occasionally go out. Central Campus has guy-only dorms and a girl-only dorm. I have been told that Haggin for the guys is awful, but everyone survives. North Campus is where the newest dorms are for now, and those dorms are known for being more studious. Living in the dorms is a great way to meet new people and make friends. When people on your floor go out, if you have made an effort to talk to them, they might ask you to go along too! Talking about dorm experiences is another way to connect with people, so no matter where you might end up in the dorms it is a good experience to have.",
            "I am currently taking more difficult classes with professors who expect a lot from each student, regardless of background knowledge of the topic. The UK Core classes make sure that everyone is taking a variety of courses but there are ways to take easy math and science classes for students in majors that don't require the classes. Professors are very knowledgeable, occasionally a little difficult to understand, and the TA's for recitation classes know what they are doing (but there are some that don't).",
            "If you have the grades and test scores, make sure you apply for the competitive scholarships-the application takes time but it may be well worth the effort! Don't be afraid to ask questions because you want to make sure that UK is the right place for YOU. Make sure to visit UK, especially if you have not been to Lexington before. The atmosphere here is very distinct and getting a feel for that might change your decision.",
            "The University of Kentucky is a school with a lot of spirit, and the atmosphere here is definitely one of it's distinct characteristics. Classes keep everyone (who is trying to learn) busy, professors try to keep things interesting, and the homework reinforces concepts being taught. The campus is big enough to feel spread out, but it is always very walkable."

I went from getting kicked out to returning three years later and accomplished a 3.25 GPA for the semester., 356203=This campus is gorgeous, there are safety measures everywhere, and everyone is incredibly helpful. I have yet to see someone who wouldn't point me in the right direction (or give me a completely random high-five when she realized we had the same major). I wish it was August already, and move-in day., 786307=Tour the campus in October - you'll see how big and beautiful the campus truly is before it's a little too chilly. Don't count UK out if you are from Lexington or a surrounding area: it can easily be your new home [somewhat] away from home!, 465115=Apply for scholarships and housing as soon as you can. The sooner you get this done the better chance you have of getting a good dorm or more scholarship money. Also apply for financial aid on Jan. 1., 513366=K Week introductory activities are awesome and a good way to get to know the campus, but don't get used to having fun and partying all the time. By September, you'll have to crack down on studying!, 355569=-Talk to everyone. That's why they're there. Financial aid counselor, admissions counselor, or just call. -Apply early. I had my application in as soon as I could (October) and got the decision letter in November. -GPA is important, so don't slack off, but practice your testing skills for the ACT or SAT. My GPA was 2.98, but I got accepted with an ACT score of 32. -Visit the campus anytime you get the chance. It's beautiful. And bring an umbrella!, 299375=The greek life is great they help with community service events the NPHC holds a Martin Luther King march every year which is fun. Also some of the Greeks in the NPHC have Yard shows, Step shows during homecoming and other fun events., 854033=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2528=When President Todd accepted the role as University President, he brought with him the Top 20 business plan meaning, thus, that the university will be a in the top 20 by the year 2020. Therefore, the University of Kentucky is making progress to become on of the top 20 schools in the nation. The William T. Young Library, a 58 million dollar complex, has the nation's second largest book endowment second only to Harvard University and is the largest among Public Universities. Also, on a side note the fifth floor was voted the best place on campus to get a date., 348057=Willy T which is the library is always filled during exam week and its almost a social event as well as a study event. Also during March Madness the city of lexington gets out of control and thats something that everyone should experience.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Kristen from Pickerington, OH 07/21/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 34 out of 34 people found this review useful. 2 of 196 Categories Comments Great for these types of students UK is a great school for any types of students! It's so diverse, it would be hard not to fit in somewhere! Tips for prospective students Don't slack off during senior year! Schools still look at those transcripts! Also, GET EXCITED! You're going into your first year of college! It can be scary going to a big school at first, but K Crew holds tons of activities for you to meet new people and try new things. Bang for the buck Ohio's tuition is expensive, and it is almost cheaper for me to attend out-of-state at Kentucky as it is for me to go to school in Ohio. Am enjoying being here I love going to school at UK. For me, it's just far enough away from home, but",
