They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto when read and interpreted according to accepted legal principles such as the doctrine of equivalents and reversal of parts. From the foregoing, it can be seen that the present invention provides an easily detachable seat assembly that can quickly be removed and/or remounted onto the seat mounts and which is securely held in place once mounted. The seat assembly can easily be aligned with the seat mounts in order to mount the seat assembly onto the supports, and the seat assembly can easily be coupled with the seat mounts to secure the seat assembly. In addition, the actuator cord provides an easy means for uncoupling the seat assembly prior to removal. The quick release mechanism described herein is equally adaptable for releasably securing",
