            "Honestly, anybody can find a fit at UNT. We have a lot of commuters who come strictly to get their degree, but we also have a great community on-campus and in Denton. The Greek life is really thriving and we have so many clubs and organizations for any interest.",
            "UNT is growing closer and closer to becoming a tier one university. So when you come, bring that Mean Green pride with you! Support our football team at the new stadium in the fall, wear green on Fridays, and be proud of the Mean Green! Also, live in a residence hall for at least your first year. It's required, but many freshman find a way of getting around it. But, you'l find that living in a residence hall your freshman year really helps you transition to the college life and you'll make life long friends there. Plus UNT Housing and Residence Life has so much to offer as far as the learning communities, called REAL communities, the programs, and housing associations.",
            "UNT is definitely one of the best schools for your money. It's even been on the national list for the best education for your money three years in a row. My best friend goes to TCU and pays SO much more than I do, for the same quality education!",
            "I love it at UNT. The community is so diverse and united. Once you find your place at UNT, my happens to be with Housing, you are sure to feel at home! Join clubs and organizations because UNT has so many to offer and that's where you're going to find your closest friends and connections. Plus, Denton is an awesome town with cool local businesses and such. Make sure you go to the square!",
            "The faculty and staff here at UNT are the biggest resource to students, but you have to be active in using them as your resources! Professors are impressed by those who take time to talk to them during their office hours, so do it! If you are having any problem, may it be academic, social, or emotional, go talk to them about it! These people wouldn't be at the university if they didn't want you to succeed. It's not like they get paid a fortune to do so. Also, the people in your major are experienced and have connections in your field. So pay attention in class, take their advice and build strong relationships with them. They have the connections to get you internships and jobs. UNT is what you make of it! It can be a great place for learning but you have to be active in learning."

They offer many different styles of cafeterias such as, an all vegan hall, a Cajun hall, a general foods hall, and many others. We have many places to eat on campus and some high dollar places like Starbucks., 58465=As I am in pursuit of my B.A.A.S. degree, UNT has excellent programs that accept my credits earned at a Technical College. I am looking forward to attending in the Fall of 2009. Everyone I have met at the campus is friendly and very helpful., 867393=February is a spring month, why is there snow? My class wasn't uphill when I was on time last Monday... HOW IS IT FINALS ALREADY????, 380469=I have attended UNT since Spring 2012 including Summer after having transferred from a junior college. I attend evening classes and had been working fulltime until now. As a result I am not very involved with lot's of campus activities, my review may be limited in some aspects., 383158=There are so many things on campus to do for fun, but the Union at the 1 o'clock lounge is the place to be on campus., 755652=A variety to choose from. There is cajun cafeterias, vegan cafeterias, as well as the standard ones., 214768=unt might not have the same prestige as smu, but it is still very nice, and certainly much cheaper. expect to pay about $1300 per 4 hour class (including fees, texts, etc.). financial aid seems kind of lacking, but the fa office claims it is temporarily short on funding., 408856=UNT is the best decision I have every made! I will be graduating this December with a Bachelors in Psychology and Minor in Spanish. Its diverse, comfortable, and its a awesome school!, 449420=I do not know yet. I will start in August., 51814=well lit, unt shuttle buses run all over campus and town until like 10:30, and emergency stations are numerous., 873635=Every April there is a 12 hour concert in one of the dorms (Bruce Hall) called Bruce Jam. This concert is open to everyone and features student bands. Bruce Hall also host a haunted house every October/, 938232=If you look around, there is usually something to do every day. I'm more of a hermit and keep to my room, but I hear about a lot of different things. Andy Grammar even did a concert here the other week! Most things are free too!, 1149997=UNT is great on traditions like the Mean Green Victory march after winning football games., our Alma Mater chant at Football games. Fraternity Bid Day marches around campus in the Fall and Spring. The campus bell that rings a nice little tune every hour on the hour. And certainly the unforgettable Eagle CAWH that anyone can throw up at a given time to show school spirit., 22038=Make sure you like where you will be living first and if you need a job apply in June or July. If you don't like noise don't stay in a dorm. Best freshmen halls for walking to class are Kerr and Maple as they have food for first thing in the morning and bus stops right in front of them. Also DON'T DO MORNING CLASSES!!! It's not like high school 8am because at least there you can go to bed before oh say... midnight?}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students North Texas has the allure of having a great art/music school with the diversity (and affordability!) you would expect from a state school. Denton is a great city as well with many parks and festivals to partake in. The public transportation is fairly decent as well. Tips for prospective students Weird/art kids tend to gravitate towards Bruce Hall their first year (myself included). Most residence halls have a distinctive community feel. Mean Greens has the best food on campus with the paninis being the best.

Because the Visual Arts program is extremely well known and growing, there are alot of artsy people. I think this school is perfect for those who may want to spend a few semesters",
