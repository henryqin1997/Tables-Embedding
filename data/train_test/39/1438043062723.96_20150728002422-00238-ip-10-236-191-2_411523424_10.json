The white balance is effected by the temperature of the light, while the color balance is effected by the shape of the lights energy spectrum in addition to the temperature of the light. So, in theory by doing color correction and reconstructing the object colors by factoring out the lights energy spectrum we are also factoring out the lights energy spectrum average value which is the temperature. I can see how adjusting the lights energy spectrum average value (the temperature) one",
