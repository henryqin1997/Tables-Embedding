Luckily I had some left over rubber sealant lying around - I'd read about and experienced this before with my other aftermarket lights. Overall I am very satisfied with the product and the customer service. I was notified of a short backorder (about a week) shortly after placing my order, which happens from time to time. Wes kept me updated and called me as soon as the item left. Great guys to deal with! \u00a0\u00a0 Andrew C\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0 (Seattle,washington) Good look, is there any manufactures going on with it? \u00a0\u00a0 Ilyes, C\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0 (Roanoke, VA) very good quality",
