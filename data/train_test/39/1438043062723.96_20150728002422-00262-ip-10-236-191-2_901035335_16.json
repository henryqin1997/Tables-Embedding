            "St. Mary of the Woods offers many extracurriculars including horseback riding. The school is also close to Terre Haute, Indiana which is home to many great theatres, restaurants, and concert halls. We have always enjoyed our visits to the area!",
            "On our visit to St. Mary of the Woods College, we experienced great food at two different dining halls. The food was fresh and the staff was kind and welcoming. I look forward to our next visit in the fall of 2013!",
            "Since I am an online student, I have never experienced dorm life at St. mary of the Woods College. Though I have met a few people that have had great experiences. I wish I would have chosen St. Mary of the Woods College sooner so that I could have experienced dorm life first hand!",
            "The highly rated academic programs of St. Mary of the Woods starts with their professors who are highly qualified. I have felt increasingly challenged in my coursework and encouraged to explore new areas of study. The online courses offer a significant amount of classes, and exactly what I need for my career in Human Services.",
            "It is very important to stay focused on your academic success at all times. Also, I have found success when I study ever day and take breaks every so often. As an online student it is imperative to stay connected with your professors and make sure to notify them if there are any issues you are having with your courses.",
            "After my first semester as an online student, I would highly reccomend their Woods Online program. The staff and professors have been prompt and helpful my entire time at St. Mary of the Woods, and I am extremely happy with my choice. I am proud to attend St. Mary of the Woods College, and am looking forward to calling myself a graduate!"
