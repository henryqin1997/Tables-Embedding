    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{180569=[0075] The different sized US-ICDs will all have the same sized and shaped thick end 1413. The thick end is hollow inside allowing for the insertion of a core operational member 1853. The core member comprises a housing 1857 which contains the battery supply, capacitor and operational circuitry for the US-ICD. The proximal end of the core member has a plurality of electronic plug connectors. Plug connectors 1861 and 1863 are electronically connected to the sense electrodes via pressure fit connectors (not illustrated) inside the thick end which are standard in the art. Plug connectors 1865 and 1867 are also electronically connected to the cardioverter/defibrillator electrodes via pressure fit connectors inside the thick end. The distal end of the core member comprises an end cap 1855, and a ribbed fitting 1859 which creates a water-tight seal when the core member is inserted into opening 1851 of the thick end of the US-ICD., 172498=[0068] Turning now to FIG. 14, the US-ICD of the present invention is illustrated. The US-ICD consists of a curved housing 1211 with a first and second end. The first end 1413 is thicker than the second end 1215. This thicker area houses a battery supply, capacitor and operational circuitry for the US-ICD. The circuitry will be able to monitor cardiac rhythms for tachycardia and fibrillation, and if detected, will initiate charging the capacitor and then delivering cardioversion/defibrillation energy through the two cardioversion/defibrillating electrodes 1417 and 1219 located on the outer surface of the two ends of the housing. The circuitry can provide cardioversion/defibrillation energy in different types of waveforms. In the preferred embodiment, a 100 uF biphasic waveform is used of approximately 10-20 ms total duration and with the initial phase containing approximately \u2154 of the energy, however, any type of waveform can be utilized such as monophasic, biphasic, multiphasic or alternative waveforms as is known in the art., 205539=[0104] The size of the electrically conductive surface of an electrode 204, in one particular embodiment, is approximately 500 square millimeters in area. In alternate embodiments, it is desirable to maintain the size of the electrically conductive surface between approximately 100 square millimeters and approximately 2000 square millimeters in area. As with the size of the canister housing 192, the size of the electrically conductive surface may vary to accommodate the particular patient recipient. Furthermore, the shape and size of an electrode 204 may vary to accommodate the placement of the electrode 204 on the canister housing 192. The shape and size of an electrode may also be varied to adapt to specified diagnostic and therapeutic functions performed by the canister 190. For example, the electrode's 204 size and shape may be altered to minimize energy loss to surrounding bodily tissues, or for minimizing the diversion of current away from the heart., 158286=[0055] The active canister housing will provide energy and voltage intermediate to that available with ICDs and most AEDs. The typical maximum voltage necessary for ICDs using most biphasic waveforms is approximately 750 Volts with an associated maximum energy of approximately 40 Joules. The typical maximum voltage necessary for AEDs is approximately 2000-5000 Volts with an associated maximum energy of approximately 200-360 Joules depending upon the model and waveform used. The S-ICD of the present invention uses maximum voltages in the range of about 700 to about 3150 Volts and is associated with energies of about 40 to about 210 Joules. The capacitance of the S-ICD could range from about 50 to about 200 micro farads., 175346=[0071] The two cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes on the housing are used for delivering the high voltage cardioversion/defibrillation energy across the heart. In the preferred embodiment, the cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes are coil electrodes, however, other cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes could be used such as having electrically isolated active surfaces or platinum alloy electrodes. The coil cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes are about 5-10 cm in length. Located on the housing between the two cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes are two sense electrodes 1425 and 1427. The sense electrodes are spaced far enough apart to be able to have good QRS detection. This spacing can range from 1 to 10 cm with 4 cm being presently preferred. The electrodes may or may not be circumferential with the preferred embodiment. Having the electrodes non-circumferential and positioned outward, toward the skin surface, is a means to minimize muscle artifact and enhance QRS signal quality. The sensing electrodes are electrically isolated from the cardioversion/defibrillation electrode via insulating areas 1423. Analogous types of cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes are currently commercially available in a transvenous configuration. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,534,022, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, discloses a composite electrode with a coil cardioversion/defibrillation electrode and sense electrodes. Modifications to this arrangement is contemplated within the scope of the invention. One such modification is to have the sense electrodes at the two ends of the housing and have the cardioversion/defibrillation electrodes located in between the sense electrodes. Another modification is to have three or more sense electrodes spaced throughout the housing and allow for the selection of the two best sensing electrodes. If three or more sensing electrodes are used, then the ability to change which electrodes are used for sensing would be a programmable feature of the US-ICD to adapt to changes in the patient physiology and size over time. The programming could be done via the use of physical switches on the canister, or as presently preferred, via the use of a programming wand or via a wireless connection to program the circuitry within the canister., 178666=[0073]FIG. 16 schematically illustrates the method for implanting the US-ICD of the present invention. An incision 1631 is made in the left anterior axillary line approximately at the level of the cardiac apex. A subcutaneous pathway is then created that extends posteriorly to allow placement of the US-ICD. The incision can be anywhere on the thorax deemed reasonable by the implanting physician although in the preferred embodiment, the US-ICD of the present invention will be applied in this region. The subcutaneous pathway is created medially to the inframammary crease and extends posteriorly to the left posterior axillary line. The pathway is developed with a specially designed curved introducer 1742 (see FIG. 17). The trocar has a proximal handle 1641 and a curved shaft 1643. The distal end 1745 of the trocar is tapered to allow for dissection of a subcutaneous path in the patient. Preferably, the trocar is cannulated having a central lumen 1746 and terminating in an opening 1748 at the distal end. Local anesthetic such as lidocaine can be delivered, if necessary, through the lumen or through a curved and elongated needle designed to anesthetize the path to be used for trocar insertion should general anesthesia not be employed. Once the subcutaneous pathway is developed, the US-ICD is implanted in the subcutaneous space, the skin incision is closed using standard techniques.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes [0167] Numerous characteristics and advantages of the invention covered by this document have been set forth in the foregoing description. It will be understood, however, that this disclosure is, in many aspects, only illustrative. Changes may be made in details, particularly in matters of shape, size and arrangement of parts without exceeding the scope of the invention. The invention's scope is defined, of course, in the language in which the appended claims are expressed. [0166] The length of the multi-segment canister housing 280 is approximately 30 centimeters long or less. In alternative embodiments, the multi-segment canister housing 280 is approximately 20 centimeters or less. In yet another embodiment, the multi-segment canister housing 280 is approximately 12 centimeters or less. The width of multi-segment canister housing 280 is approximately 3 centimeters to approximately 10 centimeters wide. [0165] The proximal segment 284 also includes a top surface 298, a bottom surface 300 and surrounding sides 302 connecting these two surfaces. The proximal segment 284 depicted in FIG. 26B, however, is generally planar. In alternative embodiments, depicted in FIG. 26C, the proximal segment 284 may also be curved and may also be of a different curvature to that of the distal segment. [0164]FIG. 26B shows the distal segment 282 of the multi-segment canister housing 280 being curved to mimic the anatomical shape of a patient recipient's ribcage",
