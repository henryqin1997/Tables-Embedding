            "very safe! I have never once been scared to walk by myself while on campus even when it was dark. The University of Maine provides a good place for students to feel welcome and safe during your time studying here.",
            "Very strong on campus and very easy to join in the beginning on the school year.",
            "During orientation as well as your first few days here there are many booth set up all around campus ready to inform you about all the many different clubs and Activities there are on campus. If you want to do something it won't be hard to find.",
            "We have what we call the naked 5. They show up to the football and hockey games just about naked with every part of there bodies covered in paint! Its weird but they do a good job keeping the crowds pumped.",
            "Eat at the dinning halls as much as possible. Its free food why waist it on take out or going out to dinner. Also If you live near by or you know your going home soon save your laundry to do at home after a while that will save you money.",
            "Maine bound is my favorite. They have an indoor rock wall and sponsor free hiking trips. Also most everything on campus is free to students we have many performers come up during the weekend and tickets are normally always free. sororities and fraternities and also very big on campus as well as many other groups and organizations.",
            "After a while the food came seem like the same thing. The key is to be able to work with everything your given, and having a few snacks in your dorm!",
            "As a first year student you will only live with freshmen. Dorm life is great everyone gets along and we always hang out in the common room and study together. The dorms themselves have some touching up to do but if you ever have a problem that be fixed with in your dorm just call it in and it will be fixed right away.",
            "Different majors have different levels of difficulties... However no matter what you should be ready work teacher won't left you get off easy.",
            "Just because you may be from Maine and you don't want to see people from your high school again the University of Maine Is big enough to avoid them.",
            "I love my school. Beautiful and very personable. Easy to get involved in any type of group you are interested in."

Rumble on the Hill (various competitions between dorms). Healthy High 5k (Run/walk on April 20th at 4:20 PM)., 9009=There is over 900 student in greek life on campus, 8 men\u2019s fraternities or 7 women\u2019s sororities. Greek life has been at UMaine since 1874 and is a big part of the school and to those who want to be involved in it. For many students it enhances there time here at UMaine and it is a great community. They support academic support/excellence, and show leadership in the community. Greek life can either be apart of your experience here at UMaine, or it does't have to be at all, it is up to the student. But greek life for many students here is a great experience., 419040=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 352333=There is a police station on campus with safety boxes everywhere. I have never felt unsafe. I have a job on campus and get out around 12:00AM. There are always student walking around and the campus police make themselves noticed - not in a negative way., 139551=I will be starting classes in the fall of 2012 but I believe the University of Maine has a wonderful reputation for their degrees they offer. I'm extremely excited to begin my college education here and experience their beautiful campus. Not only do I believe their campus and degrees are very high quality, I have heard they are always there for you. I know I am not going to be alone through my college process, all the professors and staff are they 100% to make sure everyone is getting through college as smoothly as possible., 373407=It's nice from September to mid October, then starts to get nice again in May, right before the end of the year. All the time, everyday in between, it's a dark, gray, very very cold world. A big party school, probably because drinking alcohol makes you not feel the frigid winter chill.}",

All you have to do is push the button and the campus police will come for you. RA's give the student the campus police number so if they need to call. The campus is really safe overall. Greek Life",
