While several other screen readers were reported, these were the most prominently reported. Individual versions of screen readers are not yet computed, but generally the majority of users are using the most up-to-date version of their screen reader., 48194=Many users commented on difficult web sites in the form of general site types, such as flash-based or travel/airline sites. Even with different web sites grouped into categories, respondents were more likely to identify sites they visit than sites they don't visit. The top 10 used sites above were identified a total of 1397 times, whereas the top ten web sites that screen reader users avoided were identified only 400 times. Considering this difference, the number of times a site was listed as one that was avoided carries much significance. For example, while 43 respondents listed Facebook as a site they use and 45 respondents listed Facebook as a site they avoid. When you consider the prevalence of sites being listed, Facebook accounts for 11% of the web sites listed to avoid and only 3% of those that users find easy. In short, Facebook was much more likely to be listed as a site that was avoided than as one that was commonly used., 2740=Follow-up surveys were administered in October 2009, December 2010, and May 2012.
