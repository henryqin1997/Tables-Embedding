    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{42324=While the NFL losses are significant (specifically Ryan and Clark) better position coaching should help as will any reversion to mean in the turnovers caused which was abysmal in 2014.\u00a0 The entire team had 5 INTs last year; multiple DBs on other Big 10 teams had more than our entire team.\u00a0 Fumbles caused was also pathetic.\u00a0 Just adding 8 more TOs a year by this unit - which would just be a \"normal\" year, should help change the field and make the defense \"feel\" better.\u00a0 I dont buy the \"defense was on the field too long\" argument at all for last year's failures - Michigan not only had the ball over 30 minutes a game on offense they also played at a very slow pace in real time terms.\u00a0 Lack of dynamic playmakers and ability to flip the field hurt more., 16355=Thursday, May 21, 38469=The 2015 season was a breakout of sorts for Spike Albrecht: the famously under-recruited junior wasn\u2019t projected to start at any point in his four year career, but because of the injuries to Derrick Walton and Caris LeVert, Spike ascended to starter and became an indispensible presence on the court and one of Michigan\u2019s most valuable rotation players. Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman and Aubrey Dawkins saw the biggest bumps in playing time after the injuries, but Albrecht increased his minutes per game from 26.2 to 38.6 (tied for the most on the team with Zak Irvin for games after LeVert and Walton were sidelined)., 49502=The backups are worrisome and injuries to this unit could be a big issue.\u00a0 Not recruiting an impact LB this class hurt as he could have been someone who was part of the 2 deep, especially at that SAM position.\u00a0 And it will hurt even more in 2016 when this team is probably going to be running out multiple freshmen on the 2 deep.\u00a0 With Winovich switched to TE (head scratcher to me) and Ferns transferring all you are left at from the 2014 class is often injured Furbush and Wangler.\u00a0 Can either help this year?\u00a0 They will have to in 2016.\u00a0 McCray is a MIKE type who has yet to really make any impact on the football team (was injured this spring) and Gant is a lightly regarded SAMish type.\u00a0\u00a0 Again the worry is depth here - once you get past LB #4 (Gedeon) you open up a lot of question marks.\u00a0\u00a0 The starting unit should be \"solid\" but it would be nice to really develop LBs other teams have to game plan for.\u00a0, 33964=Among the much ballyhooed (and eventually very successful) \u201cFresh Five\u201d recruiting class, only two are left: Caris LeVert and Spike Albrecht. It\u2019s easy to see, even now, that the watershed 2012 class was instrumental in triggering the renaissance of Michigan basketball \u2013 they went to the national title game as freshmen (three started), won the Big Ten by three games as sophomores (with Stauskas and LeVert leading the way), and up to four will eventually be drafted into the NBA. Here are their individual accomplishments:, 57197=With June days away, and the board under constant Nike v Adidas attack, thought I'd steal some Mr. Yost thunder and do a 2 deep for the defense for 2015.\u00a0 I was going to do this for the offense but as I looked over the RB, WR, and even OL positions it is really in constant flux - any number of guys could be starters or backups and even positions on the OL are not set in stone.\u00a0 So it's way more guesswork., 54066=UM recruited 2 freshmen in 2015 but it would seem - barring a lot of injuries - neither is going to be playing in 2015 at their current projected weights.\u00a0 Each could use 15+ lbs (i.e. a redshirt year).\u00a0, 11618=The stats throughout the weekend were impressive to say the least for the Maize & Blue.\u00a0 Michigan went 3-0, outscoring their opponents 28-5 along the way and posting a combined 1.84 ERA with a 26-5 K to BB ratio.\u00a0 5 home runs on the weekend pushed Michigan\u2019s season total to a staggering 112, now well past the 2005 team\u2019s program record in that category.\u00a0 Junior wonder-worker Sierra Romero showed the full range of her abilities, going 5-9 at the plate, showing power with a home-run and blazing speed with a triple and a cheeky bunt-single against a backed-off infield.\u00a0 Freshman Aidan Falk made a big impression as well \u2013 as Hutch says, at this point in the year, they\u2019re not freshmen anymore!\u00a0 She hit .600 on the weekend, grabbing 3 hits against both Cal and Pitt., 34229=\u2014 LaVall Jordan (@LaVall_Jordan) April 22, 2015, 50645=Bolden seems like the most sure thing as a starter after he and Jake Ryan combined for an enormous amount of playing time last year.\u00a0 UM played a ton of 2 LB sets, essentially erasing the SAM position for large portions of games and going with a nickel.\u00a0 Morgan is a presumed starter at the MIKE but I hold out hope Gedeon is seriously going to push there.\u00a0 He is another tantalizing guy that we've seen splashes of to get our interest up but not over a sustained period of time.\u00a0\u00a0 At the SAM, Ross is a mystery - a 2 year starter he entered 2014 expected to continue to be an undersized fast LB - but disappeared for much of the first half of the year it seemed like.\u00a0 One hopes he re-emerges this year - his size hurts him but with a guy like this if you can keep him clean he is one of the few guys in the LB core with serious speed.\u00a0 His backup is RJS but again see notes above - guy has been a disappearing act for 3 years so I am not counting on him.\u00a0 I really would have liked to see Dymonte Thomas bulk up to 210-215 lbs and take a swipe at SAM in his remaining 2 years at UM., 16058=Friday, May 22, 15945=6:00 p.m., 47051=The 2 that intrigue me are Hill and Kinnel.\u00a0 Hill had a rough 2014 with all the injuries - he had supposedly won the starting spot across from Wilson and then promptly was hurt. He returned later in the year, but getting trucked by Connor Cook was a testament to the type of season it was.\u00a0 He still seems like someone who has good potential and a good year for him would help alleviate worries about the 2016 SS position.\u00a0\u00a0 As for Kinnel, I am for some reason buying this kid's hype.\u00a0\u00a0 He has great size at already 205 and is one of the guys I could see losing his redshirt with the inevitable injuries every team has in the secondary., 140587=However, on May 16, 1861 newly formed Michigan regiments came marching into Washington DC to defend the capital...the very first state to respond to Lincoln's call and with more troops than Lincoln had asked from the state of Michigan. \u00a0Lincoln is alleged to have responded: \"Thank God for Michigan.\u201d, 53428=Views:\u00a0 Having a strong 2 deep at the DT is a nice luxury for the 2015 team.\u00a0 There should not be much drop off from starters to backups.\u00a0 In fact if Mone and Wormley were starting at Utah over Glasgow and Henry you wouldn't bat an eye really.\u00a0 You'll notice Wormley here along with Hurst - these are probably their more natural positions but in a 3-4 they could be your ends (along with a Charlton type).\u00a0 Heck Henry might be an end in a 3-4.\u00a0 It will be interestng to see how it plays out., 17147=Thursday-Friday, May 21-22, 50934=This is a solid workmanlike group but it seems to lack elite playmaking.\u00a0 I'd also argue it lacks depth.\u00a0 And it gets downright scary in 2016 when all 3 projected starters graduate. (UM might take 2 grad transfers here in 2016 the way this depth chart looks!!), 16240=9:00 p.m., 41422=The 2015 defense should also be interesting in terms of formations - while others have said the type of \"3-4\" Durkin runs won't be a sea change the position flexibility of a few players on the DL (Charlton, Wormley, Henry, Hurst) should make for interesting post game analysis.\u00a0 The obvious strength are the DTs with a potential pair of top end DBs\u00a0 - Peppers still needs to prove it on the field vs non MAC competition.\u00a0 LBs seem solid if not game changers.\u00a0 Finding solutions at the 2nd CB and DEs are the key - pressuring the QB is probably going to be the #1 issue for this defense.\u00a0 #2 will be depth at various positions - while one feels comfortable with the starters at most spots, the backups are either unproven or proven to be a significant step down, esp in the back 7.\u00a0 So when injuries do hit - can we get servicable production from the next guy on the totem pole?, 43149=While Michigan's NCAA defensive rank was pretty decent all that does is rank teams by average yards given up per game.\u00a0 And that gives a major advantage to every Big 10 defense as the offenses - save for a few - have been anywhere from pedestrian to poor by and large for years.\u00a0 Advanced stats showed a Michigan defense which ranked around 40ish in the country and 6th to 8th in the Big 10 last year.\u00a0\u00a0 That felt about right - and that was disappointing considering the defense was expected to be top 3 going into 2014.\u00a0\u00a0 Even the things the team did right (rush defense) let the team down when needed (Minnesota).\u00a0 It wasn't a bad defense but it wasn't as good as it looked on paper.\u00a0 The end of 1st half implosions also caused us to pull out our hair.\u00a0\u00a0, 28885=The softball team left for Oklahoma City and the WCWS today, ahead of their Thursday match up with Alabama (7:00 pm ET, ESPN2). The ASA/USA Player of the Year award (softball Heisman) will be announced tonight and Michigan's Sierra Romero -- already the recipient of ESPNW's POY award and MGoBoard's Chick that Knocks the Fuck Out of the Ball award -- is one of three finalists.\u00a0Here are some tweets and reading material for those interested.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Big Ten Review For the first time since 2005, Michigan softball swept the Big Ten championships, taking home the regular season crown after a tightly contested race with Minnesota and the tournament crown after downing PSU, Northwestern, and Nebraska in dominant fashion. The Wolverines came into Big Ten play slightly chastened by a home loss to Kent State and their brilliant pitcher, but nevertheless riding a brilliant non-conference performance.\u00a0 MGoSoftball has already ably reviewed that portion of the season (http://mgoblog.com/diaries/softball-mid-season-report). After exacting revenge against KSU and pounding Bowling Green, the Wolverines charged into Big Ten play with a three game set at Ohio State, racking up double-digit wins in all three games.\u00a0 Two games into the Iowa series, things were looking on track for continued success.\u00a0 Halfway through the final game of the series, though, the Wolverines defense collapsed, blowing a 4-run lead and handing the lowly Hawkeyes an unlikely upset at Alumni Field.\u00a0 There wasn't much time to recover, either, as Michigan had to travel up to Minneosta for a 3-game set against the nationally-ranked Golden Gophers, headlined by star pitcher Sara Groenewegen.\u00a0 After a 9-1 run rule drubbing and a blown 3-run lead early in the second game, it looked like Michigan's magical season was unravelling all too quickly. Fortunately, something clicked in those Maize & Blue minds after that bad 2nd inning in Minnesota, and the Wolverines bounced back.\u00a0 They tied the game in the 3rd, and went on to win 9-4, following",
