In these cases, it will appear as though they are lobbying on the bill sharing that number in the Congress in which they are filing, which in most cases is a different bill entirely. To see more information about the bill the client is lobbying on, you can look at the specific report under the \"Report images\" tab on the lobbying client's profile page.
