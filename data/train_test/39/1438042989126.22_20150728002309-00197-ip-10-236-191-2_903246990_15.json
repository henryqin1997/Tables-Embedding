            "Definitely make a visit and check out the whole campus and amenities. Make sure you're prepared for the different seasons of weather because it can get unpredictable sometimes.",
            "All of the fees charged for tuition, room & board, meal plan, etc. seem to be reasonable prices and it's what one makes out of their classes that can make the classes even more rewarding.",
            "It's a great area with city-like activities to do, but a nice hometown feeling. The campus is attractive and is great for walking, as long as it's not raining or snowing a lot.",
            "The professors in most of my classes have been very liberal with their teaching, meaning they allowed the students to somewhat take over the discussion and I've learned a lot through that experience. Most of the textbooks are easy to read and shares great knowledge in a more approachable way for students."

I found myself homeless in October due to an any reason or no reason clause, trigger happy administration, and a misinterpretation of events. Other students have had issues as well. There appears to be no signs of improvement coming any time soon. If you are new to the university and don't know anyone, and can't handle an apartment, you might still consider the dorms. Just don't get out of line! (or blink!) Most of the dorms are in fairly poor condition. They are economy rooms to say the least. They are very very small, and considerably overpriced due to their size and the fact that you share so much space with another person., 540906=Bob's the cafeteria really needs improvements but they are fixing that for the fall 2014 semester. There are other places to eat around campus which are great and use money on your student ID card called flex dollars., 176840=Good scholarship and grant opportunities. For out of state students see if you qualify for the WUE- Western Undergraduate Exchange there are several states that are grouped within this and offer out of state students a lower tuiton rate (apporx. $1000 more then in-state students pay, but $5000-10000 less then regular out of state students), 386648=I have never lived in the dorms, but all my friends say that they are okay, and typical. They have a loyalty program which awards students for living in the dorm with $1000 each year they return and a free $250 free meal credit., 482552=Bob's Place, the cafeteria, provides a multitude of options, particularly desserts. They cater to vegetarians as well as to people who just want a pizza. Einstein Bros Bagels (known locally as Einstein's) is a good place to hang out and drink coffee. This campus is set up for early birds: all of the food and most of the services close by 8:00 in the evening. After that, you're on your own., 552338=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students One word of advice I can give for incoming Vandals is to not underestimate core classes. I understand that they may be boring, as they rarely help with one's major, but they are required to graduate, so it is important to work hard in those courses. Bang for the buck The University of Idaho is a very affordable school. With tuition at only $5000 per year, it is fairly accessible for students",
