Keep it up., 16763=Finally, The Evening Standard reported yesterday\u00a0that Gary Cahill is Arsene Wengers principal\u00a0 target in January and he will test Bolton with a \u00a310 millon bid\u2026 See above for my thoughts on this one \ud83d\ude09, 12333=Many people think that our rivals on Sunday have a real chance of dislodging the Chavs and Mancs off the top of the Premiership next May. Yes they have money, yes they have a couple of great players in Yaya and Silva but what they don\u2019t have is great team spirit. Bellamy has gone on loan to Cardiff as he was peed\u00a0off with the atmosphere at Citeh, Tevez has recently suggested he may retire from football all together so he can\u2019t be as happy as some think. Lardybayor has either been out of favour or spouting about moving on to another club and Mark Hughes best signing is nowhere to be seen.}",
