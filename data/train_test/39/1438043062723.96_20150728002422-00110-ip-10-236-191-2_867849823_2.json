She took me for dinner at the \"Black Bear Pub\" in town and guess who was performing that night! Lisa picked me as the \"Gay Guy\" in her act, and kept the entire audience totally involved for an hour. I was not surprised to see her become so famous, she is an outstanding comic in the league of great insult comics such as Don Rickles! Cheers, T.W., 122067=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc.
