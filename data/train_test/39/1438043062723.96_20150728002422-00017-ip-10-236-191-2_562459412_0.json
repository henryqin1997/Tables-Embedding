    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{95928=The tendency of the coatings to form cracks is significantly reduced relative to the direct coating with a sol, since the particle shedding after drying is rather loose and will gain density during the sintering. The magnification from the microscope image shows a homogeneous crack-free film formed by sedimentation, which is independent of the drying process of the suspension (see fig. 3). The high porosity and the large content of macropores formed in these films also guarantee an improved interaction of the atmosphere and its pollutants with the material. Table 2 lists the libraries of the first generation. To guarantee the adhesion of the oxide films on the substrate additional sol of the pure base oxide (except for Sn, and In) was first pipetted into the cavity of synthesis reactor. Here, the content of the base oxide within the sol corresponds to 10% of the oxide quantity of the suspension. This is necessary for metal oxides with a high melting point (e.g. CeO2, approx. 2600 \u00b0C), since the adhesion on the substrate could not be achieved by sintering alone. Consequently, the libraries with Indium as bulk material were sintered at only 500 \u00b0C due to the low melting point of 850 \u00b0C. Thus sufficient adhesion was obtained for Indium oxide without adding an adhesive agent. With respect to SnO2 adding an adhesive agent was advantageous., 68223=In order to prepare the material libraries with one main component the oxides were suspended into glasses with a lid, and were stirred at 1000 rpm during pipetting by the synthesis robot. To prepare the mixed-oxide sensors the suspensions were filled into GC vials, simultaneously stirred by a multiple magnetic stirrer, and were pipetted one after the other. As to the synthesis of the In/W mixed-oxide library, both base oxides were made by using one common recipe. The pipetting volume of the suspensions was adjusted to a quantity of oxide per sample spot on the aluminium oxide support, which corresponds to a nominal film thickness (relating to dense oxide) of the sensors of approx. 10 \u03bcm. The actual film thickness will be considerably larger due to the fact that a porous film will be formed. Surface dopings can be applied by primarily introducing suitable solutions of the selected precursor of the doping element.}",
