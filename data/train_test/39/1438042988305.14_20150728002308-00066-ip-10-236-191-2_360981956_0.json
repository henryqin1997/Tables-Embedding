The annual U.S. 127 Yard Sale \u2014 also known as the World\u2019s Longest Yard Sale and/or the 127 Corridor Sale \u2014 officially gets under way Thursday and runs through Sunday. However, some vendors are already plying their wares beside the highway to serve eager buyers. Shirley Foley, who rents booth spaces at her flea market site just north of the Casey-Russell county line on U.S. 127 south of Dunnville, said on Monday that her uncle, Shearl Atwood, was already set up and serving customers. Foley said most of the vendors who have rented from her will set their items up today (Wednesday) in anticipation of the four-day sale. \u201cI\u2019ve got all my spots under shade rented, but there are still room for more outside,\u201d Foley said, adding those spots are a nominal $8 per day with the shaded spots selling for $15 per day. Foley said she ran a small ad in The Casey County News to rent her spots, which went \u201clike hotcakes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve even got my motor home rented for three nights to someone coming up here from Georgia,\u201d she said. Foley and her late husband, C.L., who passed away in October 2009, operated a flea market for years. She said C.L. always looked forward to the U.S. 127 Yard Sale, meeting and talking with people from all over the country. \u201cIt was hard to do this last year (after C.L.\u2019s death), but my kids helped me a lot, and this year, I feel better,\u201d she said. The Central Kentucky AG/EXPO Center is a hotbed of activity for the annual sale. In fact, it\u2019s so busy that Christie Edmiston, the center\u2019s director, has pre-recorded a message saying that all the spots under the shaded pavilion are gone, but there is still plenty of room outside for those who wish to set up. Blaine Staat, director of the Liberty/Casey County Chamber of Commerce, who works with Edmiston on the annual event, said the large covered and enclosed pavilion can hold 94 18-foot by 18-foot booths. Those rent for $65 for four days. The outside booths are selling for $35 for all four days, Staat said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a good place to be if you\u2019ve got your own pop-up tent,\u201d he said. Although the economy isn\u2019t the greatest, and gas prices are high, Staat said he doesn\u2019t think that will have a negative effect upon the 127 Yard Sale. \u201cI think people will still be out looking for a bargain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may affect those that travel long distances, but this is entertaining too. People still want to be entertained.\u201d Staat said even in the days of the Great Depression, people were still bargain-hunters, and he believes the times now are no different. \u201cI think there will still be as many people as we\u2019ve always had,\u201d he said. The annual U.S. 127 Yard Sale now stretches 675 miles from Hudson, Mich. to Gadsden, Ala., according to the site\u2019s official web site. Its headquarters are in Jamestown, Tenn. at the Fentress County Chamber of Commerce. The event was first held in Kentucky and Tennessee in 1987., 37459=Copyright \u00a9 2015}",
