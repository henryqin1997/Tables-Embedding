            "Gas-Cooled Plasma Arc Cutting Torch - A method and apparatus for a gas-cooled plasma arc torch. Components of the torch can include an electrode, nozzle and a shield, each of which can be gas-cooled. The nozzle can be disposed relative to the electrode and can include a generally hollow conductive body and a cooling gas flow channel defined by at least one fin disposed about an exterior surface of the body, the body providing a thermal conductive path that transfers heat between the nozzle to the cooling gas flow channel during operation of the torch. The shield can be disposed relative to the nozzle and can include a generally hollow conductive body and a cooling gas flow channel defined by at least one fin disposed about an exterior surface of the body, the body providing a thermal conductive path that transfers heat between the shield to the cooling gas flow channel during operation of the torch.",
            "PORTABLE AUTONOMOUS MATERIAL PROCESSING SYSTEM - A portable plasma arc torch system can be used for processing materials. The system includes a replaceable or rechargeable power source and replaceable or rechargeable gas source. A controller communicates with at least one of the power source or the gas source. A plasma delivery device received via the controller current from the power source and gas from the gas source to generate a plasma arc at an output of the plasma delivery device. The plasma arc can be used to process materials such as metallic workpieces. The plasma arc torch can include a wearable portable assembly which includes the replaceable or rechargeable power and gas source. A plasma delivery device receives current from the power source in the assembly and gas from the gas source in the assembly to generate a plasma arc.",
            "Forward Flow, High Access Consumables for a Plasma Arc Cutting Torch - A nozzle for a plasma arc cutting torch includes a substantially hollow, elongated body capable of receiving an electrode. The nozzle body defines a longitudinal axis and has a length along the axis from a first end of the nozzle body to a second end of the nozzle body. The nozzle also includes a plasma exit orifice disposed at the first end of the body. The first end of the nozzle body has a width and a ratio of the length of the nozzle body to the width of the nozzle body is greater than about 3.",
            "Electrode for a Contact Start Plasma Arc Torch and Contact Start Plasma Arc Torch Employing Such Electrodes - A component for a contact start plasma arc torch is provided. The component includes a hollow body defining a channel with a longitudinal axis. The channel is capable of slideably receiving an electrode body along the longitudinal axis. The component includes a contact element disposed in the hollow body and includes a first surface and a second surface. The first surface is adapted to facilitate electrical communication with a power supply and the second surface is adapted to physically contact a surface of the electrode body when the plasma arc torch is operated in a transferred arc mode. In addition, the second surface is characterized by the absence of physical contact with the surface of the electrode body when the torch is operated in a pilot arc mode.",

This enhanced sensitivity may be realized without introducing an increase in false negative alarm activation. 20110275905 Published Description Patent application number Neal Sanders, Franklin, TN US 10-03-2013 IMPROVED METHOD OF TREATING PLEURAL EFFUSION - The present invention provides methods of treating pleural effusion in a subject, comprising removing fluid from the pleural space at an increased frequency, as compared to previous methods. 20130261598 09-29-2011 CORPOREAL DRAINAGE SYSTEM - A system and method for collecting fluid from a patient is disclosed. The system includes two plates separated by restoring force providing members and straps allowing the system to be placed in expanded and compressed modes. The system is a single use system that prevents the re-use of the system once it has been drained of collected fluid. Methods for fabricating the system are also disclosed, including a method that bonds two plates together to create an assembled version of the system. 20110238022 Published Description Patent application number Monica Sanders, Oak Park, IL US //]]> BarDraw('2576397',['Patent applications by Mitchell C.

Sanders, Norwich, VT US Paul David Sanders, Boring, OR US Patent application number Description Published 20110107491 Welding Helmet Light/Strike Light - A light assembly that can be attached to virtually any welding helmet to create a well lit working area. The light emitting diode (LED) provides a bright white colored light, which is ideal while doing repair welds, fabrication, and the like. The adjustable light enables the welder to position the light as needed. The product substantially eliminates the need to work in poorly lit conditions by providing welders with the lighting means for starting their welds and inspecting their work, without the need to raise and lower their helmet. 05-12-2011 Robert Sanders, Grangeville, ID US Patent application number Description Published 20100083995 Air mattress with inflatable canopy - A sleeping bag having a mattress comprising a bottom insulating water-proof layer, which rests upon ground or camping surface.
