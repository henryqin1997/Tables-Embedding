            "I may be a little bias considering I am a member of Greek life but I think the Greek community at SDSU is amazing. It may not be the biggest but we are a tight knit community within a bigger community. There are three Sororities: Alpha Xi Delta, Chi Omega, and Ceres and six Fraternities: Alpha Gamma Rho, Farm House, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Phi Delta, Delta Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Everyone has a unique group of people and most anybody can find a group to get along with.",
            "SDSU has a club for everyone, there is everything from pre professionals club to skydiving club. Whatever your interest may be SDSU probably has a club for you!",
            "SDSU has one thing that no other school has. Hobo Days. Hobo Days is our homecoming everyone dresses up like hobos and people come from all over the state to watch the parade and football game.it is really a week long celebration that has the dorms fraternities and sororities competing against each other in various spirit activities.",
            "SDSU is very inexpensive but you get all the advantages of a big university, we are a division one school so you get to experience the fun of the football games and basketball games. The education you receive nowhere parallel to the price you pay. The things I've learned and the experiences I've had far outweigh the price.",
            "There are a lot of things to do at SDSU. Since I was there all of the time I got to experience a lot of them. on the weekend UPC holds programs called weekend stuff it ranges from movies to bingo. They are a lot of fun and a great way to meet new people. There is also random things to do on the weekdays all held by UPC such as concerts and comedians, all free.",
            "Not going to lie, the food on campus could definitely be better. But SDSU is adding in panda express, and Chick Fil A which will definitely help. There are a lot of choices for food so if one thing is not your favorite you have other choices.",
            "Dorm life at SDSU for me was amazing it doesn't matter what dorm you live in, i lived in Brown Hall and Mathews Hall, brown was known for being cheep and the bathrooms weren't the most pleasant places but the people i met and the memories i made completely made up for everything. Mathews hall is the honors/pre professional/engineering hall, it was really nice to be surrounded by people with similar majors to you and who could help you with anything you needed.",
            "This is really dependant on the classes you take. My freshman year I took rather difficult classes, with a few more simple ones thrown in here and there but college is nothing like high school, there is no required homework to keep you on top of things. You really need to go to class everyday, keep on it with the course work and definitely study.",
            "My suggestions are get to know your professors, your advisers, and your lab TA's and interns. they will be so helpful be it from writing letters of recommendations to helping to answer questions. Your advisor is always there for you and will help you through anything. As for your professors putting in that extra effort will really show them how interested in that subject you are and they will be more helpful when you go to them. Finally, take advantage of study sessions, SI, and tutoring, you may think you understand something but it never hurts to get that extra explanation.",
            "SDSU is my home away from home. Everyone here is so nice, the teachers are always here for you and willing to help you learn. The campus is beautiful, in the summer there is green grass and flowers everywhere and in the winter a fresh coat of snow is on top of everything and makes it so pretty."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23641=Although the dorm rooms are small, SDSU has made a conscious effort to increase not only the amount of dorms available to students, but also the quality. As of 2011, there were 3 brand new dorms on campus, and they are adding 3 more for this upcoming 2012 fall semester. You can choose to live either by yourself or with a roommate., 341065=Campus is generally pretty safe, but the security is not particularly responsive and the emergency contact points on campus are often out of order. While violence is uncommon on campus, there was a rapist who attacked on campus in 2009., 169281=South Dakota State University is an absolutely great school! The class sizes on average are about 25:1 except for lectures which are a bit bigger, but you still get to know the teachers very well and they are always willing to help out. Also campus activities are abundant, seriously there is something for everyone; from skydiving club to colleges against cancer, and intramural in just about every sport., 19178=There were a couple of attacks in 2010, but the man was caught and he was not an SDSU student. Since, they have started programs around campus to better campus security. The dorms are locked past a certain time and only residents of that dorm can get into the building, there are also escorts you can call to walk around campus with you after dark if you don't feel safe. Overall the campus is well lit and the student body is friendly., 110621=The food is really good! But the selection sometimes gets really repetitive. However, they are in the process of putting in 3 new eating places also to be completed by fall 2013. Also, we have the famous SDSU ice cream where they actually invented the flavor cookies'n'cream!, 194805=There are not many choices at SDSU and the options are limited. However, they are building two new eating places that will be opened in fall of 2013., 247352=As mentioned, the school has many clubs with many activities inside the clubs, but when winter comes (last from late November to early April), most have to take place inside, but they still manage to hold the activities well., 23098=SDSU has expanded the Student Union vastly since I first enrolled in 2010. There are coffee and bagel shops, cafeteria style as well as restaurant style dining options. As of this upcoming year they are also adding some popular fast food options to the Union., 268481=South Dakota State has a tradition of hobos. We have a whole week in October dedicated to our homecoming and it's name is: Hobo Week while the actual day of the football game is: Hobo Day. Many traditions live on through celebrating being a hobo and a Jack Rabbit. During Hobo Week, you are encouraged to dress in ratty clothes, grow a beard (for men), sleep over in cardboard houses and bum a meal with your friends. It's a fabulous tradition that will carry on for many years to come!, 151383=One unusual tradition that is celebrated here every year is hobo days. Everyone dresses up as a hobo and just has fun. We even have a statue of a hobo next to our union for everyone to share in the tradition. I haven't attended one yet, but it isn't until the end of October., 368233=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students Try to get into the Grove Area dorms; Pierson, Mathews, Brown or Larson Area dorms Binnewies and Young. They're close to the Union and all the activity on campus. Plus, the bathrooms and Larson Commons dining area are newly renovated. Bang for the buck It's really nicely priced and if one is looking for easy classes and a social climate like high school, it's a great place to be. Am enjoying being here There is nothing to do off campus and nobody keeps their doors open in the residence halls. It",
