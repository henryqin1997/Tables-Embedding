Version 3.4 was released September 19, which is the same day as 10.8.2, so I suspect the last 10.8.1 compatible version was 3.3.2, released July 25. I'd appreciate if, anyone has a link to the updater for the latest version that is compatible, with 10.8.1. However, for Aperture, I downloaded the trial, and then used my serials from 2 and 3.",
