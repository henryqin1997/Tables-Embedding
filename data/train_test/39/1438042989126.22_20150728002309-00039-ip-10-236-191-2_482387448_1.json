This is not to say that his prejudices are incorrect, but rather that the book is repetative, dull and pointless. He has his elevator speech done- a half-page magazine article would have done the trick. Also, I think he fails in his thinking when he cuts off biology at the neck, focusing only on dopamine and other brain issues. He cites several examples which may have far more to do with the stomich. For example, teen girls no longer reduce their eating after being given a high-sugar drink as they used to. He points out that the effect is stronger in females than males, and fails to notice that teen girls have a very high rate of pre-diatetes today. In other words, reactive hypoglycemia may play into this change. He also notices that French are now snacking like they did not do in the past. They are also moving away from their high-fat, high-protein diet (which the high-carb advocating health researchers have puzzled over being so healthy for them) to a higher-carb \"American\" style diet which requires frequent eating. Again, that is about insulin and not about dopamine (or about dopamine merely secondary to insulin). And his final advice is neither interesting nor novel. A quarter page in a women's magazine would have gotten the main points. ...more",

My take-home message from Gladwell is always a positive sense of- you can do it! He always takes what you think are the \"rules\" of success and shows how people manage to make an end run around them. In this case it is the 10,000 hour rule- want to be good at something, do it for 10,000 hours.
