    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{127896=A polar diagram of the BSE angular distribution for primary electrons incident on the substrate surface at an angle \u03c6=80\ufffd to the surface normal is shown on p. 147 of Reimer, L., Scanning Electron Microscopy, 2nd ed., Springer-Verlag, 1998, ISBN 3-540-63976-4. For gold, the BSE angular distribution is generally centered around the specular reflection angle to the surface. As the primary beam energy is increased, the angular distribution becomes narrower, remaining centered around the specular reflection angle. The scattering distributions are also narrower for lower atomic number substrates., 127239=An example of an energy spectrum of BSEs against the ratio E/EB, where E=the BSE energy and EB=the energy of the primary electron beam (20 keV), is shown on p. 149 of Reimer, L., Scanning Electron Microscopy, 2nd ed., Springer-Verlag, 1998, ISBN 3-540-63976-4. Typically, graphs of the BSE energy spectrum against the ratio E/EB found in the literature show that the majority of BSEs have energies near the primary beam energy. For higher atomic number (Z) materials, the graph shows that the energy distributions of BSEs are more concentrated near the primary beam energy., 38979=Another requirement for electron beam testing of substrates, such as those used in the manufacture of LCD displays, is to be able to use the primary electron beam as a probe of the voltage on the surface of the substrate. This is possible if one of the signals is a monotonically-varying function of the surface voltage. The reason why it is necessary for the signal to be monotonic is to maintain a 1:1 mapping between the detected signal and the surface voltage\u2014if the curve is not monotonic (i.e., the curve has the same signal level for N different surface voltage levels, where N>1), then there will be an N:1 mapping between possible values of the surface voltage and the detected signal and it will not be possible to determine the surface voltage unambiguously, as is familiar to those skilled in the art. A related requirement is for the signal to be a nearly-linear function of the voltage on the surface of the substrate\u2014this requirement arises from the need to achieve the same signal-to-noise ratio, independent of the surface charging voltage. If the signal varies only a small amount for a large change in the surface voltage, then the signal-to-noise ratio will be low, while a large change in signal for a small change in the surface voltage will give a high signal-to-noise ratio. Generally, it is desirable to maintain approximately the same signal-to-noise ratio throughout the surface charging voltage range to obtain the same precision in the measured values of the surface voltage. Thus, there is a need to configure the design of the detector optics to make the SE detection efficiency a monotonically-varying and nearly-linear function of the surface voltage., 37052=This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described above in terms of specific embodiments, it is anticipated that alterations and modifications thereof will no doubt become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is therefore intended that the following claims be interpreted as covering all such alterations and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. . However, it is also possible to implement the dual detector concept of the present invention in cylindrical symmetry such as that found in conventional single-beam electron optical systems, where the axis of cylindrical symmetry would be coincident with the axis of the primary electron beam. An example of a cylindrical optics system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,777,675 B2, issued Aug. 17, 2004, and in U.S. Patent Application Publication #2005/0001165 A1, published Jan. 6, 2005, both incorporated by reference herein. In a cylindrically-symmetrical embodiment, the SEFC electrode would comprise a single plate with a through hole, a small countersink on the surface facing the substrate, and a larger countersink on the surface away from the substrate. The design of the FFT electrode would comprise a single through hole, with a complex shape (determined by an iterative design optimization procedure) at the lower end. The SE and BSE detectors would comprise two small square or rectangular shapes. In a cylindrically-symmetric embodiment, the primary beam would pass down through the hole in the FFT, through",
