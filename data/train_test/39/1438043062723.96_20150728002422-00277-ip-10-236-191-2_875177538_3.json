    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{99586=10/15/14: The Wild took a huge step forward last season, not just making the playoffs as a wild card, but by ousting the Central Division champion Colorado Avalanche in the first round, then giving the Chicago Blackhawks all they could handle in the second round. They opened up the 2014-15 season looking to build off that success and started off with a strong statement to the rest of the league. They dominated the Avalanche and skated off with an impressive 5-0 victory. While it is only one game, the Wild look like they are ready to move up into the discussion of elite NHL teams., 45582=Minnesota Wild tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of the NHL's newest franchises begin to write its own history. Established in 2000, the Minnesota Wild joined the National Hockey League as an expansion team along with the Columbus Blue Jackets. The Wild play their games at Xcel Energy Center and have called the venue home since it opened in 2000. Watch as the Wild build a new legacy and work to bring a Stanley Cup to Minnesota!, 104089=1/7/15: The Minnesota Wild looked poised to build off their break through in the Stanley Cup playoffs last season, but this season's campaign has been a disappointment to say the least. The Wild are a talented team and even posted a positive record through the end of the 2014 calendar year at 17-14-4. However, Minnesota has struggled on the road with a mediocre 8-10 record, and that is a big reason why they are in sixth in the Central Division and well out of playoff position. At the same time, they are great at home with a 9-4-4 record, which they can improve upon this week when they host the two top teams in the Central: Chicago on Thursday and Nashville on Saturday., 83037=3/27/14: The Wild have quietly put together a pretty solid season to date and are currently in line for a playoff spot. Through their first 70 games, the Wild have compiled a 36-23-11 record, good for 83 points and the seventh spot. They likely cannot catch their more acclaimed rivals (St. Louis, Chicago, and Colorado), but seem firmly entrenched with their nearest non-playoff foe (Dallas) a good eight points back. The Wild have slumped a bit as of late, going only 4-2-4 in their past 10 games, and indeed the streaking Coyotes have a chance to catch them. However, it looks like Minnesota will be in the playoffs for the second year in a row., 90976=6/26/14: Matt Moulson may be one of the most underrated players heading into free agency. Only seven players have scored 135 goals or more since 2009, and Moulson, a three time 30 goal scorer, is one of those. He split time between the Islanders, Sabres and Wild. His agent, Wade Arnott, says that there is no news about a new contract for him, so he may be waiting until July 1 to test free agency. Certainly someone will put out a little too much money to land him. But with all the talk about Jason Spezza and Joe Thornton, he seems like he is the forgotten man right now., 82371=3/20/14: The Wild drew rave reviews for winning the free agent sweepstakes in the summer of 2012 by signing the top two free agents available: defenseman Ryan Suter and center Zach Parise. The goal, of course, was to build a competitive team that could go deep in the playoffs. A lot of big name and big money free agent signings do not pay off, but this one has so far. The Wild made the playoffs last season as an 8 seed and are in control this season for one of the two wild card spots available. They have just one regulation loss in their last 10 games and will be in the postseason if they continue this pace., 95168=8/14/14: For the most part, the Minnesota Wild are planning on heading into the 2014-15 season with pretty much the same squad that got them into the second round of the playoffs last season. The Wild were one of two wild card teams last season in the West (Dallas was the other). They shocked the Central Division champs Colorado Avalanche in a thrilling seven game series and nearly did the same to the Chicago Blackhawks. If nothing else, they have proven that they are the fourth elite team in the Central Division and everyone else is on notice., 98982=10/8/14: Defenseman Nate Prosser was not unemployed very long. The St. Louis Blues, who have a logjam of defensemen, waived Prosser early in the week, but the Wild picked him up almost right away. Prosser has history with Minnesota. He signed with them as an undrafted free agent in 2009 and spent five years in the organization - playing in over 100 games. It remains to be seen what type of role he will play with the Wild. Minnesota now has 11 defensemen on the roster, and that is four or five more than they will take into the regular season., 108876=3/4/15: The Minnesota Wild made a good move to bolster their lineup prior to the trade deadline. The Wild acquired veteran forward Sean Bergenehim and a 2016 seventh round pick from the Florida Panthers for a third round draft pick in 2016. The Panthers seemed to be looking to trade Bergenheim as he was a healthy scratch for his last six games. However, he had been productive this season with 18 goals in 39 games and good for 14 minutes a night. On the surface, it looks like the Wild got the better end of this deal and Bergenheim could be a great asset for the playoff push., 64958=9/4/13: The Minnesota Wild and their fans should have plenty of reason for optimism going into the 2013-14 season. The team boasts a very strong top line with Zach Parise, Jason Pomminville, and Mikka Koivu. Their top two defensemen, Ryan Suter and Jonas Brodin, are quite solid, not to mention veteran Kieth Ballard. This group will be relied upon to keep a rather green team focused throughout the season. The Wild made the playoffs last season, but were bounced in the first round by Chicago. With another year of experience, this may be the season that the Wild truly break out., 105899=1/28/15: It has been a tough few weeks for the Minnesota Wild and hopefully they used their time off during the All Star break to get back to where they should be. The Wild are just 2-6-2 in their last 10 games and have slipped into last place win the Central Division. However, with new goaltender Devan Dubnyk, they may be able to rebound because they certainly have playoff talent. In other news, the NHL announced the Wild would host a Stadium Series game against the Chicago Blackhawks (not the Dallas Stars) next season. The game will be February 21, 2016 at TCF Bank Stadium., 63060=8/15/13: The Wild made the jump last year from middling lower tier Western Conference team to playoff participant. While they only earned an eighth seed, and only won one game in their series against the eventual Stanley Cup winning Chicago Blackhawks, they did make the tournament. By that measure, their aggressive campaign in the 2012 free agency (where they signed the top two free agents: Zach Parise and Ryan Suter to identical $100 million contracts) was successful. Now it is time to move further up the ladder. The West will continue to be ultra competitive, but there may be room for advancement now that Detroit and Columbus are in the East., 46257=4/17/12: The Wild can use help everywhere in the offseason, as in score more and allow less. The team averaged just over 2 goals per game and surrendered 2.65. But help could be coming soon in the form of young prospects. 2010 second round pick Jason Zucker played the final six games, notching two assists. Johann Larson is excelling in the Sweedish Elite League and has a legitimate shot at making the Wild next season. The team may also pursue Minnesota native Zach Parise (Devils) and Ryan Suter (Predators) in free agency. Additionally, the Wild are working on an extension for GM Chuck Fletcher., 58583=4/18/13: Minnesota has its first chance to get into the playoffs in several years. The team is playing very well, and the infusion of the top free agents (hometowner Zach Parise and Ryan Suter) seem to be paying off. The Wild probably will not overtake Vancouver for the top spot in the Northwest, but should find themselves playing in May - which is really what this fan base needs. What they do not need is to be matched up against the St. Louis Blues who seem to have their number in every game. The Wild must, must figure out a way to generate more offense., 54396=11/15/12: Charlotte has opened up a four point lead in the standings over Houston, five over Oklahoma City, and 10 over San Antonio early in the 2012-13 season. The logical assumption is that this would be NBA standings, but that would mean that Michael Jordan was making good executive and personnel decisions. No, this is the AHL, and the Wild's affiliate, the Houston Aeros are in second place in the South Division with 15 points so far. That the minor league team is doing well should not be surprising. The Wild have a wealth of talented prospects developing for the NHL game, which bodes well for the franchise in the future., 78532=2/6/14: The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia are right around the corner. NHL teams may never say it, but they probably do not like their best players going half way around the globe to play exhibition games and possibly getting injured or getting very tired. Regardless of that notion, the Wild have something to be proud of. Zach Parise will be the captain of Team USA. That is an extraordinary honor, and hopefully Parise will lead the team to the Gold Medal. Also, Wild defenseman Ryan Suter has been name as an alternate captain - which is still a great honor., 94600=8/7/14: If there is one thing to know about the Western Conference as opposed to the Eastern Conference in the NHL, it is that Western Conference generally has much bigger players than their Eastern counterparts. So it makes sense that the Wild are bring back huge defenseman Justin Falk into the fold. He was drafted by the Wild in 2007 and spent four years in the Wild organization. He was with the Rangers last season. However, Clayton Stoner is now with Anaheim, and that opened up a spot for the Wild to bring back Falk on a one year deal., 62390=8/8/13: David Piole, the general manager of the Nashville Predators who is moonlighting as the GM for the U.S. Olympic Hockey team recently referred to Wild players Zack Parise and Ryan Suter as the most important pieces to the team for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Both signed with the Wild last summer to roughly $100 million contracts - Parise had been with the New Jersey Devils, and Suter was from Nashville, ironically. Additionally, Mikko Koivu, Niklas Backstrom, and Mikael Granlund are working out with Team Finland while Jonas Brodin has been invited to Sweden's camp and Nino Niederreiter is expected to play for the Swiss again., 97148=9/17/14: The Wild seem to have an interesting contract dispute going on with goaltender Darcy Keumper, who played pretty well down the stretch and into the playoffs last season. But he seems like the odd man out for a goalie position this season. That will not be the case for Nino Niederreiter. The team and the player agreed to a three year deal reportedly worth $8 million. He was the fifth overall pick of the 2010 draft and finished his first full year with the Wild. But the guy played well in the playoffs and scored two goals and one assist in Game 7 of the first round against the Avalanche., 69186=10/24/13: It is long believed that forward Tomas Vanek wants out of Buffalo and it appears that his desired destination is the Minnesota Wild. Vanek drove his friend Jason Pominville to the airport when Pominville was traded from the Sabres to the Wild last April, and Vanek would fit in well with his skill set and salary obligations. Minnesota will likely part ways with Dany Heatly during or after this season, and Vanek would be a clear upgrade. Adding Vanek would certainly help the Wild's offense. However, this is not a deal yet, and Edmonton is rumored to be interested in Vanek as well., 48741=5/16/12: The names on the top of the Wild's free agent wish list are rumored to be the Devils' star (and Minneapolis native) Zach Parise and Predators defenseman Ryan Suter. The Wild want to develop an atmosphere that star players want to join - but that, of course, requires consistent winning over several years. The Wild started off 2011-12 very well - at the top fo the league. Unfortunately, a rash of injuries set in, resulting in the team losing over 400 man-games, and ultimately any playoff hopes. A return to health will make the team competitive again, and some star players could put them over the top., 100889=10/29/14: The Wild made waves two plus years ago when they signed the top two free agents available - Ryan Suter and Zach Parise - to be the foundation for the franchise. That move has paid off in playoff appearances and actually getting to the second round last season. The team must have determined that forward Charlie Coyle is a core member as well. They signed him to a five year contract extension worth $16 million. That will keep him in a Wild uniform through the 2019-20 season. Minnesota is off to a decent start with a couple of wins and a couple of losses, but they should be there at the end of the season when it counts., 58004=3/28/13: The Wild have been playing much better of late, pulling even with the Vancouver Canucks for first place in the Northwest Division. Minnesota and San Jose drew the Saturday afternoon game, which gave them the chance to get in front of a national audience. However, it is March Madness time, so that may have been a wash. In any case, the Wild shutout the San Jose Sharks 2-0, and even got a goal from Ryan Suter. Suter does not have many points this year, but is among the league leaders in ice time and playing great defense - what the team should expect from one of their $100 million men., 109452=3/11/15: By now, all of the NHL and hockey fans know about Wild goaltender Devan Dubnyk. He has single-handedly saved the Wild's season and put them back into playoff contention. The Wild certainly know this and are leaning on Dubnyk. Hard. Last Friday was his 23 consecutive game. That is an awful lot on a goalie and risks fatiguing the netminder. If he is getting tired, it is not showing since Dubnyk has not given up more than two goals in a single game since February 16. The Wild are home on Friday to host Anaheim then south to St. Louis on Saturday., 107144=2/11/15: The Minnesota Wild have done an excellent job of righting the ship over the last few weeks after their disastrous December slump threatened to wreck the season. The addition of goaltender Devan Dubnyk cannot be understated at this point, though the Wild still have a ways to go to get back into playoff contention. Unfortunately, that hill got a little bit steeper last week with the news that defenseman Matt Cooke will be out six weeks with a sports hernia injury. Cooke has missed much of the season so far and is only averaging 13 minutes per game, so it is very feasible that his absence will not have much affect., 76674=1/16/14: With Claude Noel out of Winnipeg, many people may think that Mike Yeo may be the next head coach fired in the NHL. After signing the top two free agents in 2012 (defenseman Ryan Suter and center Zack Parise), many believe that the Wild are underachieving. A closer look tells a different story. The Wild are currently in line for a playoff birth. That is saying something considering how strong the Western Conference is. They also play in a division with Chicago, St. Louis, and Colorado - three elite teams. While they may not win the division, anything can happen in the playoffs.}",
