No. 797,929, filed May 18, 1977, for Amorphous Semiconductor Member and Method of Making the Same., 53106=To minimize the aforementioned problems involved with amorphous silicon and germanium, W. E. Spear and P. G. Le Comber of Carnegie Laboratory of Physics, University of Dundee, in Dundee, Scotland, did some work on \"Substutional Doping of Amorphous Silicon,\" as reported in a paper published in Solid State Communications, Vol. 17, pp. 1193-1196, 1975, toward the end of reducing the localized states in the energy gap in the amorphous silicon or germanium to make the same approximate more closely intrinsic crystalline silicon or germanium and of substitutionally doping said amorphous materials with suitable classic dopants, as in doping crystalline materials, to make them more extrinsic and of p or n conduction types. This was accomplished by glow discharge deposition where in a gas of silane (SiH4) and a gas of phosphine (PH3) for n-type conduction, or a gas of diborane (B2 H6) for p-type conduction, were premixed and passed through a reaction tube where the gaseous mixture was decomposed by an r.f. glow discharge and deposited on a substrate at high substrate temperature of about 500\ufffd-500\ufffd K. The material so deposited on the substrate is an amorphous material consisting of silicon and up to about 30 percent hydrogen (silicon hydride) and substitutional phosphorus or boron in dopant concentrations between about 5\ufffd10-6 and 10-2 parts per volume., 93450=The illustrative and stylized curves of FIG. 5 graphically point up one of the major features of this invention, the curves plotting electrical conductivity \u03c3[\u03a9cm]-1 against inverse temperature 1000/T[\ufffdK]-1. The unmodified amorphous semiconductor material in the amorphous host matrix has electrical configurations which have an energy gap E04 and a large electrical activation energy E.sub.\u03c3 and since such unmodified material is intrinsic, its electrical activation energy E.sub.\u03c3 is substantially one-half the energy gap E04. Here, for example, the energy gap is 1.5 and the electrical activation energy E.sub.\u03c3 is 0.75 eV as shown by curve 35. When modifier material is added to the amorphous semiconductor material, the intrinsic unmodified semiconductor material is converted or changed at will to an extrinsic material to stable extrinsic levels as shown by the dotted curves 36 in FIG. 5 depending upon the amount of addition of the modified material, with a corresponding decrease in electrical activation energy E.sub.\u03c3 until, for example, an electrical activation energy E.sub.\u03c3 of 0.02 eV is reached as indicated by the curve 37 in FIG. 5. With these stable extrinsic levels, the electrical conductivity at room temperature (and above) \u03c3RT [\u03a9cm]-1 is correspondingly increased as shown by the intersection of the room temperature line 38 with the curves 35, 36 and 37 in FIG. 5. Thus, the unmodified amorphous semiconductor material, which is basically intrinsic, by the addition of selected amounts of modifier material, can be converted at will to a material, which is basically extrinsic, and having stable extrinsic levels at room temperature and above having desired electrical activation energies E.sub.\u03c3 which are decreased and desired electrical conductivities \u03c3RT which are increased in accordance with the amount of modifier material added to the amorphous semiconductor material. A wide design range of activation energy and electrical conductivity can be engineered into the amorphous semiconductor member to meet desired electrical parameters., 88029=The sputtering machine is first evacuated to a vacuum pressure somewhat less than about 6\ufffd10-6 Torr to provide a background vacuum pressure. Argon is bled into the machine to provide an operating pressure of about 5\ufffd10-3 Torr as determined by a reading on a Pirani vacuum gauge, giving an actual vacuum pressure of about 7\ufffd10-3 Torr in the machine. The surface of the cathode or target and pieces of modifier material are first cleaned by sputtering against the shutter of the machine adjacent to the substrates for about 30 minutes. Thereafter, the shutter is opened and the semiconductor material of the target and the pieces of modifier material on the target are cosputtered onto the substrates. The cathode or target and the holder for the substrates are both water cooled so that the temperatures thereof are low during the sputtering operation, below the melting or crystalline or glass transition temperatures of the materials. The r.f. power of the machine may have a frequency of about 13.56 MegaHertz, and about 1000 Volts of forward power, about 50-70 Watts being utilized for a 3.5\" diameter cathode or target.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While for purposes of illustration several forms of this invention have been disclosed, other forms thereof may become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reference to this disclosure, and, therefore, this invention is to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. In view of the foregoing illustrative examples, it is seen that the amorphous semiconductor members of this invention can be readily designed or tailor-made to provide the same with desired physical and electrical properties for the fabrication of many different devices for many different applications of usage. Substitutional doping is made possible in tetrahedral materials by providing almost all of the nearest-neighbor sites local environments of the tetrahedral type. This is true in both the crystalline material and the glow discharge amorphous silicon. The present invention allows for far more nearest-neighbor bonding choices. This is a more normal result of amorphicity. The great number of these varied orbital and bonding relationships make irrelevant the substitution of one atom into a regularly spaced matrix. What is required is to take into account the multibonding possibilities and utilize them by modification to control conductivity. Not only is boron a good example of the multiorbital possibilities in the amorphous phase, but also the carbon atom, just as it does in organic materials, offers these multiorbital interactions with other inorganic materials. Therefore, it is the nonprimary bonding which is the important aspect of this",
