            "We get the occasional email about a theft or a robbery, but it's usually only once a semester. Denton is pretty safe and the UNT police do a good job of making sure no mayhem ensues during events.",
            "Lots of greeks and lots of greek activity. I'm not involved, but they seem nice.",
            "Student Gov't is huge here, as are service organizations and music events. There is never nothing going on. And sometimes there's free food!",
            "Fine arts: music, art, dance. Also liberal arts and business students. Expect weird people and lots of hipsters. But I have never met a Denton-ite I didn't like, honest uncle.",
            "The school mascot is an eagle, so on the rare occasion the football team scores (although it's getting better), we all form claws with our hands and hold them up. Also, there's a lot of caw-ing. It's weird.",
            "SO MUCH BANG FOR YOUR BUCK! This school is Texas' best kept secret! 4 academically rigorous years at a cheap(er) state school with a massive alum base to hire you after graduation? We are so lucky to go here!",
            "The Square (our downton) is a nice walk from campus and there's tons of little shops and restaurants or bars to explore. Or you could sprawl out on the big lawn in front of the courthouse and study or read or play frisbee or whatever you feel like. There always seems to be some sort of protest or demonstration going on, and those are always pretty entertaining. And even though UNT is by no means a party school, somebody somewhere will have a house party on a weekend. For those who are 21+, Fry Street houses our array of local watering holes! The mall has a $2 movie theater and it's on a bus route so people without cars can get there on weekdays. And because it's Denton, someone always has a gig. On any given night you can find somebody making music. Go to those.",
            "Avoid at all costs. As a freshman you're pretty much required to have a meal plan; stick to the salad bar. Seriously. Make friends with someone who has a car and get them to take you grocery shopping so you can stock up on oreos and pb&j, because campus food is not something you should ever put in your body. Also, try to avoid the Freshman 15.",
            "Every dorm has its own personality! The majority of your friends when you move to a new place come from where you live, and UNT is no exception. It sounds cliche, but there really is a place for absolutely everybody to fit in here.",
            "The UNT College of Music is like boot camp for musicians. If you think you're good enough, you're wrong. Ray Charles isn't good enough for the UNT CoM. But you make your bed and lie in it, and when you graduate you have a tight group of friends and an alum base that will hire you anywhere you want to be. UNT has one of the highest post-grad employment rates in the country because we push our students so hard there's just no way you don't come out great at what you do. But don't expect to sleep much. Sleep is for slackers and bums.",
            "Get a bicycle! Denton is an adorable town and almost everything you need is a bike ride away. Fall and spring are particularly beautiful, so invest in a good pair of flip flops and a frisbee.",
            "February is a spring month, why is there snow? My class wasn't uphill when I was on time last Monday... HOW IS IT FINALS ALREADY????"

They offer many different styles of cafeterias such as, an all vegan hall, a Cajun hall, a general foods hall, and many others. We have many places to eat on campus and some high dollar places like Starbucks., 58465=As I am in pursuit of my B.A.A.S. degree, UNT has excellent programs that accept my credits earned at a Technical College. I am looking forward to attending in the Fall of 2009. Everyone I have met at the campus is friendly and very helpful., 867393=February is a spring month, why is there snow? My class wasn't uphill when I was on time last Monday... HOW IS IT FINALS ALREADY????, 380469=I have attended UNT since Spring 2012 including Summer after having transferred from a junior college. I attend evening classes and had been working fulltime until now. As a result I am not very involved with lot's of campus activities, my review may be limited in some aspects., 383158=There are so many things on campus to do for fun, but the Union at the 1 o'clock lounge is the place to be on campus., 755652=A variety to choose from. There is cajun cafeterias, vegan cafeterias, as well as the standard ones., 214768=unt might not have the same prestige as smu, but it is still very nice, and certainly much cheaper. expect to pay about $1300 per 4 hour class (including fees, texts, etc.). financial aid seems kind of lacking, but the fa office claims it is temporarily short on funding., 408856=UNT is the best decision I have every made! I will be graduating this December with a Bachelors in Psychology and Minor in Spanish. Its diverse, comfortable, and its a awesome school!, 449420=I do not know yet. I will start in August., 51814=well lit, unt shuttle buses run all over campus and town until like 10:30, and emergency stations are numerous., 873635=Every April there is a 12 hour concert in one of the dorms (Bruce Hall) called Bruce Jam. This concert is open to everyone and features student bands. Bruce Hall also host a haunted house every October/, 938232=If you look around, there is usually something to do every day. I'm more of a hermit and keep to my room, but I hear about a lot of different things. Andy Grammar even did a concert here the other week! Most things are free too!, 1149997=UNT is great on traditions like the Mean Green Victory march after winning football games., our Alma Mater chant at Football games. Fraternity Bid Day marches around campus in the Fall and Spring. The campus bell that rings a nice little tune every hour on the hour. And certainly the unforgettable Eagle CAWH that anyone can throw up at a given time to show school spirit., 22038=Make sure you like where you will be living first and if you need a job apply in June or July. If you don't like noise don't stay in a dorm. Best freshmen halls for walking to class are Kerr and Maple as they have food for first thing in the morning and bus stops right in front of them. Also DON'T DO MORNING CLASSES!!! It's not like high school 8am because at least there you can go to bed before oh say... midnight?}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The location of this campus, Denton, can be extremely dull at times, but the overall atmosphere of the school is gorgeous. On top of that, there is such a variety of students, you will never have trouble looking for the right crowd to fit in with. Am learning a lot Overall, the University of North Texas is a very accredited institution. However, every now and then you will find a blow off class or professor that might be alot easier/harder than others at the same level.
