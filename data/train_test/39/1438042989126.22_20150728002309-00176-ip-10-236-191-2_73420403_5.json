This section describes Oracle and non-Oracle (third-party) databases that are certified for use with SQL Developer. 1.6 Database Certification for SQL Developer (Oracle and Third-Party) If you want to prevent other users from accessing your user-specific SQL Developer information, you must ensure that the appropriate permissions are set on the directory where that information is stored or on a directory above it in the path hierarchy. For example, on a Windows system you may want to ensure that the SQL Developer folder and the \\<user-name>\\Application Data\\SQL Developer folder under Documents and Settings are not shareable;",

Both the JDBC OCI and the JDBC Thin drivers support at least some of the Oracle Advanced Security features. If you are using the OCI driver, you can set relevant parameters in the same way that you would in any Oracle client setting. The JDBC Thin driver supports the Oracle Advanced Security features through a set of Java classes included with the JDBC classes in a Java Archive (JAR) file and supports security parameter settings through Java properties objects. 1.8 Finding SQL Developer Accessibility Information For the latest configuration information or for information on addressing accessibility and assistive technology issues, see the Oracle Accessibility FAQ at http://www.oracle.com/accessibility/faq.html.
