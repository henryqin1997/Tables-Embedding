            "Private school can cost a lot (usually in the form of loans) but Macalester is committed to meeting the financial need of all its students, so for low-income folks, it can be a good deal. It's a great school academically, but not necessarily the path to the highest paid positions.",

    "textAfterTable": "Food and Dining If you have any dietary restrictions, Mac is very accomodating. There are always vegan and gluten-free options, and the catering staff is very accessible if you have further concerns. Don't go into school here expecting a diet of cheese pizza, mac&cheese, and ramen--Cafe Mac never serves it. Very nice selection of healthy foods, amazing salad bar (feta cheese and kalamata olive amazing!), wide variety of foods, and nice variation throughout the week. My only complaint would be about their policies surrounding the cafe. You aren't allowed to take food or coffee out of the Cafe (except pastries and fruit), and if you want to downsize your meal plan they don't offer you a lot of other options, but still charge you the same price. As far as I know, these things are being worked on at this time, however. Dorm Life I was placed in a single my first year on campus. At first I was kind of crushed about it, but Mac does a really great job at including everyone and creating a welcoming community environment. Making friends was really easy, and I wouldn't consider myself an extremely social person normally! I really love my dorm community and have had a great time bonding with my floormates as well as meeting people from other communities. Dupre doesn't have sinks,",
