No. 414,216 filed Sept. 2, 1982 now U.S. Pat. No. 4,483,941., 54907=A catalyst was prepared in two components. The first component prepared by reacting 10 grams(g) of BF3 with 100 grams of alcohol containing from 12 to 14 carbon atoms (ALFOL 1214, trademark of and sold by Conoco Inc.) The second component was prepared by introducing 60 cubic centimeters (cc) of 0.593M aluminum triethyl in hexane into 100 gram 12 to 14 alcohol. Hexane was subsequently removed by rotary evaporation. Both the first component (0.0175 gram) and in the second component (5.7 gram) were introduced into a stainless steel reactor together with 120 grams of 12 to 14 carbon atom alcohol. After purging with nitrogen at 400 cc per minute for 30 minutes, an alkoxylation was carried out at 170\ufffd C. and 40 psig ethylene oxide partial pressure, which was maintained throughout the reaction. Under these conditions, 1.22 moles of ethylene oxide (EO) per mole of alcohol was introduced in 130 minutes. Residual free alcohol in the product was 13.7 weight percent. In contrast, the ethoxylated product produced by BF3 catalyst at the same EO/alcohol mole ratio yielded free alcohol levels of 24%., 56633=An alcohol with 12 to 14 carbon atoms (ALFOL 1214, 300 g) was ethoxylated as in Example 1, with 2.0 g SiF4 and 10 cc of 0.593M triethylaluminum in hexane as a catalyst mixture. The product after 145 minutes of reaction contained 2.68 mol EO per mol alcohol. The ethylene oxide distribution obtained is compared with that obtained with BF3 catalyst in table 1., 58771=A series of reactions was carried out to determine the effect of metal alkoxide addition to BF3 as an alkoxylation catalyst. Alcohols of various molecular weight were ethoxylated. (ALFOL 1412 molecular weight 205.5; ALFOL 6 molecular weight 1033, a six carbon atom alcohol and ALFOL 610 molecular weight 134.3/, a six to ten carbon atom alcohol, all trademarks of and sold by Conoco Inc.). All reactions were carried out in the same fashion as the following specific reaction.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While certain embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating this invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Alkoxylation of an alcohol containing from 12 to 14 carbon atoms was attempted using an aluminum alkoxide catalyst under the conditions of Example 1. No alkoxylation occurred. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 6 Higher peaking of the distribution of EO in the adducts appears to be directly proportional to the decreased level of unreacted alcohols.
