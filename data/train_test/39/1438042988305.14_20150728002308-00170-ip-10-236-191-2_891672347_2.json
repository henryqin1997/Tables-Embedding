This seemed to work, so we'll follow a similar model this year. Sadly we can't have talk space at MSR on a Saturday. If you're having trouble following things on IRC, the discussion page on the wiki might be a good place to leave comments and questions. Planning will be taking place on IRC as per previous years: #anglohaskell on irc.freenode.net [edit] 4 Programme Another guest house right next to the station is Tenison Towers (01223 363924). There's a fairly inexpensive YHA hostel in Cambridge. [edit] 3.2 Hostels Many of undergraduate colleges offer cheap accommodation over the holidays. Locations near MSR include Churchill College (online booking), Wolfson Court (an annexe of Girton College), Fitzwillian College, Robinson College, New Hall Murray Edwards (female only; recently renamed) and Burwells Field (an annexe of Trinity College).

This was a good thing, and some of the best talks were from people who were far from considering themselves as experts, so feel free to tell us about your experiences. In the event that more talks are offered than we have time for at MSR, we'll have to work out what we can do to find more time. Talks planned and/or offered: Neil Mitchell - hopefully \"Make Considered Harmful\" Tom Schrijvers - \"Monadic Constraint Programming\" Tristan Allwood - \"Using the GHC API to automatically find errors\" Neil Brown - \"CSP Models on the Cheap\" (like several others, I spoke last year -- so others should have priority if we get too many talks) Sam Martin - \"Functional languages in games development: plotting the coup\" Peter McArthur - Saturday afternoon workshop: \"From Map to Monads\" Monads for the nervous [edit] 4.2.1 Abstracts People giving talks should add these as they have them\u00a0:-) Monadic Constraint Programming A constraint programming system combines two essential components: a constraint solver and a search engine.
