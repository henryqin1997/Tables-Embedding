            "This is needed for the cases where the developers are using different ORG_CONFIG_FILES directories (which is my case). To make this work I removed all references to VulnReport_Files and made sure that all references to config files are made via GlobalVariables.****. I also added a quick check on load for the DevPath.org file. If it exists ORG will load it and use it as a virtual reference to the location of the config files (for example mine points to ..\\..\\..\\..\\ORG\\ORG_CONFIG_FILES), if it doesn't exist, then ORG will look for those files in the current application execution directory",

            "The issue seems to be related to a directory handle that exists on the ORG process (created by the Altova component) that prevents the directory from being completely deleted and means that when the same finding is opened again an error is thrown. The current solution is based on saving the temporary files in a folder named after a unique GUID. This solves the problem in the short term. but we still need to figure out how to close the handle properly (since at the moment not all directories are properly deleted)",

            "Worked on the UserProfile class. Reason for creating a seperate class was for code cleanliness and everything was getting confusing for loading, projects, etc.. from the yucky global variables.",
            "This was caused by the program not checking to see if the user wanted to continue or exit the program.",
