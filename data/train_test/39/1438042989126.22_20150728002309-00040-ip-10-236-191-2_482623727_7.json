No. 6,009,412, which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/572,017, filed on Dec. 14, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,774,870., 72074=While the above method of displaying the qualified awards is workable, it may take too much time to scan all the awards in order to \u201ccustom\u201d build a qualified awards catalog. Therefore, other alternatives may be used for creating the qualified award catalog. According to the preferred alternative, point levels are defined. For example, point level 1 can include all awards of value up to 500 points, point level 2, up to 1000 points, etc. When the user's account is read at 425, the highest point level the user is qualified for is determined. At this point a message may be displayed such as \u201cYou are qualified for point level 3 and have additional 350 points in your account. To qualify for point level 4 you will need 150 additional points\u201d., 73641=In the preferred embodiment the award libraries are arranged in a progressive manner, so as to avoid the need for a large memory size. The above example of the point levels will be used to explain this feature. Using the above example, award library 1 should include all awards worth up to 500 points. Award library 2 should include all awards worth from 501-1000 points, etc. Thus, if the user is qualified, for example, for point level 2, access is made to award libraries 1 and 2. Thus, duplication of awards in the various libraries is prevented.}",

In the description of the preferred embodiment, the term \u201cuser\u201d also refers to merchants, product manufacturers, award program administrators, etc. These particular users may be provided with a special access code. Upon entering the special code, these particular users may be provided with a privileged access to the program which allows them to make limited changes to the data. Thus, for example, a merchant may use this special access to change a price charged for a particular product. Similarly, a program administrator may gain privileged access to enter newly added awards available through the program. In addition, in the preferred embodiment a report is generated upon each privileged entry so that the changes made can be monitored. The proper amount of points is then subtracted from the user's account and an adjustment is made in the frequency database, 520. A link is then established to the fulfillment house or directly to the product manufacturer and an award order is communicated, 530. Thereafter, the program returns to the PROGRAM HOMEPAGE 300. It should be noted that if the REDEEM 500 step has been entered into from an award page, the award described in that particular page may be automatically read into the REDEEM 500 routine as the selected award.
