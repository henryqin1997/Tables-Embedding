            "Make sure to get involved in every way you can. Living in the dorms will give you great connections and will help you in finding some of the best friends you will ever have. Also, do not forget to get out in the surrounding areas such as Upper Bidwell for hiking, biking, and swimming.",
            "The education is well worth the price. I feel like I am able to leave class each day knowing a lot more about the subject, and if not then teachers are more than willing to help you before or after classes.",
            "The environment around campus is great. Fellow students and faculty are very friendly and willing to help you if you just ask. It is a nice quiet college town, with plenty of places to go to get out in the sun on the weekends.",
            "I love the classes at Chico State. Each day I learn something new, and look forward to the next class. The teachers have a great way of teaching and helping you learn the subject being taught, and also help you learn about yourself and help you become a better person overall."

My mind changed at summer orientation when I saw all of the clubs and opportunities Chico actually gave you. -If you have a meal plan try and organize how many meals a week you should be having. Because both semesters I had so many meals left over and the last week I tried to eat around 5 times a day! -Be prepared for both extreme heat from August to early October, and extreme cold in the winter. And when I say extreme I mean extreme for someone from the Bay Area. (100degrees and 30degrees), 217698=Okay, I'm going to divide the food and dining into two categories-the dining hall on campus and dining out in town. The Sutter Dining Hall was only recently opened in 2011, so it's extremely new and modern. However, the food options aren't necessarily the greatest. But I guarantee if you ask anyone at any school, they'll all tell you that they're dining hall stinks. Now as for downtown dining, it's awesome. There's a great pizza place called Celestino's (it's been a huge staple while I've lived in Chico), and also a burger/bar joint called The Bear (you have to try the jiffy burger...yes, it's a burger with peanut butter on it!), 584889=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students Chico is the school to go to if you have a good head on your shoulders and you can focus on why you are really there...to go to school! Bang for the buck Chico is not just a wonderful campus with the most knowlegable professors, it is also a beautiful town and great place to live. There are really nice dog parks to go to and the local swimming holes that are popular as well. All colleges are going to be expensive, but it feels better to be paying for an education AND a great",
