In 2000, Texas fined the charity $110,000 in penalties and costs after accusing it of misleading donors. In 2002, Florida fined it $1,000 for failing to register to solicit. In 2009, Kentucky levied a penalty of $101,500 for what regulators called deceptive fundraising practices., 40190=As far back as 1991, CFA's founder, James T. Reynolds Sr., said he intended to reduce the charity's high-fundraising costs. But more than 20 years later, fundraising still takes more than 83 cents of every dollar raised., 208790=In 2011, neither of the Morrisons reported taking a salary from the Disabled Police Officers Counseling Center. The couple did take combined pay of about $30,000 from their second charity that year, however., 95650=In May 2009, his charity, the Association for Firefighters and Paramedics, was one of 12 charities and 17 solicitors targeted by California Attorney General Jerry Brown for deceptive fundraising tactics. Brown said the charity misled donors about how much money would go to burn victims. And he accused its operators of diverting $33,000 in donations to pay for out-of-town board meetings and a Caribbean cruise for the three board members and their families before a meeting in Florida., 39093=Cancer Fund of America, started in 1984, claims in pledge letters that it is on the front lines of the fight against cancer. But its main activity has nothing to do with funding research or paying for cancer treatment. Instead, the charity collects donated goods \u2014 including shampoo, DVDs and air fresheners \u2014 and ships them across the nation to dying patients and the families who have gone broke trying to save them., 26548=Tampa Bay Times/CIR/CNN \u2013 in print June 10, 92229=Since 2009, the charity has also shipped donated medical supplies valued at about $9 million to Central America. Bowen said the supplier recommended an orphanage in Guatemala as one of the recipients. Youth Development Fund pays the supplier a few thousand dollars for shipping and counts the full value of the shipment as revenue on its tax forms. That boosts the charity's good deeds and makes its fundraising costs look lower in comparison to donations raised., 125540=Operation Lookout has signed settlements with regulators in Florida and Iowa. In Iowa it agreed to stop soliciting until 2016 as a result of fundraising abuses by its telemarketer. Callers lied about how much money went to the charity and said local children would benefit from the donations when the money was used nationwide., 161723=Terry and Lorna Morrison run two of the worst charities in America from the same office in Niceville, Fla. Disabled Police Officers Counseling Center was started in 1995 to educate the public and provide counseling to disabled officers. The Morrisons launched Disabled Police Officers of America in 1998 to provide financial assistance and scholarships to disabled and retired law enforcement officers., 188925=When Brian Hampton started Circle of Friends for American Veterans in 1993, the charity ran a homeless shelter for 70 men. Hampton said he soon decided the group could have more impact if it promoted awareness of the needs of homeless veterans, instead of actually housing them., 198822=The group's use of professional fundraisers has led to problems with regulators, however. One of its telemarketers closed in 2011 after Iowa regulators accused it of misleading donors. Two years earlier, Reserve Police Officers paid a $1,000 fine and agreed to stop soliciting in Washington state after regulators learned it was not registered there. The investigation began after\u00a0a Washington resident complained about repeated phone calls from solicitors seeking money for the association., 190087=The money that reaches the charity goes mostly toward salaries. Hampton received a combined salary of $188,000 in 2010 from Circle of Friends and Center for American Homeless Veterans., 80855=Since 1998, Florida-based Project Cure has raised $65 million to lobby Congress and educate the public about alternative treatments for cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease., 118951=Updated Sept. 3, 2013., 208053=The charity's website says its founder has experience providing career counseling to disabled and retired police officers. But Jan Collier, a therapist who shares an office complex with the Morrisons in Niceville, Fla., said she has seen the couple only a handful of times in the past 10 years and has never seen anyone who appears to be a counseling client., 31570=America\u2019s Worst Charities is the result of a yearlong collaboration between the Tampa Bay Times and the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting, the nation\u2019s largest and longest serving nonprofit newsroom dedicated to watchdog journalism. CNN joined the partnership in March 2013., 229422=For about a year, Caring for Our Children operated a thrift store, paying Melody Gibson $4,500 as manager. According to the charity, the store also offered training to unemployed parents. The Gibsons closed the store in 2012 when it began losing money., 225472=Robert Amick, vice president of Firefighters Assistance Fund, spoke briefly by phone to a reporter, but declined to answer questions. He said his brother, Joe Amick, is the only paid employee. He was paid about $20,000 for his part-time position in 2011., 120885=In fiscal 2012, NCC made a single cash grant of $10,000 to an organization in Central America. All its remaining grants were donated medical goods and pharmaceuticals. Landry, meanwhile, received total compensation of $314,000., 125250=When fundraising declined in 2001, the Gibsons launched another charity, Caring for Our Children, to raise money for Operation Lookout. Both charities rely heavily on high-cost professional fundraisers and are on theTimes/CIR list of the nation's worst charities., 96155=Gamboa, who has been president of the California charity since it was started in 2001, settled with the state in September 2010. The group admitted no wrongdoing but paid a $100,000 settlement and agreed to special monitoring. Board members remain the same., 251920=To settle Iowa regulators' claims that Firefighters Burn Fund had not adequately monitored the telemarketer, Simpkins signed an agreement in early 2011 that prevents the charity from soliciting in that state for seven years., 237939=Reports filed with state regulators stated that help would take the form of \"housing, job search and placement, transportation, clothing, food, and medical assistance.\" On the basis of such promises, donors gave $2.6 million from 2003 to 2009. The charity spent $2.3 million of that paying for-profit solicitation companies., 47857=Frank Tepedino, who became president of the charity after Pelico, told the\u00a0Milwaukee Journal Sentinelin 2007 that he planned to slowly change the way the charity raised money. That hasn't happened., 166273=Two couples in New England started this badge charity in 2002 to give financial assistance to disabled officers and train police in subjects ranging from close-quarter shooting to knife defense., 251130=In the four years since, those telemarketers have been the primary beneficiaries. Firefighters Burn Fund has raised about $2 million. Fundraisers kept 82 percent. The charity has given cash grants of $30,000 over that time, though its IRS filings do not include details about the recipients. Simpkins is the only paid employee, receiving about $45,000 in 2011., 67407=Instead, it relies on social workers to suggest worthy recipients and sees itself as helper of last resort, said Kraft, who has headed the group since 1989., 129639=For American Foundation for Disabled Children, 2011 was a typical year., 247811=The charity was inactive from 2006 to 2009 but has recently resumed its fundraising efforts, according to its filings with the IRS. However, a button on the charity's website that encourages donors to give was not functioning in June 2013., 120021=Separately, the Axios spokeswoman confirmed that the charity provided technical support for a Gardasil vaccination project in Honduras in February 2013., 139608=From 2001 to 2010, the charity spent $260,000 total on direct cash assistance, including benefits provided to the families of police officers killed in the line of duty, according to tax filings., 228414=For 17 years, Melody and Mike Gibson ran Operation Lookout, a Washington-based charity that says it helps the families of missing children. When donations began to flag in 2001, the Gibsons formed a second charity that was designed to raise additional donations and send any money left after expenses to Operation Lookout., 208561=In its 2011 IRS filing, the charity did not report spending money on any counseling services. All expenses were related to overhead, including printing, postage and general administrative costs of about $15,000., 81050=But its office off Interstate 75 south of Tampa is little more than a storage unit filled with plastic bins, unused furniture and Christmas decorations. Its lobbying has been limited to less than $3,000 in political donations between 1995 and 2008, according to federal campaign reports. And its educational efforts are a couple of websites that mostly provide links to articles from other sources., 105685=Until his death in April 2010, Stephen Van Dyke ran United States Deputy Sheriffs' Association with his wife, Judy. The charity said its purpose was to train officers, give financial aid to the families of fallen officers and donate equipment to rural law enforcement agencies., 247527=One of the charity's board members, Robin Monville, was married to the owner of a company that brokers contracts between charities and professional fundraisers. Hope Cancer Fund paid the company $16,000 in 2010., 250780=Ron Lagur had been a broker for years, matching charities with telemarketers and taking a cut of the donations for his trouble. When he retired in 2007, however, Lagur didn't get out of the business. Instead, he helped his wife, Cathy Simpkins, start Firefighters Burn Fund. Then he used his connections to help her find solicitors., 153914=In an interview in February, Brooks told a reporter he decided to close Veterans Fund at the end of 2012. The final straw was a $30,000 penalty the charity had to pay to settle allegations of wrongdoing against its telemarketer in Oregon., 220755=Of the $8.6 million raised from 2001-2010, about 60 percent went to professional solicitors., 96770=The charity, whose mission is to provide \"financial assistance\" to burn victims and their families, continues to be dependent on professional fundraisers for all of its income. In 2011, solicitors kept nearly 90 percent of the $1.2 million raised. Gamboa, who has an online organic supplement marketing business on the side, took a salary of about $54,000. Less than $20,000 in direct cash aid was given to fire victims or hospital burn units., 167343=Between the two groups, the couples made $234,146 in total compensation in 2011., 157661=In 1999, the Minnesota attorney general accused the organization of misleading donors.
