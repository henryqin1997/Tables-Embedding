            "-join an LLC for your freshman year -take as many tours, visits, and preview days as possible (you will get more and more questions answered, and get more comfortable about the whole new college experience) -if you have a question about ANYTHING ask. i have yet to meet someone on campus who is not nice, patient, and knowledgeable about answering questions and even if they do not have an answer for you they will find someone who will",
            "i would say that if your major is either criminal justice, forensics, or fire science then you definitely get major bang for your buck. the school focuses a lot of their time and efforts into those programs. if those are not your majors then you have to really be confident of your major choice to stay here. i am not one of any of those majors but i am very excited for psychology/Pre-elementary education that i think that UNH is well worth my time and money.",
            "my freshman year i participated in a living learning community. these communities are made up of freshman that have the same major as you that you live with. i was in the pre-education LLC and it helped to find and even have friends that are readily accessible in your dorm to do homework together, pick classes together, and talk about and ask/answer questions together because more than likely those questions are the same as yours. by participating in this it was easier to find friends and fit-in and feel at home when i live so far away.",
            "I am definitely learning a lot. the classes that are specifically aimed for my major which is psychology have helped me. they are challenging so as to get me to think outside of the box but at the same time im learning. i like that there is a core curriculum here. these classes are the basic high school classes that cover the normal classes like science, math, and english. by completing these first before my major requirement classes it gives me a solid base to build on."

They changed an upperclassmen dorm to a freshmen dorm and fall 2014 they'll open up a new dorm with parking and a movie theater., 273808=The great thing about living in Europe is that the airfare is really cheap through RyanAir. During October break six of us went to Barcelona, Dublin, and Paris. It is also easy to hop on a train during the weekend and explore more of Italy. At Keller Platz they have nights where bands play and there is great music and dancing!}",

Am enjoying being here Okayy, this school makes it sound more interesting then it really is. The people are nice and the classes are good, however the campus is kinda boring. It is very small and right now a lot of construction. This is also not the best area to live in. There have been lock downs and such on campus, students have been robbed at gun point etc. There are campus police and they seem to do there best, and they will send out txt",
