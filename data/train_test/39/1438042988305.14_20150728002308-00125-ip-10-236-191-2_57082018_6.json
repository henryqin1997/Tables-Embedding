Never heard of one of these being stolen in southern California. As for the more obvious species (most Encephalartos), best way to keep them from being taken is to make them difficult to take- plant them behind a row of spiny things, put in back yard with a large dog, pile huge rocks around them making digging nearly impossible, etc. You cannot post until you register, login and subscribe.",
