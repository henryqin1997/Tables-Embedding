            "Gordon is expensive--no doubt about that. But with scholarships, financial aid, and work study it is manageable and you definitely get your money's worth: in and out of the classroom.",
            "There are so many things to do off campus, like Boston, Salem, Gloucester, and Marty's Donut Land in Ipswitch at 1 in the morning! There are also things on campus. You will often find students up at 3 in the morning not doing homework but just hanging around playing music and having a great time together!",
            "Lane food has a pretty good selection! My favorite is the salad bar and sandwich line. There is always fresh fruit and veggies!",
            "There are many activities in the dorms! In my hall, Nyland, we have fun nights like Nyland Iron Chef and brother-sister floor dinners. It's a great way to get to know people and just have a great time together!",
            "Gordon gives a lot of homework! Some classes are harder than others, but all around you will get your money's worth!",
            "Definitely visit and stay overnight! You see a lot more when you spend the night here.",
            "Gordon College is amazing! There are so many opportunities to connect with other students on campus and ways to make friends. There are so many fun activities around campus and within the dorms. Really great Christian school!"

Tips for prospective students If you still have some time left get involved in community service, because Gordon really looks for students who are willing to be leaders in those areas. If it's possibly try to get you're grades up also, or you could miss out on some really good scholarships from Gordon. Bang for the buck Gordon is really expensive but then again so is pretty much every private college in the United States. Gordon does realize that, and you can always go to the financial office if you think you're struggling, they're really nice there and will help you out. Am enjoying being here Everyone is so nice and caring here, sometimes I think it depends on where you live because the community is better for freshman especially, in the hud dorms. For some the first semester might be difficult but if you stick it out it gets better. Am learning a lot I'm constantly challenged here by my teachers and classmates. Even if you're in a lecture class you will be blown away by how",
