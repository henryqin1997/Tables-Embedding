            "Public safety does a great job. It's not a rowdy town or campus. Public safety is very quick to respond, and often offers rides to single or even pairs of students coming back from town late at night.",
            "Aside from some honor clubs for specific fields of study, there is no Greek life.",
            "I was not very involved due to my choice of classes, but there are a variety of activities. Athletics is probably not our strong suit, but there are a lot of music ensembles, social justice and volunteer groups, and other just plain fun clubs. Swing dancing and ballroom are two highly popular clubs that are highly involved in campus life.",
            "If you are a hard worker, like an academic challenge, and want to meet friendly, inquisitive people, this would be a good fit for you.",
            "Well, Jesse James Days is Northfield tradition commemorating the day the James-Elder Gang did not rob the bank. It is cowboy-themed, with a carnival and lots of events. St. Olaf's big tradition is Christmas Fest. Many of the students, music majors or not, participate in ensembles, and Christmas Fest has a national reputation for musical excellence. Over four performances in the beginning of December, the campus is beautifully decorated and swarming with people in Norwegian sweaters who come for the music and dinner of traditional Norwegian foods, including the dreaded lutefisk. Don't eat in the cafeteria every night of Fest- you will really hate ham and meatballs for a while otherwise, although no one could possibly get tired of lefse.",
            "St. Olaf can be pricey, but I personally felt that I received an above-average education, and that the opportunities I was given far outweighed the cost. The school makes a huge effort to allow students to study abroad if they will, and I think the last statistics said roughly 2/3 of us did study abroad. In addition, once you graduate, our career center is still willing to help with advice and resume assistance in the 2-3 years following graduation. The alumni network is very strong and connected in the Midwest, and many of them are open to talking to or even assisting students during the career search process.",
            "There are a lot of on-campus activities like dances, concerts, and extracurriculars. Northfield is well known for Jesse James Days, which usually takes place soon after school starts. If Northfield is too quiet for you, Minneapolis and St. Paul are a half an hour drive away,a nd many students go to concerts and events over the weekend.",
            "The cafeteria is fantastic. Catered by Bon Appetit, which also runs the cafe in the student commons, provides lots of fresh, well-balanced, and local options for all types of dietary needs. Randy Clay, who runs the cafeteria, is a beloved campus celebrity and lets the students post on a bulletin board outside the cafeteria about what they do/don't like, and suggestions for meals. The Pause is a student run kitchen that is very cheap, but has slow turn times on items like pizzas. Dining in Northfield is pretty good, with some fast food options, as well as more upscale and ethnic restaurants as well.",
            "For the most part, students live in the dorms. St. Olaf is on a hill, and all other non-dorm housing including the honor houses and any apartments are downhill towards Northfield. Each dorm has its own personality and attracts different class years and personality types. Do a little research and ask around before choosing a dorm- you might not want to be in a quieter, more studious dorm if you really enjoy impromptu parties on the weekend.",
            "This is not high school, and slacking is not an option if you want to earn good grades. That said, I never encountered a professor that was unwilling to help me with a question or concern, and there are a lot of resources available if you need help. Just be forewarned, there will be times during any given semester where you will feel overloaded.",
            "Be yourself! St. Olaf can be a little preppy and overly studious at times, but the students are incredibly friendly and are open to new experiences and people. Don't be afraid to ask tons of questions about anything and everything when you visit- the guides enjoy answering questions, and most of them are pretty frank about what they do and don't like about the school.",
            "St. Olaf is stresses community, academics, and personal growth through activities and involvement. Even though the courses can be rigorous and stressful, the school offers a lot of extracurricular activities where you can relax, meet people, and explore new interests. Fantastic study abroad opportunities help expand your horizons even when you aren't on campus, and the alum network is very active."

Ole's, the nickname for those who are attending or have attended St. Olaf, are very willing to help one another whether in internships, advice, anything. For example, I received the opportunity to work as a student worker at a University of Kansas Medical Center research lab because I was able to contact an alum that is a senior researcher in the lab. If you want to gain experience in something, whether leadership or otherwise, opportunities on campus are abundant. You can join or create an organization for almost anything. St. Olaf is known for its study abroad programs in 46 different countries. One can study abroad for January Interim, a semester, or a whole year concentrating on almost any area of academics., 27402=Every December there is a large choir concert called Christmasfest. It is broadcast all over the country and everyone dons their Norwegian sweaters and attends for good music and Christmas carols. It is a tradition that it snows during Christmasfest - somehow it happens every year at least once that weekend!, 149480=Well, Jesse James Days is Northfield tradition commemorating the day the James-Elder Gang did not rob the bank.

    "textAfterTable": "Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus There is a Norweigan, Lutheran heritage to the campus which comes out in events during Christmas Festival and heritage days. People flock to the campus in Norweigan sweaters to enjoy dinners of lutefisk and lefsa. During the normal school year though, it is like any other college campus and there are not an overwhelming amount of blonde hair and blue eyed students. Bang for the buck St. Olaf is one of the most expensive private colleges in MN. You do get a great education, but with the job market, make sure that the price of your degree is worth what you want out of school. If you just want a degree to get a job, St. Olaf is not for you. You have to want to grow as an individual and discover yourself to make it worth the cost. What to do for fun Students learn to create their own fun. There are not a lot of big concerts or parties like at a large university so gatherings are mostly small groups of friends. Food and Dining The food at St. Olaf is amazingly good, healthy, and sustainable. Much of it is locally grown and students learn to really",
