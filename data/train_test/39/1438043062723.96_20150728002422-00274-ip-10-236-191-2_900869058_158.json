            "Somewhat glitched in communicating information to the students and faculty, University Police are very vigilant and make great effort to protect the people of this institution.",
            "From the traditional to the professional, a variety of Greek life exists on campus.",
            "Hundreds of clubs exist in this university. There is a club for most anything one can think of.",
            "Great if you like large populations with the ability to escape easily when needed.",
            "Most importantly, we sing John Denver's Country Roads for most any occassion. We also REALLY dislike the University of Pittsburgh.",
            "While tuition continues to climb annually, WVU still remains one of the most affordable institutions in the region.",
            "Outdoors and indoors, the Monongalia County region has much to do. Coopers Rock State Park is just a few miles east of town, providing hiking, climbing, ziplining, and outdoor exploration to anybody looking to escape the hustle of the city and relax. Night life in the city is similar to what you would find in any major city. Clubs line up downtown, and music venues dot the city, giving way for fans of rock, country, hiphop, and everything in the middle to experience their favorite artists live. Pittsburgh is only a 90 minute drive north, as well.",
            "The many dining areas on campus give students the opportunity to try a variety of different foods on any given day, at any given time, at any given location. From large cafeterias to small cafes, WVU provides students with a variety of options to suit their wants and needs.",
            "Buildings both new and old, WVU's student housing provides everything you need to be comfortable in Morgantown. Each dorm has a variety of clubs and events, from arts clubs to hall council to talent shows.",
            "The academics at this institution are top-notch. Rigorous coursework coupled with opportunities, both provided and self-made, provide the knowledge necessary to make a career in any person's given interests.",
            "WVU gives you the chance to interact one-on-one with skilled educators who have experience in their respective fields. Like any other college, you will learn the skills needed to make a successful future. What makes this university special is that opportunities always surround you, and in order to make the most of what you have, you can't be afraid to make things happen for yourself.",
            "Nestled in the hills of north central West Virginia, WVU is a land-grant university that has served the state since 1867. Despite having a population of over 30,000 students, one can still feel the tie associated with a small school while still living in a modern, urban area. A very diverse social and cultural atmosphere blends with academics that provide opportunities beyond what one can imagine, harboring an environment of creativity while fostering a future of success."

The campus is beautiful covering over 1000 acres and transportation is great , buses and trains (PRT) carries people all over the campus .

I did not decide on WVU until late, as a matter of fact I was set on attending West Virginia Wesleyan College until financial aid fell through I had to re-evaluate my situation. In July I transitioned to WVU. My advice is to apply early and commit early. This will allow you the greatest opportunity to capitalize on all WVU has to offer. Believe me, being the last to schedule and waiting for them to make a room for you is no fun. You will end up with 8am classes and classes at 9pm, you will live in Evansdale and have all your classes downtown. It\u2019s been a hectic first semester, one that you can avoid by committing early., 704435=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 678161=Nestled in the hills of north central West Virginia, WVU is a land-grant university that has served the state since 1867.

Seriously, any stereotype, any click from the athlete to the nerd, from the music major to the chemistry loving geek, from country to hard rock, white, black and every color in between you will fit in at WVU. The diversity here is amazing. I frequently spend my lunch just people watching and enjoying all the variety WVU has to offer. I myself have been challenged to look beyond who I am and reinvent who I will become. At am a musician, playing in the orchestra, a nerd in the honors program, an athlete running and attending spinning classes daily, a teacher working with students at a local school, a mentor for teenagers at the rec center, a room mate and friend to several girls from all over the country. WVU is great for all",
