Therefore it does not stop at Osaka Station. The Haruka primarily operates between Kyoto Station and Kansai Airport Station, with stops at Shin-\u014csaka Station and Tenn\u014dji Station in Osaka City. Some trains make additional stops (stations in italics in list below).[2] Station stops[edit] There are 60 Haruka train services per day, numbered 1 to 60; odd-numbered trains run south (toward the airport) and even-numbered trains run north (away from the airport). They operate every half hour during the daytime and early evening. The typical travel time between Kyoto Station and the airport is 75 minutes for southbound trains and 73 minutes for northbound trains.[2] Operations[edit] 7 External links 6 References 5 History 4 Ticketing 3.1.2 9-car formations 3.1.1 6-car formations 3.1 Formations",
