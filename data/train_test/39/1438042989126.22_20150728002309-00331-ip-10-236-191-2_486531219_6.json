    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets It will be appreciated to those skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure that this invention is believed to provide a well survey system including a survey tool having one or more electrolytic tilt sensors arranged therein. The survey tool disclosed herein provides an accurate determination of wellbore inclination in either a WL or MWD application. Such a survey tool is also smaller, less expensive and more reliable than other electronic survey tools. Further modifications and alternative embodiments of various aspects of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of this description. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such modifications and changes and, accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. In general, a survey tool should experience a substantially consistent pattern of motion and/or temperature values when disposed within a particular wellbore. In other words, the measured motion and/or temperature values may be thought of as a \u201csignature\u201d of the particular wellbore. Therefore, the characteristic pattern may be compared (in step 920) with a pattern detected during a previous well survey to determine if the current well survey is conducted within the wellbore. If the characteristic pattern is similar to the pattern detected during the previous well survey in step 930, it is determined that the well survey",
