    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6500=FIG. 34 shows a drawing that indicates a change in the CV characteristic before and after the thermal endurance test of an electrostatic actuator so as to confirm the effects of the protrusions 32. In other words, as shown in FIG. 35, an insulating film 31 made of an oxide film (SiO2) is formed on the fixed electrode, with the protrusion 32 made of an oxide film (SiO2) being formed on the insulating film 31 in the same manner, so that an electrostatic actuator is formed. Here, the thickness T of the insulating film 31 is set to 2000 to 2500 angstroms, the height H of each protrusion 32 is set to 400 to 600 angstroms, the diameter D of each protrusion 32 is set to 25 to 35 \u03bcm, and a plurality of protrusions 32 are formed with pitches P set to 100 to 110 \u03bcm. With a driving voltage of the rated voltage being applied between the fixed electrode and the movable electrode of the electrostatic actuator that forms this measuring subject, this has been held at 85\ufffd C. for 1000 hours, and this is then left at a standard state for two hours. The CV characteristic is measured with respect to the electrostatic actuator having been subjected to such a thermal endurance test, and FIG. 34 shows the results of the measurements.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As a result, the electrostatic actuator of the present invention makes it possible to control the charging phenomena such as plus shift and minus shift, and consequently to control the operational voltage characteristics such as on-voltage and off-voltage. Moreover, the quantities of positive and negative charges to be generated in the above-mentioned insulating film when a voltage is applied between the first and second electrodes are respectively controlled so that the sum of the quantities of charge in the insulating film is desirably controlled; thus, the quantity of positive charge and the quantity of negative charge are mutually cancelled so that the entire charge quantity (total quantity) generated in the insulating film is controlled. In particular, it is not necessary to reduce the quantity of positive charge and the quantity of negative charge, and by making the quantity of positive charge and the quantity of negative charge cancel with each other, it becomes possible to reduce the entire charge quantity generated in the insulating film, and consequently to control the charge quantity as a whole to, for example, zero. In accordance with the electrostatic actuator of the present invention, it is possible to control the quantities of positive and negative charges in the insulating film by utilizing its charge-quantity controlling structure. For example, it is possible to reduce the quantity of positive or negative charge due to charge transfer and the like, or",
