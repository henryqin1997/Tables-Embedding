It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, and those made apparent from the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be made in the above constructions without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.

This engagement between the carrier 60 and jacket 10' during motion in the outward direction (76) prevents separation of the carrier 60 from the jacket 10' except upon application of transverse forces 78, as described above. The other constructional features of the jacket 10' are correspondingly similar to the jacket 10, described above. Adhesive 42', 44', illustrated as a dotted",
