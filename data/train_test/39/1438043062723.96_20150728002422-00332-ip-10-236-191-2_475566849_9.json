All are considered to be within the sphere and scope of the invention as defined in the claims appended hereto. In addition, while it is preferred that PAL circuits be utilized for implementing the enable signal circuits of the present invention, other programmable logic circuits may be used, such as programmable logic arrays (PLAs), etc. Also, while the description herein refers to DRAM chips, other memory circuits such as bubble memory or static RAM, etc., can be utilized, appropriate modifications being made to the enable signal generation circuits 6A and 6B. Variations or alternative embodiments may now be conceived of by a person skilled in the art understanding the present invention. For instance, main memory module 1 and expander memory module 2 can be comprised of greater or less than 5 memory banks, or a greater number of memory modules and corresponding enable signal circuits can be utilized, and the memory chips connected thereto can be larger or smaller than 64k and 256k bytes respectively, suitable changes being made in the PAL equations shown in TABLES 1 and 2. In order to utilize the present invention properly, DRAM chips must be connected to adjacent memory banks of the memory module. For example, the invention will not function properly in the event the B0, B1 and B3 memory banks of",
