Section 401 of the JOBS Act added Section 3(b)(2) to the Securities Act of 1933, which directs the Commission to adopt rules exempting from the registration requirements of the Securities Act offerings of up to $50 million of securities annually. The final rules include issuer eligibility requirements, content and filing requirements for offering statements, and ongoing reporting requirements for issuers in Regulation A offerings., 69108=The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) is publishing for comment proposed amendments and a re-proposed rule to address the application of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) that were added by Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) to cross-border security-based swap activities. The Commission is proposing amendments to Exchange Act rules 3a71-3 and 3a71-5 that would address the application of the de minimis exception to security-based swap transactions connected with a non-U.S. person's security-based swap dealing activity that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of such person located in a U.S. branch or office, or by personnel of such person's agent, located in a U.S. branch or office. The Commission is also re-proposing Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(c) and proposing certain amendments to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a) to address the applicability of external business conduct requirements to the U.S. business and foreign business of registered security-based swap dealers. The Commission also is proposing amendments to Regulation SBSR to apply the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of non-U.S. persons, or personnel of such non-U.S. persons' agents, that are located in the United States and to transactions effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility), along with certain related issues, including requiring registered broker-dealers (including registered security-based swap execution facilities) to report certain transactions that are effected by or through the registered broker-dealer., 58326=15 U.S. Code \u00a7 32, 33 - Repealed. Pub. L. 91\u2013452 , title II , \u00a7\u00a7\u2009209, 210 , Oct. 15, 1970, 84 Stat. 929, 14138=The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) is adopting new Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (\u201cRegulation SCI\u201d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and conforming amendments to Regulation ATS under the Exchange Act. Regulation SCI will apply to certain self-regulatory organizations (including registered clearing agencies), alternative trading systems (\u201cATSs\u201d), plan processors, and exempt clearing agencies (collectively, \u201cSCI entities\u201d), and will require these SCI entities to comply with requirements with respect to the automated systems central to the performance of their regulated activities., 85636=The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) is proposing to amend Rule 15b9-1 (\u201cRule\u201d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cAct\u201d or \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which exempts certain brokers or dealers from membership in a registered national securities association (\u201cAssociation\u201d). The proposed amendments would replace the current gross income allowance in the Rule with a narrower exemption from Association membership for a broker or dealer that carries no customer accounts and effects transactions on a national securities exchange. The proposed amendments would create an exemption for a dealer that effects transactions off the exchange of which it is a member solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based activity, or a broker or dealer that effects transactions off the exchange resulting from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to prevent trade-throughs consistent with the provisions of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS., 168485=On February 25, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission re-opened the comment period on two releases related to asset-backed securities. The Commission re-opened the comment period to permit interested persons to comment on an approach for the dissemination of potentially sensitive asset-level data. The comment period is scheduled to end on March 28, 2014. In light of public interest in providing comment on the approach, the Commission is extending the comment period until April 28, 2014 to permit interested persons additional time to analyze and comment on the approach., 55164=The Securities and Exchange Commission published a document in the Federal Register of January 8, 2014 that contained an incorrect instruction. This correction is being published to correct instruction 5.b in that document., 29262=We are adopting significant revisions to Regulation AB and other rules governing the offering process, disclosure, and reporting for asset-backed securities (\u201cABS\u201d). The final rules require that, with some exceptions, prospectuses for public offerings under the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and ongoing reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) of asset-backed securities backed by real estate related assets, auto related assets, or backed by debt securities, including resecuritizations, contain specified asset-level information about each of the assets in the pool. The asset-level information is required to be provided according to specified standards and in a tagged data format using eXtensible Markup Language (\u201cXML\u201d). We also are adopting rules to revise filing deadlines for ABS offerings to provide investors with more time to consider transaction-specific information, including information about the pool assets. We are also adopting new registration forms tailored to ABS offerings. The final rules also repeal the credit ratings references in shelf eligibility criteria for ABS issuers and establish new shelf eligibility criteria., 64600=Title 17 published on 2014-04-01, 8777=Pursuant to Section 763(i) of Title VII (\u201cTitle VII\u201d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) is adopting new rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) governing the security-based swap data repository (\u201cSDR\u201d) registration process, duties, and core principles. The Commission is also adopting a new registration form. Additionally, the Commission is amending several of its existing rules and regulations in order to accommodate SDRs. First, the Commission is amending Regulation S-T and Exchange Act Rule 24b-2 to clarify that all filings by SDRs, including any confidential portion, and their requests for confidential treatment must be filed electronically. Second, the Commission is amending Regulation S-T by, among other things, adding a new rule that specifically applies to the electronic filing of SDRs' financial reports., 157993=The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) proposes to amend Rule 17Ad-22 and add Rule 17Ab2-2 pursuant to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) and the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act of 2010 (\u201cClearing Supervision Act\u201d), adopted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). Among other things, the proposed rules would establish standards for the operation and governance of certain types of registered clearing agencies that meet the definition of a \u201ccovered clearing agency.\u201d, 163009=In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), is proposing recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers (\u201cSBSDs\u201d) and major security-based swap participants (\u201cMSBSPs\u201d), securities count requirements applicable to certain SBSDs, and additional recordkeeping requirements applicable to broker-dealers to account for their security-based swap and swap activities. The Commission also is proposing an additional capital charge provision that would be added to the proposed capital rule for certain SBSDs. Finally, the Commission is proposing technical amendments to the broker-dealer recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements., 102003=We are proposing amendments to our rules to implement Title V and Title VI of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). The proposed amendments would revise rules adopted under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) to reflect the new, higher thresholds for registration, termination of registration and suspension of reporting that were set forth in the JOBS Act. The proposed rules also would apply the thresholds specified for banks and bank holding companies to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the proposed amendments would revise the definition of \u201cheld of record\u201d in Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1, in accordance with the JOBS Act, to exclude certain securities held by persons who received them pursuant to employee compensation plans and establish a non-exclusive safe harbor for determining whether securities are \u201cheld of record\u201d for purposes of registration under Exchange Act Section 12(g)., 44750=The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d or \u201cCommission\u201d) is adopting rules and providing guidance to address the application of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) that were added by Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), to cross-border security-based swap activities. These rules and guidance in large part focus on the application of the Title VII definitions of \u201csecurity-based swap dealer\u201d and \u201cmajor security-based swap participant\u201d in the cross-border context. The Commission also is adopting a procedural rule related to the submission of applications for substituted compliance. In addition, the Commission is adopting a rule addressing the scope of our authority, with respect to enforcement proceedings, under section 929P of the Dodd-Frank Act., 64192=124 Stat. 1376, 63800=\u00a7 1350 - Failure of corporate officers to certify financial reports, 19073=The Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the Federal Register of September 15, 2014 (79 FR 55078). The rule applies to credit rating agencies registered with the Commission as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (\u201cNRSROs\u201d), providers of third-party due diligence services for asset-backed securities, and issuers and underwriters of asset-backed securities. 1 1 See Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange Act Release No. 72936 (Aug. 27, 2014), 79 FR 55078 (Sep. 15, 2014)., 75167=We are proposing amendments to Item 402 of Regulation S-K to implement Section 14(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), as added by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). Section 14(i) directs the Commission to adopt rules requiring registrants to disclose in a clear manner the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the registrant. The proposed disclosure would be required in proxy or information statements in which executive compensation disclosure pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K is required. The proposed disclosure requirements would not apply to emerging growth companies or foreign private issuers.}",
