    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus a filter module is made available which overcomes the defects which have been established in the prior art and meets all the initially set conditions. Connecting means which work by force-fit, form-fit or combined can be used to transfer the axial clamping forces and also to protect against unintentional radial unhooking or unlocking motion. In the embodiment as shown in FIG. 9, the bands have projections 14 which extend in the peripheral direction of the end rings, while in the inside wall of the end rings there are recesses 15 of the corresponding shape. Here the projections 14 and the recesses 15 are matched to one another such that engagement is possible only after slight elastic deformation. In this way a connection which works by form-fit in the axial direction of the filter module is produced. As a result of elastic deformation this connection is already protected against unintentional radial disengagement. In addition, as shown in FIG. 9c, there can be a material bridge 10 which partially overlaps the recess 15 and which is made in one piece with the end ring. Alternatively, of course a separate retaining ring 11 as shown in FIG. 7 can also be used here. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 8, the bands 5 are equipped with a barbed projection 13 which fits over the end ring 4 on the outside, while unintentional radial disengagement motion is prevented by",
