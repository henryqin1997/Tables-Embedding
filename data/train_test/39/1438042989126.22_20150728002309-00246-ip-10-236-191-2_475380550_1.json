They quickly realize that they can share some activities such as going to the movies or enjoying the beach while forgoing games of catch or playing hide and seek.

A bird happily perched in a pond becomes crowded when a frog, egret, and other animals squeeze in to join him. After annoyed exchanges of 'pardon me!' the bird ends up left alone until one final 'pardon me' reveals another animal in the water.

He pesters her to read to him and she puts him off, instead making a bowl of alphabet soup for his lunch. While the soup is cooling, the steam turns into, you guessed it, a tiger in the soup. The boy fights back with a spoon, romping through the house, until the sister warms the soup up in the microwave. The sister, exasperated with her brother, finally agrees to read the book. The book ends on a sweet sibling note while the boy wonders where the tiger will show up next. Fabulous illustrations, a wonderfully imaginative story! Recommended for kindergarten and first grade, boys will especially love the action that the tiger inspires. ...more"
