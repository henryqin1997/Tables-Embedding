I didn't expect anyone could fully answer it for me, but the input so far has been useful... And don't get me wrong - I like the results from the Df just as much but in a different way. Just trying to assess where (presumably somewhere in the middle) the D610 would fall with the same lenses. Pretty simple - just want more focal lengths than one. If the A7 had a 24 or 28 and something wider, I'd probably go that direction. And might someday. But not just",
