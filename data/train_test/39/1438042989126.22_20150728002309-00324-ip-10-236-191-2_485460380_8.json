When the ball 26 has been properly oriented within the socket 22, the set bolt 46 is advanced inwardly to urge against the ball 26 and thereby hold the ball 26 stationary within the socket 22. Then, the neurosurgery probe 14 is advanced through the bore 28 of the ball 26 and the channel 24 of the plate 16 into the skull of the patient 12. When the probe 14 has been positioned as desired, the set screw 42 is rotated to urge against the probe 14 and thereby hold the probe 14 stationary within the bore 28. Next, the ball 26 is positioned in the socket 22, and the retainer ring 30 positioned over the ball 26 and fastened to the plate 16 to hold the ball 26 within the socket 22. The ball 30 is then oriented within the socket 22 as desired by appropriately rotating the ball 26. Stated differently, the ball 26 is rotated in the socket 22 to establish a predetermined orientation of the bore 28 relative to the skull of the patient",
