It`s a long time, well since QPR, that I`ve seen Fulham take a side to the cleaners. But what made it the more enjoyable was the fact that the goals were classics and of such a standard that they had Martin Jol purring afterwards talking about them and also the contribution of one man in particular, with Jol commenting, \"We scored some great goals. The first was a great move.\" \"The second was amazing and the third was clever. If you could come up with ideas like that every week, you would be like Real Madrid in the golden days.\" \"For me, as a second striker Andy Johnson is one of the best. People say that if you play like that week in, week out, you should be in the England team.\" How about it Fabio? With Wayne Rooney suspended for the first three games of the Euro 2012 Finals and with it being rumoured that Fabio will be taking a look at various options, how about taking a look at AJ?
