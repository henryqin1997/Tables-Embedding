Redshirted in 2006 (Jimbo Fisher took over as FSU's offensive coordinator following the season). Debuted in '07, seeing action in just one game (Virginia Tech) and completing 8-of-18 pass attempts (44.4 percent) for 105 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. Took over in '08 when he started all 13 games and was the team's offensive MVP after passing 177-318-2,006-14-13 (55.7) with 119 rushes for 423 yards (3.6-yard average) and four touchdowns. Made nine starts in '09, tossing 227-330-2,717-14-7 (68.8) before suffering a Grade-3 separation of his right (throwing) shoulder against Clemson and undergoing season-ending surgery. Started all 12 games played in '10 and managed 184-299-2,044-20-8 (61.5) despite incurring a triceps contusion against Oklahoma and aggravating it against BYU; suffering a ruptured right bursa sac against Boston College (drained after Florida and underwent two procedures in December); and sustaining a concussion in the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Two-time elected team captain. Earned his undergraduate degree in 2\u00bd years. Named Senior Bowl MVP. Had a 22-13 career starting record.
