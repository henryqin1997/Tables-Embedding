            "The BU alert system is quick to text and email us when something happens. I don't ever not feel safe on campus, students are always around as well as security.",
            "So much to do...from quidditch to board and games club! Honestly it is not hard to find people on campus who are into the same things you are.",
            "Honestly, great for any type of student!",
            "Marathon Monday is tons of fun, classes are cancelled and students line up to go cheer on the Boston Marathon runners!",
            "BU is very expensive, but you are getting a good education. College is very expensive in general. If you're looking for a hard degree, the money is worth it, but if you are going for a degree you can get anywhere then it is not worth it. BU does give out money though generously.",
            "You have the entire city! There is so much to do to Boston, as well as tons of other schools to meet people. There are also tons of concerts if you're into music.",
            "Lots of different food and eatable, can get a little too weird sometimes and not always sanitary. But the staff is easy to contact and they will fix any problem.",
            "Very open dorms, easy to meet people and very clean. Space is typical for freshmen, but space gets bigger once you are a senior.",
            "Very hard to get an A, but not impossible. Professors push you to do your best.",
            "Make sure you get sleep! Try to plan to do you homework whenever you have a break, that way you can relax and get a good night's sleep. You'll be much more attentive through the day!",
            "Boston University is a large university. It is set in the city but has a campus feel. It is also extremely diverse, you will never go without friends."

Also, study hard because Boston University accepts mainly AP class kids and 2000 SAT score kids., 40346=As soon as I visited BU on Accepted Students Day in Spring of 2010 I knew I wanted to go here! Ever since it's been perfect. I can absolutely see myself here for the completion of my undergraduate career. The only reason why I'm not really considering it for graduate school is because of the weather - coming from Maine, I'm already sick of the winters. I always say that BU is in its own corner of Boston; if we want to stay only around college peers all we have to do is stay on campus, but there's literally a 5 minute walk to Kenmore Square, 10 minutes to Fenway, and 20 minutes to Newbury St. It's amazing!, 584975=It is what you make of it, Busy schedules don't leave a lot of time for social interaction on the floor. I met my roommate on BU facebook page class of 2017. We chatted for several weeks before we felt we were compatible. We love the same music, books, poetry and we are both science majors. Our floor has monthly meetings, but we haven't had any social outings yet., 548355=The new mean SAT score at BU is 2016, and it's rising every year-- 2013 had an all time low admittance rate of around 30%. It sits right across the river from the mavericks: MIT and Harvard-- and it's doing everything in its power to compete., 612040=Unfortunately, SATs are one of the most important things BU looks at when awarding financial aid. Make sure you score above a 1950 and you'll probably get a merit scholarship., 694949=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608687=There is a huge seal on the ground in Marsh Plaza (located in central campus) that is rumored to hold bad luck (namely, no diploma awarded) for those students who walk over it. After graduation in May, one can see many graduated seniors triumphantly standing on top of it, having their pictures taken., 225778=I love living in Warren Towers. It houses about 1800 students (primarily freshman) and you get that true dorm living lifestyle!, 329832=All dining foods are great. There are special nights in each dormitory where chefs come in and compete. The GSU (student union center) also has good food. There is a new dining place opening fall 2012 with a whole new variety. There are literally tons of good restaurants in nearby Boston that anyone could access although the food may be a little overpriced., 126853=Let this be a cautionary tale for those with tight budgets (or budgets at all...)- This is the only field I can really fill out- I just got accepted here as a transfer student, and I was nominated for a scholarship through my community college. Shortly after my acceptance, however, I received notice of my financial aid assistance. Out of the $50,000+ in tuition and fees, I was eligible to receive only $9,100, which includes the loans they offered me, which is a hole I am not planning on digging for myself. No- I did not receive my scholarship, and I was frankly not expecting to. A scholarship is a gift, a happy surprise. But still - the ONLY need-based aid they were willing to give me was my $2600 Pell Grant! Seriously? Let me give you my background- I am one of four children. We live in a *tiny* condo. Only *one* of my parents works full-time, and his pay schedule is at times unreliable. OK, we do have enough money to eat, be clothed, and have heating and electricity, but still! We don't go on exotic vacations. We do stay-cations in Boston. Or sometimes hop on a bus to NYC to visit my aunt and baby cousins. C'mon. I'm sorry, no matter how great of an academic/social/whatever experience other students have had, this is a big deal-breaker. I kind of hope this some mistake- someone forgot to add an extra zero, or they fell asleep at the calculator. But I am only too sure that I would be so wrong., 352084=You name it they have it. I am into music, accapella and theater groups. However, there are so many to mention. SPLASH, in September, is where they all come together.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here There is so much to do here! Thousands of students that provide student-led activities as well as the school providing stuff to do. For example, at BU Central, students book bands to come and play for students for FREE! The school also does things for students, like teh parade held last year to honor the hockey team in their national victory. Am learning a lot I've only given four stars due to my lack of interest in the required courses. I understand the purpose behind them, but they really put a damper on my enjoyment of my classes for my major. I absolutely love those classes (SMG Business) and the Professors are amazing!
