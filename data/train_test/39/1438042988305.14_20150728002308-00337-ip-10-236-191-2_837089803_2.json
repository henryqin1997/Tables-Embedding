According to IHS, the base station count will increase to 600,000 by 2017 while China Telecom and China Unicom lag behind with 400,000 and 300,000 stations respectively., 24254=IHS anticipates 4G growth to pick up pace gradually with the maximum growth coming in 2016 and 2017 as 3G is expected to be phased out by then. With more than a billion plus cell phone users, China Mobile offers a huge smartphone market, which is still being dominated by Android and iOS., 21507=The research firm expects 4G customer bases to surge from an expected 1 million in 2013 to 439.9 million in 2017 with China Mobile boasting the biggest share of 52%, followed by ChinaUnicom Limited (CHU - Analyst Report) with 26% and China Telecom Corp. (CHA - Snapshot Report) with the remaining 22%., 64338=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 64399=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors.
