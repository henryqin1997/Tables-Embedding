I love the fact that there are only 15-25 kids in each of my classes and that all my professors know me by name. Also, as a liberal arts school with widespread core requirements, I am taking classes in disciplines I never would have thought of and have found new subjects that are interesting to me. Another great thing about Regis is the fact that they have a free tutoring program, that's right free! There are tutors for nearly every subject and it is actually part of their workstudy to help you, so all you have to do is make an appointment. They also have a great Writing Center and Library where people are willing to help you with any part of writing a paper, whether it's research, grammar, or format., 160262=Regis University is a wonderful school with caring professors. It is a writing intensive university which has prepared me for my Master's program. Upon graduating in May, I feel I got a good education worth all the money I spent on the tuition., 354027=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 188621=There are about 11 trees on campus that have state and national recognition for their size, form and species. They are well cared for and tours are often taken on campus by botanical societies and gardeners. The campus is well groomed and cared for. Another interesting note is the Statue of Sacred Heart of Jesus at Regis University with Latin writing. A Latin scholar once read it and verified that there is no meaning to the words that are inscribed on the plaque. The statue however is beautiful, and one of many statues on campus which receive attention and recognition. Main Hall is the oldest building, built in 1887 and it marks the highest point in the Denver vicinity. It also supposedly has a cell phone tower transponder in the cross on top of the building because of its location., 126385=One fun activity to do on your own or with a friend on a cool September evening is walk around campus and find all the benches and study spots.}",

Tips for prospective students Visit the campus in the fall and during the winter. You need to get a good idea of what the campus is like during all times of the year. Talk to an advisor, make sure you know exactly what you need to do to get in, stay in, and finish your college career in a reasonable amount of time. Finally, try to talk to some current students who attend Regis. Get their perspective on it, ask any questions you may have, and see if the crowd seems like the type of crowd you would choose to be around. Bang for the buck While it is an expensive school,",
