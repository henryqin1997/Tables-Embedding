            "The campus is very safe, they have lights all over campus. They also have put up many areas that you can call security from along the trails and such.",
            "I don't like Greek Life. They wrote on my windows my first night ever on campus.",
            "There are a lot of intramural sports and clubs to join. The only issue with it is finding the time and the money to spend doing it. They often occur late in the afternoon or on weekends when many students would be working.",
            "USI is very good for science majors. You get to do a lot more hands on lab work with instruments you would not even be able to touch in a larger school.",
            "In the corner of the first floor of the library you can still find a typewriter.",
            "Often for fun you can go a little ways down the road and go to the theater. The campus is just right outside of the main parts of Evansville so a short drive can get you to the museum or mini-golf, etc.",
            "Most of the food on campus is really good, but not as good when you consider the price. The prices they charge are absolutely ridiculous.",
            "I was in an on-campus apartment my first two years. The best choice I ever made was to get an apartment off campus.",
            "Do not take too much in the beginning. Some advisers will push you to take more than what you can comfortably handle.",
            "Go to class before buying your books, and at the very least don't open them until you are 100% sure your professor requires them.",
            "There are plenty of very good professors, that are very enthusiastic about their field. In the meantime, there is a lack of microwaves and parking to be found on campus. The library is very large and has a ton of computers for the students to use, and a very helpful staff."

Most of my grief from my freshman year was that I was lonely and didn't have much too do.

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The campus is very well kept and the staff is extremely friendly. The advisors are more than willing to meet with you for any scheduling concerns, no matter how many times you need to see them. The groups and committees on campus offer many activities, such as new movies in the forums about twice a month or ice-skating during the winter. With all those kinds of activities, gym access, sports events, theater productions, etc., there is always something to do if you want. However, if you just want to take a break and relax, there are many quiet places to hang out or grab a cup of coffee on campus as well. Am learning a lot The amount you learn depends on the amount of effort YOU put into schooling. The professors, like at any other college, expect you to put time in outside of class to do your own studying. They do not spoon feed you all the information you need for tests, but are extremely willing to help when you do not understand things you are trying to learn on your own.
