Some big name bands come through; we have Old Crow Medicine Show coming in July and just had Lamb of God and Dropkick Murphy's in fall 2012. There is hiking, camping, fishing, hunting, snow sports, and pretty much any type of outdoor activity., 105708=Every October a Jack-O-Lantern mysteriously appears on the spire of the University Hall., 505018=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 256917=As a college student in today's economy, nothing is affordable. The nice thing about UM is that it gives away a lot of scholarships, but you need to apply early. It is an especially good deal if you are a Montana resident. It is also easy to work while you take classes, and if you start applying for jobs in August, you can get a good one on campus. The relatively inexpensive cost (compared to out-of-state schools) and the quality of the classes makes UM an excellent choice., 298969=Is this school a commuter campus? Also, if I have a 3.57 unweighted GPA (3.8 weighted) and a 1770 SAT score, what are the chances I will receive the WUE scholarship?, 380164=Every year around October someone places a pumpkin on the top of University Hall and it stays there year round. There is the Oval in the center of campus where people are always doing something., 59478=an unusual tradition on campus is every halloween night, the rock climbing club scales the clock tower and places a pumpkin on the very top. also, there is a 95 year old tradition of having a forester's ball at the end of january., 96623=the forester's ball since 1918, 146692=Unusual, well that is to be expected when an university established in 1879.}",

UM is such a varied type school. No matter what type of student you are, UM will have something for you. As a liberal arts college, there are of course all the art anyone could ask for. However, for those of you that are like me, there is also infinite possibilities in the world of math and science, English and literature. Tips for prospective students #1 Be on top of your game. Apply for deadlines early whether those are on housing deadlines, financial aid, or scholarships. #2 Use your resources. Professors and TA are there to help and to make your life easier. My TA's have been so incredibly helpful, and most them know the ins and outs at UM. Bang for the buck As a Montana",
