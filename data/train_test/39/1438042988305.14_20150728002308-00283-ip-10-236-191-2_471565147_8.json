Greater pressure will cause excessive drooling through the nozzle plate 6 and may cause the diaphragm to burst of become permanently deformed, thus hindering the operation of the regulator mechanism. As positive pressures will cause undesirable drooling through the nozzle plate, although a \"perfect\" pressure may be determined for any particular design in which purging is accomplished without simultaneous drooling, it is simpler to provide a printhead cap 1403 as part of the service station mechanism as would be well known in the art, thus preventing such adverse reactions., 31040=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/518847, filed on Aug. 24, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,992, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/331453, filed on Oct. 31, 1994, by Pawlowski et al., now U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,545, issued Dec. 10, 1996., 48376=FIG. 10B is a view taken in plane B--B, arrow 1001, of FIG. 10A., 71313=An air vent 819 (FIGS. 8 and 10A) via a channel 814 in the lid 813 is coupled through a hollow air standpipe 1111 (see also FIG. 11) to the diaphragm-sealed cavity 901 via an air inlet port 911 (FIGS. 9 and 10A). The cavity 901 is thus an air chamber maintained at local atmospheric pressure., 74814=Turning now to FIGS. 14A and 14B, any suitable mechanism 1401 for providing a positive pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is brought into contact with the apparatus of the present invention such that the positive pressure is applied to the vent 819 in the lid 813. Such pressure can be applied such as by a simple pump (not shown) incorporated into a service station mechanism of the hard copy apparatus in which the pen is used; preferable the operation is automated to make the purging process \"invisible\" to the end user. The positive air pressure will drive the diaphragm 823 outwardly from the cavity 901 as shown in FIG. 14B. Via the plunger 829, this opens the ink port 903. As the pressure increases, bubbles are now forced out of the ink accumulator chamber 3B through the ink port 903 an into the ink supply 1301 where they will not affect printhead performance. Note that an equivalent, fully mechanical mechanism can be designed and substituted for the positive air pressure mechanism used to force the diaphragm 823 to open the ink port 903., 73993=Air purging of the ink accumulator chamber 3B is accomplished in the following manner. FIGS. 13A and 13B depict a free-ink ink-jet pen embodiment as shown in FIGS. 8-12 onto which a piggy-back ink supply 1301, such as a disposable, replaceable ink-filled cartridge, has been fitted to supply port 847. In the condition shown, namely before purging, the ink supply 1301 has a partial volume of ink 1303 contained therein. The ink accumulator chamber 3B has a partial volume of ink 1303' shown in the snout portion 5 and air, or other gases, in the rest of the chamber 3B. As best seen in FIG. 13B, the regulator mechanism shows the diaphragm 823 at its unflexed position. Valve seat 872 is mated against the ink port 903. In order to fill the ink accumulator chamber 3B, the air therein must be purged., 75906=After purging, the positive pressure is removed. Then, in accordance with the normal regulator operation described above, ink 1303 flows from the supply 1301 into the ink accumulator chamber 3B due to the pressure differential. Since bubbles and vapor-saturated ink will be the \"lightest\", bubbles and vapor-saturated ink are forced out first by this method., 72205=A hollow ink standpipe 1101, FIG. 11, is on the opposing surface 1103 of the mount 860 as the raised chamber ridge 862. The standpipe 1101 fluidically couples the ink supply port 847 to a valved ink port 903 (FIGS. 9 and 12). Ink from the reservoir flows under pressure (atmospheric or higher) through the hollow bore 847' (FIGS. 8, 10A and 10B) of the ink supply port 847 and ink standpipe 1101 into ink accumulator chamber 3B. The opposing surface 905 (FIGS. 9 and 12) of the diaphragm 823 to that surface 1105 which forms an inner wall of cavity 901 is affixed to a plunger 829. Plunger 829 includes a fixed crossbar axle 907 (FIGS. 9, 11, and 12) which is rotatably fit into support bearings 909, 1109 of the mount 860. A biasing mechanism (not shown) analogous to the springs 31, 231, 531, 631 used in the previous embodiments is used to set the appropriate back-pressure set point. A valve 870 which carries a valve seat 872 is affixed to the plunger 829 such that the valve seat 872 mates with the ink port 903 when the diaphragm 823 is at its biased position to the predetermined back-pressure set point and the ink accumulator chamber 3B is substantially full (as is explained in detail with respect to previous embodiments). Thus, ink is not flowing from the off-axis supply, through the supply port 847 and the ink port 903 into ink accumulator chamber 3B until an atmospheric pressure to back-pressure imbalance occurs. That is, as with previous embodiments, when atmospheric pressure flexes the diaphragm 823 outwardly from the cavity 901 due to a pressure imbalance as in the accumulator chamber 3B is depleted, the plunger 829 swings on its axle 907, and the valve seat 872 is pulled away from the ink port 903, refilling the ink accumulator chamber 3B., 31377=This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/065,957, filed on May 21, 1993 by Seccombe et al., assigned to the common assignee of the present invention, titled INK PRESSURE REGULATOR FOR INK JET PRINTHEADS, and its continuation-in-part U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/409255, filed Mar. 23, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,650,811 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety., 32217=The art of ink-jet technology is relatively well developed. Commercial products such as computer printers, graphics plotters, and facsimile machines employ ink-jet technology for producing hard copy. The basics of this technology are disclosed, for example, in various articles in the Hewlett-Packard Journal, Vol. 36, No. 5 (May 1985), Vol. 39, No. 4 (August 1988), Vol. 39, No. 5 (October 1988), Vol. 43, No. 4 (August 1992), Vol. 43, No. 6 (December 1992) and Vol. 45, No. 1 (February 1994) editions, incorporated herein by reference. Ink-jet devices are also described by W. J. Lloyd and H. T. Taub in Output Hardcopy sic! Devices, chapter 13 (Ed. R. C. Durbeck and S. Sherr, Academic Press, San Diego, 1988)., 70311=A pen lid 813 has a depending, substantially planar, regulator mount 860 which inserts into the ink accumulator chamber 3B; the lid 813 effectively sealing the chamber 3B, as best seen in FIG. 9. The mount 860 includes a raised, chamber ridge 862 on one surface 864 of the mount such that the surface 864 and ridge 862 partially forming a cavity 901, FIG. 9. In the preferred embodiment, the ridge 862 is circular; however, other shapes can be adapted to a particular pen implementation. As with the embodiments of FIGS. 2 through 6, an ink impermeable, flexible diaphragm 823 is used. The diaphragm 823 has its periphery secured to the rim 866 of the ridge 862 in a fluid-tight, sealing manner. Thus, one surface 1105, FIG. 11, of the diaphragm 823 forms an inner wall for the cavity 901 and essentially makes it fluid tight. That is, although the regulator mechanism on the mount 860 is submerged in ink when ink accumulator chamber 3B is filled, no ink will enter the cavity 901., 41493=One such method for purging a pen is shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/519,384, filed by R. W. Hall on Aug. 25, 1995, and assigned to the common assignee of the present invention. A gas separation and purge mechanism is incorporated into a pen body construct having an on-axis ink containment chamber designed such that gases will rise toward the mechanism. A vacuum is cyclically applied to the gas separation and purge mechanism to remove the gas bubbles and to allow the ink containment chamber to refill from a remote reservoir as needed., 77123=Note that bubbles can also be flushed or purged in accordance with the present invention from either the ink supply reservoir (such as by using the invention as set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/519384) or from any conduit between the pen and an off-axis ink supply reservoir (as taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/566644, filed on Dec. 4, 1995 by N. Pawlowski, Jr., assigned to the common assignee of the present invention, and incorporated herein by reference).}",
