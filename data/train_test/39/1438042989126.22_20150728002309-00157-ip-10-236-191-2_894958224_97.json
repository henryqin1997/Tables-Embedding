            "As far as campus safety goes there are peds which each student who lives in a dorm has, and this ensures that no one can enter into that building unless they have one, so no random people will walk in unless they are guests. There is the campus police who is on duty at all times and are very easy to contact. Also, along with the police is the campus security, so here at BGSU it is safe for the most part.",
            "For fun there are many different organizations that you can join, and then of course there's your typical weekend college parties.",
            "The food and dining has a bit of a variety. If you choose to eat in the union then you can choose from panda express and steak escape just to name a couple. The dining halls are buffet style and served similar things, but you can eat as much as you want.",
            "Some dorms are shared amongst two people and others just you by yourself. There are ones that have a community bathroom and the others have a bathroom within the dorm room itself, which is shared with just you and your roommate. Not all have air, and some have to wait for the heat to be turned on by a main heater, and then they are allowed to control it. Most dorms have a theme for each hall, which is really cool.",
            "There is a thing called academic probation. This is for students who do not maintain a GPA of 2.2 or higher, if you are placed on this then you will need to meet the standards in order to continue the following semester.",
            "Be on time, prepared, and stay up on your readings for class.",
            "Bowling Green State University is the perfect size campus for incoming students. The teachers here are all very friendly and waiting to help you with whatever is needed. Also, there are many activities to become involved in so JOIN!"

At BGSU we seriously have something for everyone... from Warm Up BG to TOMS CLUB to Greek Life. It all just depends on who you want to be associated with in College... Parties are everywhere so there won't be a problem finding one... EVER!, 805574=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 193911=Right now our Greek life is under construction. In 2016 we will have all brand new fraternity and sorority houses built. I'm not involved in Greek life but my friends that are say that it is a little bit expensive but still a great experience., 760441=There are many things to do for fun at BGSU. There are many organizations and clubs you can join. I joined an outdoor activities program where we go on many trips together, it has been a blast. I also joined a few Christian Organizations where you gathered together on campus performing activities and worshipping. I also studied abroad in Argentina. It was the best experience of my life and BGSU made the process very smooth. There are many different events/concerts and sports events. Our football team was the 2013 MAC Champions so they are always fun to watch., 344072=The weather is a little so-so sometimes; the wind is something to get used to. But overall, it's a great place. I attended the 2011 fall semester, and didn't attend the spring semester and I greatly missed having so much to do and look forward to returning., 722748=Bowling Green State University's football team was a ranked team this year, and definitely is getting better and better each year! On campus there are many restaurants, bars and clubs to spend time at. There are also lots of festivities with freebies happening multiple times per month. Hockey games are also definitely a must when attending Bowling Green, the stadium is always packed and in spirit! The union has a movie theater, and food options until 2:30 in the morning. Even in the middle of the night during the week, there always seems to be something happening on campus!, 752481=Bowling Green offers more than I ever thought it would. There's an on campus medical center if you ever aren't feeling well. The library offers so many awesome things as well. If you just need to talk to someone, there are counselors and psychologists available for you to talk to for free! There are video and sound recording devices you can rent, bikes you can use, TV's everywhere, along with plugs for laptops and phones. The Rec center is currently being amazingly updated and I am so monumentally excited for when that is done later in 2014. BG has so much to offer, it really is worth the money you put in., 321304=Some tips I would share with prospective students would be to visit BGSU. I had never even considered going there until my friend offered to take me on a visit, once i took my first few steps on the gorgeous campus ground I knew it was THE one. I would also tell them to apply early and choose BGSU before October so that they could sign up for housing and be housed in the brand new Cenntenial dorms that have their own bathrooms., 415226=There are truly many different levels of academics at BGSU. Some classes range from 1000-4000 levels, with the top being the most difficult. However, BGSU is very helpful in the sense that the earlier classes prepare students for the later classes (which will be taken during the junior and senior years). Also, although students are expected to excel in the classroom and give adequate effort, professors are extremely helpful and an unbelievable amount of resources are offered to students in order to accommodate any difficulty that they may encounter. As a student you are expected to put effort into your studies, but you'll find that you are never alone and there is someone who wants to see you succeed at every turn., 427687=Campus is a very safe place. There are lights all over the place to make sure no one is walking completely in the dark and a shuttle runs until 2:30 a.m. on weekends or 10:00 p.m. on weekdays to get people around campus or even take them off campus. There are emergency phones within eyesight everywhere on campus., 685642=For fun, you can always tour downtown and go to the many places that are downtown (which is not far from campus at all). There are normally events on campus such as huge movies nights that are held outside on a LARGE projector. BGSU will also have a completely new Recreations center in the fall of 2014 where you can participate in multiple activities such as basketball, racquetball, rock climbing, swimming etc. There is also a lot of fun within your own dorms, such as ping-pong tables, pool tables, etc., 123714=I would go to one of BGSU's preview days. I went to one in October and I learned much about the school, majors, financial aid, and housing.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students All Majors Tips for prospective students Just make friends, fill out scholarships, and make the best of the options given to you. Bang for the buck All of the food places around BGSU offer discounts so it very affordable for college students. There are many places such as BW3s and Dairy Queen. The school also offers a lot of scholarships and it sometimes leads to people getting BIG refund checks. Am enjoying being here BGSU campus is not too small or too big. Its not a very urban environment but, if you just want to escape to the city sometimes you can go to Toledo its only 20 minutes away. I have many friends and I love my dorm. Am learning a lot BGSU has great entering freshman programs that help you learn and understand a lot about the campus. It also is good for undecided students and it helps you find your major quicker. There are also many places that offer free tutoring and the teachers are very accessible. Login to rate",
