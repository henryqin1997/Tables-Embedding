            "I recommend Volunteer State Community College to any type of student; whether you are budget conscious, working full-time, or simply unsure of what major you're interested in, VolState is the place to be!",
            "I recommend working with an Admission Counselor on making your schedule. If you know where you will be transferring to VolState will work with the other school on making your schedule to ensure that all the classes you will take at VolState will transfer.",
            "Volunteer State Community College is as cheap as it gets! Tennessee HOPE Scholarship covers most of your expenses, but VolState has other scholarships you can apply for to cover the extra, unforeseen costs.",
            "I loved the atmosphere a VolState! The campus is big enough to feel like a college, but small enough that you don't feel like just another face in the crowd. The teachers are personable and actually remember your name! There are plenty of extracurricular activities to involve yourself in, on and off campus.",
            "I attended Volunteer State Community College for my freshman year. Choosing VolState was the best decision I made regarding my education. VolState has a very flexible program, including multiple locations. I took all of my classes on the main Gallatin campus. I experienced every type of education available. I took MWF, Tues.,Thurs., night, online classesvand even a Maymester class (which is a 15 week class done in 15 days). Every professor I had at VolState was supportive, encouraging, entertaining, and understanding. I never had a teacher turn me away when I needed help after class. Most made themselves available to their students night and day."

At just under $2000 for 12 credit hours, you will receive a sound education, and a taste of the college experience. It is an unbeatable price, and Volunteer State has not seemed to cut any necessary corners to make it possible.}",

Most of my friends went to MTSU, Austin Peay, or Tennessee Tech after high school. The big universities didn't appeal to me because I didn't want my focus to shift away from my education and on to other things. Those who are very school-oriented would do well here, as well as those who are paying to go themselves and want the best they can get for as little as they can get it. It's a great start to a college career with success in mind. Tips for prospective students Study up! Meaning: This is a good school, however you shouldn't just settle for any school. Choose one that fits what you are looking for and what",
