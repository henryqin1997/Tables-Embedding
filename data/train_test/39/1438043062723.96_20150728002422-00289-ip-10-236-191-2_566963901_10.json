            "So I read parts of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles a long time ago, but I never really got the whole story. I'm planning on re-reading it, but I'm not sure whether I should read xxxHOLIC before or after Tsubasa. I realize they were going on at the same time, so should I go back and forth between them? Also, I've read Chobits, which, from what I've seen, has a minimal amount to do with TRC, but it was useful. So is Cardcaptor Sakura also useful, and should I maybe read it first? What about RG Veda (it's on my wish list)? Thanks. Last edited by unusuallove at 12:43 am, Feb 22",

            "I'm not gonna say the way I did it was right and I'm certainly no expert on how the works of Clamp intertwine but I watched the xxxHolic anime first and got interested in the group's other works. The anime doesn't have as much, or really anything, about Tsubasa like the manga does so there's not too much confusion. Then I went back and read Cardcaptor Sakura because it happens first in this timeline. After that, I read Tsubasa and because I was already familiar with the xxxHolic characters, it was a little more clear. And finally, I'm in the middle of reading xxxHolic now. I think my brain just exploded a little trying to explain that haha ________________ *sigh* All the good ones are either gay or fictional. How does a girl catch a break?

            "I read xxxHolic before I'd ever heard of TRC and it worked out fine. The parts that intersected were minimal. Really, you just need to accept the things you don't understand and keep reading and you should be fine. Though, certainly, there were various parts that I only understood after reading TRC. Many things are alluded to in xxxHolic that are only explained in TRC. After a certain point I found TRC very confusing, so the knowledge I had from xxxHolic in the few times they intersect was helpful. But I wouldn't try going back and forth between them. They don't intersect enough for me to see that as really working."
