I graduated from Grace University with a Bachelors in Bible and Elementary Education and an endorsement in ESL. Immediately after graduation, I moved to China and taught ESL at an International school for three years. I then moved back to the U.S. and taught for one year on the Navajo Reservation. The following year, I moved to the city where I met and married my husband. I now have beautiful baby girl and am working part-time from home as a tutor and free-lance writer. Throughout all of these life changes, writing has been a passion \ufffd a way to express and communicate my experiences and perceptions, a way to help myself process and understand life, a way to allow my imagination to soar. \u00a0About Self 39 Articles written: Member Stats",
