            "There are emergency call boxes located throughout the campus. Twenty-four hours, seven days a week, the campus police are available to help anyone in need. There is constant crime prevention patrol by foot, bike, and car.",
            "There is no Greek Life on this campus.",
            "Being involved in activities on campus is a great way to enjoy attending this college. There is ceramic, Christian fellowship movie making, sign language, African culture, and comic book clubs to name a few. Many of these clubs have community involvement and provide a way to meet other students who have similar interests to you.",
            "Students interested in saving money and getting a solid education should attend Waubonsee Community College. Students who enjoy smaller class sizes similar to high school.",
            "There are not any unusual traditions or locations on this campus.",
            "Waubonsee Community College is worth every penny because it provides a necessary education and prepares students for four year universities. It allows students to save money before moving away, and is easy to attend while having a part time or full time job.",
            "There is a wide range of activities every day on campus. There are plenty of clubs to choose from and Student Services provides unique opportunities for students to be involved. There are music groups to be a part of including the chorale and band. There is a coffee bar in the cafeteria and plenty of benches and shady spots to sit and have conversations with friends between classes.",
            "There is an on-campus cafeteria which provides meals and is a good hang out spot. There is a range of healthy food to junk food choices. The food is prepared well and is not too expensive.",
            "There are no dorms available for students at this community college.",
            "Students will feel challenged, but as long as they do their work, they will be able to maintain good grade point averages. Students need to make an effort to be in contact and communication with their professors. The work is more advanced than high school and is appropriate for community college.",
            "Prospective students will enjoy the atmosphere and will still get the college experience even though it is not a four year university. Students will be able to obtain their general education requirements while saving money. It is easy for students with their two-year degrees to transfer to four-year colleges from Waubonsee Community College.",
            "Waubonsee Community College provides an excellent diverse learning environment and makes students transitioning from high school or people returning to college to continue their education feel comfortable. The campus is easy to navigate and teachers are outgoing and easy to work with. Students and teachers at this institution are from different counties, states, and even countries."

Their dual placement program with 4 year institutions is awesome! You will save alot of money by going this route. Instead of paying $1000-$2000 a class you'll pay about $300.

Bang for the buck I am saving SO MUCH MONEY! It was hard for me to opt for a community college instead of a 4 year school right away, but it was well worth it. Definitely! Am enjoying being here Pretty campus, nice teachers, great schedules & opportunities. Very convenient & student friendly. Am learning a lot The classes are small with a lot of individual attention, I was nervous after taking some time off after high school, that college classes would catch me off guard, but this is a great place to start your learning & get into the college level work load.
