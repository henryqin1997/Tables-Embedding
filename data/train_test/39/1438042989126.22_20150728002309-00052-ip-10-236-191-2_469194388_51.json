Your Sea Dog Base Rail Fitting 90 Rectangular 7/8\" (35102 281900-1 or 92564 286190-1)looks close but you don\u2019t provide the bolt spacing. My spacing is 7/8\" vertically and 2 3/8\" horizontally (centre - centre). Will either of these fittings work?, 201440=I snipped about 1 foot of my bow rail off (the V on the bow rail) so I can access the boat easily (I bow into my slip) It has indeed inhibited the integrity of the entire railing on my boat. It is 1998 20 ft. Proline cuddy cabin/walkaround outboard. This boat is not manufactured with re-enfourced railing where it meets the gunnal. That said, I\u2019m looking for hardware that would slip around the railing supports (2 halves or hinged)to anchor the railing to the boat hull to make it sturdy. Unless there is a product that will allow re-enforcement without having to penetrate the gunnal would be ideal., 206302=35102 281900-1 c to c holes 2-3/8\" x 1\" 92564 286190-1 c to c holes 2-2/16\" x 1\" It is unlikely that you will find the 7/8\" spacing - but 1\" is close enough. 35102 looks to be the closest.}",
