    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations 9. The multiplications and divisions of dimensions with dimensionless numbers are operated upon measure numbers. 8. The additions and subtractions are operated upon metric equivalents and the results converted back to U.S. units. 7. Dimension in U.S. units enter and are processed in calculator only as measure numbers. Their metric equivalents are processed on values of whole dimensions. 6. Multilane displays dually in U.S. and metric units any input and every output. This is the basis for conversion into metric in both usual and dual dimensioned drawings. 5. All conversions into metric start from measure numbers. 4. Any keyed measure number is displayed on screen 30 and can be read as the whole sub-dimension in conjunction with the facing denomination from line 20. 3. The unit (Ft, In or /x) of each measure number is specified by the lane used for its entry. 2. Each lane is designated to a single unit species. 1. It deals directly only with the measure numbers (\u0192, i, n) of any dimension (\u0192.Ft-i.In-n/x), where x is the denominator of any inch fraction. The particularities of Multilane: CONCLUSION It will be understood that diverse omissions, additions of extra functions, or changes in forms, details and operation may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the essence of the invention. Multilane requires KS uniquely for the measure numbers, that is only for about 40% of those",
