Many enterprises are already using modeling to streamline their application development. The sessions will explore how enterprises, such as UBS and Bosch have used Eclipse technology to implement a modeling strategy. Eclipse modeling experts will also provide a review of the core Eclipse modeling technology that enables key enterprise modeling features, including data modeling, graphical modeling, model repositories and textual modeling. Finally, a presentation on the Eclipse Modeling Platform will show how an integrated Eclipse-based platform can provide the flexibility and extensibility required for large-scale enterprise model driven development. Eclipse Enterprise Modeling Day is for IT architects and IT strategists who are exploring a model driven development approach for their enterprise application development.
