    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{7654=This pool was initially pronounced the Pool of Death, and three weeks later, I see no reason to change that assessment. The University of Miami is the favorite to top this group after spending all of 2013 beating up on southern squads. In 2013, Miami is 11-0 with no matches being decided by Snitch catches. The fall saw an equally strong Miami performance as they posted a 10-2 record. The only two losses happened on the team\u2019s trip to California in October, both to the University of Southern California (Los Angeles, CA), who was a stronger squad then than they are now. On that same trip, Miami picked up their best win of the season over the University of California Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA). With superb seeking from David Moyer, Miami is one of the most well rounded squads, and they have the ability to pull out of tight games. They also have the intangible benefits of a short journey without a flight, and of being accustomed to the warm weather., 44359=Northern Arizona University has only competed at regionals this spring, and at that tournament none of their performances were overly impressive. They beat a relatively weak Cal squad 80*-40, and they do have two wins over Arizona State University (Tempe, AZ) and a win over Austin Quidditch (Austin, TX) from the fall, but I don\u2019t find any of those wins to be particularly impressive: although Arizona State is a good team, October was a long time ago. At Western Cup IV, NAU was decimated by the University of California-Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA) 170*-10, and lost to a depleted USC squad 140-90*. NAU also may be competing without their seeker, Porter Marsh, who broke his leg at Western Cup IV., 202659=The popularity of Muggle Quidditch has been growing rapidly around the world since the formation of the International Quidditch Association, which was founded in 2010 as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. The organization\u2019s CEO and Co-Founder is Alex Benepe, who was one of the original players at Middlebury College with Manshel. Currently, there are over 800 registered teams with the IQA around the world that follow a specific set of standards and rules adapted for the game. Each year, typically in April, the IQA hosts the Quidditch World Cup that places the top teams in the world against each other in a weekend tournament.\u00a0The IQA has become the USQ , United States Quidditch, and the IQA Congress, which oversees Quidditch worldwide. This change took effect July 1, 2014. The USQ is also divided into leagues throughout the United States and Canada., 13963=This is Maryland\u2019s pool to lose, and I don\u2019t see that happening. UMD has lost just once this year: in the finals of the regional tournament to Villanova. Outside of that defeat, they own two victories over Hofstra (Hempstead, NY), a win over Tufts (Medford, MA), two over Ohio State (Columbus, OH), and wins over just about everyone in the Mid-Atlantic, other than Villanova. In addition, Maryland has caught more Snitches than any other team, led by chaser/seeker hybrid Harry Greenhouse. UMD is a strong team, and should do decently in the tournament; I don\u2019t anticipate any struggles in this pool for them. They have already faced pool-mate Macaulay this year, winning 100*-0 in February., 148720=Quidditch is an intense, co-ed contact sport played by over 300 teams around the world. This April, 80 of those teams will descend upon North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to crown the sport\u2019s world champion \u2013 the winner of the seventh annual IQA World Cup., 208898=In 2014, the IQA became US Quidditch, which manages the sport within the US. The new IQA took on a more international management and developmental position for the sport., 43290=Florida State will try to benefit from their competitors\u2019 lack of activity this spring. Florida State has already played in three tournaments this year, notably winning the Rocky Top Rumble hosted by Tennessee Technological University (Cookeville, TN). While they have had the benefit of competing, Florida State has not been overly impressive. They beat a field that included a number of relatively weak Southern Region squads at the Rocky Top Rumble, and came within one game of missing a World Cup spot at the regional championship. At the Florida Quidditch Conference meet in February, Florida State finished with a 2-2 record, losing to the University of Florida (Gainesville, FL) and the University of South Florida (Tampa, FL). Florida State has been very average all year, and has not beaten a single team of the caliber of any of the three previously mentioned teams., 148896=April 5-6, 2014 North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, 209309=Finland joined the US and Canada in 2011 for World Cup V. Over 10,000 fans came to watch this tournament, where 96 teams performed in New York City., 30959=Central Michigan and Austin, neither of which is a threat to BU or Nova should have a hotly contested battle for third in this pool. While Central Michigan snuck into the World Cup, don\u2019t let that fool you; they are a good team. This spring they have played a lot of games, including contests against nearly every World Cup team in the Midwest, which is quite a strong and sizable contingent. While Central Michigan boasts just a 2-5 record against World Cup bound teams in 2013, their matches against good teams have been close. They own a win over the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI) and relatively narrow losses over Bowling Green State University (Bowling Green, OH), 100*-20 and 90*-40, Ball State University (Muncie, IN), 80*-10, and Michigan. The key thing to note about all those scores is how few points Central Michigan scored. Excepting a few games, Central Michigan has had trouble scoring points, which could plague them at the World Cup; still they\u2019re a talented squad., 147253=The brand-new North Myrtle Beach Sports Complex will hold its official grand opening on April 5-6, the weekend of World Cup VII. Check back here in the coming months for more information about the layout of the tournament site., 58398=On paper, Minnesota seems like a formidable squad, but that\u2019s only if one looks at the name written on the top of the page and nothing else. Yes, Minnesota made the Final Four last year, but this year they\u2019ve shown no ability to repeat that achievement. They underwhelmed at the Midwestern Regional Championship in November, and rebounded decently at the Spring Breakout before falling to Kansas 90*-40 in the finals. Of course, nobody saw their run last year coming, and a lot of the talent is still there, even though they did not advance very far at the Midwestern Regional Championship. Still, there\u2019s something to be said for having the experience of a World Cup run; their leadership will know what needs to be done., 201105=In June 2013, Muggle Quidditch was featured prominently in the motion picture The Internship., 142915=QWC Coverage April 5-6 from North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, 203271=Muggle Quidditch was founded in 2005 at Middlebury College by then-freshman Xander Manshel. Looking for a variation on their normal Sunday activities, Manshel and his friends laid the foundation for a game that has grown in leaps and bounds to become a widely respected, physically intense sport., 200626=April 11-12, 2015 Rock Hill, South Carolina, 201777=In April 2013 at the Quidditch World Cup VI, the University of Texas at Austin was the first team aside from Middlebury College to be crowned Quidditch Champion with their defeat of UCLA in the final match by a score of 190-80. The livestream of the finals match gained over 8,000 views. In commemoration of Texas\u2019s victory, the University of Texas at Austin illuminated the Main Building on campus, an honor also given to recognize Big 12 Conference championships., 209141=2012 saw the first bi-annual Global Games, which had teams from the US, Canada, the UK, France, and Australia perform in Oxford, England. This event sparked interest and growing popularity of the sport all around the world., 209620=The sport became international in 2008, when the first non-US team, a Canadian team from McGill University of Quebec, debuted in the first World Cup championship. As the sport gained popularity, it was decided that more formal leadership was needed. As a result, the IQA was created in 2010., 60225=If all of these teams were at full strength, this would be quite the pool to watch. However, USC has been devastated by injuries recently, and are really just a shell of the team they were at the beginning of the season. Keeper August L\u00fchrs should return to lead USC after missing Western Cup IV, but the team will still likely be without star chaser Remy Contaser and beater Spencer Gold. With USC, a top-10 team earlier this year, so hampered by injuries, Emerson is the clear favorite in this pool., 204378=Quidditch falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, part of the Ministry of Magic. The professional organization is called the International Association of Quidditch. Professional matches are attended by trained mediwizards, and while there are many injuries, there are few deaths from Quidditch accidents. However, referees have been known to disappear completely only to turn up weeks later in the middle of the Sahara Desert. There are seven hundred possible ways to commit a foul in Quidditch, all of which occurred in a World Cup match held in 1473., 37616=Texas State is not the only team in this pool that is an expert at winning close games; Michigan State has made a habit of it this spring. In their first four games of 2013 against World Cup-bound competition, Michigan State has had all of their matches decided by Snitch catches. In those games, they are 3-1, including a 2-0 record in overtime. Both Texas State and Michigan State have had excellent performances from their seekers, which should make a game between these two particularly exciting, and these contests could very easily decide the pool., 32693=Villanova deserves to be a top seed. Had they not sent a mediocre squad lacking most of their starters to Charlottesville, VA for A Cup Worth Fighting For, they would likely have been placed into Pot 1 and would never match up against BU in pool play. At that February tournament, Villanova went 0-3 and saw their ranking plummet. Outside of those losses, Nova has just one defeat on the year, 120*-100 to Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, MD) in September. Villanova also boasts impressive victories over an excellent Maryland squad and a great Hofstra University (Hempstead, NY) team., 59267=South Florida will have no such difficulties. Whereas none of their pool competitors will travel fewer than 1000 miles, USF has the luxury of a measly 75-mile commute. This lack of travel combined with familiarity with the weather could provide a major advantage. As far as gameplay is concerned, South Florida has been a difficult team to read this year. They\u2019ve played well against the University of Miami (Coral Gables, FL), clearly the region\u2019s top team, but have also lost to the University of Florida (Gainesville, FL), which carries no shame; and University of Southern Mississippi, a game they simply should not lose. The Southern Region is one of the most isolated regions, with teams rarely traveling to other areas, so it\u2019s tough to predict how they will fare in relation to teams from other regions, but my hunch is USF may be overrated., 59699=Emerson may be hampered by their location. Based in Boston, where winter weather is much more of an obstacle than in Los Angeles or Tampa, Emerson has yet to play an official game in 2013. While they were sharp at their last tournament of 2012, the North Eastern Regional Championship\u2013which they made the finals of\u2013they may need to shake off some rust at the World Cup while adapting to a very different climate., 201294=Quidditch World Cup VII will be held at the North Myrtle Beach Sports Complex on April 5-6, 2014. This promises to be the most intense tournament of Muggle Quidditch ever., 209809=Xander Manshel and Alex Benepe created Muggle Quidditch in 2005 at Middlebury College. Intramural games became regular, and in 2007 they played the first official match., 33435=This pool features what I think will be the best game of pool play: Villanova vs. Boston University. BU is one of the best teams in the world. Led by Team USA chaser Kedzie Teller, and Team USA reserve keeper Brendan Stack, BU ran the table at the Northeastern Regional Championship, with all of their wins outside of Snitch range. That they could dominate a strong Tufts team as completely as they have this year, two wins: 160*-10 and a160*-40 shows Boston University\u2019s strength. BU has lost just once this season, in October to Emerson, but they have also yet to play an official game in 2013. This relative inexperience could harm them come bracket play, but regardless with such strong play they will be tough to top.}",

Well, this sparked Dad\u2019s interest and he mentioned it to me and my younger brother Joseph. Not only did I then discover it was in Oxford, I also realized that it was less than 5 miles away in Cutteslow Park in North Oxford., 83475=Nimbus 1500, 83217=Nimbus 1000, 83733=Nimbus 2000}",

UMass finished 2-2 in pool play, receiving the 14th seed in the bracket. A 70*-30 win over the University of Vermont (Burlington, VT) placed UMass in the Round of 16, where they squared off with Boston University (Boston, MA). UMass could not get by BU, falling into the loser\u2019s bracket with a 70-30* loss. In the quarterfinals of that bracket, UMass took out Vassar College (Poughkeepsie, NY) 80*-40. They still had not yet earned their berth, as they fell to Rochester Institute of Technology (Rochester, NY) 40*-20 with a spot on the line.
