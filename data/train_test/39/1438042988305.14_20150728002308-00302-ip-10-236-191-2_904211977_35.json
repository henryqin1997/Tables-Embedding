From tenting for basketball games to volunteering with the clubs on campus there are soo many things to do. Also downtown Spokane is just a quick walk and there is ice skating, the annual Bloomsday run in May, different restaurants and shops too., 267910=TENTING! Tenting is a must do if you go to Gonzaga. What it is is when there is a big men's basketball game the Kennel Club (people that help distribute tickets) sends out a text at about 12:15 and it says where the location of them is so that you can get a number. This number is the tent that you get. If you get in the top 5 tents that guarantees you front row seats. The whole thing is an EXPERIENCE! And one that is on every zag's undergraduate bucket list., 168357=I want to go to this school in the fall of 2013 because of what I've researched and what people who have seen the campus told me. Its a wonderful school, beautiful campus and great community service opportunities- which i love to do. Even though the school is expensive and some of the reviewers I'm reading is bad and not encouraging, that will not stop me from attending the college I'm interested in., 261230=Visit the campus during the months of January, February, or March. If you love the campus then, you will love it most of the time. Those months are the gloomy months and can bring down moods if you come from a place with warmer weather like I did.}",

People who like community. People who can handle work. People who like business or engineering. Tips for prospective students It gets cold here. There are some creepy people in Spokane's Logan neighborhood which the campus is surrounded on 3 of 4 sides. Don't choose Marian Hall if you don't want to walk",
