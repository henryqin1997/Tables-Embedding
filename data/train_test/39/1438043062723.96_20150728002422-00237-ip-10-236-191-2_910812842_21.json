            "From the Bulldog Taxi Service to the UMD Safewalk, you'll be perfectly fine. Cops are usually hanging around campus on the weekends, and NAs and RAs will watch out for you as well. Off campus, though, don't walk around alone at night.",
            "TKE isn't as awful as everybody says it is. It can get pretty dirty there on the weekends during their parties, but nobody is going to rape you. I know a few people from TKE who are really great people. I have a few friends in the main sorority, also. I'm not sure what it's called, but from what I've heard about it, I may join this upcoming semester. Greek life is frowned upon by the council in Duluth so there aren't huge houses specifically for the frats/sororities.",
            "I'm too busy with work, but a lot of the clubs seem fun.",
            "Obviously great for students who love the outdoors, and those who like to ski, snowboard, and play in the snow love it here.",
            "It's nice that you don't have to pay for any credits after 13. Watch out for the potential health plan that the school adds onto your tuition bill if you don't show proof of insurance. A lot of my friends were out $1000-2000 until they realized they were added to the plan and got out of it, which isn't possible after the first few weeks.",
            "There are a lot of places in Duluth to go out and have fun. There's a lot of trails and hiking opportunities, and it's amazing being by Lake Superior. It's obviously a lot harder to go out and do stuff in the winter since there's 5 feet of snow on the ground and it's -10 degrees outside, but there's always something to do on campus.",
            "I can always find something to eat, but being someone who is picky, most everything in the Dining Center is gross to me. The Food Court is very pricy but usually has decent food, and you get $175 per semester in Dining Dollars to use there or in the coffee shop. The coffee shop is amazing and has a lot of gluten-free options. The bagels there are delicious",
            "It isn't bad. I live in Lake Superior Hall, and it isn't as terrible as everybody says it is. Yes, it is smaller, but it's still alright. It's harder to connect with my floormates since we're all in separate halls on the same floor, but the ones in the rooms surrounding me have become close friends. The RA tries to have floor activities but a lot of people don't show up.",
            "Professors will definitely make or break your grade. A lot of them grade fairly but I did have one professor that graded based off of her opinion of your opinions. If you had differing opinions, you weren't graded very well. Science classes can be difficult and a study buddy is definitely recommended."

Don't be concerned with the cold Minnesotan weather, dorms are connected to the campus via a heated sky walk so flip-flops and shorts are often worn year round. Plenty of UMD scholarships are available to apply for before May of each year., 107955=The Dining Center's foods average at best (and utterly mysterious sometimes). There's an ice cream machine too but it's normally broken down or the ice cream is bad. The hours are from 7:30 to 7:30 which isn't good. The coffee shop has great atmosphere though it's weekend hours aren't anything to brag about (it's closed on sunday). There also is a Food court with a 50's themed burger place, an italian and a sub place. The only one open until 10 would the the italian place otherwise everything else's hours vary widely.}",

Although Duluth has nasty winters, you wont need to go outside between classes because everything is connected by a concourse system ;) Tips for prospective students Apply early, and turn in your housing deposit early! Meet people and get involved, I missed out on a lot first semester because I did not join many clubs. Bang for the buck I have not compared tuition, but its likely just as costly as any other liberal arts college. Am enjoying being here Duluth is a great city and dorm life is comfortable. I am however transferring to a",
