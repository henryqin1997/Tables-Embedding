USARSA offers a wide spectrum of courses ranging from professional development training to training for cadets, officers, and enlisted personnel of participating Latin American countries. On 19 November 1982, eighty-eight infantry officer candidates from Honduras received their commissions, becoming the first officer candidate class to graduate from USARSA in its thirty-six year history. A total of 41,283 students from twenty Latin American countries have graduated since 1946 when USARSA was founded., 34065=The Army began testing the management and accountability of Army materiel at Fort Hood, Texas, this fiscal year. The one year test, which started in March 1983, monitored simplified procedures for documenting the loss adjustment of hand tools and conducting inventories of property belonging to III Corps. The purpose of the test was to examine the effects of current property regulations and procedures at the unit level, while still maintaining effective property responsibility. Test initiatives included considering hand tools costing less than $5.00 as expendable; authorizing unit commanders to adjust losses of hand tools when no negligence is suspected, where the total gross value of each loss does not exceed $100.00; maintaining at company level a document registering both expendable and durable items; and providing a clear definition of the responsibilities of the officer in charge and guidance to the personnel conducting the surveys and approving the survey reports., 16757=The Army initiated efforts this year to develop a new computer system to support transportation. The TC ACCIS will link the Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) with installation transportation offices throughout CONUS. The Defense Communications Agency and the Joint Deployment Agency are developing the prototype system, which the Army hopes to test as a joint system in May 1985. The Army also continued to develop other automated systems begun in previous years. The development of the DASPS-E made progress toward a fielding target date of May 1985. In FY 83, the Army conducted a Software Qualification Test (SQT) and continued to produce DASPS-E hardware with delivery expected to be on schedule for all eleven sites. The Army also made progress developing a functional description for the DAMMS Redesign, an on-line interactive system to manage the theater transportation pipeline and commit and manage theater-level truck assets. The Army hopes to complete DAMMS Redesign in November 1984 and to field the DAMMS Movement Planning Module, to USAREUR in January 1985 and to EUSA in February 1985. The DAMMS Movement Planning Module automates the theater wartime movements program and provides the capability to analyze transportation networks, intermediate trans-ship points, and receipt and asset capabilities., 5438=Switzerland has continued its negotiations to both procure and coproduce the basic TOW and the basic Stinger missile systems. The Swiss also announced, on 24 August 1983, that they were acquiring 210 German Leopard-2 tanks, after three years of testing and evaluating both the U.S. M 1 tank and the Leopard-2 tank. Among the reasons for choosing the Leopard-2 tank were availability date of 1984 versus 1986 for MI, greater participation in coproduction combined with lower overall total cost, and the fact that the Leopard-2 \"speaks German.\", 31168=FY 83 also was a period of extensive improvement in TAEDP capabilities. Enhancements to TAEDP included an innovative requisition validation system, war reserve comparison/deviation products, a Force Integration Staff Officer worksheet report, Army Modernization Information Memorandum worksheet and the incorporation of fiscal year funding into the TAEDP distribution scheme. Ongoing enhancements nearing completion by September 1983 included TAEDP Associated Support Items of Equipment (ASIDE) products, revisions to the POMCUS Authorization Documents System (PADS), the inclusion of a HQDA major item substitution policy in TAEDP and various system maintenance improvements. The development of the TAEDP modernization program continued during FY 83 with the completion of the functional description and development of the technical specifications., 29762=During the year, the Army decided to implement a policy of simultaneous obligation of ASF requisitions beginning I October 1983. Simply, this means that an obligation will be recorded in the books of the requisitioner as well as the ASF when the requisition is submitted rather than when the supplies are actually received. Under the new arrangement, the Army could control requisitions at the time of submission rather than be subject to the whims of an unpredictable delivery system. It would obligate funds for these requisitions against the current fiscal year, and not have to worry about the ability to pay for it in subsequent fiscal years and would have the ability to charge price adjustments to the year of the requisition, where it can be controlled, as opposed to subsequent years, where the unknown amount of deliveries would occur. This change will effect the entire finance and accounting network, supply system, and every individual that controls funds., 5942=The Army participated in a number of security assistance programs in Europe this year, including those in Denmark, Switzerland, and Turkey. In June 1983, Denmark received the first two leased batteries of Improved Hawk missiles, and in the next fiscal year will receive two more. Because Denmark expressed interest in obtaining a fifth and sixth battery, under acceptable financial terms, the Army was exploring a composite lease-purchase arrangement for Denmark at the end of this fiscal year., 9170=Forces' readiness posture until FY 86. Since 1982, the Egyptian IMETP has continued at the level of $2 million, one of the largest in the world, with over 300 officers trained in CONUS this year alone. Jordan, also, is one of the largest IMETP recipients., 8206=Israel continues to maintain a generally recognized margin of superiority over any combination of potential opponents. They used fiscal year 1983 foreign military sales financing for air defense, armored and tracked vehicles, artillery, missiles, and ammunition., 153=TABLE 17 - ARMY SECURITY ASSISTANCE OPEN PROGRAMS, 30 September 1983, 27965=Three actions taken during the year enabled AIF to achieve a more businesslike and efficient approach to operations and management. These actions were the Asset Capitalization Program (ACP), the Fiscal Year 1983 Appropriations Act, and Research and Development (R&D) Activities., 25037=Since 1979 the Army has maintained a Maintenance Management Improvement Program (MMIP) to eliminate serious maintenance shortfalls. The Army designed MMIP to attack root causes and to focus command attention on the tasks of upgrading maintenance operations, strengthening maintenance training, improving publication, and supporting tools and repair parts. DA Circular 750-83-3, published this fiscal year and effective 15 November 1983, defines objectives, assigns responsibilities, and establishes methods and implementation procedures for the MMIP, 3310=The United States contributed to South Korean security through a commitment embodied in the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954, the maintenance of U.S. troops in Korea, an extensive military sales program, IMETP training, and technical cooperation in development of selected Korean defense industries. Extensive coproduction and coassembly programs operated effectively this year, to include small arms munitions, M16 rifles, Vulcan air defense guns, helicopters, and tank munitions., 4876=In June 1980, Turkey received the technical data for converting 2,800 M48 series tanks to the M48A5 configuration and, under a U.S.-Turkey lease agreement, plant equipment. The plan was for Turkey to purchase 500 conversion kits annually from the U.S. through FY 86, while increasing in-country productions, until Turkey was producing 44 of the 57 subkits in each kit. By the end of FY 83, Turkey had completed three tanks, and expects to complete 180 in 1984 and to attain a maximum capability of 500 per year when a second conversion line opens in 1985. The total foreign military sales value of the program at the end of FY 83 equaled $240 million., 32461=During FY 83, the Army used the Total Army Equipment Distribution Program (TAEDP)-a computer program for managing major pieces of Army equipment-as the principal data base to support key logistical studies and to support Army staff and congressional analyses of logistical issues, particularly concerning the equipment status of reserve components. These studies included the report of the Resource Management Review Select Committee in November 1982, \"Equipping the Total Force\" study (1982), \"Project Relook,\" \"Army Logistics Assessment,\" \"Support Equipment Analysis,\" \"Equipment Redistribution\" study, \"VCSA documentation\" study, and Volume 11 of the DOD Force Readiness Report., 6370=continued emphasis on the helicopter program and the delivery of TOW missiles in June 1983 to enhance Kenya's antitank readiness. Security assistance to Morocco consisted of completing the M48A5 tank conversion program, an airlift of artillery ammunition, and the second U.S.-Morocco Joint Military Commission in Washington in May, which stressed enhancement of their logistics infrastructure and support capabilities., 17424=theater of operations. In September 1983, USACAA presented a preliminary report of phase I of the study, titled the Containerized Cargo Distribution Analysis (COCADA). Unified Commands and MACOMs can apply the methodology developed in phase I to analyze the maximum possible containerization in a theater of operations. The phase II follow-on, scheduled for FY 84 will continue developing a model to determine the impact of various policies on the utilization of containers and their equipment on all the components of a theater distribution system force structure, facilities, storage locations, and the transportation network available to move containers., 24478=The Standard Army Maintenance System is an automated logistics management system, thirteen years in development, that will provide maintenance management from direct support and general support units at retail level up through DARCOM at the Army wholesale level. This year the ODCSLOG and the ODCSOPS sought unsuccessfully to obtain $17 million for system hardware and to accelerate fielding. Despite this set back, they initiated efforts to move the starting date for the operation of SAMS from January 1986 to January 1985. As has happened before in SAMS (Standard Army Maintenance System) history, the software for SAMS has reached a state of maturity, but the ADP equipment needed to process the system is still unavailable., 36513=Department of the Army Historical Summary: FY 1983}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{8176=A total of 6,724 foreign students received military training in the Continental United States under U.S. Army sponsorship during FY 83, and 2,553 under the FMS program. Training funded under the IMETP equaled approximately $12 million, under FMS about $24.5 million. Participating countries fund the International Fellows Program (IFP) for foreign students at the Army War College, through FMS or IMETP During the 1983-84 academic year, Australia, Austria, Egypt, Germany, Italy, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Tunisia participated., 8785=In January 1983, the Assistant Comptroller of the Army, Security Assistance Division, held a meeting to discuss and resolve problems involving financial management and control of IMETP-TLA (Travel and Living Allowance). Those attending were from the Department of the Army staff and Major Army Commands (MACOMs) responsible for IMETP-TLA. The meeting resulted from a study made in 1977 by the Office Chief of Staff Management Division titled \"The Army Security Assistance Program Study\" report (TASAPS-77) and a study performed by Stephen J. Lesley, Foreign Training Officer, Security Assistance Division. Both studies identified problems with the present system of executing TLA (Travel and Living Allowance) and especially those encountered by the overseas commands that seemed to result from distance and time restrictions. To better track funds to the program, respond to emergency requirements, and eliminate large unobligated balances at year-end, the attendees at, 10709=Plans moved forward in FY 83 to establish a permanent secretariat for the Conference of American Armies (CAA), which has been meeting biennially since 1960, to deliberate security issues of mutual interest. Toward this end, the Interim Permanent Secretariat (IPS), headed by Chief of Staff of the Army, General Edward Meyer, took a number of steps. They developed, for approval by member armies, changes to conference regulations to establish a permanent secretariat, promoted the implementation of the XIV CAA Agreements through publication of a bimonthly Conference Information Bulletin, proposed professional staff officer-level seminars to continue the dialogue of conference themes, and assisted the host country in the preparation and conduct of the XV CAA., 5535=Coproduction enables a foreign government, commercial firm, or international organization to acquire the technical \"know how\" to assemble or manufacture an Army weapons system in whole or in part. The Army initiated its first coproduction program with NATO in 1960 for the Hawk missile system. Since then the Army has participated in thirty-two projects with thirteen foreign countries and NATO. FY 83 coproduction programs include the AH-1S helicopter with Japan, the Stinger missile system with Germany and NATO, and 105-mm. ammunition with Egypt. A memorandum of understanding requires the foreign producers to purchase U.S. components. The total dollar value for all coproduction projects through FY 83 amounted to $6.4 billion, of which $2.4 billion will be returned to the United States., 7126=As for education for FAOs, the Army logistics office in Hong Kong developed a new in-country studies program of instruction for China FOAs. The Army also established a new correspondence language course for foreign area officers, who are unable to attend the five month resident course in basic French and Spanish at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The School of International Studies, under the guidance and testing of the Defense Language Institute, Monterey, California, supervises the course. The school initiated a cooperative degree program with Campbell University (located in Buie's Creek, North Carolina) and plans to expand this program to include the University of North Carolina, North Carolina State, East Carolina University, and the University of South Carolina. The Chief of the Strategy Plans and Policy Directorate, Americas-Asia Division and the Director of the School of International Studies signed a memorandum of agreement to publish a FAO newsletter twice a year. They have scheduled the first newsletter for early 1984., 6715=The action to improve coding of Foreign Area Officer (FAO) manpower requirements continued throughout the fiscal year. The FAO steering committee met on 10 March 1983 to define, 9814=the January meeting recommended that the Army transfer the management of the TLA function from the Army's component of the Unified Command to TRADOC-Security Assistance Training Field Activity (SATFA). The centralization of TLA funding at TRADOC, the Army believes will greatly improve the execution of the IMETP appropriation. Having appropriation directorship, program, funds, and accounting centralized at one place will result in optimum utilization of funds, timely response to the program, and preclude a possible violation. The Army anticipates that the centralization of TRADOC-SATFA will occur in FY 85, when TRADOC will have acquired the necessary people and automation to undertake the responsibility. Meanwhile, the U.S. Army Finance and Accounting Center (USAFAC) will serve as interim financial manager and finance and accounting office for the IMETP-TLA funding program.}",

Security assistance new business is generated from amendments and modifications to prior year cases and new orders implemented during the year. At the end of FY 83, the FMS programs amounted to $42.0 billion. The status of this program at the close of the fiscal year is indicated in Table 17. $1.3 billion for Jordan, $1.0 billion for Korea, and $1.0 billion for Germany. The programs for these six countries comprise over 75 percent of the total value of the Army's security assistance open cases. [143] In FY 83, ninety-one countries participated in Army FMS programs. The program for Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE), valued at $5 thousand, represents the smallest, the one for Saudi Arabia, valued at over $22 billion, was the largest. Other large programs that the Army has continued this fiscal year are $2.6 billion for Israel, $2.1 billion for Egypt, The U.S. government continued to emphasize the importance of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. It targeted security assistance on deficiencies in Pakistani defenses and obsolescence of existing equipment. Pakistans' needs included armor, air defense, and other combat capabilities. The U.S. security assistance relationship developing with Pakistan, however, tended to stultify U.S. relations with India. The threat of Socialist Republic of",

The COE plays a supervisory role, while both U.S. and foreign civilian contractors accomplish 90 percent of the workload. The general upward trend in equipment diversions continued during FY 83. President Reagan approved diversions to support Allies and friendly nations faced with ongoing or imminent threats, or to fulfill certain foreign policy commitments. The principal recipients were El Salvador, Lebanon, and Honduras. This year's diversions involved 102 armored personnel carriers, 1,033 radios and 2,050 TOW missiles. In addition, the Army diverted 677,022 rounds of large caliber ammunition during the fiscal year, a 233 percent increase over the 203,319 rounds diverted the previous year. Current high demand items are those pieces of equipment and weapons systems used by the Active Army and provided to FMS customers. The most important ones are the M60 series tanks; the M48 series tanks; the M 109 series howitzers; the M 110 series howitzers; the M 113 series carriers; the M 198 series [144] howitzers; the TOW launchers and missiles; the I-Hawk missiles and battery sets; the Chaparral missiles and launchers; the Stinger weapons system; the 155-mm. artillery ammunition; and radios.
