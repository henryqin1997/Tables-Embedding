These uniquely identify the cable 132 that RF modem 106 is connected to., 94130=SNMP agent 1233 passes the message on to channel manager 1231, which maintains a list 1235 of free CCB blocks 1023 for each network. Channel manager 1231 finds a free CCB block in the list for the specified Net ID. The block is for a particular <channel,pipe> pair. Channel manager 1231 fills the IP address from the SNMP message and a link ID for the RF modem 106 into the CCB block 1023 and adds CCB block 1023 to ARP table 1101. Channel manager 1231 then uses SNMP agent 1233 to send a return message via SNMP agent 1203 to IPA manager 1203. As shown at arrow 1243, the return message contains the IP address and the <channel,pipe,link ID> triple that has been assigned to it. Channel manager 1231 adds entries for the newly-assigned IP addresses to its assigned IPA data base 1207. Each entry contains the IP address and the <channel,pipe,link ID> triple. Now that all of the information needed to relate the IP addresses of RF modem 1060)'s hosts 108 to a <channel,pipe,link ID> triple on cable 132 is available, DHCP server 1201 returns a DHCPOFFER IP packet to RF modem 106(j) which is to receive the IP packets whose destination IP address belong to the set of addresses 210(j) corresponding to the <channel pipe,linkID> triple., 90303=FIG. 12 shows the system used to do dynamic assignment of IP addresses and <channel,pipe,link ID> triples in a preferred embodiment. Dynamic assignment is handled cooperatively by control/management server 125 and communications manager 102. Both are hosts in IP network A 206 and have TCP/IP SNMP (simple network management protocol) agents 1203 and 1233, and control/management server 125 and communications manager 102 can cooperate by means of SNMP messages. For details on SNMP, see Stevens, supra, pp. 359-387., 79940=FIG. 11 also shows ARP cache 1119 for host 108(k). Cache 1119 has a cache entry 1120 for each host 108 connected to LAN 133 that currently has an IP address assigned to it, shown at 1122, and a cache entry 1120(j) for RF modem 106(j). In entries 1122, each entry has the IP address 1121 for the host 108 to which the entry belongs and the LAN address 1123 for the host 108; entry 1120(j) has reusable IP address 1117 for RF modem 1060) and RF modem 106(j)'s LAN address 1125., 33718=An example of such a system is the one disclosed in Moura, et al., Asymmetic Hybrid Access System and Method, U.S. Pat. No. 5,586,121, issued Dec. 17, 1996, and in Moura, et al., Remote Link Adapter for use in TV Broadcast Data Transmission System, U.S. Pat. No. 5,347,304, issued Sept. 13, 1994. In this system, the head end of a cable system has high bandwidth access to the Internet or to other networks and access via CATV cables and the telephone system to households or businesses with PCs. Data received from these networks is sent to PCs connected to the cable system's cables and responses from the PCs are collected via the telephone system and sent to the network. In the home or business, the PC is connected either directly or via a local area network to a device which includes both a radio frequency modem and a standard analog telephone modem. The radio frequency modem is connected to the CATV cable. It receives and decodes the data sent on the CATV cable and provides it to the PC. The telephone modem is connected to a standard telephone line. It receives data from the PC and sends it to the CATV head end, which in turn forwards it to the Internet or other networks., 92774=The IP addresses of the hosts 108 are assigned by IP address manager 1204, with the assistance of SNMP agent 1203. The first step in assigning the IP addresses is determining which IP network B 208(i) the cable 132 belongs to that RF modem 106(j) is connected to. IPA manager 1204 uses a table 1237 to make this determination. Each entry in the table relates a <frequency,streamID> pair to a Net ID. All IP addresses assigned in the IP network B 208 identified by the Net ID must include the Net ID. The information in table 1237 is provided by channel manager 1231 in communications manager 102., 91707=Assignment of IP addresses to hosts 108 connected to. RF modem 106 and of a <channel,pipe,link ID> triple to RF modem 106 begins when DHCP server 1201 receives a DHCPDISCOVER message from an RF modem 106(j) that has become active. The DHCPDISCOVER message requests assignment of a number of IP addresses for the hosts 108 attached to RF modem 106(j). In the preferred embodiment, the DHCPDISCOVER message includes the IP address 1215 of RF modem 106(j) (assigned it by modem pool 135). The vendor-encapsulated-options part of the DHCPDISCOVER message includes the following, as shown at 1213 in FIG. 12:, 104225=Server 125 sends an SNMP packet to communications manager 102 instructing it to remove the entries for the IP addresses from its ARP cache 1001. Communications manager 102 returns the <channel,pipe,linkID> triple to its list of free <channel,pipe,linkID> triples. When server 125 receives an SNMP acknowledgment from communications manager 102, it deletes the entries for the IP addresses for the hosts 108 connected to the IP modem from its data base and returns the IP addresses to its list of free IP addresses. In other embodiments, the DHCP protocols used to get and free IP addresses for hosts 108 may originate with the individual host 108., 101472=IP addresses in network A 206 for a domain name server, for SNMP agent 1203, for communications manager 102, and for router 101., 93494=When IPA manager 1204 has the Net ID, it can assign the IP addresses. IPA manager 1204 has a list 1211(i) of free IP addresses for each network B 208(i), and it takes a set of IP addresses that has the number of addresses specified in address range 1216 from the free list 1211 for the network B 208(i). IPA manager 1204 then provides an SNMP set message with the IP addresses to SNMP agent 1203. As shown by arrow 1241, SNMP agent 1203 sends the message to SNMP agent 1233 in communications manager 102., 84252=Continuing with routing table 933 for RF modem 106, this routing table has an entry 935 for each host 108 attached to LAN 133 and two others that are of interest in the present context. In the entries 936 for the hosts 108, each contains the host's IP address as both its destination IP address and gateway IP address. Entry 935(j)'s destination IP address is the IP address 214(a) assigned RF modem 106(j) by modem pool 135 when RF modem 106(j) became active; the gateway IP address here is again RF modem 106(i)'s reusable IP address 1117. This entry routes messages for RF modem 106(j) received via PSTN 109 to RF modem 106(j) itself. The final entry, 935(k), is the default entry; the gateway IP address is IP address 214(b) for modem pool 135, and thus, all remaining packets received by RF modem 106(j) are routed via PSTN 109 to modem pool 135 and from thence to router 101., 77721=Entry 1103(i) is for the so-called loop-back interface. It has a special IP address that clients and servers on the same host can use to send IP packets to each other. Packets sent to this IP address are processed completely within client 108 and never appear on LAN 133. As can be seen from FIG. 11, the same loopback IP address 1103 is used for both the destination IPA and the gateway IPA. The entries labelled 1104 are for the other hosts 108 in set 210(j). Each of these has the full IP address of the given host as both its destination IP address and its gateway IP address. What this means is that when a packet has an IP address that matches the destination IPA in entry 1103(j), its ultimate destination is a host 108(l) and the next step in the routing is for host 108(k) to use the ARP protocol to determine the LAN address corresponding to the packet's gateway IP address and then to send the IP packet to the LAN address., 40864=FIG. 3 shows those parts of an Internet protocol (IP) packet or datagram 301 that are required to understand the following discussion. An IP packet 301 has two main parts, header 303, which carries control information about the packet, and data 305, which is the data being transported in the packet. Header 303 has a fixed format and length, while data 305 may have a varying length All that need be known about the contents of header 303 for the present discussion is that it contains two 32-bit Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, one of which, DEST IPA 307 specifies a destination in the Internet to which IP packet 301 is to be delivered, and the other of which, SRC IPA 309, specifies the source in the Internet of packet 301. Sources and destinations of Internet packets 301 are termed herein Internet hosts. An Internet host is an entity in a network which has an IP address and which is capable of responding to at least some of the protocols in the TCP/IP protocol suite. For details on IP addressing and the protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite, see W. Richard Stevens, TCP/IP Illustrated: The Protocols, Addison-Wesley, 1994, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this patent application., 86195=FIG. 10, finally, shows the implementation of ARP cache 1001 in communications manager 102. The technique used to implement the table is hashing, which is a standard technique for reducing search time in large tables. In ARP cache table 1001, the IP addresses 1003 for incoming packets addressed to a host 108 are hashed, that is, they are input to a function 1005 which produces small integer values 1009 from the IP addresses. The small integer is used as an index into a hash array 1011, whose elements are pointers 1013 to lists of IP addresses that hash to the index of element 1013. Each list entry 1015 has three fields: field 1017 contains a destination IP address; field 1019 is a pointer to the next list entry 1015 in the list, and CCB pointer 1021 is a pointer to a data structure called a CCB block 1023 which specifies the frequency, pipe number, and linkID to which packets having IP address 1017 may be sent. The fields of CCB block 1023 are IP address 1025, which has the same IP address as IPA 1017, modulator number 1029, which effectively specifies the frequency, pipe number 1031, which specifies the pipe, linkID 1033, which specifies the RF modem 106, and next pointer 1035, which specifies the next CCB block 1023. Translation of an IP address into the corresponding <channel,pipe number,linkID> triple works by hashing the IP address to get the index of list pointer 1013, following list pointer 1013 to the list, searching list entries 1015 until one is found that has the IP address being translated as its IP address 1017, and going to that list entry 1015's CCB block 1023 to find the information needed to form the triple. It is worth noting here that it is the structure of ARP cache 1001 which makes it possible in a preferred embodiment to use any IP address in the network of the cable 124 to which an RF modem 106(j) is attached for a host 108 that is attached to RF modem 106(j)., 27042=The present patent application claims priority from a United States Provisional Application titled Cable Data Network System, filed Jan. 17, 1997, Ser. No. 08/035,618 with Scott E. Hrastar, Mark E. Schutte, Roy A. Bowcutt, David A. Sedacca, and Todd A. Merrill listed as inventors. The present patent application is further one of 10 patent applications directed to the cable data network system disclosed in the above Provisional Application that are being filed on the same day. The 10 patent applications are listed by attorney docket number and title in two groups. The seven in the first group all have the same Detailed Description., 95591=In a preferred environment, IP addresses assigned to the hosts belonging to RF modem 106 are deassigned when RF modem 106(j) becomes inactive. This is detected by modem pool 135 when RF modem 106(j) hangs up and modem pool 135 sends an SNMP message to SNMP agent 1203 in control/management server 125 informing agent 203 of that fact. Agent 1203 removes the entries for the IP addresses for the hosts 108 connected to RF modem 106(j) from its data base and returns the IP addresses to IPA manager 1204, which puts them on the proper free list 1211(i). Agent 1203 also sends an SNMP message to SNMP agent 1233 in communications manager 102 informing communications manager 102 that the IP addresses have been deassigned. Agent 1233 passes the IP addresses to channel manager 1231, which removes the CCB blocks for the IP addresses from ARP table 1101 and returns them to the free CCB block list 1235 for the network to which the addresses belong., 92441=The number of addresses being requested 1216. An address is requested for every host 108 connected to RF modem 106(j)., 28954=1263.04703, System and Method for Detecting, Correcting and Discarding Corrupted Data Packets in a Cable Data Delivery System, 90894=Control/management server 125 further has a DHCP server 1201 and an IPA manager 1204 executing on it. DHCP server 1201 responds to IP packets belonging to the TCP/IP DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration) protocol. As will be explained in more detail below, this protocol is employed to dynamically assign an IP host an IP address. Details on the DHCP protocol may be found in R. Droms, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, RFC 1541, obtainable in March 1997 at the URL www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1541.html. The IP addresses themselves are managed by IPA manager 1204. Communications manager 102 also has executing on it a channel manager 1231, which manages the <channel,pipe,link ID> triples assigned to RF modems 106., 31878=A great many homes do in fact have a high bandwidth connection, namely that provided by cable television. The problem with this connection is that it is one way. A PC may receive data via a home's CATV cable, but it cannot use the cable to send data. Again, ways of making the CATV system bidirectional have been known for years. For example, in the early 1980's, Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. introduced and marketed a product known as the Model 6404 Broadband Data Modem for use with bidirectional CATV systems. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. has also recently filed U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 08/627,062, filed Apr. 3, 1966, 08/732;668, filed Oct. 16, 1996 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,966,163, and a continuation-in-part titled System and Method for Providing Statistics for Flexible Billing in a Cable Environment Koperda et al., filed Mar. 14, 1997 which describe bidirectional CATV systems. As with the telephone systems, the problem here is not the technology, but the fact that its introduction requires extensive modification of most existing CATV systems., 78780=IP packets whose destination addresses are not in set 210(j) are handled by entry 1103(k), which is the default entry for IP addresses that cannot be routed using other entries 1103. The default IPA 1115 is accordingly the destination IPA. The gateway IPA is the reusable IPA for RF modem 106(j). As will be explained in more detail later, this reusable IPA 1117 does not belong to the set of IP addresses 210(j) that are dynamically assigned to hosts 108 connected to LAN 133 when RF modem 106(j) becomes active. When host 108(k) receives a packet that matches default entry 1103(k), host 108(k) uses the ARP protocol to find the LAN address corresponding to re-usable IPA 1117, that is, the LAN address of RF modem 106(j) and sends the IP packet to RF modem 106(j). Since both the hosts 108 and RF modem 106(j) are connected to LAN 133, the routing info in entries 1104 and 1103(k) specifies LAN 133., 103532=As long as any of hosts 108 is connected to Internet 150, RF modem 106 listens for super packets addressed to it at the <channel,pipe,link ID> triple for RF modem 106 and maintains its connection via the telephone network to modem pool 135. When the last host 108 shuts down its connection to Internet 150, RF modem 106 hangs up on the telephone line connecting it to modem pool 135. Modem pool 135 responds to the fact that RF modem 106 has hung up with a DHCP release message to DHCP server 1201. The DHCP release message specifies the IP addresses assigned to RF modem 106., 100339=Modem pool 135 receives DHCPOFFER packet 703, adds modem pool 135's IP address to it, and unicasts the packet via net A 206 to DHCP server 1201. DHCP in control/management server 125 responds to packet 703 and assigns IP addresses for the hosts 108 attached to RF modem 106(j) and a <channel,pipe,link ID> triple to RF modem 106 as described above. The IP addresses have leases that are long enough for the period for which an RF modem 106 is typically active. Next, control/management server 125 sends a DHCPOFFER packet 715 addressed to RF modem 106's IP address. This is routed to to modem pool 135. The OFFER packet contains the following information:, 76740=FIG. 11 shows a routing table 1101 for a host 108(k) when host 108(k) is connected to cable data network 100. Host 108(k) has only three destinations to which it can route IP packets: to itself to another host 108(i) connected to LAN 133, or to RF modem 106(j), which is of course a host in LAN 133, but is also the router for all IP packets that have destinations outside LAN 133. There are thus n+2 entries 1103 in routing table 1101, where n is the number of hosts 108 attached to LAN 133. Each entry has three parts: a destination IP address, a gateway IP address, which must be an IP address of a host on LAN 133, and routing information, which indicates among other things whether the host specified by the gateway IP address is a router and the name of the link-layer network upon which the packet is to be routed.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The foregoing being the case, the Detailed Description is to be understood as being illustrative and not restrictive and the scope of the invention claimed herein is to be determined not by the Detailed Description but rather by the attached claims as interpreted with the full breadth permitted under the patent laws. Finally, the TCP/IP protocols employed in the preferred embodiment may be replaced by any other protocols which have the same effect. In particular, the DHCP protocol may be replaced by any protocol which can be used for dynamic assignment of logical network addresses, the RIP protocol may be replaced by any protocol which communicates changes in routings to routers, and the SNMP protocol may be replaced by any kind of network management protocol. Moreover, the techniques described herein for dynamically assigning IP addresses to hosts will work with any kind of logical network addresses, including, for example, virtual circuit numbers. Similarly, the techniques described for dynamically assigning <channel,pipe,linkID> triples to RF modems can be used equally well to dynamically assign any kind of link-level address. The techniques will also work with any technique for subdividing the bandwidth of the unidirectional connection among a number of modems. While the Detailed Description presents the best mode presently known to the inventors of implementing the cable data network, it will be immediately apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts that the principles used to implement the",
