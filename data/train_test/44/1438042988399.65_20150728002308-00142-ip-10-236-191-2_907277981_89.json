            "UW is incredibly affordable - both for instate students and out of state students. Take advantage of the scholarships - there are a ton out there just waiting to be claimed.",
            "Everything! Laramie is a small town, but there is a lot to do around campus. Friday Night Fever hosts a free movie every Friday, along with a myriad of other activities. There is always something to do!",
            "Washakie is pretty standard. Nothing too special about it, but it is good food.",
            "Pretty normal, nothing special in this area. Dorms are nice and well kept up, and floor hold activities often to allow students to bond with their floormates.",
            "You get out of classes what you put into them. It is easy to skate by, but if you want to succeed, you have to work hard.",
            "Go visit your professors during their office hours! It will let them put a name to a face and will let you get to know them as people, which can come in handy for reference letters. They also have a lot of wisdom to share - so ask!",
            "UW is an incredible school for motivated students - and you get out of it what you put in. That being said, if you are looking for a challenge, you can find it here. It is very easy to get involved on campus and the professors care about you and make efforts to get to know you - even in a class of 200."

Should be comfortable to live in from 2014 onwards....., 128885=Don't be afraid to email or call the school with questions. I've probably emailed the poor Admissions Office 50 times asking them anything and everything I had to ask. They have, however, always replied with friendly and helpful answers that aided me in completing my application and such. Also, apply as soon as you can. UW has a rolling application, which means you can apply whenever you want, and as soon as all your application materials are received, you can expect a reply in as little as four weeks. Then, if you want to go there, you don't have to worry about applying to three or four (or however many) schools just in case. There is no essay on the application so it takes less than an hour to complete and then you're done with that. Some of the scholarships also have an apply by deadline. For example, to be considered for the WUE, you must submit all your application materials by the beginning of December. Finally, don't worry about how to apply for scholarships too much. A lot of the scholarships (the WUE and Rocky Mountain Scholarships) only require your application to apply for the scholarship. And if you have any questions about scholarships and how to apply, like I said, don't be afraid to email or call them with questions., 590290=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 52444=Be careful with your travel! Snow storms can swoop down as early as August and continue through May. (June and July snow is rare, but does happen.) The roads into and out of town wind through mountainous passes, so they close pretty quickly in bad weather., 161106=i am enrolled in fall of 2012 with a partial swimming scholarship. gooo cowboys!, 300653=Definitely be prepared for a freezing winter. Summer clothing will only be used in August, possibly September and May. As for schooling, just be organized. That's how it is with any university., 16869=I am a freshman at the University of Wyoming, so although I have not experiences finals or anything yet, I feel as if I am learning a lot. There is a good mix of professors and graduate students that teach the classes so experience different teaching styles and approaches to learning. There are quite a few large lecture classes but most do not reach over 200 students so there is still a good student to professor ratio. The teachers present well rounded, new information in every class and I find myself eager to attend class every day. The only place that I sometimes find that my learning is curbed is some of the classes with graduate students. They are learning new things parallel to their students so points they try to make are sometimes unclear. Otherwise, the professors are all very knowledgeable and have taught me a lot since the semester started a month ago. The 1000 level courses that most freshmen take are a good transition from high school to college and demand just enough attention from the students that if you work hard enough A's and B's are not unattainable., 235289=If you decide to come to the University of Wyoming, pack very warmly. Temperatures can reach significantly below zero in the winter, with the coldest months being between December through February. Also, if you decide to stick around Laramie through the summer, don't put away your winter gear, because Laramie will usually get snow up through May, and sometimes in June or July (but those situations are rare). Don't let the weather discourage you though, the education is great, the people are amazing, and there is so much you can do downtown and outside of town., 27696=The classes I have taken have overall been intellectually challenging. The 1000 level courses are definitely easy to do well in, but I still seem to learn a lot from them. As the class levels have increased, so has my work load--but also my intellect. I definitely feel like I am getting a solid education. Regarding the classes in my major, I feel I am being adequately prepared for a career--the assignments and knowledge base have all been directed towards what will help us in the pursuing a career and what will help us in the workplace. This has proven to be very beneficial thus far. In general, my professors have been very good--extremely knowledgeable in their respective subjects and very willing to help the students succeed., 222980=The University of Wyoming shows many of the same characteristics that the state of Wyoming has. You can party on weekends if you would like, but for weekends there are not a ton of options besides hanging with a group of friends. Make sure to bring warm clothes because winter lasts from late October to mid-March.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students that like individual attention and those motivated to take advantage of the great opportunities available Tips for prospective students Get involved. Find what you love and go for it. Bang for the buck Classes in Wyoming are much cheaper than I could have found in Colorado. With fewer institutions to split federal money, UW has access to more money for scholarships and program development. Professors care about how the individual student is doing and work to provide opportunities outside of the range of general classes. Where as most universities restrict research to graduate students or seniors, UW encourages students at all levels to participate in works to further understanding and real world application of knowledge learned in class. I am have greatly enjoyed the opportunities I have been given to conduct research. Am enjoying being here Going to the University of Wyoming has to have been one of the better college decisions I have made. Laramie provides the feel of small college with the opportunities of any of the major state university. When I came up to school I knew no one. The student body develops tight knit groups that I have greatly enjoyed being",
