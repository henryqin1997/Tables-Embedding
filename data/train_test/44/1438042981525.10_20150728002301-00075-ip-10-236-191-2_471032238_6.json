Particularly, it should be appreciated that the actual layout of the various components, such as the work table, the mounting plate, the rocker arm, the elongated cable and the like may all be widely varied within the scope of the invention. Further a wide variety of other features conventional features could be added to or substituted for the described components. For example, the linkage means for coupling the safety guard to movements of the saw blade and the guide fence may be widely varied. Therefore, the present examples and embodiments are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims. To facilitate ripping small cross sectional pieces, a push stick is attached to the top surface of the guide fence. The push stick is particularly useful when no cutting board is being used. Referring next to FIGS. 18 and 19, the push stick 120 includes a carriage rod 122 that is secured to the top surface of the guide fence by a pair of brackets 124. A push pad 126 has a pair of",
