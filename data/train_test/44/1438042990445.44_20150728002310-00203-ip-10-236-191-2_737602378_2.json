During the late 20's and early 30's the club had it's best period and began making good progress. Season 1929/30 saw the Bees play and win every home match in the league. This is still a record that has not yet been broken. It also meant another unwanted record as well. They are the only club to win all 21 games at home and not win promotion. 1932/33 saw the club finally gain promotion to the old second division. Two years later they reached the pinnacle of their dreams and made it to the old First Division. Finishing 5th in their first season at the top level completed their rise. This has so far proven to be the highest placing that they have achieved. The second world war brought an abrupt end to the good feelings surrounding the club. The first season after the war the club was relegated. The downward trend continued with the Bees ending up back in the third tier of English football in 1952/53. Since then it has alternated between the third and fourth level of the Football League. It has the odd moment of near misses like losing to Wigan in the Freight Rover Trophy final at Wembley in 1985. After a 45 year wait the club finally made it back to the second tier of football as Division Three Champions. Relegation followed the next season and the club has remained in the lower reaches since. Several near misses have followed as the club has reached the playoffs a few times without being able to cross the final bridge. The club has a hardcore of fans who have kept the club alive. 20th January 2006 saw the newly formed 'Bees Trust' takeover the impoverished club. Several changes have been made since but the club looks to be slowly heading in an upward spiral again. 25th April 2009 saw the club become Division Two champions.(4th tier) This win meant that Brentford have become the first club to win the fourth tier of the league in it's three different names. The Fourth Divisio, Division Three and Division Two. On August 5th 2009 Bees United announced it had arranged terms with Matthew Benham to ensure 'BU' could continue it's role of protecting the long term interests of the club. Last season saw the club start slowly but a few changes in personnel saw Brentford climb to safety and beyond. The season has been regarded as a great success as they did well against the big boys at home. Griffin Park is still a place that others are wary of visiting. Against Saints they managed two 1-1 draws. Both games could have gone either way though fans on both sides will claim they should have won. This season if they show a little more they could well become involved in the fight for promotion. They are becoming a club with a reputation for being hard to beat. I look forward to our meetings with interest this season.
