The company, which posted better numbers in the first three quarters of 2012, owing to lower catastrophe activities, is expected to incur huge losses in the fourth quarter of 2012 from hurricane Sandy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter of 2012 is a loss of 11 cents representing a year-over-year decline of 113.3%. However, for full year 2012, it is currently pegged at $3.75, reflecting year-over-year growth of 267.9%. We expect this risk-management effort by AIG to reinsure itself will help it sustain the sudden shocks of unpredictable weather changes in the upcoming period. AIG currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The AXA Group (AXAHY - Snapshot Report), a peer of AIG, carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)., 61280=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 14849=by Zacks Equity Research \u00a0\u00a0Published on January 14, 2013 |, 20916=The transaction was financed by a $400 million catastrophe bond issued by Compass Re Ltd. in a single tranche. Using an index-based risk transfer with state-specific payment factors, the deal will provide fully collateralized coverage for AIG against catastrophe losses like Hurricanes and earthquakes occurring through December 2014.}",
