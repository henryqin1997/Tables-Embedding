    "textAfterTable": "Submitted by Lloyd Snook ( electronic mail, March 3, 2002) Editor's Note: There were 38 fewer valid ballots cast in the third round of voting [376 total] than in the second round [414]. 698 out of a possible 752 [i.e. 376 x 2] valid actual votes were cast on the third ballot. When candidate David Simmons was dropped from the third ballot - having received the lowest percentage of convention votes [25.19] in the second round - he asked the audience to cast their votes for Blake Caravati. However, this only netted Blake Caravati an additional 2 actual votes. The biggest gainer in the third round was once again Alexandria Searls, receiving 14 additional actual votes. At the same time, Blake Caravati's actual vote total of 192 and weighted convention vote total of 54.75 put him over the top - making him the first candidate at the convention to be nominated for city council. Waldo Jaquith, who had the same number of actual votes [192], received 48.7 of the weighted convention vote total and came in second. While Alexandria Searls, who received 168 actual votes and 43.19 of the weighted convention vote total came in third. Bern Ewert, who received 146 actual votes and 40.48 of the weighted convention vote total, was dropped from the 4th ballot. Comments? Questions? Write me at george@loper.org.",
