    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets While I have illustrated and described my invention by means of specific embodiments, it is to be understood that numerous changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. The transplant plugs or devices, in accordance with the invention as illustrated above, provides the surgeon with allograft bone that is consistent in size and quality, unlike those originating solely from the iliac crest. These devices also provide the surgeon with grafting blocks or units that have the combined and best characteristics of both cortical and cancellous bone materials. This combination of characteristics maximizes the chances of a successful transplant. Grafting bone material may be obtained from any suitable source. A common source is that of cadavers wherein tissues are selected, cleaner, treated and preserved by well known techniques, such as by freezing, lyophilization and the like. The cancellous block 32 is selected and sized to snugly fit the cavity 30 in the block 28, with top and bottom surfaces 34 and 36 exposed. This combination cortical and cancellous block provides a bridging segment, with the best features of both cortical and cancellous structures. Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, a generally cubically configured integrated cortical cancellous block 26 is illustrated. This block is formed and constructed in a manner similar to that of the dowel of FIG. 1. A suitable section",
