    "textBeforeTable": "Arroyo defies convention by going most often to the curveball when he uses the lower slot, though he occasionally drops down even farther when he goes to the changeup. His average curveball is released more than half a foot lower than his other pitches, a fact that shines brighter when we consider that the breaker is his most common pitch this season. Latos' teammate in the Cincinnati rotation has perhaps the craziest pattern of release points in the game. While some pitchers are inconsistent due to unplanned fluctuations in their mechanics, Arroyo blatantly manipulates his angle of shoulder abduction in addition to his spine angle, displaying intent behind his chaotic release point. He ranges from a high arm slot to one that is dropped down to sidearm, and he appears to have a couple of specific slots in mind while avoiding the middle ground. Bronson Arroyo Latos shows what it looks like to be successful with the Gallardo strategy, as he is able to repeat his arm slot much more effectively than most pitchers who sacrifice posture in the name of height at release point. Latos' release is still inconsistent when compared to well-balanced pitchers, and he must",
    "textAfterTable": "Arroyo mixes up his technique as well as his repertoire to keep opposing batters on their heels, distracting them with his showgirl leg-kick and diverse arm angles.
