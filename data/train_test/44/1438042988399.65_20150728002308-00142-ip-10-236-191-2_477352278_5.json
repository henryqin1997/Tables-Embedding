Means 1502 locates the first valley which is at the center of bar 1206, immediately preceding space 1216. Means 1502 may select pixel 4 in FIG. 13 as the first valley. Means 1504 then locates the second valley which is at the center of bar 1208, immediately following space 1216. Means 1504 may select pixel 9 in FIG. 13 as that second valley. Means 1506 then computes the signal energy value for space 1216 using Equation (9). Assume, for example, that the histogram for the pixel image containing bar code symbol 1202 indicates that the minimum pixel intensity level Imin is 50. The signal energy value si for space 1216 from means 1506 is then given by: ##EQU8##, 133714=Means 1506 then computes the area under the gray-scale signal curve between the two valleys by numerically integrating using the pixel intensity levels. This area is the signal energy value of the space being analyzed. In making this integration computation, means 1506 preferably uses the minimum pixel intensity level from the histogram generated by means 102 of detection system 100 of FIG. 1 as the lower limit for computing the area under the curve. In general, the signal energy value si for a space is given by: ##EQU7## where Imin is the minimum pixel intensity level from the histogram, Ivalley #1 is the pixel intensity level of the pixel corresponding to the first valley, Ivalley #2 is the pixel intensity level of the pixel corresponding to the second valley, and Ip are the pixel intensity levels of the pixels lying between the first and second valleys along the current search step., 132200=In the example of FIGS. 12 and 13, stepping subsystem 904 implements subpixel interpolation subsystem 1400 along search step 1228 to determine the signal energy value for bar 1206. Since bar 1206 is the first bar in bar code symbol 1202, means 1402 preferably selects as the first peak a pixel near the end of quiet zone 1204, such as pixel 2 in FIG. 13. Means 1404 then locates the second peak which is at the center of space 1216, immediately following bar 1206. Means 1404 may select pixel 7 in FIG. 13 as that second peak. Means 1406 then computes the signal energy value for bar 1206 using Equation (7). Assume, for example, that the histogram for the pixel image containing bar code symbol 1202 indicates that the maximum pixel intensity level Imax is 240. The signal energy value bi for bar 1206 from means 1406 is then given by: ##EQU6##, 131245=Means 1406 then computes the area above the gray-scale signal curve between the two peaks by numerically integrating using the pixel intensity levels. This area is the signal energy value of the bar being analyzed. In making this integration computation, means 1406 preferably uses the maximum pixel intensity level from the histogram generated by means 102 of detection system 100 of FIG. 1 as the upper limit for computing the area above the curve. In general, the signal energy value bi for a bar is given by: ##EQU5## where Imax is the maximum pixel intensity level from the histogram, Ipeak#1 is the pixel intensity level of the pixel corresponding to the first peak, Ipeak#2 is the pixel intensity level of the pixel corresponding to the second peak, and Ip are the pixel intensity levels of the pixels lying between the first and second peaks along the current search step., 143302=In a preferred embodiment, means 1702 performs subpixel interpolation along multiple search steps that may be selected by projecting onto a reference line similarly to that performed by stepping subsystem 904. Each search step is used to determine the signal energy value for two or more symbol elements. As opposed to stepping subsystem 904, which starts the next search step from where the previous search step left off, stitching subsystem 1700 purposely repeats subpixel interpolation for symbol elements that have been previously analyzed. Thus, the search steps of stitching subsystem 1700 overlap, where those for stepping subsystem 904 follow end to end., 115323=In the example of FIG. 10, Table I may represent the character choices created by means 906 using reference line 1018. Means 908 first selects the set of first-choice characters corresponding to character set {\"C\", \"O\", \"D\", \"7\", space \"1\", \"2\", \"8\", \"84\"}. Means 910 then performs checksum analysis on the selected character set. Since the checksum result of means 910 does not match the checksum character \"84\", the checksum analysis is not satisfied. Means 912 then determines whether the character table contains any more character sets. In a preferred embodiment of decoding subsystem 114, if the set of first-choice characters fails the checksum analysis, then selected other character sets are tested., 109503=Stepping subsystem 904 then performs subpixel interpolation of bar code symbol 1002 along search steps associated with reference line 1018. Stepping subsystem 904 and subpixel interpolation are described in further detail later in this specification in conjunction with FIGS. 11, 14, and 15. Each symbol character of bar code symbol 1002 is a set of bars and spaces that represents an alphanumeric character. Stepping subsystem 904 selects one or more alphanumeric characters to associate with each symbol character of bar code symbol 1002. In addition, for each symbol character, stepping subsystem 904 assigns to each selected alphanumeric character a confidence factor that indicates how \"confident\" subsystem 904 is that the symbol character actually represents the selected alphanumeric character., 136603=Each bar code symbology has a particular format for the encoding of alphanumeric characters into bars and spaces. In this specification, subsystem 1118 is described in the context of decoding bar code symbols of Code 128 Symbology, although those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention may also employ analogous processing to decode any known symbology. In Code 128 Symbology, each alphanumeric character is represented by a symbol character having three bars and three spaces. The width of every symbol character is 11 modules, where each symbol element (bar or space) is an integral number of modules wide and the minimum width for a symbol element is 1 module. In addition, the sum of the widths of the three bars is always an even number of modules, while the sum of the three space widths is always an odd number of modules. Character determination subsystem 1118 generates one or more choices of alphanumeric characters for each symbol character of three bars and three spaces., 124896=After means 1102 selects the start point of the first search step, means 1104 performs subpixel interpolation along the first search step to determine a signal energy value that represents the width of the first bar of the bar code symbol. In the example of FIG. 12, means 1104 performs subpixel interpolation along search step 1228 to determine a signal energy value for bar 1206 of bar code symbol 1202. The higher the signal energy value, the wider the symbol element. Subpixel interpolation is further described later in this specification in conjunction with FIGS. 14 and 15., 133087=Similarly, when a space is to be analyzed, means 1502 of subpixel interpolation subsystem 1500 locates a first valley corresponding to the center of the bar immediately preceding the space to be analyzed. A valley generally represents a pixel intensity level minimum with respect to adjacent pixels. Means 1504 then locates a second valley corresponding to the center of the bar immediately following the space to be analyzed. The two valleys are adjacent critical points along a one-dimensional signal curve that represents a portion of the current search step that is centered on the space to be analyzed., 125496=Means 1106 sets the current search step to be the first search step. Means 1108 then performs subpixel interpolation for another element along the current search step, where elements are analyzed by means 1108 in the order in which they appear in the bar code symbol. Means 1110 then determines whether subpixel interpolation for the next element is to be performed along the current search step or whether a new current search step is to be selected. A new current search step is selected if the next-to-last analyzed element is wide enough to project from. For example, where the last analyzed element was a space, a new current search step is selected to analyze the bar that immediately follows that space, if the bar that immediately precedes that space is wide enough from which to project., 107172=Referring now to FIG. 10, there is shown a graphical representation of pixel image 1000 containing degraded bar code symbol 1002. Bar code symbol 1002 is a Code 128 symbol encoding the data \"CODE 128\". In addition to the eight data characters, bar code symbol 1002 includes a start character, a stop character which is considered to include the termination bar, and a checksum character. The checksum character represents the value 84, which is equivalent to the result of performing the appropriate Code 128 checksum computation on the eight data characters of bar code symbol 1002. The checksum character may be used to verify the correctness of the decoding of bar code symbol 1002., 127567=In the example of FIG. 12, means 1110 may determine that the signal energy value for bar 1206 is greater than the fourth threshold. Means 1112 may then select start point 1246 of search step 1230 as the start point for the new current search step by projecting from point 1248 of search step 1228 onto reference line 1226. For example, where bar code symbol elements have a minimum width of 0.015 inches, the fourth threshold may be equivalent to 0.030 inches. The projection from search step 1228 to reference line 1226 is preferably perpendicular to reference line 1226. If reference line 1226 is characterized by slope k and intercept n and center point 1248 is represented by point (x1,y1), then the projection line from center point 1248 is characterized by slope k1 and intercept n1, where: ##EQU3## Start point 1246 may be represented by the point (x2,y2), where: ##EQU4## After means 1116 determines that the quiet zone has not been reached, means 1108 performs subpixel interpolation for bar 1208 along search step 1230., 139189=Subsystem 1118 compares each measured width ti to the ideal widths to assign one or more ideal widths and deviations from those ideal widths to the measured width. For example, an ideal width of 2.0 may be associated with measured widths ti from 1.3 to 2.7. Similarly, an ideal width of 3.0 may be associated with measured widths ti from 2.3 to 3.7. Some measured widths may be associated with more than one ideal width, e.g., a measured width of 2.5 would be associated both with ideal width 2.0 and ideal width 3.0. Those skilled in the art will understand that these ranges may be selected empirically by testing various ranges with known bar code symbols., 143984=Means 1704 then compares the redundant results for each symbol element of the bar code symbol to select a single signal energy value for that symbol element. In a preferred embodiment, this selection may be performed by averaging the redundant signal energy values. In alternative embodiments, other types of statistical analysis may be performed to select a single signal energy value for each symbol element. After each symbol element is assigned a signal energy value, character determination subsystem 1118 of FIG. 11 may then generate character choices for use by decoding subsystem 114 as described earlier in this specification., 111296=Because bar code symbol 1002 is degraded in regions 1004 and 1006, stepping subsystem 904 may generate one or more alphanumeric character choices for each of the other data characters using reference line 1018. For example, stepping subsystem 904 may generate a first or best choice of \"O\" and a second best choice of \"W\" for the second data character of bar code symbol 1002, because reference line 1018 passes through degraded region 1004 at the second data character. The relative values of the assigned confidence factors may indicate that stepping subsystem 904 is \"more confident\" that the second data character actually represents the alphanumeric character \"0\" than that it actually represents the alphanumeric character \"W\". Similarly, stepping subsystem 904 may generate best, second best, and third best choices \"7\", \"L\", and \"E\", respectively, for the fourth data character of bar code symbol 1002 due to the adverse results of degraded region 1006., 137629=Referring now to FIG. 16, there is shown a graphical representation of bar code symbol character 1600 consisting of three bars 1602, 1604, and 1606, and three spaces 1608, 1610, and 1612. The widths of the symbol elements of symbol character 1600 may be represented by signal energy values b1, b2, b3 for the three bars and s1, s2, s3 for the three spaces. These signal energy values are generated by subpixel interpolation performed by decoding subsystem 114. Character determination subsystem 1118 determines a 1-module value X equivalent to 1 module for symbol character 1600, where: ##EQU9## Subsystem 1118 then forms four measured widths t1, t2, t3, t4 from the signal energy values generated by decoding subsystem 114 and the 1-module value X, where: ##EQU10## Each width ti corresponds to the width along symbol character 1600 from one symbol element edge to the next symbol element edge of the same type. For example, the width t1 corresponds to the number of modules from the leading edge of bar 1602 to the leading edge of the next bar--bar 1604. Similarly, the width t2 corresponds to the number of modules from the leading edge of space 1608 to the leading edge of the next space--space 1610. Since bars and spaces are integral numbers of modules wide, ideally the widths ti are integers from 2 to 7. In practice, however, noise may cause deviations from these ideal widths., 110335=For example, using reference line 1018, stepping subsystem 904 may determine that the first data character of bar code symbol 1002 should be associated with the alphanumeric character \"C\", as presented in Table I. That character choice is then assigned a particular confidence factor. Stepping subsystem 904 may also determine that the second data character is to be associated with the alphanumeric character \"O\", which is assigned its own confidence factor., 108936=In the example of FIG. 10, decoding subsystem 114 receives as inputs corners 1010, 1012, 1014, and 1016, which define a region of pixel image 1000 containing bar code symbol 1002. Means 902 selects reference line 1018 as the first reference line for decoding bar code symbol 1002. Reference line 1018 may be the line through points 1020 and 1022, where point 1020 is the midpoint between corners 1010 and 1012 at one end of bar code symbol 1002 and point 1022 is the midpoint between corners 1014 and 1016 at the other end of bar code symbol 1002., 129617=Referring now to FIGS. 14 and 15, there are shown process flow diagrams of subpixel interpolation subsystems 1400 and 1500 of the present invention for calculating signal energy values for bars and spaces, respectively. If the bar code symbol element to be analyzed is a bar, means 1108 of stepping subsystem 904 implements subpixel interpolation subsystem 1400 to determine a signal energy value for the region from the center of the space that immediately precedes the bar to the center of the space that immediately follows the bar. Similarly, if the symbol element to be analyzed is a space, means 1108 implements subsystem 1500 to determine an signal energy value for the region from the center of the bar that immediately precedes the space to the center of the bar that immediately follows the bar., 117376=Since {\"C\", \"O\", \"D\", \"E\", \"1\", \"2\", \"8\", \"84\"} is the correct character set, it satisfies the checksum analysis of means 920, that is, the result of the checksum computation performed on the data characters of that set of characters is \"84\", the value of the checksum character. At this point, bar code symbol 1002 is decoded and processing of decoding subsystem 114 is concluded. If it turned out for some reason, however, that region 1006 was so degraded that, for reference line 1018, none of the character sets selected by means 908 satisfies the checksum analysis, then means 914 determines whether there are any more reference lines to be used to decode bar code symbol 1002. The number of reference lines to be used may be dictated by the processing requirements of the particular application. In one embodiment, up to 20 reference lines are selected., 146379=Each element may be characterized using one or more search steps. For example, bar 1808 may be characterized using search steps 1842, 1844, and 1846. Means 1704 may keep track of the symbol elements by assigning each element an offset value corresponding to its location along the bar code symbol, where the offset value is based on the total energy signal value for the preceding elements. For example, bar 1806 of bar code symbol 1802 is the first bar in the symbol and has an offset of 0. If means 1702 generates an energy signal value equivalent to 9 modules for bar 1806 along search step 1840, then space 1824 has an offset of 9. Table III presents the offsets and energy signal values that may be generated by means 1702 for search steps 1840 through 1864. Search step 1844 begins with space 1824 having offset 8 based on the energy signal values of 8 and 9 for bar 1806 generated by means 1702 along search steps 1840 and 1842, respectively., 142424=Referring now to FIG. 17, there is shown a process flow diagram of stitching subsystem 1700 for decoding bar code symbols by stitching according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Stitching subsystem 1700 functions substantially in accordance with stepping subsystem 904 except that stitching subsystem 1700 uses each search step to perform subpixel interpolation of two or more symbol elements of the detected bar code symbol and each search step has one or more symbol elements in common with at least one other search step. That is, there is overlapping of symbol elements between successive search steps. Stitching subsystem 1700 determines the signal energy values to assign to each symbol element by comparing the redundant signal energy values that may exist for that symbol element from two or more different subpixel interpolations., 107887=Bar code symbol 1002 is degraded in regions 1004, 1006, and 1008. Degradations may make bars and spaces appear thinner or thicker than they were intended to be. Such deviations from intended thicknesses may result in errors in decoding bar code symbol 1002 along reference lines that pass through the degraded regions., 123175=Referring now to FIG. 12, there is shown a graphical representation of pixel image 1200 containing quiet zone 1204 and a portion of bar code symbol 1202 which is not aligned with either the pixel rows or columns of pixel image 1200. Bar code symbol 1202 includes bars 1206 through 1214, and spaces 1216 through 1224. FIG. 12 also shows reference line 1226 and search steps 1228 through 1242. Reference line 1226 is analogous to reference lines 1018, 1024, and 1026 of FIG. 10., 126997=After the start point is selected either by means 1112 or 1114, means 1116 determines whether stepping along the reference line is complete by checking whether the quiet zone has been reached. If so, character determination subsystem 1118 generates the alphanumeric character choices and confidence factors associated with each symbol character of the bar code symbol. At that point, processing by stepping subsystem 904 is complete. Character determination subsystem 1118 is further described later in this specification in conjunction with FIG. 16., 141884=Subsystem 1118 decodes each of the symbol characters in a detected Code 128 bar code symbol by performing similar analysis on each set of three bars and three spaces corresponding to a symbol character. The resulting alphanumeric character choices and associated confidence factors are used by means 906 of decoding subsystem 114 to create and update the character table used to generate character sets for checksum analysis., 148133=Since the energy signal values generated by means 1702 for each symbol element along different search steps may be different from one another, means 1704 may average the energy signal values for each element to determine a mean energy signal value to assign to that element, as presented in Table IV for the example of FIG. 18. In alternative embodiments, means 1704 may determine an energy signal value to assign to each element using other types of statistical analysis, including voting schemes., 118345=After means 914 determines that reference line 1018 is not the last reference line to be selected, means 902 may select reference line 1024 as the next reference line, where reference line 1024 is preferably the line midway between reference line 1018 and the line defined by corners 1010 and 1016. Stepping subsystem 904 then decodes by stepping along reference line 1024. As before, this decoding may result in one or more alphanumeric characters and associated confidence factors for each symbol character in bar code symbol 1002. Means 906 then updates the character table using the results for reference line 1024 and the results previously generated for reference line 1018., 128682=Otherwise, if the signal energy value for bar 1206 is not greater than the fourth threshold, then means 1114 sets the start point for subpixel interpolation to the center of bar 1206 along current search step 1228. After means 1116 determines that quiet zone has not been reached, means 1108 calculates the signal energy value for bar 1208 along current search step 1228. Subpixel interpolation of subsequent symbol elements continues along search step 1228 until the next-to-last analyzed element is a bar or space of sufficient width, in which case, means 1112 then projects from the center of that element onto reference line 1226 to select the start point of the new current search step. In this way, stepping subsystem 904 determines signal energy values for each symbol element of bar code symbol 1202., 135699=After subpixel interpolation has been performed for all of the symbol elements of the detected bar code symbol, character determination subsystem 1118 of stepping subsystem 904 determines the alphanumeric character choices for each of the symbol characters. Subpixel interpolation generates a signal energy value for each bar and space of the detected bar code symbol. Combinations of bars and spaces in the bar code symbol correspond to symbol characters. Character determination subsystem 1118 uses the signal energy values to determine one or more choices of alphanumeric characters for each of the symbol characters. Subsystem 1118 also computes a confidence factor for each alphanumeric character choice. These character choices and confidence factors are then used by decoding subsystem 114 to create and update the character table used in the checksum analysis described above., 140925=Subsystem 1118 will generate alternative choices when the measured widths ti fall within the ranges of more than one ideal width. Since the measured width t1 in character symbol 1600 is 2.45, it falls within the ranges for both a 2.0 and a 3.0. Thus, measured width t1 may correspond to a 3.0 instead of a 2.0, and a possible alternative choice for the measured set is the ideal set {3.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0}. The confidence factor for the alphanumeric character associated with this second ideal set is 0.95. Since the previous character choice has a lower confidence factor than this character choice, the previous character would be the first choice in the character table created by decoding subsystem 114. Other characters are also possible, but assuming the other measured widths ti lie within the ranges of only one ideal width each, subsystem 1118 does not select further alternative choices., 130442=When a bar is to be analyzed, means 1402 of subpixel interpolation subsystem 1400 locates a first peak corresponding to the center of the space immediately preceding the bar to be analyzed. When analyzing any bar other than the first bar of a bar code symbol, a peak generally represents a pixel intensity level maximum with respect to adjacent pixels. When analyzing the first bar, the first peak is preferably a bright pixel near the end of the quiet zone abutting the first bar. Means 1404 then locates a second peak corresponding to the center of the space immediately following the bar to be analyzed. The two peaks are adjacent critical points along a one-dimensional signal curve that represents a portion of the current search step that is centered on the bar to be analyzed., 124068=Stepping subsystem 904 of FIG. 11 begins with means 1102 which selects the first search step and the start point for the first search step. The first search step is preferably a row or column of pixels that intersects the reference line at the state transition between a quiet zone and a start/stop character of the detected bar code symbol. The start point is preferably the pixel that corresponds to the point of intersection. In FIG. 10, point 1020 may be the start point of the first search step when using reference line 1018 to decode bar code symbol 1002. Similarly, in FIG. 12, point 1244 may be the start point of first search step 1228 when using reference line 1226 to decode bar code symbol 1202. Search step 1228 forms part of the row of pixels that intersects reference line 1226 at point 1244., 144639=Referring now to FIG. 18, there is shown a graphical representation of pixel image 1800 containing bar code symbol 1802 which is not aligned with either the pixel rows or columns of pixel image 1800. Bar code symbol 1802 contains bars 1806 through 1822 and spaces 1824 through 1838. Stitching subsystem 1700 may decode bar code symbol 1802 by stepping along reference line 1804 to perform subpixel interpolation along search steps 1840 through 1864. With each search step, means 1702 generates energy signal values for one or more elements of bar code symbol 1802. For example, means 1702 may perform subpixel interpolation along search step 1840 to generate energy signal values for bar 1806 and space 1824. Similarly, means 1702 may perform subpixel interpolation along search step 1842 to generate energy signal values for bars 1806 and 1808 and space 1824. Table II contains the elements of bar code symbol 1802 that may be characterized along search steps 1840 through 1864., 121152=The updated character table is then processed by means 908, 910, and 912, as described before. If none of the character sets selected by means 908 from the updated character table satisfies the checksum analysis, then another reference line 1026 may be selected and the procedure of stepping, updating, and checksum analyzing repeated., 126312=To make this determination, means 1110 compares the signal energy value for the previous symbol element to a fourth threshold. The fourth threshold is preferably equivalent to at least two times the width of the narrowest bar code symbol element. If means 1110 determines that the signal energy value for the next-to-last analyzed element is larger than the fourth threshold, then means 1112 selects the start point for a new current search step by projecting from the center of the next-to-last analyzed element onto the reference line. Otherwise, means 1114 selects the start point along the current search step as the center of the next-to-last analyzed element., 139901=Assume that the set of measured widths {t1, t2, t3, t4 } derived by subpixel interpolation of character symbol 1600 of FIG. 16 is {2.45, 5.2, 4.9, 2.9}. Subsystem 1118 may select the ideal set {2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0} for this measured set. In that case, a distance measure reflecting the deviations from ideal is the sum of the absolute differences between the ideal set and the measured set, that is, (|2.45-2.0|+|5.2-5.0|+|4.9-5.0|+|2.9-3.0|) or 0.85. This distance measure may be used by decoding subsystem 114 as the confidence factor for the alphanumeric character corresponding to the ideal set {2.0, 5.0, 5.0, 3.0}. The closer the measured set is to the ideal set, the smaller the distance measure or confidence factor, and the greater the confidence that the measured set is the ideal set. If no alphanumeric character corresponds to that ideal set, then subsystem 1118 does not select that ideal set as a possible choice for the current symbol character., 123671=Referring now to FIG. 13, there is shown a graphical representation of the pixel intensity levels of 11 pixels in search step 1228 of pixel image 1200. Each pixel along search step 1228 has a corresponding intensity level representative of its brightness. In order to facilitate explanation, stepping subsystem 904 is described in the context of the example of FIGS. 12 and 13.}",

As described earlier in conjunction with FIG. 1, in a preferred embodiment, means 102 of detection system 100 generates a histogram of the entire input pixel image. The histogram is then used to select thresholds for detecting state transitions between bar code symbol quiet zones and start/stop characters. The histogram is also used to select minimum and maximum pixel intensity levels used in subpixel interpolation, as described earlier in conjunction with FIGS. 14 and 15. In an alternative preferred embodiment, detection system 100 performs adaptive thresholding in which the dynamic range of pixel intensity levels is determined for every part of the image separately. In adaptive thresholding, thresholds may be adjusted while scanning or searching through the image. In this preferred embodiment, detection system 100 can process images whose dynamic ranges vary over the image areas due, for example, to nonuniform illumination.
