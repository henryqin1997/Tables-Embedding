For example, computer networks 20 and 30 in FIG. 1 may be a Local Area Network (LAN) and a Wide Area Network (WAN), respectively, that together form a computer intranet. A resource map, when stored for later use or transmitted to a spider, may take the form of a database object, a structured file of text, or any other convenient format. The hard drive controller 523 is coupled to a hard disk suitable for storing executable computer programs, including programs embodying the present invention, and data. The video controller 531 is coupled to a video recorder, which may be used for storing and importing video footage and for writing final output. The I/O controller 524 is coupled by means of an I/O bus 526 to an I/O interface 527. The I/O interface 527 receives and transmits data (e.g., stills, pictures, movies, and animations for importing into a composition) in analog or digital form over communication links such as a serial link, local area network, wireless link, and parallel link. Also coupled to the I/O bus 526 is a display 528, a keyboard 529, a network interface card (NIC) 530, and a modem 532 for connecting, e.g., to an Internet service provider (ISP) or an on-line service provider (OSP). Alternatively, separate connections (separate buses) may be used for the I/O interface 527, display 528 and keyboard 529.",
