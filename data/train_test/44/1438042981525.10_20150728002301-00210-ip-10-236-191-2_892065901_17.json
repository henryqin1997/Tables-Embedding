            "Every building on campus is connected! So you never have to fear the cold or be afraid to walk to the library late at night. I have never felt uncomfortable in any situation being on campus alone.",
            "Whether you just want to play on an intramural sports team, join pottery club, or study abroad in another country, UMD has an absolutely incredible variety of student programs. If you can't find the group or club you're looking for, you can just as easily start your own!",
            "It's college. None of them are cheap! But UMD has won awards nation-wide for their academic programs. You'll get more bang for your buck than you could have expected. Awesome classes and professors make it well worth the money. And there are always scholarships available!",
            "It's Duluth. Come on. Go hang out in Canal Park, check out that big blue thing called Lake Superior, or go to a Bulldogs hockey, football, or any other sports game! The school spirit here is insane! It'll only take you a few short weeks to realize all the options you have for fun!",
            "UMD has great meal plan options as a freshman. With the dining center and food court on campus, it's pretty hard to go hungry.",
            "Dorm life at UMD is awesome! All the buildings are connected so it's that easy to go see anyone you want without having to go outside. Living in the dorms is the best way to meet tons of new people. I highly recommend it!",
            "Classes at any college are going to be tougher than high school, but you'll realize you have a lot of free time in college and if you use it right and simply put in the effort the classes aren't bad at all! Plus there are TONS of opportunities to get help on campus.",
            "If you are planning on coming to UMD you better be ready: to get taught by some amazing professors (for real, one of my music professors was the original keyboardist for the band Chicago!), to meet a lot of awesome people (ever heard of Minnesota nice? I'm pretty sure that originated in Duluth), to get a degree from a long list of extremely successful and award winning academic programs, and most importantly, you better be ready to have fun. The BIGGEST tip I can give, is to get involved! Join any and all groups or clubs you can in your first year. It's a great way to meet people. I just wish I had someone to tell this to me when I first got here."

Watch out for the potential health plan that the school adds onto your tuition bill if you don't show proof of insurance. A lot of my friends were out $1000-2000 until they realized they were added to the plan and got out of it, which isn't possible after the first few weeks., 308478=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 305205=To be certain UMD is the right college for you a campus tour is very helpful. Don't be concerned with the cold Minnesotan weather, dorms are connected to the campus via a heated sky walk so flip-flops and shorts are often worn year round. Plenty of UMD scholarships are available to apply for before May of each year., 107955=The Dining Center's foods average at best (and utterly mysterious sometimes). There's an ice cream machine too but it's normally broken down or the ice cream is bad. The hours are from 7:30 to 7:30 which isn't good. The coffee shop has great atmosphere though it's weekend hours aren't anything to brag about (it's closed on sunday). There also is a Food court with a 50's themed burger place, an italian and a sub place. The only one open until 10 would the the italian place otherwise everything else's hours vary widely.}",

    "textAfterTable": "umd is a fantastic but underrated school. not many people know about it outside of minnesota and wisconsin, and even fewer consider it during their college search, but it is a wonderful school nonetheless. it has miles of trails, a great city down the hill, awesome sports, good people, and best of all it is cheap.

Although Duluth has nasty winters, you wont need to go outside between classes because everything is connected by a concourse system ;) Tips for prospective students Apply early, and turn in your housing deposit early! Meet people and get involved, I missed out on a lot first semester because I did not join many clubs. Bang for",
