            "There are usually police officers somewhere around the campus. Teachers are everywhere as well. There is usually no unsafe activity at this school as many of the students that attend are responsible adults who are strictly there to learn and have fun outside of campus.",
            "There are many clubs and activities around campus.",
            "This school is great for students who want to go to school and still work. It is in location for students that live anywhere between Temecula and San Jacinto. You can opt to be a part-time student and work at the same time. You can also be a full-time student and work at the same time as well.",
            "The costs to attend this college are much less than a university but still require the standard cost per unit for each class. The average for a full-time student is around 400-500 dollars, not including books. The best advice is to buy your books on amazon or somewhere online ahead of time in order to spend less money. The book store at this school is VERY pricey.",
            "There is not much to do for fun at school, but there are other shops and hang-out spots around the area to go and study with friends or just to spend time together. There is also space available around campus to do this and in the LRC building.",
            "There is a cafe where they can make food from the menu for you. There are also a lot of snacks and drinks to choose from.",
            "There are no dorms at MSJC.",
            "Classes can vary with teachers and subjects. Most teachers are very helpful and can answer any questions you may have, just make sure to ask!",
            "Make sure you find out all the deadlines for any applications ahead of time. Make appointments with your counselors to ask them any questions. Enroll in your classes as soon as you get your registration date!",
            "This school has a nice location. The teachers here are great and really friendly. The campus is easy to navigate through."

Compared to a university, it is very cheap. There is also a board of governors wavier that one could apply for in order to have their classes paid for. One just has to show that they financially struggling., 30491=I would check out some other junior colleges in the area as well. Like Palomar or RCC. MSJC is a good school, its just really impacted and hard to get into classes. It would probably be a good idea to register for classes at a couple different places if you can, or just be okay with the fact that an AA/AS could take you 3 - 5 years., 159767=Class units cost $48 as of Oct. 2012. Way more affordable than starting off at a University. Pay close attention to which units transfer and which don't., 117121=As of now they are asking i believe $36 a unit which is just over $100 a class which is a whole lot cheaper for your general education then if you were going to a Four-year institution paying almost a $1000 or more per class. I say your going to get more band for your buck here then at a Four-year, 277808=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 104405=Units will increase beginning Fall 2012 to $49 a unit}",

Even top students in high school will learn as much at this school as if they went to a 4 year university. Tips for prospective students Buy the books from somewhere online or from other students. I paid for all my books new and they were all over $60. Bang for the buck The tuition is extremely cheap. I LOVE how cheap it is. Compared to other schools, going to Mount San Jacinto is like going to school for free, which in this economy is mind blowing! The cafe is also very cheap but it serves delicious food. Am enjoying being here",
