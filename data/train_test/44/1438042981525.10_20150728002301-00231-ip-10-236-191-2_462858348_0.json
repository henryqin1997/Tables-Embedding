Galax and Grayson County will need to make room for the G-Men as they enter the MED in 2011, while Carroll County must find replacements for Graham as well as Grundy, which is heading to the Black Diamond District., 31809=Despite their geographical proximity, the Cavaliers and the Bears have never met on the football field. Although competing in North Carolina\u2019s smallest classification, Mt. Airy should be a solid opponent. The 2008 1-A state champions, Mt. Airy saw its 31-game winning streak come to an end in last year\u2019s title game. The Bears (currently 3-2) are coming off a three-year stretch in which they went 13-1, 16-0 and 15-1. They will be only the second out-of-state opponent ever for Carroll, and the Cavaliers\u2019 first since playing Surry Central, N.C. in 1976., 40626=Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Galax Gazette is your source for local news, sports, events and information in Galax, Grayson, Carroll, and surrounding areas.}",
