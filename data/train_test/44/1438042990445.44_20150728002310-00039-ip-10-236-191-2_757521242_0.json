I have known Jody all my life and I am troubled that someone could ruin someone's life so easily., 33600=\u00a0I was greatly disappointed in the printing of Bonnie Erbe's column \"End the mistreatment of race horses\" May 8 in The News-Enterprise. Her column was chock-full of horror stories depicting the worst sorts of cruelty to horses imaginable. None were documented. None correspond with my own personal knowledge of pleasure and race horses. Kentucky is horse country. The News-Enterprise should apologize to horse owners everywhere for its implicit endorsement of Bonnie Erbe's slander., 50797=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 38565=In May 2003 when major combat actions were declared completed, the nation collectively wiped its brow and thought, \u201cWhew. Thank God casualties were relatively few.\u201d, 31747=Gov. Steve Beshear proclaimed May 1 as \u201cDay of Prayer in Kentucky.\u201d Thank you, Governor. If I may, here is a prayer for the most innocent among us., 30411=A church outing turned tragic for members of the Radcliff First Assembly of God when 27 lives were lost on that fateful night of Saturday, May 14, 1988. They will never be forgotten., 31055=April Mills}",
