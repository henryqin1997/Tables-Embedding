You never have too many Problem in that it's a nice problem to have, as in a riches of pitchers. Problem as in, I want this problem, seriously. August 23, 2011 11:31 AM Yes, I wish it was a very good problem as we are still talking about unproven talent and questions on Wang and Detwiler. This is why the Phillies were able to trade JA Happ in the Oswalt trade and Kyle Drabek in the Halladay trade because they have established a pipeline of talent.Also keep in mind that not everyone wants to play for the Yankees but all good starters want to win. Cliff Lee chose to go to Philadelphia over NYY and Boston.This is what the Nats need to establish in the Minors to either do it like Tampa Bay where you are growing your own talent or a hybrid like Philly where Hamels was their own and all the other pieces came from trade and Free Agency. Now they have this Vance Worley kid who was a 3rd round pickup in 2008 who has put up excellent numbers., 123095=NatsJack in Florida said\u2026 Man\u2026 people just do not understand the importance of left handed starters in the NL East. That's the best way to get past both Atlanta and Philly.Why are people so bent on dumping LannEn now that he's learned how to pitch? August 23, 2011 1:55 PM Many don't get it which is why I think Milone gets a higher rating than Peacock and why the Nats need 2 (good) lefties in the bullpen and why Detwiler is so important to the team and why Buehrle is a coveted target more so because he is a lefty.Lannan is under team control for 2 more years., 124292=Anonymous said\u2026 had to say, just met danny espinosa who gave me 2 tickets for the game tonight. Could not have been a nicer guy. Really down to earth! By the way, anyone know where the will call is to pick them up? Im just used to coming through left field entrance with my tix. Thanks! August 23, 2011 2:52 PM Players Will Call is to the right of the Suites/Media entrance by home plate entrance., 99593=Steve M. said\u2026 Analytical Nat said\u2026 If I had to chose one or the other, having that winning season beside your organization matters more for marketing and for attracting FA, and it just feels good. You forgot one biggie. Attracting Ryan Zimmerman to sign an extension. A winning season would be very big for him plus the Brinks truck and a key to it.Guys \u2014 I see this all the time around here, and I just don't buy it. RZimm (nor other free agents) are not so shallow as to measure a team by simply it's W-L record. Much more important is: which direction is the team moving? (As well as: how is the front office and manager, etc.)Everybody knows the Nats are in an upward direction. Everybody knows about Stras and Harper and the incredible 2011 draft. That (and money) is way way more important than whether we hit the mythical .500 mark or not.(I distinctly remember Keith Hernandez leaving the Card to sign for a Mets team that had just finished 65-97. The FO convinced Keith that they were committed to winning, and had a ton of talent in the minors \u2014 including then minor-leaguers Strawberry and Gooden.)RZ knows what direction we're going. And if he sees that we didn't finish .500 because we played guys like Peacock and Milone \u2014 or, heck \u2014 what if even Strasburg loses most of his games this Sept?! \u2014 RZ is smart enough to know how good the team is and our direction for next year without whether we actually got those few extra victories at the end of the year., 47938=NatsJack in Florida said\u2026 And Detwiler needs to go to LannEns physical trainer and bulk up alot. He could stand to put 30 lbs on that frame of his spread evenly from hips to shoulders.It has sure made a difference in LannEns game. And NatsLady re:Maya\u2026. yes. August 23, 2011 11:20 AMYep, I think Detwiler weighs the same as the day he arrived. He needs to build up those legs of his as being a starter for the season requires a body to sustain it with endurance. I know there have been comparisons to Lincecum in body size but Lincecum has proved against the odds he can do it. Ross hasn't proven more than a few starts of 5 to 6 2/3 innings. That is what has me nervous that he won't sustain it and look like some of the fringe starters of years past.If this team is trying to be post-season competitive, you need 4 proven starters. We already know that Strasburg won't be around past 160 innings in 2012., 32906=The Phillies, and other patient teams, are the types of teams Lannan will do poorest against. Even though he can occasionally bring it in the low 90's, he relies on location rather than overpowering hitters. When he's off to an impatient team, the hitters will get themselves out. When he's off to a patient team, he'll get pounded.Lannan is a lock for 2012, but might not be for 2013., 103963=I'd let the battle for starting pitching jobs be fought at Spring Training 2011.The problem with that is pitchers in spring training only gradually work their way up to pitching more than a few innings at a time. They'll only get at most one start during ST where they are expected to go five or six innings. This would allow someone who looks real good the first two times through the lineup but can't make it through the third time to sneak his way into the rotation. Letting the rotation candidates pitch in September when they're fully stretched out avoids that problem., 144165=Hope the Wandy thing is just a rumour. I have my heart set on Steve M. joining Rizzo as assist. GM, not because we have same first name and last initial but because I would love to have Buehrle next year. 33 years old \u2013 he has TEN straight seasons winning 10+ games and has pitched 200+ innings in those 10 years as well. Coming into this year he has over 1200 Ks/500 walks. Just a solid pitcher who would help our young guys a bunch.I loved watching Detwiler last night and also loved having a crowd around me that was cheering for the home team. The Drrrew thing was spontaneous but picked up speed and I will use it again tomorrow.Has there ever been a playoff team with 3 lefthanded starters? J Zimmnn, SS, LannEn, Detwiler & Buehrle. Trouble here is I really like what Wang has done as well. What a delightful problem to have. Also think Peacock and Milone can start at AAA next year and still see time with the big boys if they have a good Sept this year., 44582=According to MLB trade rumors, Gorzy cleared waivers on August 15.http://www.kffl.com/player/13069/MLB/Tom-Gorzelanny, 126209=Well forget Mark Buehrle, the Nats just got Wandy Rodgriguez as a waiver claim and he's not cheap. $10 mill next year and $13 mill in 2013 plus a team option. Not a young guy as he will be 33 years old next year. Having a good year on a lousy team and a solid #3 ahead of Lannan.I wonder who they gave up. My guess is bye bye to someone on the 40 man., 136640=Anonymous said\u2026 Analytical Nat I'd say a 5.9. August 23, 2011 3:23 PM Good., 31374=Well \u2013 this is quite an interesting situation , isn't it? I think one of the reasons you think very seriously about both Lannan and Detweiler is that they are lefties \u2013 a valuable commodity. In September we will definitely need a pitcher to back up SS. Is Gorzelanny under contract or a free agent? Do we actually use one of our up and coming pitchers as trade bait for a center fielder/leadoff? ( horrors!) Who do we see back in the pen next year \u2013 Coffey? Burnett? Balester? What I want to see is a good look at September call-ups, but also a good strong run to the end of the season. And , I just have to add once again \u2013 How good are Ryan Zimmerman and Drew Storen? There are others, too! And \u2013 Jayson, keep it up!!! GYFNG!!! natsfan1a \u2014 I LOVE \"The Franchise\"!!! I can't believe how up to date each new episode is \u2013 it's crazy that they are using stuff from only a week before its aired., 97457=Lannan absolutely should be a lock for next year. With that said, I wouldn't be surprised if he comes down with a fluke injury shelving him for the next 2 weeks or even till the end of the season to get Peacock a few spot starts. I think Milone will be a September callup, pushing Livo to the bullpen. With two young guns and Strasburg replacing Zmann in the lineup, we'll need Livo and Gorzo for long relief. If I was the GM\u2026 I want to see Strasburg, Wang, Detwiler, Peacock (for 2 weeks replacing Lannan) and Milone for the rest of the year as the rotation., 60967=jd said\u2026 I agree with N.Cognito that Lannan is a lock for 2012 but when the young guns start graduating from the minors it's hard to see where he fits in especially when he becomes expensive.I really feel that Wang is a good option if he will sign for a 1 year deal for about $5 mil with a mutual option for a 2nd year. I would not commit to Buhrle for more than 3 years. August 23, 2011 11:35 AM Agree. I think the 6th day after the World Series is over you are calling Buehrle and offering to pay him $60 million for 3 years. Over pay him for 3 years and take him quick before the big market teams have a chance to react. Instead of throwing away money in the 4th and 5th years, pay him more years 1-3. Give him a team 4th and 5th year options if you have to. He is the lefty you need for next year and he slides into the #3 spot and Lannen goes to the #4. Then you can take a chance on Wang and move Detwiler to the bullpen and it gives you another year in the Minors to evaluate Peacock and Milone while seeing which one is the guy, as you will need someone in mid-August 2012 for Strasburg., 64466=JamesFan \u2013 I hear you about giving up third place and a .500 season to see what we have got. Fortunately for us, it appears that the fish have gotten to that point a long time before us. They demoted LOMO to teach him a lesson, which is probably hurting them, too. I hope they love their principles. The Mets are not contending and have had lots of injury problems. So \u2013 they will probably also be bringing up people from the minors. Our three way Mets/Fish/Nats competitions may look somewhat like AAA match- ups at times. The Phils can coast, the Braves HAVE to win as much as possible. I often wonder how fair it is in September if were , for example, to pitch a call-up against the Braves and give them perhaps an easier win and then use a front line starter against someone they are competing against. I just don't think what we do should affect the post-season outcome., 29568=Analytical Nat, seriously? Problem? You never have too many and this is a fight for the 4th and 5th starter not a #1, 2 or 3. I still think Rizzo will pick up a #3 or #4 from Free Agency which he can do if he is early on while the big boys are pre-occupied with Sabathia and CJ Wilson, the Nats can work on Buehrle.Worse case is the Nats are picking from their own Free Agents of Livo and Wang or going with Ross Detwiler and rookies Milone and Peacock.I agree with Mark Z. with regards to Livo \"But the time has probably come for the Nationals to slide him out of the way, perhaps sticking him in the bullpen for the season's final month, in order to get a look at Milone and Peacock.\"To me, the jury is still out on all 5 of the maybes. I am starting to think Detwiler could be the guy. I agree with comments yesterday on Detwiler as he approached the 5th inning. Super sharp for 4 innings. Arm strength definitely better than the past starts which was important. Rizzo has to decide if 2012 is the year for a post-season push or another year of 10% improvement over the previous year because historically 92 1/2 wins almost guarantees you a Wild Card spot., 55399=Anonymous said\u2026 Mark,With the signing of Rendon and Purke to MLB contracts, is the Nats roster at 40 (excluding 60 day DLers)? If so, who is getting waived or traded to make room for Peacock and Milone? Also, looks to me like the Nats are going to leave some decent prospects off the 40 man roster and expose them in the Rule V draft as the organization has never been so deep. Pilchard August 23, 2011 11:46 AM The Nats have 2 more to move to 60 Day I believe and need room for Strasburg. They need to create 1 spot I believe for 3 players in Peacock, Milone and Lombardozzi as Marrero is already on the 40 man., 112054=@DC Wonk, I normally don't agree with Boswell and even he has been talking about the positives of the winning record. I think you can try to tell a player where you are heading and they can believe it or not. You show them a trendline from 2009 to 2010 to 2011 and most will buy off on that. Some will be impressed by the .506 winning percentage. Ryan Zimmerman has been through the worst of times. Not sure what will motivate Ryan right now., 997=It's been a while since there was any reason to pay more than scant attention to September baseball in the District. Over the last five seasons, the Nationals have entered the final month of play with virtually nothing at stake, aside from a bit of pride and the occasional late-season debut of a prospect (Ian Desmond in 2009, Danny Espinosa and Wilson Ramos in 2010)., 9844=This is gonna be big time FUN! And so many home games, every weekend in September is at home. Mark, when you have a chance, any news on Pudge? I heard that the Giant's backup catcher is on the DL., 46381=Gorzy is under team control for 2 more years, and relatively cheap\u2013$2M this year, and tho he's arb-eligible, his 2011 #s don't look to earn him a big raise in 2012. I would be surprised if they just let him walk\u2013better I'd think to resign him and use him as trade bait., 93404=Yankees just added Laffey (L), picked up on waivers from Seattle. He was assigned to their AAA team but is expected to join the team on September 1st., 82690=JamesFan said\u2026 This is not hard. I would give up third place and a .500 season to test our best prospects, especially pitchers in September. Understand where you commin' from, but respectfully disagree. Without knowing what the outcome of the season will be, hypothetically, if the Nats could finish 82 \u2013 80, psychologically for the organization and fans this would be a significant success story going forward into 2012 and I think significantly more important than about finding out about would-be pitchers and prospects in September. If I had to chose one or the other, having that winning season beside your organization matters more for marketing and for attracting FA, and it just feels good., 56645=This is not hard. I would give up third place and a .500 season to test our best prospects, especially pitchers in September. Lannan, Gorzy and Det are interchangable at this point. One can be traded, one stays in the pen; start one. Rizzo can decide. Shut down Znn, put Livo in the pen for now. Bring up Peacock and Milone (not Stammen and Maya please. We know them too well.) Let Marrero and Lombardozzi get in several games as starters. I would also give Brown or someone some reps in centerfield. We have to look long-term. Livo understands that., 41456=And there's this: A.J Cole and Alex Meyer are potential top of the rotation guys and may be ready for 2013. There's nothing like excess talent. The Expos traded for Pedro Martinez because they were not afraid to swap Delino Deshields knowing they had excellent young players to fill his shoes., 139943=It drives me crazy\u2013some of the comments about Detwiler. Roy Harper says Detwiler doesn't come through in September. I've written about this before, with nary a comment from one other blogger. In 2009, after a poor debut at the major league level, Detwiler returned to triple A and did very well. He returned to the big leagues in September and had an excellent month. Then the injury. Now it appears he might be getting it back. I'm am sick of the negativity about certain Nat's players such as Detwiler and Desmond. But I'm especially sick of the ignorance that often accompanies these comments., 161002=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern.

Click here for past audio clips., 96035=Analytical Nat said\u2026 If I had to chose one or the other, having that winning season beside your organization matters more for marketing and for attracting FA, and it just feels good. August 23, 2011 12:41 PM You forgot one biggie. Attracting Ryan Zimmerman to sign an extension. A winning season would be very big for him plus the Brinks truck and a key to it.The winning record has been the unachievable and 2006-2010 out of the realm of reality.You still have to continue with bringing up prospects but again, you don't ever sacrifice wins.Here's the breakdown of the remaining 36 games to go 20-16:Arizona 3 (1st place)Reds 3 (3rd place)Braves 6 (1st place Wild Card)Mets 7 (4th place)Dodgers 4 (Last place)Astros 3 (Last place)Marlins 6 (Last place)Phillie 4 (1st place), 173337=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 84012=I wish this were not true, but Livan Hernandez still might be the best starting pitcher on this staff. Hernandez, Lannan, Wang, Detwiler, Zimmermann and even Strasburg have all turned in both really good and really bad performances this year. At least with Livo, you have a lengthy track record of his previous success.I'd let the battle for starting pitching jobs be fought at Spring Training 2011., 86951=I thought in 2005 the Nats were above 500 going into Sept? However, they were fading and finished 81-81. Frankly, we should expect better than a 20-16 finish. I feel if Nats are above 500 going into 9/1, anything can happen. Regardless, you still shut down Jordan Z period! March 2012 will be exciting in watching who will be the 5 in the rotation, 45395=I agree with N.Cognito that Lannan is a lock for 2012 but when the young guns start graduating from the minors it's hard to see where he fits in especially when he becomes expensive. I really feel that Wang is a good option if he will sign for a 1 year deal for about $5 mil with a mutual option for a 2nd year. I would not commit to Buhrle for more than 3 years., 85839=Anon at 12:01, The Yankees starting pitching is not messy to the point where Livo and Gorzo are an improvement. They have gotten good performances from Nova (excellent actually), Garcia and Colon. Yes they are concerned about the playoffs but they don't shop at Target or Kmart. When they look for pitchers to go for the best with loaded wallets. The Yankees also have 2 stud pitchers on the verge of being ready (Banuelos and Betances) so I don't think you can tempt them with Livo and Gorzo., 15219=When Strasburg gets back here, will he be allowed to pitch a full game (6-7 innings) this September, or will he have some sort of shortened limit? I could imagine a situation where the Nats plan for two pitchers per game. Strasburg might be started with a 60-pitch/4-inning limit, and another \"starter\" would come in as the reliever after that. That could allow the team to give better evaluations to all this potential talent., 16306=NatsLady: Pudge has begun taking some light swings, but he's still got a ways to go before he's ready to play again. May not make it back this year at all.If a team like the Giants was interested, they'd have to see him healthy and playing again before Aug. 31, because players acquired after that date aren't eligible for the postseason., 92693=On a scale of 1 to 10, the promise, excitement, and anticipation of 2012 is a 10+, 1387=Make no mistake, though: This September will be worth watching, for any number of reasons., 121155=I work in Crystal City at 2600 crystal drive. We evacuated our high rise for about 30 mins. It was strong as heck here\u2026 the building was shaking and swayed a lil bit. I didn't know what it was at first\u2026. being on the 2nd floor of a 19 story building, I ran to the balcony. I almost jumped the 15 feet down to get the heck away from the building. Never been in an earthquake before. But soemthing did happen around 25th st. and Crystal Drive. The road was block off, with a bunch of ambulance and firetrucks. Maybe someone just got in a crash cuz they were scared as it happened., 1859=The other compelling storyline that is beginning to emerge, though, is the battle for spots in the Nationals' 2012 rotation. There is plenty left to decide, and there is plenty of reason to believe September performances are going to matter in this race., 59567=Given that Livo takes about a hundred pitches to warm up before a start I think it rules him out for the bullpen. Livo has tendencies to be very good in the cold months of April and May, while slacking off terribly after that. We can live without Livo next year, although I will miss him.I am very excited about seeing Peacock and Strassburg in September. If Wang continues to improve (and resigns) there may be no need for a major free agent pitcher to be brought in. Strassburg, Zimmermann, Lannen, Wang and Detwiler would be an improvement over 2011's staff. If there is a true competition next year for the last position then so much the better. I see the bullpen needing a lockdown 7th inning pitcher as being a priority. Then we can start talking about 6 inning games., 106045=Lots of food for thought in this post and the comments, that's for sure. One thing that jumps out initially \u2014 I question whether it really makes sense to keep LannEN in the rotation for the next month with all of the other guys we'd like to at least get some experience against MLB hitters. As for next year, I totally understand the view that Livo might be close to the end of his time with the Nats, but his reliability and durability make it far from certain that he won't be the No. 5 starter next year, especially if Nats decide to part with someone (LannEn, Det, Gorzo?) to get a CF. I expect that Purke will spend all of next year in the minors, and Peacock and Millone may not be quite ready either. September will tell us something, but remember that the teams we're playing will also be giving playing time to their expanded rosters. Also, if DJ stays, he has said he's going to want a very different, and smaller, bullpen next year. We can expect to have two long men in the pen \u2014 which puts Maya back in the mix in my view. I doubt if Livo would want that role. He might very well decide to sign on with a team that needs him every fifth day, as much as he likes DC and this team, if he can't compete for a rotation spot. Finally, I think the Nats would be well advised to use Strasburg differently than they did JZnn this year. If we are going to make a serious run at the post season, and I think that should be our mindset at least initially, we don't want to have to shut down Strasburg in September. Pitch him for 5 innings per start instead of 6 and that amounts to 7 more starts a year. That could be crucial as we had down the stretch next September, and is another good reason to have two long men in the bullpen.The RZimm question is very important. I think next year's performance is much more significant than how we finish this year. Either way, that needs to be a priority for the front office and ought to be in the mix as they figure out next year's rotation. Great \"problems\" to have eh?, 70576=@gonatsgo: in regard to whether it is \"fair\" to bring in a call-up to pitch to a contending team\u20131) We have plenty of games against the Mets and Marlins in September.2) Remember what Stras said about pitching against better hitters, that you have to set them up vs. minor-league guys who are swinging from the ankles at every pitch? That's got to apply even more when you get higher. Now, of course they get SOME major league hitters in Syracuse when guys are rehabbing (and probably not at full strength, and certainly not going full out). The more chances the young guys get to pitch against good hitters in real game situations, the better off they are. You are not setting them up for failure, I'm sure they are chomping at the bit., 66792=Mark, can you confirm Livo's contract status? If I remember right, he did the \"slip of paper\" negotiation with Rizzo for $1 million for 2011. If the Nats sit him down for September as you suggest, and he's not under contract after the end of this year, then how about trading him now? Get what you can for him, give him a chance at the playoffs, and then if he's still in the plans sign him as a free agent in the off-season. What do you think he would bring from a contender looking for help in a trade at the September 1st deadline?, 13874=Interesting debate to be having, although I would argue one of little signficance beyond who gets a leg up going into Spring Training in 2012. Far too often have we seen performances in August and September that have not translated to the next season (Detweiler fitting this description on several occasions).I am interested to see which pitchers the Nats bring up on when rosters expand, but I have to think going into 2012 the following guys are in the mix, besides the three locks you mention above(in no particular order):MayaStammenMillonePeacockMyersWangMartisLivoDetweilerGorzelannySeptember could be a good way to showcase some of these guys too.
