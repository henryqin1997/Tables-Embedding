    "textBeforeTable": "What to Do ? Phu Quoc is also called the Emerald Island because of its natural treasures and tourism potential. There's plenty of strips of sand and fine beaches with clear and blue water like Long Beach, Bai Sao, Beach Bai Vong where travelers can go for picnics, paddling, snorkeling or fishing. Aside from its beaches, Phu Quoc is known for two things -- its fish sauce factories (dotted through Duong Dong town) and Suoi Tranh waterfall (10km southeast of Duong Dong in the centre of the island). Phu Quoc Island has many deep harbors such as An Thoi and Hon Thom where international and domestic ships anchor. There are also several historical sites on the island for instance National Hero Nguyen Trung Truc's military base, vestige of King Gia Long, the first king of Nguyen Dynasty in 19th century and Phu Quoc Prison. Another attraction is the Pearl Farm, which sits about a third of the way down the length of Long Beach. Again a bit of a filler for a very slow or rainy day, the farm includes a small educational display about pearls along with the opportunity to spend a motza on a few sets of earrings. In the rainy season (May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Oct) Phu Quoc is relatively quiet, and room rates become more easily negotiable, though in peak season ( Dec- Jan), accommodation",
