What I've been told is that an artist on MTM needs to move 10,000 units in order to earn its keep on the label's roster. Erosion of this \"quota\", if you will, due to CD burning could obviously lead to a band being out of a record deal. Without a CD, it's that much harder for a band to draw numbers on the live circuit. The two go hand in hand: you hear a CD by a band- you want to see them live. Or the reverse: you see a great band live and the next question is: do they have a CD? I think, Mike, in a large sense, you are right about labels getting a lion's share of the profits. However, when you're talking about smaller European hard rock labels, I think the benefits of being an artist are greater. Let's face it: MTM and Z Records don't have to put up large amounts of money for two-page ads in Billboard magazine or foot seven-digit production costs for a video clip. Mind you, the chances of an artist going double platinum are pretty slim, so everything is to scale, I suppose. ------------------------------- koogles wrote: So let me get this correctly.You need to",
