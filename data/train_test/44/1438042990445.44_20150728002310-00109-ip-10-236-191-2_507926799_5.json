Skin tests can help identify what you are allergic to. But completely avoiding them is not always possible. The reality is that most allergy sufferers need to take medicine, including antihistamines. A 2010 Consumer Reports survey found that people who suffer from allergies use a variety of measures to get relief, including avoiding the substance they're allergic to, and taking both nonprescription and prescription medications. You can read more about the survey results and the strategies that people said were most helpful at: http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2012/08/relief-from-springtime-allergies/index.htm., 90363=Written by ConsumerReports.org | Published on March 31, 2014, 51817=Source: Adapted from \"Is it Just an Allergy?\" Consumer Reports on Health newsletter, May 2005 (Vol. 15, No. 5)., 11554=Consumer Reports is an independent and nonprofit organization whose mission since 1936 has been to provide consumers with unbiased information on goods and services and to create a fair marketplace.

The prices for prescription drugs in this report are national averages based on sales of the drugs in retail outlets. They reflect the retail cash price that would be paid for a month's supply of each drug in February 2013. Prices for nonprescription drugs were obtained from several large drugstore chains.

    "textAfterTable": "\"Generic\" indicates that the drug is sold as a generic. \"Yes\" means it is a generic, sold under the chemical or scientific name. \"BG\" means it is a branded generic, which is a generic copy of an original drug given a special name by its manufacturer. In this table, for example, Alavert is a branded generic. \"No\" means it is a brand-name drug. OTC stands for over-the-counter; \"yes\" means it is a nonprescription OTC drug. Frequency of use reflects recommendations on the package insert; some products can be used more or less frequently. For drugs available by prescription only, monthly costs reflect nationwide retail average prices for February 2013, rounded to the nearest dollar. Data is provided by Symphony Health Solutions, which is not involved in our analysis or recommendations. For drugs available OTC, prices were obtained by Consumer Reports secret shoppers from five major chain pharmacies (CVS, Rite Aid, Target, Walgreens, and Walmart) and local supermarkets across the U.S. in January 2013, and in some cases, prices were obtained by Consumer Reports in June 2013 at the online sites of those chain pharmacies. The prices from the various stores were averaged to yield per pill prices, which were then converted into a monthly price based on the maximum recommended number of pills per day. 1",
