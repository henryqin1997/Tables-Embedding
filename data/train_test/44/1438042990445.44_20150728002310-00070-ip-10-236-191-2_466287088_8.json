    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17707=Prior art references describe four application methodologies. The first methodology (1) was the placement of the fluids in the tank of an ultrasonic cleaning bath or similar cavitating open vessel, as described quite extensively in early publications, such as \"Ultrasonics . . . Science of a Coming Technology\" (unattributed), in Industrial Laboratories, April 1952, and \"Ultrasonically Induced Cavitation in Water\" by G. W. Willard of the Bell Telephone Laboratories, in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Volume 25, No. 4, Pp. 669-686, July 1953, and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,351,539 and 4,576,688. A further development of this methodolgy was the closure of the tank or vessel such that liquid could flow in a controlled manner in and out of the energy field, usually accompanied by provision of additional radiating surfaces to increase the intensity of the energy field, as described in Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc. Technical Note HSU-TN-1, \"Industrial Scale Ultrasonic Liquid Processing\", dated April 1984. A second methodology (2) was the introduction into a static bath containing two or more fluids, of a probe vibrating at sufficiently high amplitude and frequency to generate cavitation, the creation of shock waves in liquid by formation and collapse of vapor bubbles, as described in U.S. patents such as U.S. Pat. No. 3,246,881. A further development of this technique was the enclosure of the probe tip and liquid bath in a pressure vessel with inlet and outlet provisions, thereby allowing pressurization of the bath and continuous flow of the liquid and other fluids, as described in Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc. brochure S-803 dated May 1962 and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,394,274; 3,715,104; and 4,244,702. The third methodology (3) was the passage of the fluids past a vibrating knife edge or reed by which means cavitation was induced in the primary liquid, as described in Bulletin 60 from Sonic Engineering Corp. and in literature covering the SONOLATOR device from Sonic Engineering Corportation. The fourth methodology (4) was the forcing of fluids at extremes of pressure through greatly restricted orifices such that very high rates of shear were generated in the primary liquid, resulting in cavitation, as described in literature from APV-Gaulin Corp. One of many methods of purifying water through the introduction of ozone is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,548,716, while one of many methods of purifying liquids and other substances by the application of ultrasonic energy is discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,477,357., 20307=Prior art methods and methodologies are shown and described in Reprint PVI-2 entitled \"Application of Ultrasonic Liquid Processors (Power vs. Intensity in Sonication)\", by S. Berliner, III, dated April 1985, available from Heat Systems Incorporrated, 1938 New Highway, Farmingdale, N.Y. 11735, which describes typical equipment and applications; in \"The Chemical Effects of Ultrasound\", Pp. 80-86, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, February 1989, by Dr. Kenneth S. Suslick, which describes processes; and in Bulletin S-803, entitled \"New Branson SONIFIER\", available from Branson Instruments, Inc., which describes a device.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While the method of invention has been described in its preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the words which have been used are words of description rather than limitation and that changes may be made within the purview of the appended claims without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention in its broader aspects. A sixth embodiment, which uses the method of the invention, is shown in FIG. 9. Parts of sixth embodiment or assembly 500 which are like parts of the first embodiment 10 have the same numerals but with a subscript \"c\" added thereto. Assembly 500 has a converter 14c with a cable 15c, a cup or bell-shaped horn 16c and a housing or vessel or cell 20c. Converter 14c has an axis 38c. Converter 16c has substantially the same structure as converter 14 of first embodiment 10. Ring horn 16c has the same structure as horn 16, but ring horn 16c has an internally-relieved bell-shaped lower portion or bell portion 502. Bell portion 502 has a ring-shaped radiation face 504. Face 504 forms an upper part of an annular sonication zone 506. Cell 20c has a pipe assembly 508. Cell 20c has a peripheral wall 510, a lower end wall 512, and an upper end wall 514 enclosing a cavity 516. Lower wall 512 has a seal ring 518, which engages pipe assembly 508. Upper wall 514",
