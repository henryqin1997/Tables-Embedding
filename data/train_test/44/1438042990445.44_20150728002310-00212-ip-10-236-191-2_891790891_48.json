            "We're right on the Boston Common, and so it should be a kind of dangerous place, but you can walk through the Common at three and the morning and be safe. The Boston PD is very good, and Emerson has its own police too. There are muggings, of course, it's a city, but the police always notifies us when it happens and gives us frequent tips to be safe. I never feel worried walking anywhere.",
            "I don't think there's really a type of student for Emerson. I've heard a lot of people, many students, call us stuck-up hipsters, rich kids, privileged kids, and I'm sure many are like that. But everyone I've met seems to fall outside a type, and everyone I've met has been really open-minded and really kind to everyone. Honestly, if you have a passion and you just want a school that can focus that passion, look at Emerson. You're type doesn't matter.",
            "Our college is the type of college that will name its School of Communications the Ron Burgundy School of Communications for a day after the fictional star of Anchorman 2 and have Will Ferrell give a press conference as the character at our school. Enough said.",
            "Emerson, though it's not explicitly a performing arts school, is heavily involved with the arts. We own five theaters with student performances or company performances, and each ticket is only $15 as opposed to $65 for students. There are like, a million groups on campus who organize events or give comedic performances of their own. There's an open-mic night nearly every other week. And, of course, you're in the city! Just walk around for a little bit, or travel three stops on the T, and you'll find something to easily. Plus, you get MFA tickets for free.",
            "So it's still school food, but the chicken is actually chicken, I feel like the vegetables have nutrients, and I actually want to eat the food. It's a million times better than high school food. The dining hall has a wide variety of food options; it even has a vegan station. There's a convenience store and several cafes, one of which is in my dorm room, with really delicious food. Since Emerson is in Boston too, there's plenty of opportunities for other food if you don't like the campus food (for some reason...). The meal plan easily provides enough food as long as your not careless with the meals and the Board Bucks (school dollars that can be used pretty much anywhere). Exceeds expectation.",
            "All of the dorms are surprisingly spacious with a lot of room for storage already in place. I brought several items to increase my storage that I ended up not needing. The random roommate survey actually does a really great job at matching people up; my roommate is one of my closest friends, and I get along with all of my suitemates really well. The people on my floor are very friendly, even the ones who are freshman. I feel safe in my dorm room. The RAs are awesome and make plenty of great programs, such as going pumpkin picking at Halloween. This is not even all that the dorms have to offer (think food).",
            "Some of the required classes feel a bit like high school classes, but the teachers and classmates are more fluid and cooperative. All of the classes demand you to think in creative ways, which is different than many high school experiences. It demands a lot of work and a lot of effort from you, to really push yourself and try harder for the good grades. The work is hard but fun.",
            "Make sure you visit the campus, because even though it is beautiful and amazing, to really get a feel of what the college is, you have to be there to understand if it is for you. Also, make sure you understand what Emerson offers. It is not a performing arts college, but a communications college. There's no music or anything like that; it has a lot of opportunities that span a wide range so long as you understand what they are.",
            "Emerson is a very open-minded college in a beautiful city with a lot of opportunities to get involved. The classes are challenging the the way that's rewarding, not horror-inducing, and the dorms are actually big and cozy with a lot of storage room. It may be expensive, but everything course-wise and beyond is worth the cost."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{43017=Depending on the building and the individual, dorm life can be great. If you're trying to decide which building to live in, here's a breakdown of them: Little Building: Mostly freshman. Consists of most double, triple, and quad rooms. I believe there's one 6-person sing suite on every floor. Communal bathrooms. Older building; not the cleanest but livable. Also houses the dinning hall, C-Store (convenient store), gym, Cabaret, and many other Emerson offices. I believe there's either a laundry room on every floor or every other floor. (Don't quote me on that though). There's also a Dunkin Donuts downstairs that sometimes sets a bagel on fire, triggering fire alarms for the entire building. This building really is good for socializing as a first-year. There are lots of activities and friendly people. Piano Row: (My current building of living) Mostly freshmen and sophomores. All suite-style living (4 and 6 person). Common rooms (consisting of tv, sitting area, sink, stovetop and microwave) on every other floor. Holds the Max (150 Cafe), laundry room, gymnasium, a large multipurpose room, various meeting spaces for student orgs, and the student service center. Very clean building. I believe it opened as a dorm building in 2006. Colonial: Known as the 21+ dorm building. Holds mostly upperclassmen but is known to also house freshmen and sophomores on occasion. Only building with full kitchens (stove tops and ovens) in their common rooms. Very upscale and nice building. Hasn't been open very long, which makes it very clean. Only place where alcohol is allowed in dorm rooms (ONLY IF YOU'RE OVER 21 THOUGH!). Has laundry room and mail room. Paramount: Houses mostly performing arts students. Smallest dorm building on campus. Also the furthest away from the main Emerson campus. (far away means two blocks - yeah, we're spoiled). Paramount holds a theatre, multiple practice rooms and studios, classrooms, the Paramount Cafe (get the onion rings, they're delicious!), and Emstage's shop and paint studio. This building is recommended for performing arts students and people who don't mind a little extra walk to their classes. The building is very clean and well decorated. Their common rooms have nice kitchen areas as well as flat screen TVs and foosball tables., 209039=I visited Emerson on junior day 2013 and loved it. I am definitely going to apply, as should anybody else interested in film, writing, or communications. The location is great as well, basically touching the Boston Commons., 52352=It's all about the essay! Write a meaningful essay, an honest essay, and be careful with spelling and grammar., 276490=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Tips: 1) Don't let reviews make your decision. You will read bad reviews, and you will read good reviews. Focus on what is more important for your future. 2) If you're unsure about Emerson College because of the party-scene, don't let that you hold you back. Your education is far more important and trust me, you will have fun if you know the right places to go. 3) You have probably read that Emerson College has a lot of gay people. It does. However, there are plenty of other guys and gals! Bang for the buck Emerson College is extremely expensive, as you already might know. However, it's worth it. The opportunities that you get from this school can't compare to anywhere else. Am enjoying being here College is going to be fun, no matter where you go. You're free for the first time. The advantage that Emerson College has over many other colleges is that it is right in the heart of Boston. There is always something to do. Although Emerson College is not a huge party school, there is Boston University, Boston College, Northeastern University and many others right around the area. Newbury St. is right around the corner; there is a movie theater right next to us; and",
