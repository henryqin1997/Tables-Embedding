We believe this is also highly unlikely given the strong pharmacokinetic profile with FV-100 demonstrated in the phase Ib multiple ascending dose program from 2008., 19577=On January 11, 2010, Inhibitex ([url=http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/inhx]INHX[/url]) announced that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) met, as scheduled, in early December 2009 to review the 30-day follow-up data on the first quartile of patients enrolled in the company\u2019s ongoing phase II clinical trial of FV-100., 24124=Inhibitex exited 2009 with $37.9 million in cash and investments. This should be enough to fund operations, including completing the ongoing phase II FV-100 program and completing a phase Ia and phase Ib program on INX-189, through the end of 2011. Financial guidance for 2010 is for the company to exit the year with still $14 to $15 million in cash on hand., 61492=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 61431=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 21976=Enrollment at ~360 patients should complete in the third quarter 2010, with top-line data to become available in the fourth quarter 2010. As a reminder, the phase II program, initiated in May 2009, is a well-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial evaluating FV-100 against an active control of Glaxo\u2019s Valtrex (valacyclovir)., 14835=by Jason Napodano, CFA \u00a0\u00a0Published on March 23, 2010 |}",
