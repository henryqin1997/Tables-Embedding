(Monday July 27 2015), 23678=Date:Friday December 22 2006, 26913=Villa legend Ron Saunders has been speaking with the official site and says he expects the old 'tingle' to run through him. Amazingly he also says when he said he wouldn't return to the game when he quit football following his sacking from WBA in 1986 he meant it and doesn't even watch the game on tv. Such a shame, if the board hadn't conspired, he could have built an empire at Villa. Meddling idiots. Saunders will be on the pitch ten minutes before kick off, although with the forecast saying heavy fog and freezing conditions to continue, we'll just have to hope the fixtures aren't affected by the weather. 'I have not been back since I left over 25 years ago and I know that the ground has changed enormously. So I am looking forward to returning and seeing it for myself. I received a telephone call from the club saying Mr Lerner would like me to be there and I was very flattered and delighted to accept.' 'When I decided to quit football as a manager I said I would never return to the game and I haven't. I don't even watch it on TV. That was my decision and I have no regrets. But this is a different situation and I'm looking forward to meeting the new owners of the club so I can wish them well. I am sure there will be a tingle run through me.', 23632=Time: 8:24AM, 13996=Join The Vital Villa Fantasy League 2015/16 (Monday July 27 2015), 13584=Shock Horror - Striker Pushing To JOIN Aston Villa (Saturday July 25 2015), 13787=AVFC: Some Stats To Make You Think!?
