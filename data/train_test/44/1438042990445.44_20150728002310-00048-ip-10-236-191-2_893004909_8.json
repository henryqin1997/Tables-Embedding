            "There are blue emergency lights all across campus and campus security is always moving around. However, because St. Cloud is a larger town, I wouldn't venture too far off campus alone.",
            "You don't really hear much about Greek life here. There really isn't a Greek row like larger campuses or any stereotypical ragers.",
            "SCSU has over 200 clubs and activites. There are tons of intramurals, which can be a great way to expand your group of friends.",
            "I feel SCSU is great for all types of students! There is such a diverse population that anyone could fit in and anyone could find their niche.",
            "Last year they the first ever naked mile across campus, which I thought was a pretty cool thing.",
            "SCSU is a great school for a really low price. The education, nursing and buisness programs all have a super good rep too!",
            "SCSU has plenty of on campus activites. There is Atwood afterdark, where they have tons of games and activites planned. There are tons of cultural nights, which are a cheap way to get super good food. There are also movie nights in Atwood every Thursday through Sunday evening. Also, at the beginning of the year there was a super fun Jonny Holmes concert.",
            "Garvey is pretty horrid. People complain of the Garvey runs. They sometimes have good food, but my first semester I only ate pizza and salads.",
            "The dorms are fairly close to most of your freshman-year classes. However, they tend to get loud and the showers in Mitchell do not work nearly as well as the ones in other buildings such as Stearns. Be sure to go on tours of the dorms and think of how you'd want to share a room when signing up for the dorms.",
            "In high school I was always told college would be super hard but I'm finding the opposite to be true. In most classes it's easy to get an A or B by doing very little work.",
            "Get involved! There are so many activities on campus to choose from. Within the first month of classes, there is a fair where all of the organizations lineup on campus. It's a great way to get information about things you are interested in.",
            "Depending on your major, some of the prerequisites have larger class sizes. I personally enjoy them more; however, the only drawback is that you don't really get to know your professors or other students."

There is a few different options but when I attended school there 2007-2009 I wasn't impressed with the options. There is also a Subway and Dominos but I personally don't like either. The Dining Hall had a few different options like a salad bar and a sandwich station but nothing is great., 186873=Sober living...AA meetings. Great idea just not a big turn out back in 2004-2005.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The class sizes are just right here and you are able to get to know professors if you try. If you want a good education you can certainly get one here but if you just want to party, you won't be alone. College is different than high school, you do have to try and study to learn but it's not difficult and SCSU has a lot of resources to help you out.

Dorming your first year is the best way to meet new people. People who are coming internationally will also love SCSU. We have a large population of international students and have made a lot of accommodations for them to still feel",
