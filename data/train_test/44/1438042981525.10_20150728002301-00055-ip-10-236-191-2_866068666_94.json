The North Korean team walked off the pitch in protest at seeing the South Korean flag displayed by their names and refused to warm-up whilst the flag was being displayed. They also objected to the South Korean flag being displayed above the stadium, even though the flags of all the competing countries were being displayed. The game then commenced after a delay and rectification of the error.[36], 36847=On 19 April 2012, FIFA released the list of match referees that would officiate at the Olympics.[7], 314688=Coincidentally, Steinhaus was also in charge when the same two nations met in the final of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Frankfurt, won by Japan on penalties., 8172=The women's football tournament at the 2012 Summer Olympics was held in London and five other cities in the United Kingdom from 25 July to 9 August.
