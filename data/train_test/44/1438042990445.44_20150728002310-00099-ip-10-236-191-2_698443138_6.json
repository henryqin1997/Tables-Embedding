This may be coordinated with the College Honors Program. In research courses (determined in consultation with a faculty adviser) leading to a senior thesis. All Biological Sciences faculty participate in the seminars and supervision of the students engaged in research. If senior thesis (BIOL 4186) is not completed, all accumulated honors credits count as free electives, not biology electives. The Bachelor of Science degree (B.S.) is intended for those students interested in pursuing careers in science and considering application to graduate programs in science or medicine. In addition to meeting the standards and requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences, degree candidates for the Bachelor of Science in Biology must complete a minimum of 65 credits in biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics.
