None has so painstakingly chiselled his way to greatness TCM August issue, 49877=Stokes clearly enjoyed his first full season of Championship cricket, notching up 740 runs at 46.25, but it was in 2011 that he really began to blossom. In April he took 6 for 68 and scored a brilliant hundred that included five sixes in an over against Hampshire, and just over a month later registered his maiden limited-overs ton, cracking 150 not out against Warwickshire in the Clydesdale Bank 40. A broken finger hindered his bowling, but he played for England Lions and made his ODI debut against Ireland in Dublin, going on to play four times against India, albeit with limited impact., 50513=Stokes performed better than many with the bat in a damp 2012 season, making 827 runs at 29.53, and coupled with his 37 wickets at 21.47 it was an excellent return. He was called up to the England Lions squad for the tour of Australia in early 2013 but ended up being sent home with three matches remaining after two breaches of discipline. It was a watershed moment. He was rapidly rehabilitated, however, playing a key role in Durham's Championship-winning season and being recalled to England's limited-overs teams. Playing as a third seamer in the one-dayers against Australia, and batting strikingly low at No 8, he took a maiden five-wicket haul and won selection for the 2013-14 Ashes tour that suddenly thrust him to the forefront of many people's attention ESPNcricinfo, 74016=New Zealand women's coach Haidee Tiffen on her mentoring philosophy, winning the 2000 World Cup final, and retiring young, 55990=Jul 19, 2015, 48151=But he remained a work in progress, albeit an impressive one. A dismal 2014 summer insisted as much. An England run of 43 runs in 12 innings in all formats, with six ducks, at an average of 3.60, revealed a batsman bereft of form. All that followed his recovery from a badly broken wrist suffered during an ill-advised attempt to use a dressing locker as a punchbag in the Caribbean. That anger at his dismissal ruled him out of World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. When he swept Durham to the Royal London One-Day Cup final with a vigorous 164 against Nottinghamshire at Chester-le-Street, and then followed up with an important innings at Lord's to see off Warwickshire, it was as if a weight had lifted., 47031=Ben Stokes' potentially life-changing experience on England's Ashes otherwise disastrous 2013/14 tour of Australia did not just fill English cricket with hope for a new era, it was a test for even the most stable personality. England were walloped 5-0 in the Tests, lost 4-1 in the one-day series and were whitewashed again in T20, and when the agony was all over, only Stokes returned to England hailed as a star of the future., 54318=Jul 31, 2015, 17262=Born June 4, 1991, Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand, 49205=His prodigious talent was clear from an early age: he was just 18 when he signed a two-year contract with Durham in December 2009. A true allrounder, he had been quietly developing in the Durham Academy for some time and had already made his one-day debut for Durham that summer, snaring Mark Ramprakash, a quiet destroyer of county attacks from the day he was born, with his third legal delivery in senior cricket. From there he enjoyed a productive time at the Under-19 World Cup, scoring a century against India, before registering a maiden fifty on his first-class debut for Durham in the pink-ball season opener against MCC., 57215=NBC Denis Compton Award 2010, 2011, 55128=Jul 30, 2015}",
