            "the campus police protect the college but are known for being rude. they are not oppressive in the least, but their parking system could be more merciful. nevertheless the campus is safe and secure despite being located near to a bad part of town.",
            "none.",
            "plenty if you know where to look.",
            "associates degree seeking students who wish to transfer out to complete higher learning.",
            "no unusual traditions or locations.",
            "an excellent bang for you buck for your associates degree only. i have the displeasure of finishing my third year here before transferring out for my fourth and final year. students who attend here longer than two years feel like they are on a treadmill for sorts. after the two year classes the college loses quality and you feel like you are being farmed for your money. the associates programs are very good, just transfer out after that. the college has fallen on hard times. shortly before investing in a new, enormous, glass-sided building, buying the apartment complex across the street for use as dorms, doubling the size of the artificial lake and expanding the parking lot, the dean/president resigned, tuition was hiked and the college was hit with a $5 million budget cut. people who have been here for a while can feel as if the college is spread too thin, and overall the college really has gone downhill.",
            "the college is located on a street called eisenhower parkway. about a mile away there is the presidential shopping center and that is about it. presidential has multiple grocery stores, retail stores and the like but not much for fun. ten miles up i-475 is zebulon road (exit 9), where there is more to do if you know where to look. ten miles east is the city's main shopping center, riverside drive. you can do just about anything here, but is a 20 minute drive from the college. downtown macon is equally far away. overall a very fun city.",
            "food is okay. they serve sushi, burgers and all the typical food. there is a cafeteria with ample dining space. prices range from two dollars for a small item to eight or nine dollars for a full meal, so it is not hard on your wallet. the staff are also very nice, but are slow to start up in the morning. overall very well.",
            "dorms are okay. there is an ra in every complex. each of the complexes has three levels with four apartments on each level, each apartment has four small bedrooms with private bathrooms in each one and a public common area for its four residents. the apartments are low-mid quality, but the privacy you get by having your own room makes up for it. it is also quiet and overall was a nice place to live.",
            "extremely easy to get in to, and widely renown throughout the state as being one of the hardest colleges to remain in. the professors are very low quality and care little for their students. the work is hard, ambiguous, and teaches little for those not attending for a medical degree. i would only recommend attending for a 2-year degree and then transferring out.",
            "great for you associates degree, but the current administration has turned it into a college you will not want to attend for very long. the college has fallen far, so i recommend you get in, get your associates and leave as soon as you can.",
            "a great college in the past, but has since fallen on hard times. following some bad decisions on budget allocation the college has since fallen far. most of the teachers are foreign and the vast majority of the students have extensive complaints about it."

In the Spring of 2013, Macon State will be called Middle Georgia State College. Hopefully we will have a real football team and much more! Pep Rallies will be a blast! Go Knights!, 185226=Cochran campus food was decent but this was back in 2002 when I was there. I cant speak for now. As far as the Warner Robins campus, I have used the cafe in the bookstore and I love their coffee. There is now the new cafe/lounge there too which is really nice.}",

I have an afternoon job, so the morning classes are perfect for me. I also like not having classes on Fridays so that I have one day of the week to just chill. I usually use Fridays to catch up on housework I've neglected so I could do homework. Tips for prospective students Make sure you get to class early to find a parking spot.
