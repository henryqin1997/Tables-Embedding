            "Safety of very well covered at UD and the security officers are very involved with the students and they know everyone and are always available.",
            "UD does not have any kind of Greek life offered and I do not miss it at all. Because of the size of the school you feel involved with everyone and do not need any Greek organizations.",
            "There are many clubs and activities offered from all the sports choices offered. Soccer is my favorite. There is also a big swimming pool and weight room. I do wish they had a film making club as that is hard to start up on your own because you need equipment like cameras and a computer to work with as you develop a film.",
            "UD is a great school for those who want to grow in their Catholic faith and want a rigorous academic challenge.",
            "Ground Hog Day is a big celebration on the campus of UD. There are other fun activities like the juggling group and square dancing group.",
            "UD is a great college especially because it is not a huge college and the teachers really want you to do well.",
            "Well as for fun activities, there is more than you could ever do and if there is not something you would like to do you can start that activity yourself. Also, the Dallas area is rich in things to do from museums, to movies not out in other parts of the country yet, many restaurants, music concerts and sporting events.",
            "The food is really good except I am use to more spice in my food and sometime I get tired of the same foods being offered on a regular basis. It is good to go home occasionally to get real home cooking.",
            "I have had a great experience living in the dorm. I really get along with my roommate and the others in the dorm. The only thing negative I could say is that it is noisy and people are always popping in to talk or ask if you want to go do something so you don't have much quiet private time. But everyone is really nice.",
            "Classes are very rigorous especially biology. So be prepared to study regularly.",
            "My tips for anyone interested in the University of Dallas would be for you to consider: * Do you like the challenge of a very rigorous academic environment? UD will challenge you and you will have a study a lot. * Do you like the challenge from your fellow dorm mates to grow in your faith? You really get to know and get close to the other students as you all grow in your faith together. * Do you have the drive to work hard academically and with a job because it is expensive and so you will probably have to contribute to the cost of this education.",
            "The University of Dallas is a great fit for me. It is not a very large university but still large enough to have all the programs and activities you want to really enjoy your college experience. I also love the Dallas area that has lots to explore and learn from."

The two sports clubs, rugby and Ultimate Frisbee (co-ed), are quite popular. Swing dancing is a weekly, well-attended event, There are also the various service and academic clubs., 22210=Do your best and remember that knowledge is better than book smart. I would also recommend applying at the Early Application deadline in November so that you have a better chance at scholarships and acceptance., 61027=Be ready to read everything starting from 2000 B lot wiser.C! Don't give up, because you will leave this school veryy wise. Start reading the summer before, and chose your major early on in order to plan courses accordingly., 73255=Due to the small population of about 1200 students there are not Greek houses. However, students tend to have a lot of pride in the dorms they represent and there is a strong student government., 51033=There is no Greek life. Since there are only about 1300 undergraduates, the whole campus has a bit of the feel of one large family.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor UD professors really challenge students to think about things, develop their own arguments, and make connections with what they\u2019re learning in one class to what they\u2019ve learned in another. This dynamic is facilitated by the Core Curriculum \u2013 every UD student is required to take specific History, English, and Philosophy classes, in addition to politics, art, and economics. Admittedly, some professors are easier than others, and you can manage the difficulty of your classes by asking around for who is and isn\u2019t a hard teacher. That being said, I would highly recommend taking the hard teachers (Moran for Lit Trad is wonderful); they really make the UD experience special. Dr. Olenick in Physics and Dr. Hendrickson in Chemistry are especially noteworthy as exceptional professors for those interested in the sciences. Overall, I am very happy with the education I am earning at UD!
