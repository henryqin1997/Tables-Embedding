Roy Keane snapped up the 18-year-old Welshman today, in a bid to ease his defensive crisis. The Black Cats' defence has been pitiful for the last few games, strangely similar to their Tyneside neighbours. Nyatanga was Derby's young player of the season - last season - after making 25 appearances for The Rams.
