            "Someone who values a Christian education and hearing professors' viewpoints from this perspective. Someone who wants a small campus/class size with limited amenities, but can stand a high price tag.",
            "HBU freshmen wear blue and orange beanies and have a tug of war",
            "Tuition has increased way too much since I started my degree in 2008!",
            "Random events like dances or volleyball games in the colored sand.",
            "The Baugh isn't the worst, but definitely not the best either. Other options like the Java City or Husky Express are better, but a little pricey.",
            "The Lakehouse is pretty one the outside, but walls are paper thin and fire alarms are annoying. Also there's only one set of elevators for all 6 floors and it does break sometimes. The Husky Village apartments are the way to go, but you have to be an upperclassmen.",
            "Teachers are usually easy to work with, but don't expect A's to be handed out like high school. I would definitely say it's harder than HCC or UH.",
            "Make sure you can afford tuition plus a dorm, otherwise commuting will use a lot of gas money. Take summer school! It's a great deal and will make sure you graduate in 4 years! Don't procrastinate on getting your 80 CLW/SLP.",
            "I love my professors and the education I am receiving at HBU. I do not like the tuition increases, strict absence policy or how grades of finals are not given to students. Overall I think some of the recent changes are unnecessary, but I do like that HBU is a small Christian university (all my classes have had less than 30 students)."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{156230=The school is fairly expensive with a 4.1 percent increase in tuition planned for the 2013-2014 school year. Currently, it stands at 38k per year including room and board and is at 26k without. Coming in with college credit from courses like AP classes are recommended due to the number of hours required to graduate. Having a car is not a necessity due to the hours of food services though if one wants to make a 3 AM run for food, the last food services close at 10 PM thus either leaving one to walk (which is not recommended in the area due to the crime rate) or driving., 284339=This is an area where HBU really lacks. The only dining hall on campus (The baugh) has the weirdest hours and the food is disgusting. On the weekends they don't serve breakfast until 11 and stop serving dinner at 7! For anyone who works off campus these hours are insane as I can't even eat 1 meal here during these times. The workers are pretty incompetent and take about 5 minutes to swipe my id. They serve the same thing everyday and the salad bar is a joke. They redeem the dining life with a chick-fil-a and a coffee shop on campus but again, weird hours. (chik-fil-a closes at 2:30 on Friday?), 16375=I've gone to the campus and I've asked the coordinators and administrators, current students and some of the professors at HBU all the questions that I need to know. And I think that HBU is one of the greatest places to earn your bachelor's or master's degree in whatever you're planning to major in. They have given great confidence of attending here in the Fall of 2011 and I'm eager to learn new things. I'm Buddhist, and HBU is strongly Christian-based and you are required to take 3 classes dealt based on the religion. I thought about how I could be struggling with it along with the 'points' that you are required to reach before graduation, but I'm now confident that I will achieve my goals and get to learn the Christianity faith., 15633=I'm planning to live on campus because it's easier to deal with the events, attend classes, and study for my classes. The people and staff at HBU are so welcoming and friendly with a positive attitude. The lakefronts and walking trails are all so beautiful, you never want to leave campus! The classroom student teacher ratio is 1:15 so it's personal. The professors know your name and they say hi to you as you're walking. It's such a warm environment., 289223=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 153171=The Baugh Center's buffet has had issues in the past concerning health code violations and while the situation is being addressed, in its current state, it probably should not be the first choice in eating on campus. Tila's Cafe is a restaurant on campus offering mostly Mexican food (nachos, burritos, tacos) and is open only from 11 AM - 2 PM. The Baugh Center serves breakfast in the morning from 7 AM to 10 PM, Lunch from 11 AM - 2:30 PM, and dinner from 5-8:30 PM. The other options on campus are usually open from the morning to day such as Java City which is like a Starbucks as well as Husky Express which serves mostly sandwiches and soda. One can use a declining balance if they have a meal plan to pay for items that are not included in a meal plan and this extends to a local Papa Johns as well.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here There are not many student activities and there are faculty members who are opposed to any new organizations. Besides student activities, it is difficult to keep up with requirements as the rules keep changing almost daily on what is required to graduate; what forms to fill out for permissions to take classes, etc. Am learning a lot The professors at HBU know alot about their field of interest and share that passion with the students. Besides classroom instruction, with small class sizes, the professors are willing to answer questions and discuss material outside the classroom.
