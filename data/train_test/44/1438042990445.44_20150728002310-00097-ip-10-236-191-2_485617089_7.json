Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description. For instance, the devices may be any type of controller which controls interaction with a physical process. Further, the autoconfiguration process may be initiated at any time during operation of the system as a result of modifying the system or repairing the system. Such autoconfiguration may be applied in many different settings besides conveyor systems. Any physical system implementing a process which has at least some flow to it which can be detected and exercised may make use of the invention. In one embodiment, a grid of motion detectors can be configured by moving entities through the net in different directions, such as selected horizontal and vertical paths. Not all potential paths need be exercised to find a general spatial relationship between sensors. Further embodiment will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. Device configuration information is automatically determined with respect to a physical process that multiple devices monitor or control. The physical process is exercised, with each device tracking progression of the process and determining a preceding device and",
