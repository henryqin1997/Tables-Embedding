    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{50952=The protein encoded by this gene is a coiled-coil-forming protein that associates with the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor) complex of proteins and the BLOC-1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles) complex. Biochemical studies have identified additional binding partners. As part of the SNARE complex, it is required for vesicle docking and fusion and regulates neurotransmitter release. The BLOC-1 complex is required for the biogenesis of specialized organelles such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. Mutations in gene products that form the BLOC-1 complex have been identified in mouse strains that are models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2012], 48474=Component of the BLOC-1 complex, a complex that is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LRO), such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes. In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals. The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension. Plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking and synaptic vesicle recycling. May modulate a step between vesicle priming, fusion and calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release through its ability to potentiate the interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNAREs and the plasma-membrane-associated protein SNAP25. Its phosphorylation state influences exocytotic protein interactions and may regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis. May also have a role in the mechanisms of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in non-neuronal cells.}",
