I can never get enough of this area, because as a nature photographer, the possibilities are endless. I\u2019ve seen bear, fox, bobcats, deer, and very impressive scenery on almost every trip to Benezette. Oh, did I mention an occasional elk or two? This trip was to be a little bit different, as we had a rather large group of ten. My friend Tom, the deer whisperer from Olean, N.Y., and his wife had brought their family down to see the elk, and they needed a guide., 10909=Kane's opponent in the \"Elite 8\" state football playoff game Friday night-- is in familiar territory. The Blue Devils have won nine District 10 Class A football titles-- eight in the last 19 years under head coach Paul Piccirilli.\u00a0 Sharpsville, which won the state Class A football championship in 1997, will meet Kane on Friday at 7 p.m. at Slippery Rock University. This will be the third consecutive week that Sharpsville has had a playoff game at Slippery Rock., 25898=The Kane Lady Wolves opened their 2014-2015 season on Monday night against the Elk County Catholic Lady Crusaders in the Wolves\u2019 Den. The young Lady Wolves tied the game at 10-10 early in the second quarter but the visitors went on a 13-4 run on their way to a 50-27 win., 17040=SLIPPERY ROCK \u2013 The Kane Wolves storybook season has come to an end. The 2014 Wolves, who regrouped from three midseason one-point losses to go on a postseason tear came up against a tough Sharpsville squad on Friday night and lost 50-14. The District 10 Champion Blue Devils scored 24 points in the final five minutes of the first half to blow open a close game.}",
