    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20545=The new terminal was opened on 7 October 2005 by the Prime Minister John Howard and South Australian Premier Mike Rann. However, Adelaide Airport Limited announced soon afterward that only international flights would use the new facility immediately due to problems with the fuel pumps and underground pipes. These problems related initially to the anti-rusting agent applied to the insides of the fuel pumps, then to construction debris in the pipes. Although international and regional (from December 2005) aircraft were refuelled via tankers, a lack of space and safety concerns prevented this action for domestic jet aircraft, which instead continued operations at the old terminal. The re-fueling system was cleared of all debris and the new terminal was used for all flights from 17 February 2006.[12] The new airport terminal is approximately 850\u00a0m (2,790\u00a0ft) end to end and is capable of handling 27 aircraft, including an Airbus A380, simultaneously and processing 3,000 passengers per hour. It includes high-amenity public and airline lounges, 14 glass-sided aerobridges, 42 common user check-in desks and 34 shop fronts. Free wireless Internet is also provided throughout the terminal by Internode Systems, a first for an Australian airport.[13], 52755=The airport so far has an excellent safety record. There are reports of only one incident,[citation needed] which occurred on 31 July 2014, when a departing Malaysia Airlines jet nearly collided with an airborne Tiger Airways aircraft.[21], 10427=First established in 1955, a new dual international/domestic terminal was opened in 2005 which has received numerous awards, including being named the world's second-best international airport (515\u00a0million passengers) in 2006.[3] Also, it has been named Australia's best capital city airport in 2006, 2009 and 2011.[4], 15274=An annexe to one of the large hangars at the airport served as a passenger terminal until the Commonwealth Government provided funds for the construction of a temporary building.[5] International services became regular from 1982 upon the construction of an international terminal. A new dual-use $260\u00a0million facility replaced both the original 'temporary' domestic and international terminals in 2005., 8928=Adelaide Airport (IATA: ADL,\u00a0ICAO: YPAD) is the principal airport of Adelaide, South Australia and the fifth busiest airport in Australia, servicing 7,696,000 passengers in the financial year ending 30 June 2014.[1] Located adjacent to West Beach, it is approximately 6\u00a0km (3.7\u00a0mi) west of the city-centre. It has been operated privately by Adelaide Airport Limited under a long-term lease from the Commonwealth Government since 29 May 1998.[2]:p 25, 16608=Plans were announced for an expansion of the terminal in July 2007, including more aerobridges and demolition of the old International Terminal.[8], 16943=On 5 August 2008 Tiger Airways Australia confirmed that Adelaide Airport would become the airline's second hub which would base two of the airline's Airbus A320s by early 2009.[9] On 29 October 2009 Tiger announced it would be housing its third A320 at Adelaide Airport from early 2010.[10] Tiger Airways later shut down its operations from Adelaide only to recommence them in 2013.[11], 23003=In July 2013, Adelaide Airport became the first Australian airport and second airport worldwide to have Google Street View technology, allowing passengers to explore the arrival and departure sections of the airport before travel.[14], 19832=Proposals were developed for an upgraded terminal of world standard. The final proposal, released in 1997, called for a large, unified terminal in which both domestic and international flights would use the same terminal. A combination of factors, the most notable of which was the collapse of Ansett Australia, then a duopoly domestic carrier with Qantas, and the resultant loss of funds for its share of the construction cost, saw the new terminal plans shelved until an agreement was reached in 2002., 23776=As of 2011 a series of developments are either underway, approved or proposed for Adelaide Airport. In February 2011 a A$100\u00a0million building program was launched as part of a five-year master plan. The developments which have been made public (whether part of the building plan or not) are listed below:, 22563=The first Qantas A380, VH-OQA \"Nancy Bird Walton\", landed at the airport on 27 September 2008, Several thousand spectators gathered to catch a glimpse of the giant aircraft. This was a 25-minute stopover before it flew on to Melbourne. This was one of several visits the airliner made as part of a pilot training and testing program., 14402=The first Adelaide airport was an aerodrome constructed in 1921 on 24\u00a0ha (59 acres) of land in Hendon. The small facility allowed for a mail service between Adelaide and Sydney. To meet the substantial growth in aviation, Parafield Airport was developed in 1927. By 1947, the demand on aviation had outgrown Parafield and the current site of Adelaide Airport was selected at West Torrens (now West Beach). Construction began and flights commenced in 1954. Parafield Airport was turned into a private and military aviation facility., 19497=The airport was redeveloped in 2005 at a cost of $260\u00a0million. The redevelopment was managed by builders Hansen Yuncken. Before the redevelopment, the old airport terminal was criticised for its limited capacity and lack of aerobridges., 51205=Adelaide Metro operates frequent JetBus buses connecting the airport to the Central Business District and Glenelg. Routes J1, J1X and J2 operate to the City every 15mins. Routes J1 and J2 also operate to Harbour Town Shopping Centre and route J1 continues to Glenelg. Routes J7 and J8 operate to West Lakes and Marion.[20] The AAL's latest airport master plan proposes a light rail service. Historically airlines provided connecting buses to the Central Business District, after which a private bus service provided a service until 2013., 11130=In the financial year ended June 2014, Adelaide Airport experienced passenger growth of 25.5% internationally, growth of 3.5% domestically and a decrease of 4.7% regionally, resulting in an overall increase of 5% from the previous year.[1], 15866=In October 2006, the new terminal was named the Capital City Airport of the Year at the Australian Aviation Industry Awards in Cairns.[6] In March 2007, Adelaide Airport was rated the world's second best airport in the 515\u00a0million passengers category at the Airports Council International (ACI) 2006 awards in Dubai.[7]}",
