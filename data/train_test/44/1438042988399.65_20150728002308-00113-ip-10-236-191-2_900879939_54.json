    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{14762=In the summer, before I began my first semester of college I couldn't imagine being here at UMHB. I didn't believe this was where I was supposed to be. I participated in the University's Welcome Week 2010 for incoming freshman and transfer student. During that first week my entire perspective on the University changed. I learned that here, they want this to be a place we can call home. A place to find brothers, sisters, friends, spouses etc and live together as a community of Crusaders. I'll never forget when I changed my mind about my expectations of my first year at the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor. It was the last event of Welcome Week, the dubbing ceremony. It's an event where all the new students sit out in from of Luther Memorial, light our candles, go on bended knee before our faculty and professors and pledge ourselves Crusaders Forever. To most students it's kinda a funny tradition, it's kinda chaotic there isn't any robes or chanting in the background, but to me it was the day I decided I was going to make the most of what God had given me. Not to long afterward I found friends that I could depend on. What was more I found brothers and sisters in Christ who I trust and rely on. We walk together as Christians and as Crusaders. On campus, there really is a sense of comradery. If you need a ride anywhere there is always a friendly face and a willing friend to give you a ride. I think the biggest form of unity we have at the University is the Home football games. Hundreds of students, alumni, faculty and staff all gather together in their cars, line up, roll down their windows and scream with a police escort all the way to the football field. Then, like crusaders going off to war we cheer for our team. Everywhere you go and to every event the students you see are always happy, always excited to see you, and if anyone is having a bad day or is worried about anything the students here are the first to pray for you, cry with you, laugh with you and help you through anything. I never thought I'd find a home here at UMHB, but that's exactly what I found. I really hope whoever is reading this can find that home here too., 188883=- Be yourself - Be ready with Ramen for the weekends because the cafeteria is closed on Saturday and on Sunday, they only serve lunch. Unless you want to get Chick-fil-A once the new Student Union building opens this coming September. - Tolerate and accept people of different faiths, 282053=Our university just opened a NEW student union this semester! Inside of it is an amazing cafeteria which is loads better than the previous Hardy Hall. They have a wide range of options such as a pizza bar, salad bar, sandwich bar, soups, burgers, stir fry, and some sort of home style choice at each meal! Also some days, there is a taco bar or wing bar, and in the mornings their is an omelet bar and waffle bar. The people who work in the cafeteria take the time to ask about your day and make sure that your dining experience is as best as it can be. Also, the Union has a Starbucks, 1845 Grill and Chick-fil-a inside in which students can use their Dining Dollars to eat at as well., 105660=i'm considering transferring schools because the cost is so high. it's roughly $2000 for a 3 semester hour class. and that's not adding in the various fees that colleges like to throw in. great school, but not if you don't want tons of student debt at graduation., 7826=Don't wait...visit UMHB now! I wanted to enjoy my senior year and not worry about where I was going to go to college so I did my research and visited several colleges and I made my decision in January that UMHB was the place for me., 288045=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 75497=The food when I first attended UMHB was, I'll be honest, TERRIBLE. But very shortly after my first semester there, they installed a feedback system where in the cafeteria there was a box where students could place comments on the food in a box. In just a few months, the food quality greatly increased. The SUB, which is separate has great food. And the new student union building which should be finished in the fall of 2013 will feature a Chick-Fil-A and Starbucks, or so we've been told., 74302=UMHB is an expensive university, however, they accommodate for this by giving lots of financial aid to incoming students. The university also puts the money to good use by constantly improving the facilities students use on campus, like the new stadium and student union building being constructed that will be completed by the fall of 2013, and the new field house for athletes. The campus always looks beautiful due to a dedicated gardening staff., 81173=This year we've started the traditions walk where every class starts at a different location on campus and we all march together to the crusader statue in front of the stadium. We are also starting a new tradition with a dance the student body does at every home football game., 243601=Since 1894, UMHB has been notoriously awesome at creating the coolest events for students. It used to be a female college, but then later integrated and decided to create a new tradition for the holidays called Stunt Night in which a whole class could create a spoof or original story and perform their skits in front of the school. Other fun traditions include Foamcoming- where the school brings out a large machine to generate foam and music - and Spring Formal, which gives students an opportunity to dance the night away like they were Seniors in high school prom again., 178978=Annual pancake supper before finals, play day in april, Easter pageant for the community, stunt night- classes compete in a skit on stage}",
