            "CBU is expensive, no doubt about that. However, the school usually makes good use of the money it has. The campus is beautiful, the food is delicious, the professors are great, and the living facilities are pretty nice. I've also given CBU the nickname of The School of Free Stuff. Seriously, you get free stuff all the time. Free Chik-fil-A, free shirts, free candy, free scantrons, etc. There's also free counseling and low-cost health care on campus. I think CBU is worth every penny, and I absolutely love it there.",
            "Fun?? I'm a science major! We don't have time for fun! All kidding aside, there aren't really that many things to do for fun on-campus. There are random events like fairs and movies, but they can be kind of lackluster. There's a rec room, but it's small. There is also a pretty nice gym that everybody and their brother uses. The weather is usually good enough for playing some sports outside, like badminton or basketball. I would say, though, that if you want to go do something fun, it's better to go off-campus.",
            "The food is delicious and healthy, with a good variety. I would give 4 and a half stars, however, just for the fact that there aren't very many eating places. You have the cafeteria, two to-go places, and Subway, but those are the only meal-swipe places. There is a coffee shop that commuters primarily use, since it doesn't accept meal swipes. Also, meal plans are mandatory for residents, which is kind of a pain. I will emphasize that the food is VERY good, however.",
            "I've never lived in the dorms (just the apartments), so I can't comment on that, but the living facilities are, from what I have seen/lived in, very nice and clean. Maintenance will usually take care of problems promptly, and people are friendly and usually considerate. There are usually events for residents going on a couple times a month, so that can be fun if you're into that sort of thing. Also, the RAs I've had were great, caring people. Nothing to complain about here.",
            "Overall, CBU isn't too difficult academically, but it really depends on the program you're in. I am in the science program taking classes like biochemistry, organic chemistry, and physics, and I would be lying if I said it were easy. Also, professors here, while very friendly and often lenient, care enough to not let people get away with laziness. If you're having real difficulty, they're there to help, but if you just don't feel like doing the work, you'll more likely than not get the grade you deserve. Classes are small, so don't think you'll just be a face in the crowd, either. Do your best, if not for the professors, then for yourself (and for whoever is paying big bucks for you to be there).",
            "It's true that you only need a pulse to get in, but make sure you can afford it! CBU is pricey, so grab every scholarship you can and plan each year in advance so that you'll know you won't run out of funds.",
            "CBU has a great community of friendly faculty and students. The campus is clean and beautiful, with delicious food and nice living facilities. Lastly, the education you receive at CBU is excellent academically, but it goes beyond academics and helps you to become a better person."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{129352=the classes here are great. they the teacher to student ratio is about 1:21 but it is actually a lot smaller if i might add. i had one class with only 6 students! and trust me that is awesome. it might depend on the major you are also, but so far i have had only one class that was somewhat large and that was a general education class that is popular on campus, it is called marine science., 198016=Best college cafeteria food ever. Sunday brunch is to die for. People actually come from off campus to eat in out cafeteria. There is also a restaurant called Briscios that offers sandwiches, and salads. There is a new restaurant opening fall 2012 that is going to offer different types of pasta. All of these are options that use the meal plan., 94607=The facilities, classes, professors, food, student body, and the school itself are all fantastic. There are buildings that are still standing from when the school was founded in 1954, but they are all standing strong, and are diligently maintained. In addition to buildings that were there originally, California Baptist University has purchased much of the land around it, and continues making renovations on existing buildings, as well as recently built facilities, and buildings that are being constructed., 463048=On campus, one can visit the game room and play ping pong, pool, shuffleboard, or Foosball. There is also a recreational center being built which will have workout equipment, a pool, an above ground track, a rock climbing wall, and much more. This is projected to open in the spring of 2013., 39258=Woo fest, March Madness and the Man Auction are all great traditions and so much fun to participate in!, 246543=The CBU crazies march during homecoming, there are several cool spots too! For example, there is the fortuna fountain, the catacombs( unfortunately you cannot go down in them) and the front lawn in general is nice., 658978=There are many events on campus for the residence and commuter students. If any events are coming up there will be posters around campus, people will tell you during Chapel, your RA will post things in the living area and you can check lancermail to see what is going on. There are service events to help out the community and hang out with friends. During September we have TWIRP week were the girl ask the boys on dates the entire week. Also have midnight madness, christmas chapel and etc. Next semester we have WOO! same as TWIRP but instead the boys ask the girls and woo there affection. Just a munch of events to connects everybody together and meet new people., 25803=There are tons of fun things to do on campus at any given moment. I enjoy spending my free time playing Futsol(street soccer) with friends or having late night jam sessions with my band, or even just kicking back and watching a movie at amc with a 7$ ticket bought from campus life. Oh and did i mention that the mountians and beach are only 45 min away? Wooo! 4:1 ratio!, 322308=A very friendly environment. The staff as been awesome in helping me along the way for the 2012-2013 school year. I'm so excited for what the future has for me at cbu., 533345=Despite it's hefty price tag, I've only have had to pay 1200 out of my own pocket. I feel like I'm paying for Cal State tuition. :) Which is a plus. However, make sure you're able to pay for 2/3 of the tuition. If you end up having to pay for more than $10,000 through your own pocket, and loans, do not attend Cal Baptist. You'd be better attending another college or university. Also, only take out Federal Subsidized loans (and not even a single unsubsidized loan). Private loans will haunt you if you take them out. Believe the horror stories you read about those taking out private loans., 255431=They do TONS of free and fun stuff. On November 1st to kick off Homecoming they were able to get Switchfoot to come and gave out like 600 FREE TICKETS!!! AND!! The concert was in our very own gym! And for midnight madness instead of just regular tickets they gave out CBU watches., 23013=No frats sorry, but tons of great clubs! Baking club for example............4:1 ratio!, 734003=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Tips for prospective students It's a great deal of work to attend a private university like CBU, but I guarantee that it is worth every dollar! Don't let the cost daunt you! If you're committed to going there and you trust in God's plan, anything can happen! Just remember-- always make sure you know when your deadlines are!

Throughout my previous years in school I maintained a high grade point average, but I still have to work very hard to maintain such a high GPA in college. Do your best to get involved in at least one sport, club, or bible study group. The friendships, memories, and values you'll gain are life-changing and it will make you feel home away from home.",
