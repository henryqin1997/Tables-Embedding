    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations According to the above embodiment, information on the correct distance between a radio controller and a radio telephone is detected and the position of the radio telephone and the locus of movement of the radio telephone are displayed. Since the distance and azimuth of the radio telephone relative to the radio controller can be recognized more precisely, the degree of accuracy of display of information on the position of the radio telephone is improved. Since the detection by a particular radio controller can be used for security purposes, a radio telephone can be used not only as a telephone terminal but also as a terminal of a security system. The output processor which is an external data processor processes data stored by the exchange. When the exchange has detected the position of a radio telephone, it sends data on the detected position to the output processor such that the output processor can perform a required process with the latest information to thereby avoid wrong recognition of the position due to old data. The output processor is capable of requesting transmission of data from the exchange to thereby render proper data communication between the exchange and the output processor. In addition, since the output processor is capable of collecting information on exchanges other than the exchange connected to the output processor through the common line and processing that information, it is capable of displaying as an exchange",
