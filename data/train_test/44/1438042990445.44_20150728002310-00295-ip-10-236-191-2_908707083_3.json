            "Tiffin is great for all types of students. If you're studious, there are study labs all over campus. If you like involvement, there are tons of clubs and organizations. If you are athletic, there are varsity, junior varsity, and club sports available. If you like music, there are musiic groups that tour regularlty. If you're religious, there are religious groups on campus and churches all around the city of Tiffin. If you like scholarships, they have them! I've met so many people from so many backgrounds at Tiffin, and we're all a family!",
            "I would advise all students to jump in and have fun. College is about making connections. Once you find something you're interested in, jump in and enjoy yourself. When people see you enjoy something they are more likely to help you succeed! Also, make sure you bring some ramen noodles!",
            "You get so many free offers and discounts. I recently won a new 22' Flat screen Vizio television from entering into a contest sponsored by the financial aid and retention offices. Every week there are awesome events for all students, and of course most of them are free. The education and experience are good too. (I just really like the free stuff too though!)",
            "There is always something going on at Tiffin. It's a small place, so the environment is ideal for someone who loves a family atmosphere. You meet so many different people here. It's great! I also have learned alot from older students. The atmomsphere at Tiffin allows everyone to be friendly and make connections that prove to be very valuable both in your stay at Tiffin and when you leave.",
            "All of the professors I have encountered at Tiffin have worked in the fields that they teach in. I love the fact that I learn from their experiences and not just the text book (Some of the professors even wrote the textbooks they teach out of)."

It is easy to navigate and get into, if you have basic online proficiency. I am in the Business Administration DCP, and find that it is well-designed for the working adult. The courses are given one at a time for focused study, while maintaining full-time enrollment status. This is the best feature, and makes other drawbacks worth it. The admissions staff is exceptional. Financial aid is lukewarm, especially for online students; it is best to have a backup plan for financing graduation. However, they say that online students enjoy a lower tuition cost then the traditional student does. Pell and FSEOG, yes--early FAFSA on Jan.1 gets the rewards--Perkins, no., 24775=The online forums are mandatory; the quality of discussion with fellow students is very low. Many do not have critical thinking skills and have poor spelling and grammar. The online teacher tolerated multiple incidents of a student plagerizing another students work in the forum posting. This led me to conclude that the instructor is not really reading the posts. If this kind of thing does not bother you, the online program certainly gets the job done, but it is more suitable for the independent-minded person., 147182=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Also, ask your professors for help... that is what they are there for! Bang for the buck I have learned so much from my professors. Again, it is the effort you put into it though. Many professors will give you their home phone number and help you outside classroom hours, which is extremely useful if you are uncertain about an assignment.
