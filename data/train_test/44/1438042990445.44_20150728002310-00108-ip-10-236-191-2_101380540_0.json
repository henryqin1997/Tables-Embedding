    "textBeforeTable": "How The Rankings Are Calculated: Frontstretch does our power rankings similar to how the Associated Press does them for basketball or football. Our expert stable of NASCAR writers, both on staff and from other major publications will vote for the Top 20 on a 20-19-18-17\u2026 3-2-1 basis, giving 20 points to their first-place driver, 19 for second, and so on. In the end, Mike Mehedin calculates the points, adds some funny one-liners, and\u2026 here you go! How did that shake up our poll before the teams head Northeast to New Hampshire? While the teams take their battered cars \u2013 and spirits \u2013 back to Charlotte, see how your favorite driver ranks after Daytona. In true restrictor plate fashion, two big wrecks slowed the pace and collected more than half the field. The end result? Only one driver (Clint Bowyer) from the top 10 in the Power Rankings from Kentucky finished in the top 10 Sunday afternoon. Almost all other Power Rankings drivers received damage in one of the two wrecks, including last week\u2019s leader, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and his three Hendrick Motorsports teammates. It was not the way anyone expected or wanted the race to end, but one fact cannot be denied: Aric Almirola is a winner in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
