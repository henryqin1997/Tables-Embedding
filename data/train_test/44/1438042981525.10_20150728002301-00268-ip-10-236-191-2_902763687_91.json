            "There is a recreation center with a stretching room, basketball court, swimming pool, ping-pong table, and even an enclosed tennis room. If sports aren't your thing, there are a couple tv's with gaming consoles hooked up to them. I recently saw several students playing dance dance revolution for the xbox kinect. They were dancing against each other and the moves they were doing were hilarious.",
            "The on-campus diner is great! It feels as if all the waiters are a big family and they're always kind to me. I feel comfortable eating there from the moment that I enter.",
            "I don't dorm at the college. Even though I've heard negative things about dorming at Montclair, I've taken the transit buses around campus and it's really not that bad if everything is done on time.",
            "Teachers really know their stuff when it comes to the subject they teach. However it feels as if they're rushing to get through the lesson and that makes it appear less hands-on.",
            "Know what classes you should take before enrolling. Make sure that if you are transferring that the courses you took at a prior college will transfer into Montclair.",
            "Montclair State University is a huge campus with many students that show their pride for the college. Every day, special events are held to either raise money or keep the spirit of the Red Hawks alive and thriving. The teachers are easy to talk to and really seem to know what about the subjects that they teach."

Many activities to do. I'll recommend this school to anyone who wants to have a future!!! Tips for prospective students Well you would have probably heard a lot of things about Montclair( many terrible things) but I want to tell you otherwise MSU is one of the greatest public schools in the state and country at large. It is very affordable, environment is very conducive, students are active friendly and intelligent, staff are resourceful and helpful even though there maybe some exceptions, food is OK, plenty activities to do a lot of clubs and organizations, financial aid and scholarships are available, on campus jobs are available and they even bend it around your schedule, there is also a train station on campus that takes you to NY. People MSU is really a great school I believe you should come and see for yourself. Just",
