Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in this art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For embedding this expansion into the previously existing message strategy for the eoc channel within an SDSL frame, a message encoding, for example, that was previously unused is used in order to transmit existing signaling for operational purposes for exactly one type of service (for example, ISDN). A specific service number within a service type (for example, one of a plurality of ISDN connections) is addressed in a following field that lies in the parameter region of this message encoding. In the same way, a further message encoding that is still free can be employed for traditional telephone connections. shows an embodiment of the eoc address expansion necessary for the addressing of the individual ISDN connections or, respectively, traditional telephone connections. To this end, the address of the eoc channel has an auxiliary address field attached to it. This auxiliary address field comprises the components service-ID and service-No that are needed for an unambiguous addressing of the respective connection. FIG. 7 shows a further division of a payload region within an SDSL frame. The signaling information of the D-channel of a first ISDN connection SO1 and those",
