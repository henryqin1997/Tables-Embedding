Tips for prospective students Come to university to learn and not just to party. Remember what you are there for and you'll do great. Bang for the buck MSU is one of the cheapest colleges in the nations, even if a student comes from out of state or is a non-resident. You receive great information compared to other colleges and you pay less tuition compared to other colleges. Am enjoying being here MSU is in a small town so fun",
