            "Wesleyan is great for any type of student who doesn't mind small towns and small classes!",
            "As a student at West Virginia Wesleyan College, I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to attend classes! Honestly, anywhere you go, this will be the most important advice you could receive.",
            "As the most expensive college in West Virginia, it meets the standards in terms of what you get. It's a decent place, the living quarters aren't as bad as some other schools', the campus is extremely neat and well taken care of, and there are several plans for renovations and new projects!",
            "At West Virginia Wesleyan, there is always something to do. The Campus Activities Board is very successful in having activities for students just about every day of the week. The people you can find most anywhere are very kind; the teachers get to know you as a student; the campus community is a very enjoyable one, to say the least.",
            "West Virginia Wesleyan's professors, at least the ones I have taken classes from, are extremely knowledgeable on their subjects that they teach and extremely helpful. The course materials used appertain to the classes significantly."

Wesleyan has campus activities and is fun, but most of the work is strenuous and time consuming. If you want to excel at Wesleyan, you have to be committed to your schoolwork. Bang for the buck Yes, Wesleyan is kind of pricy, but when you graduate from here, you will have a top notch education. And they do offer many academic scholarships. Am enjoying being here I LOVE Wesleyan! The campus is beautiful. The professors are nice and really care about their students. The dorms are okay. I am really enjoying the classes. And there are many groups with which to get involved with on campus. Am learning a",
