Also, as of right now (2009 - 2010 school year), you'll pay a flat rate for credits. So whether you take 12 or 17 credits, you're paying the same amount. This would be the college to take that yoga class, or to learn to scuba dive. You'll enjoy it, and it'll be a stress reliever. Plus, you're already paying for it., 118653=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students Come and tour the campus. I toured the campus a couple times before I decided to attend. It's small so you can find your classes easily and fast. The campus is in a city but there are a lot of wilderness to be discovered too. Am enjoying being here I love the upper peninsula. This is a small campus and I come from a small town so it isn't so overwhelming. Am learning a lot The student to professor ratio is really good so you get to do a lot of one on one with your professor. It's helping me learn the material and then some extra.
