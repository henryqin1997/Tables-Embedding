The animal in question is probably identical with the Culpeu of Molina, especially an the account of its surprise at the presence of man, uncombined with any exertions to escape, as given by Mr. Darwin, agree with the observations of Molina. Still, however, the description of the Culpeu is too vague to render its identity with the present species a matter of certainty; and as I regard it to be the best and safest plan in all doubtful cases to set the matter in such a light as to prevent if possible any confusion, I shall here describe and name the animal, for which I propose the specific title fulvipes. Mr. Martin described a species of Fox brought by Mr. Darwin from the island of Chiloe, respecting which he made the following remarks:\u2014 comprehends the short-eared owl of England, and numerous other nearly allied species which are distributed universally over the globe, from all of which it may be distinguished by its smaller size and darker colouring. I am led to regard the members of this section as possessing characters of sufficient value to justify their being separated into a distinct genus, for",

The Vulpes fulvipes is remarkable for the stout form of the body and the shortness of the limbs: the tail is rather short, and covered with hair of moderate length, except at the extremity, where it forms an abrupt and full tuft tipped with sooty black. The general fur is full, moderately deep, and rather harsh; on the body the colour is hoary mixed with black, the latter being more decided down the top of the back; the head inclines to fulvous, grizzled with hoary. The muzzle and skin are dusky, but the edges of the lips are white: the ears are rather short and of a chestnut brown; the outside of the fore limbs is dusky black freckled with fulvous inner side and toes pale fulvous brown; a dark mark approaching black above the tarsal joint; tarsi and toes fulvous brown.
