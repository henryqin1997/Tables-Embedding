    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{58002=The chamber 72 of the source body 14 is maintained at a pressure of about 0.1 torr to about 1 torr via activation of the first pump 58. The pressure at which the chamber 72 should be maintained is dependent upon the pressure inside the nozzle 24 and the discharge nozzle orifice 20. For an effective supersonic expansion following production of the corona discharge plasma, the difference in pressure between the discharge nozzle orifice 20 and the chamber 72 is preferably in the order of at least about 102 to about 105, with good results achieved with a pressure difference in the order of about 103 to about 104. Excellent results have been achieved when the pressure difference is in the order of about 103. Accordingly, if the pressure in the chamber 72 is maintained at 500 mTorr, the pressure within the interior 32 of the discharge nozzle 12 and in the nozzle orifice 20 is preferably about 1000 Torr., 55794=A supersonic corona discharge nozzle of the present invention greatly reduces the frequency of such collisions and recombinations. Any loss of energy through subsequent collision or recombination is quenched by the supersonic expansion of the corona discharge plasma. Additionally, the present invention supersonic corona discharge nozzle distributes energy to and activates only those gas particles that are supersonically expanded immediately following their production in the discharge nozzle orifice. Production of the plasma inside the nozzle orifice results in enhancement of the current density applied to the gas. That is, only approximately 0.1 W of power is required to generate 1016 metastable particles per cm3 in a discharge nozzle orifice 20 having a diameter of about 100 \u03bcm, as compared to the 1000 W of power necessary to achieve comparable metastable densities in an RF or microwave system., 58987=As gas is supplied to the discharge nozzle 12 and a potential is applied to the electrode 40, a corona discharge occurs. The discharge forms a continuous spark which extends from the tip at the second end 44 of the electrode 40 to a location within the nozzle orifice 20. Atoms and/or molecules passing through the nozzle orifice 20 experience temperatures of about 10,000\ufffd C. in the spark. The current density within the spark channel is in the order of about 104 A/cm2. Energy from the corona discharge is deposited into the gas atoms and/or molecules, forming a plasma. Since the potential applied to the electrode 40 is positive, the current within the spark adjacent to the electrode comprises substantially, exclusively electrons. Electrons, attracted to the electrode, do not cause sputter damage due to their relatively small size and weight (and, therefore, much smaller momentum) in comparison to positive particles. Such conditions produce a plasma containing high-energy radical and metastable particles at a concentration of about 1016 to about 1020 particles/cm3 inside the nozzle orifice 20.}",

It will be understood that the invention is not limited to those embodiments, but covers all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims. Although the system and methods of the present invention are generally discussed in terms of thin film deposition or modification of wide bandgap semiconductor compounds, the system and methods are equally applicable to a number of semiconductor compounds and for various semiconductor modification techniques. The present invention can be utilized to enhance both P and N-type doping of existing semiconductor thin film substrates, provide enhanced cleaning and preparation of semiconductor substrates, and produce the necessary beams of high-energy particles for the purpose of high resolution lithography. In an embodiment of the present invention, a positive voltage is applied to the molecular beam skimmer 16 as the plasma passes therethrough to preclude ionic contamination of the corona discharge plasma beam that enters the deposition chamber. Pump 80 maintains the pressure within deposition chamber 23 at about 10-6 to about 10-10 torr, or the appropriate pressure for the deposition or modification of a particular thin film, as is known to those persons skilled in the art. The background pressure of the deposition chamber 23 preferably does not exceed 10-10 torr. The molecular beam skimmer 16 defines and directs the",
