First, the server application component is implemented in a DLL file (i.e., the server application DLL 120 of FIG. 3). (COM objects otherwise alternatively can be implemented in an executable (\u201c.exe\u201d) file.) Second, the component's DLL file 120 has a standard class factory 122 (i.e., the DLL implements and exports the DllGetClassObject function, and supports the IClassFactory interface). Third, the server application component exports only interfaces that can be standard marshaled, meaning the component's interfaces are either described by a type library or have a proxy-stub DLL. The proxy-stub DLL provides a proxy component 130 in a client process 132 on the client computer 92, and a stub component 131 in the ASP 90 on the server computer 84. The proxy component 130 and stub component 131 marshal calls from a client program 134 across to the server computer 84. The proxy-stub DLL in the illustrated system is built using the MIDL version 3.00.44 provided with the Microsoft Win32 SDK for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 with the Oicf compiler switch, and linked with the transaction server executive 80. These additional requirements conform to well known practices., 45282=This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/959,142, filed Oct. 28, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,958,004., 73548=With reference now to FIG. 3, the server application component 86 (FIG. 2) in the illustrated embodiment conforms to the Component Object Model (\u201cCOM\u201d) of Microsoft Corporation's OLE and ActiveX specifications (i.e., is implemented as a \u201cCOM Object\u201d), but alternatively may be implemented according to other object standards including the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) specification of the Object Management Group. OLE's COM specification defines binary standards for components and their interfaces which facilitate the integration of software components. For a detailed discussion of OLE, see Kraig Brockschmidt, Inside OLE, Second Edition, Microsoft Press, Redmond, Wash., 1995., 47443=A transaction is a collection of actions that conform to a set of properties (referred to as the \u201cACID\u201d properties) which include atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. Atomicity means that all activities in a transaction either take effect together as a unit, or all fail. Consistency means that after a transaction executes, the system is left in a stable or correct state (i.e., if giving effect to the activities in a transaction would not result in a correct stable state, the system is returned to its initial pre-transaction state). Isolation means the transaction is not affected by any other concurrently executing transactions (accesses by transactions to shared resources are serialized, and changes to shared resources are not visible outside the transaction until the transaction completes). Durability means that the effects of a transaction are permanent and survive system failures. For additional background information on transaction processing, see, inter alia, Jim Gray and Andreas Reuter, Transaction Processing Concepts and Techniques, Morgan Kauffmann, 1993.}",
