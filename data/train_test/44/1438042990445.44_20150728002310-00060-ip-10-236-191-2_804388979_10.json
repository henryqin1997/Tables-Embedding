My results are unofficial, the official results have been posted on the Ironman website at http://eu.ironman.com/triathlon/triathlon-rankings/points-system.aspx (but as far as I can tell show the same data). I do not count AQs in my rankings, therefore it is a bit easier to determine the Top 40 male and Top 28 females. I will update this post with new information regarding declined slots and rolldown. For now, the athletes with a rank in brackets (e.g. \u201c(42)\u201d) are outside of the July slots., 2238=The Pro\u00a0qualifying for Kona 2015 is getting into its final, decisive weeks. To learn\u00a0more about how the KPR works, check out the short video below on the KPR. To follow the KPR and the athletes qualifying for Kona at the end of the qualifying cycle, you purchase the KPR Observer for the reduced end-of-season price of 19$ at\u00a0https://gum.co/2015KPR., 80047=All July slots have been accepted, the only exception is Patrik Nilsson who declined for Luke Bell., 6574=With an adjustment of -7:45, Maastricht seems to be a pretty slow course: After a \u201cnormal\u201d swim, the bike was slow and also seemed to take a lot out of athlete\u2019s legs for the run., 46419=IM Netherlands is a P-2000 race. It has a total prize purse of 25.000 US$., 101995=The Kona Pro Ranking is the system used to determine which Professional triathletes qualify for the Ironman World Championships in Kona. To make the KPR easier to follow and understand, I\u2019ve set up the \u201e2015 KPR Observer\u201c. More details can be found in my info post on the KPR Observer., 179894=Copyright \u00a9 2010-13 Thorsten's Triathlon Rating \u2022 thorsten@trirating.com, 61317=After a slow bike leg (adjustment -14:46) no one was able to run fast (only two sub-3h runs for the men and 3:16 was the fastest female marathon), leading to an overall adjustment -15:45. This was even slower than the \u201chot race\u201d in Coeur d\u2019Alene (adjustment of -8:24) where the heat impacted the athletes mainly on the run., 3092=My 2015 KPR Observer\u00a0makes understanding and following the KPR rankings easy. It consists of an Initial Information Package about the KPR and ongoing updates via EMail during the season., 76092=Both Laurel Wassner and Cait Snow had a chance for a July slot. They struggled in the cold conditions, but still finished \u2013 even if their 9th and 10th place finishes were short of the podium finished they would have needed., 90358=As for the male side, there was only one slot rolling down: Yvonne Van Vlerken declined, and Dimity-Lee Duke now received a July slot., 4686=You can order the 2015 KPR Observer at\u00a0https://gum.co/2015KPR (or click on the picture above) for 29$., 22896=After his stellar are at IM Germany, Jan Frodeno has taken over the top spot in front of Sebastian Kienle. With Nils Frommhold there are now three Germans at the front of my ratings:, 46167=Update (July 29th): Corinne Abraham announced she won\u2019t be racing in Maastricht. (She already slipped into the first round of qualifiers.), 79825=Update 2 July 28th: Patrik Nilsson also declines to focus on racing well at IM Sweden, his slot rolls down to Luke Bell., 69271=Both Viktor and Kyle scored enough KPR points to move into the Top 40 July spots. Barrett Brandon, Luke Bell and Paul Ambrose DNF\u2019d on the bike and couldn\u2019t improve their score. Luke ends up in #41 in the rankings and is either the first not to qualify or the first one receiving a roll-down slot., 6798=Bas Diederen had a solid day, the best bike and run allowed him to win the race by eight minutes over countryman Mark Oude Bennink. Third place went to Alberto Casadei who scored 1280 more Kona points, but his new score of 3.065 is probably not enough for an August slot., 57762=Bas and Cyril lead the odds for the men, they are already qualified for Kona and may not race at their full potential. Per Bittner (3.030 points), Fraser Cartmell (3.545) and Alberto Casadei (1.791) look for more KPR points to secure an August slot., 78895=Update July 28th: Yvonne Van Vlerken declines (with a post on her German language\u00a0Facebook page), Dimity-Lee Duke is now in. Here\u2019s a quick translation of Yvonne\u2019s statement:}",
