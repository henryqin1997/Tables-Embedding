    "textBeforeTable": "The following table provides a summary of the connection types used by the mobile devices and the ports they use by default. Only one data sync channel is used but the mobile devices can support either HTTP or HTTPS. Connection types and ports Apple devices use either HTTP or HTTPS communication channels to sync with the Lotus Notes Traveler server. These devices do not support the SMS push channel. ActiveSync (Apple) devices The Lotus Notes Traveler client running on Windows Mobile and Nokia devices uses a single communication channel for data syncing and push messages along with an optional SMS channel. The data sync channel uses HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with the server. This channel is always initiated from the mobile device. The channel should be secured either through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or by using HTTPS so that all data sent is encrypted. The optional SMS channel is used to notify the mobile device of pending server changes. This short message is delivered to the device SMS mailbox and read by the Lotus Notes Traveler client. The Lotus Traveler client then carries out the command or begins a data sync. Windows Mobile and Nokia devices Where to place your IBM Lotus Notes Traveler server in your network depends on a number of factors. This section includes a list of possible scenarios and why one might",
    "textAfterTable": "Note: You might want to consider running the mobile device client connection with the HTTP protocol rather than the HTTPS protocol when you are using a VPN. The VPN typically provides a secure data channel. There is some performance gain using HTTP rather than SSL because the mobile device and the IBM Lotus Notes Traveler server do not need to encrypt all data. However, this leaves the connection unencrypted between the VPN connection point and the Lotus Notes Traveler server. The type of VPN server that must be installed depends on the mobile device. Most of the mobile devices support some form of IPSEC or PPTP protocol, so network VPN appliances can be used by the mobile devices. The IBM Lotus Mobile Connect server provides mobile clients which support Windows Mobile and Nokia devices. It also offers a secure HTTP access solution for devices such as the Apple iPhone. For more information about the capabilities of Lotus Mobile Connect, see the IBM Lotus Mobile Connect page, which includes a link to Lotus Mobile Connect documentation.
