The wiring diagram of FIG. 17 can be used with the electromagnetic pickup in FIGS. 2-11, inclusive, and can be used to connect the coils in a series/parallel relationship or a series/split/parallel relationship. FIGS. 16, 17 and 18 are illustrations of the various circuit configurations for the coil connecting means 98 of FIG. 2. Specifically, FIG. 16 is a wiring diagram for an electrical pickup of the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 2-4 and 6-11, inclusive, wherein two of the four conductors are connected for phasing when used with another pickup. The waveforms of FIG. 15 show various operating characteristics at higher frequencies for variations in the electrical characteristics of the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 6-11, inclusive. The waveforms of FIGS. 13 and 14 show various operating characteristics at higher frequencies for variations in the electrical characteristics of the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 4. The four-wire conductor cable permits these electrical connections and the embodiment illustrated by the curves 300-306 can be obtained by use of the wiring diagram of FIG. 17 with the coils appropriately connected. Curve 306 illustrates the electrical characteristics of the electromagnetic pickup apparatus in a series, in-phase, non-humbucking arrangement. Curve 304 illustrates the electrical characteristics of the electromagnetic pickup apparatus in a",
