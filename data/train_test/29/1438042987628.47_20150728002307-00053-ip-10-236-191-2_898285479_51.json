            "Unfortunately, Greek life is not an option at Pierce College.",
            "There are numerous clubs offered, ranging from religious groups to political debates, and much more.",
            "Pierce college tends to attract laid-back individuals who prefer social life over academics. However, those motivated to achieve greatness can get a lot out of the school. Students are highly diverse and friendly. I have yet to see discrimination between students and I feel very safe attending Pierce College.",
            "The school provides you with the education you desire for a minimal fee of $46 a unit. The way you apply yourself really makes the difference.",
            "There aren't much activities on campus, but the surrounding area has plenty of activities such as gyms, malls, restaurants, etc.",
            "Food supplies are limited to snacks and coffee. There is one coffee shop and vending machines throughout the campus.",
            "There are no dorms on campus.",
            "Professors at Pierce try to prepare students for University courses and expect students to really apply themselves. Students that put in the effort and do the required work will pass classes with ease.",
            "Once students decide on their major, they should apply themselves and transfer as quickly as possible.",
            "Pierce College is a great school for students seeking guidance before attending a four year university. There is a lot of diversity on campus and plenty of academic programs for various majors. The professors are extremely passionate and caring."

    "textAfterTable": "What to do for fun There are many things to do on the campus, whether it's having an adventure on the campus or going to the gym and playing with your friends. There are many hot spots on the campus to simply sit down and hang out. Food and Dining The Pierce Cafe is one of the most affordable Cafes i have seen. The food is always fresh, the drinks are always made in front of you and the service is fantastic. There are food trucks all over the campus that serve great affordable food as well. Depending on where your class is located, going to a food truck may be more convenient but the quality of the food is always a hundred percent. Dorm Life Pierce College does offer dorms for students who want to live on campus; however, the majority of students usually live with their parents or on their own because the campus isn't far. I personally live with my parents and the commute to Pierce isn't bad at all. Academic Rigor The academic rigor definitely depends on the class he or she takes.
