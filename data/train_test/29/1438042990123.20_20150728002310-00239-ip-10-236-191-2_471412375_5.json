No. 5,500,077). The methods applied have been, for example, reactive ion etching using RF plasma generation with different gases such as O2, CF4 etc. A highly efficient etching process is described in Llewellyn et. al., SPIE Vol.2286, (1994) 198-204, still only for a two-dimensional set-up. Reactive ion etching (RIE) constitutes a combination of a chemical reaction and physical ion bombardment of a surface. Typical for RIE as compared with plasma etching in general is that the ion energies are high, this due to a low pressure during the process (<100 mTorr)., 26574=According to the present invention there is also provided a method for manufacturing of said body. The method involves reactive ion etching of diamond coated inserts in a gas plasma atmosphere using gases with oxygen or halogen content such as Cl or F containing gases, preferably HCl, Cl2, SF6 or O2 and most preferably CCl4. The etching of the diamond layer is effective at all sides of the body that are exposed to the plasma. Another method involves the deposition of an outer layer onto the diamond layer, which layer subsequently is etched away to a large extent. The layer material may be deposited by any CVD or PVD method, including deposition during a RIE process, or the deposition may be made by sol-gel technique. The preferred method of manufacturing involves dipping in a sol-gel medium, preferably containing SiOx. The preferred method of drying the sol-gel coating involves spinning of the sol gel by using a rotating device onto which the body is fixed. The spinning device is then rotated with rotation speed up to 5000 rpm, preferably 1000-3000 rpm. The sol-gel application/spinning treatment may be repeated several times resulting in a multiple layer structure which fully covers the peaks of the underlying diamond coating. Subsequently, the body is heat treated at 300-500\ufffd C. The etching of a diamond coated insert provided with such an outer layer is preferably made using O2 and/or SF6 as the etching medium., 28106=The etching method according to the invention involves typically a bias voltage at the sample of \u2212200-\u22121000 V, preferably \u2212400-\u2212700 V. The gas pressure is 0.5-50 mtorr, preferably 1-30 mtorr and most preferably 2-15 mtorr., 32398=A WC-4% Co insert with a cobalt depleted surface zone was diamond coated to a layer thickness of 20 \u03bcm using a high current DC arc discharge depositing method. SiOx sol-gel was applied to the diamond surfaces and the sol-gel was spun at 2500 rpm for 20s so as to generate a thin, homogeneous gel film. The sol-gel application/spinning treatment was repeated three times. The insert was heat treated at 425\ufffd C. for 60 min and then etched in an RIE-plasma in O2/SF6 during 30 min at parameters:}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. The invention which is intended to be protected herein, however, is not to be construed as limited to the particular forms disclosed, since these are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Variations and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. As a reference, a second insert was diamond coated as described above, but no RIE etching was applied. The diamond surface roughness for this insert was Ra=200 nm measured by AFM. After etching the diamond coating surface roughness was Ra=30 nm measured with Atomic Force Microscopic technique (AFM). The measure area was 100\ufffd100 \u03bcm. mass flow ratio O2/SF6=400 p=20 mtorr A WC-4% Co insert with a cobalt depleted surface zone was diamond coated to a layer thickness of 20 \u03bcm using a high current DC arc discharge depositing method.
