Walton Beach!! Betty R. | 05/25/2012 Read Full Review We love Ft. Walton Beach!! There were a few things in the condo that needed repair. One, the front right burner on the stove does not work. Two, the electrical plug beside the phone, only one plug works and the socket is loose. And three, the big bedroom was hot. The air didn't seem to flow in there. --Message from Manager-- Thank you for choosing",
