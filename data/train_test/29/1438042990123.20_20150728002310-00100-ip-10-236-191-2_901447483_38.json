            "there are help boxes all over campus. if you push one the police come running. they have a service that picks you up and takes you to your dorm late at night. there is a police office in one of the dorms. i feel really safe even though i live in the middle of a city.",
            "this school is great for anyone who wants a good education and also wants to have fun. the students are pretty serious so its easy to find a friend group that encourages doing school work.",
            "if you're looking for a party school do not come here. they have quite a few clubs and bars to go to. the best way to have fun is get involved on campus and make friends.",
            "they have a taco bell and chick-fil-a. the main cafeteria, the commons, is pretty cool. their menu rotates so it doesn't get too boring. there is a place called the diner that is open from two in the afternoon till two at night! a late night snack is only a meal swipe away!",
            "dorm life is what you make of it. they have the potential to be totally awesome! there are no dorms that have to share a bathroom with the whole floor. you only share a bathroom with one person. they are all co-ed so you get to see the opposite sex. you can have over night stays; that special someone can sleep over! the resident assistants are really nice and understanding. everyone is really nice. dorm parties are easy to come by.",
            "i am only a freshman, but i can tell school work is the top priority. however, the work is manageable. time management is key.",
            "be ready to do work. this school is not known for partying. most people here are going into the medical field. don't feel bad if you're not; there are people like me who have a different major. college is what you make of it. if you get involved you will have fun.",
            "they have a really nice campus; it makes you forget you're in a city. most people are really friendly and open. this is a grade conscious school; so the library is a popular hangout."

Non-medical students will take classes mostly in a two block area., 583106=They are are currently renovating the student center where Chick-Fil-A and Taco Bell were located. So the selection is somewhat limited, but you have three cafeteria based areas one of which that remains open till 1:00 A. M all of which also provide vegetarian options. There is also a nearby Subway and Starbucks that accept meal plans, dining dollars, or blazer bucks as well as numerous food trucks, vending machines, and Simply To Go food stations. Slightly off campus you have the entirety of downtown Birmingham at your disposal with Al's(mediterranean food), Maschino's(Smoothies), and 5th avenue which has the iconic Mellow Mushroom available., 513651=There are many restaurant options in and around the campus. With a dozen or more fast food places and sit-down restaurants. There is even a Cajun restaurant that sends a food van around campus that always smells like amazing seafood., 167126=The are many food options on campus. Chick Fil A and Taco Bell are right on campus and you can use your meal plans there! The Diner is open until 2:00 a.m for those nights that you have stayed up to study and now you are starving!, 52152=Anyone looking for a quality education will fit in at UAB. I'm so thankful and proud to be part of the LAST undergrad class of Health Information Management students at UAB - after I graduate in 2015, the program will become a masters program and no longer offered to undergrad students. This is still really cool though because UAB is one of very few colleges to offer HIM at all! If you want to be in the medical profession in any way, shape or form, UAB is your school. From dentistry, optometry, and medicine to nursing, health information management and psychology, UAB has everything any student could ever want in the way of a career in a health profession,, 701699=Despite being in the center of Birmingham, UAB feels like its in its own little bubble. UAB is also currently undergoing a lot of renovation, with a new freshman dorm and student centering being built for incoming students of 2015-2016. Lastly, UAB is arguable the best medical school in the state of Alabama., 468035=The food at UAB is pretty good. The only downside is that most of the resturant areas at UAB close fairly early and the only one open late is the Diner. But, like the name implies, the Diner mainly only sells diner food which isn't the most healthy thing to eat at 10:30 at night., 722336=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 83202=this college is one of the best colleges in the country, i visited during the summer of 2011 and had an amazing time the campus was beautiful and it is in the top 10 for most safest college, 348659=Do not plan classes at 6:45 am or 8:00 am if you are not a morning person. Pay attention to all deadlines from registration to a withdrawal date., 240297=I am very pleased with my education thus far at UAB. I feel fortunate to be there and look forward to graduating in 2015}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students UAB is for you if you are interested in - -Sciences, such as chemistry, biology, etc. -Graduate school-dentistry, medical, health professions, etc. -Diversity -Long-life friendships Tips for prospective students Words of advice: If you are up for the challenge of your life with hard course work, networking with faculty and other students, participating in fun-filled activities and programs, then pursue it! You will not be disappointed. I am currently a sophomore at UAB, and many people would say that after a year or so it gets boring. Well, it doesn't. There is always something new happening each day, which makes UAB so wonderful. That's what makes it so unique. Bang for the buck As with any university, the price can be expensive, especially since the economy becuase of the current economy status. Nevertheless, I would say that you get your money's worth from this university. There are several resources available that can provide you with financial aid support. Am enjoying being here I love it here!!!!! I have never been happier at UAB. They have so much to offer. There are plenty of activities on campus throughout the academic school year, from seminars that are informative about the academic process, financial",
