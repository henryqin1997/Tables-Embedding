These are just the tip of the iceberg of fun activities available to Solano Community College students and the local community., 9082=If you are interested in attending Solano, make sure that you see a counselor as soon as possible. Also, apply for Financial Aid well in advance (as close to Jan. 1 is possible). Research your professors so that your class experience can be better. Most of all, stay on track! Try to take classes that you know will definitely transfer if you're looking to transfer. If needed, make more than one counselor appointment. Ask other students about scholarships you can apply for., 224560=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 198654=Take a tour around campus.

I will graduate Soalno Jr College this May with 5 AA Degrees. I studied my graduating, transfer courses, and all the classes I needed also for my high school requirements.

    "textAfterTable": "Did enjoy being here Seeing as Solano is my only college experience thus far, it's hard to compare enjoyment of this college with others that I've never attended. Despite this, I'd say that Solano Community College is a fun college to attend; I'd much rather have been there than not. Did learn a lot While it may have just been a two year institution, the level of knowledge most professors have in their field makes this school a very good place to start. I say most because there a few professors that make you question the validity of their degrees, but overall Solano was a positive learning experience for me.
