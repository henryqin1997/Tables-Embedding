By default, the authentication API checks the directory where Access Manager is installed for AMAgent.properties. After installing Access Manager though, the file does not exist. If the file does not exist, you must create it and add these properties to the file. More information on AMAgent.properties can be found in Appendix C, Web Agent AMAgent.properties Configuration File, in Sun Java System Access Manager Policy Agent 2.2 Guide for Sun Java System Web Server 6.1. Tip \u2013 The following list of properties are used by the authentication API. Some are defined in the AMAgent.properties file and some are not. Those that are not defined can be added to the file so they do not have to be defined for each function call. For example, com.sun.am.auth.org.name, which identifies the organization from which you want to authenticate, can be added to AMAgent.properties.
