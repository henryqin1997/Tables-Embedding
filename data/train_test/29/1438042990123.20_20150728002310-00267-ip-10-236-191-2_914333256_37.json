            "Overall campus safety is good! For residence halls, you have to have an ID access to get in and after 7 pm you can only get in if you live in that building. If you do not, someone has to sign you in as a guest. Valpo also has there own police department and are driving around a lot especially at night. Valpo also has the blue emergency poles with the emergency buttons all around campus. But when there is a suspicious person on campus or even around campus an email is sent to all students and staff members describing the person.",
            "I, myself, am not a part of Greek life but I know several other peers in Greek life. The girls and guys I know that are involved love it! They say that it is fun and enjoyable! There are also music/theatre sororities and fraternities, so there are also plenty of options in Greek life as well. Although some fraternities and sororities have been getting investigated because of suspicious activities of hazing and drugs. Valpo takes these things very seriously and are quick to act upon things like this! The Greek life has improved overall because of the seriousness of discipline Valpo has taken.",
            "There are plenty of different clubs and activities ranging from music/choirs to sports, intramural or NCAA registered, to a wide variety of clubs. What I also commend Valpo for having is two offices called the Office of Multicultural programs and the Office of International programs!",
            "The food at the school is quite expensive and a bit outrageous.",
            "What I do for fun is mainly getting involved on campus and go different events that organizations plan. I was an executive member of a club so I was sometimes busier than others but I still went to a lot of other events held on campus. Most of them were quite enjoyable. If not on campus, the movies are near the school, sometimes I shop or go out to eat, or just go outside when the weather permits to play Frisbee or something. The campus can sometimes have nothing going on on the weekends but I me and my friends found ways to entertain ourselves.",
            "The food is not that bad. As a freshman, I didn't really know what to expect. There are changing options but also options stay the same. After a year though, the food is just tiring because the menu doesn't change a whole lot.",
            "The dorm life was quite enjoyable for me. I've only lived in a freshman dorm so far, but it still was a great experience. It is usually clean and tidy and if you have a problem in your room, maintenance will be quick to help. You just have to put in a work order and that's easy because it's just a quick email.",
            "The academics are very rigorous but there are plenty of options and assistance for the student to have access to. Many times also, there are plenty of sources for assistance. Valpo is very good in the helping the success of the student.",
            "As a prospective student, you should be very open minded to what Valpo has to offer and don't be scared to push yourself out of your comfort zone. When I did that, I only broadened my horizons and experienced many new things.",
            "Valparaiso University creates a wonderful environment for students to excel and benefit academically but also socially. They create a good environment connecting the student body to the faculty and vice versa. The only negative I have to say is the constant rising in tuition each year, which puts more stress on the student."

Dorms are co-ed by floor, each floor has a lounge with a tv, microwave, toaster, etc. Most buildings have a kitchen, all dorms have laundry in the basement (laundry will be included in tuition starting 2013-2014 school year). Cable hook up in every room. Plenty of floor and building events to get to know the people you are living with. But once you make it through freshman year dorms get way better.}",

Whether you're into music or business or different cultures, it's all available here! As long as you have a good attitude, you could belong at Valpo! Tips for prospective students Don't decide on a college [either for or against it] without visiting it first. When I first heard about Valpo, I didn't want to come here. I was dead set against it, but then on a visit [that I had to go on against my will] I feel in love with this place! The campus just has this feel of great energy. Bang for the buck Valpo is expensive. I'm not going to lie to you about that. However, most kids get a LOT of financial aid, and the financial aid",
