The arena has hosted tennis matches, figure skating competitions, and even the 2000 Democratic National Convention. It also regularly plays host to award shows such as the Grammys and major concerts from prominent artists.Staples Center is a part of the L.A. Live development, which houses the L.A. Convention Center, the Nokia Theater, restaurants and museums, among other things. Also outside the arena is Star Plaza, where various statues of past L.A. stars are on full display. Inside the arena, it has a maximum capacity of roughly 20,000 and features all the amenities expected of a modern arena. When the Staples Center was first conceived, it was designed to not only hold games, but also to give fans a world class entertainment experience. There are over 1,000 flat screen televisions throughout the arena along with a brand new center hung video display that debuted in 2012. Things are a bit crowded at the Staples Center, as the Los Angeles Kings, Lakers, and Clippers all call the arena home. This was never more evident than in 2012, when all three teams reached the postseason, making for quite an eventful spring. The Laker's sustained success has made the Staples Center a hot spot of activity. But they aren't the only hot ticket in town: the Kings won the Stanley Cup Championship in 2012. That confirms what was already known: there are few better places in the world for sports than the Staples Center.}",

In many ways -- you could consider Aaron Lewis therapy for a wounded heart and a raised goblet of rock (and apparently country music as well!) for your royal soul.
