Those changes are as follows: Rebasing of Nursing Facilities using 2003 as the base year - $8.1 million total funds; $2.9 million general funds; Implementing payments to Nursing Facilities based on the Median Plus methodology as recommended in the Nursing Facility Payment Study completed in the fall of 2002. The recommended levels of payment are provided at 20/20/10. (Median cost plus 20 percent for direct expenses - nursing care and therapies; median cost plus 20 percent for other direct expenses - food, laundry, social service, activities; and median cost plus 10 percent for indirect - support / administration.) - $634,000 total funds; $228,000 general funds; and Increasing the amount allowed under the Medicaid program for funeral set-aside. In the current budget, that level is set at $3,000. The proposed budget would raise that level to $5,500. The estimated impact on the Medicaid budget is $1.3 million total funds; $.5 million general funds. Major Budget Changes As mentioned in Carol Olson's testimony and displayed above, the increase in the general fund is $79.3 million. Forty percent of this increase, $32 million, is attributed to the decrease in the Federal Medicaid Matching Percentage (FMAP). The FMAP for the upcoming biennium is as follows: FFY 2005 - 67.49% Final FFY 2006 - 65.85% Final FFY 2007 - 63.23% Estimated (preliminary number usually issued in April) Bottom line -",
