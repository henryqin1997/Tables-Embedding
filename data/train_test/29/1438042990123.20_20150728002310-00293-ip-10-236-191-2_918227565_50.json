    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{11563=The school is not the cheapest out there, but for the personal atmosphere and quality education, I think it does pretty well. The school is also pretty good about giving out scholarships to incoming students, so it's very unlikely you'll have to pay the full tuition price in your time here. Your meal plan is handled through your Jacket Express card, which usually carries about $2000, which you load it with at the beginning of the year from your tuition. You can use that on food, vending machines, the bookstore, or wherever. The nice thing is that if you don't use all of the money by the end of the semester, you get the rest back or it goes towards your next semester's tuition, which the school likes to advertise since you don't get that at a lot of other schools. I got $600 back last semester, but it all depends on how much you spend throughout the year. Furthermore, admission to the football games is free, as is access to the Recreational Facilities and many other activities on campus. You also get three sessions with a personal trainer per semester, and there are things such as free kick boxing classes and water aerobics that you can take. The food is overpriced in my opinion, and not the best quality, but I feel like that describes that food at most colleges. Again, you don't have a set meal plan where you pay x money in your tuition for y meals each week, so you can spend as little or as much as you want for food., 198894=April Reign is a very big part of the spring semester every year. Students can create a team to compete in four events: Tug, Boat, Obstacle, and Pyramid. There is also a concert on the second day of April Reign each year, and this encourages friendly competition and bonding between students, along with an atmosphere of fun shortly before finals., 121536=The conservatory is ranked as one of the best in the country. Being undecided, I have access to everything they have to offer from a math major to a music major to pre-medical fields to business. The class sizes have a 14:1 student to faculty ratio. Being a small college, the teachers go out of their way to help you., 189867=The dorms were great! As part of the Honors Program, I was placed in a dorm that used to be a house. As a result, everyone in the dorm grew to know each other really well. The RA always had events planned and was super nice to. Better yet, during my time on campus, the other dorms were undergoing renovations and improvements for the fall of 2013 and none of my friends ever complained about their dorm., 247755=April Reign is the Greek Fest of campus, where for a whole weekend all the fraternities and sororities on campus have a sort of field day and everyone in the school goes out and cheers them on. It's a great way to meet people and enjoy the college experience on campus., 113263=In April, there is a competition between teams, primarily Greek chapters, Independents, and sports' teams, but all are welcome to participate. It is called April Reign. The main event is Tug (or tug-of-war). There are events such as an obstacle course, human pyramid building, boat, and aforementioned tug. This is one of the highlights of spring semester., 95629=April Rein, get a tour and ask about it, it's kinda like the olympics, 53584=Every year in April BW has an event called April Reign. In short the event involves physical activities such as Tug of war, boat races, human pyramid, and obstacle courses in which Greeks and non Greeks compete against each other. There is always a concert (this year we had Jeremih) and a cookout., 149517=During April Reign, Greek Life groups have rowing competitions and other events for everyone to attend., 288609=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 20978=Call or e-mail the school for information on your intended major; everyone there is more than happy to take the time to talk with you personally. Also, make sure to plan your visit during an active time of year, so you can see the campus in action. The wonderful admissions officers have numerous events planned throughout the year, so call (they are more than happy to talk) and see what campus events might be planned. Most importantly: Apply early!!! The earlier you apply, the more money B-W can give you! If you are applying for musical theatre: First: From my own personal experience, B-W had the best audition process - the faculty and students were all very kind and eager to give advice; they provided a free lunch; the showcased their seniors; the actual audition was very organized and time-effective - not to mention the dance portion of the audition was very fun for all levels of dancers. Second: opt to audition in November. This is their only early notice audition and I found out on December 5th that I was admitted. For the other auditions you typically have to wait til March to find out if you made the cut. Finally: realize that they only accept about 15 students a year into the MT program with over 500 applicants auditioning, so it is very competitive. Please know not to take it personally if you do not get accepted., 188878=The meal plan was excellent. Instead of only getting an allowance of \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?seven meals a week\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? or \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?fourteen meals a week,\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2? students had more freedom to use their money as they wished. At the beginning of every semester, students would get $2000 put on their card that they could use in the bookstore or at the dining halls. When a student paid for a meal, it would subtract the appropriate amount. For example: if a student just wanted to buy an apple that would be the only thing charged rather than the entire meal. Furthermore, if money was left over on the card, the student was reimbursed.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This is great for students who want to learn and like more individual attention when a problem occurs. Students who attend Baldwin Wallace need to be self motivated and outgoing. Tips for prospective students As soon as you get your foot through the door find an organization that interests you and become involved. Stay busy and take advantage of every opportunity. Your experience here is what you make of it. Bang for the buck The financial aid situation went fairly well for me. Taking advantage of every opportunity available requires alot of research and questions. It helps to have a back up plan thats cheaper too. Am enjoying being here This campus has turned into a second home for myself as well as alot of other students. Whether studying or just relaxing and watching a movie with some friends, we all have a great time. Am learning a lot There is no way to beat the class sizes here at Baldwin Wallace. The small size allows me to learn alot and have all my questions answered immediately.",
