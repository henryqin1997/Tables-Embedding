Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Pro plastic in general - it starts out being slightly less overstable. Pro discs are more durable than DX. They provide more grip than Champion. They provide more glide than DX, Champion and Star. They retain flight characteristics longer than DX. They range from firm to extremely soft and flexible. Speed 6, Glide 5, Turn -2, Fade 1 It is a great choice for a straight line driver, an all around driver, anhyzer shots, rollers, beginner's first driver, and as a young disc golf player's first driver in lighter weights. Highly recommended beginner friendly fairway driver. The Innova Pro Leopard is a great beginner friendly fairway driver that is understable. It should be everyone\u2019s first driver as it is easy to throw straight and far and has excellent glide. The Leopard is a great turnover disc for players of all skill levels. More experienced players can use the Leopard for throwing distance-stretching \u201cHyzer Flip\u201d shots. Especially as it ages, the Leopard makes a dependable long range roller.",
    "textAfterTable": "\"Of course the Leopard is in my hand for the left to right drives, but I'll also use it on the shorter, low-ceiling holes that are long enough to need the glide advantage of a driver. With a lighter delivery and softer grip, the leopard will take me straight to the bank.\" - Simon Lizotte \"This is my favorite disc ever made!!! I personally carry 3 of them in the bag. Perfect for Mid-Range shots that require low ceiling. I also carry a lighter DX version for rescue shots. The straightness of this disc allows you to throw confident shots in the woods. If you don't have one, you could be costing yourself strokes on the course.\" - Ken Franks Write a review Rating: Bad \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Good Your Name: Your Review: Note: HTML is not translated!
