When you posted your question I sent an email to the New Zealand distributor for JB Weld to ask where it was sold in Australia. I had exchanged emails with this person a few years ago. I just got an answer back from them and thought I would still pass it on to you. This is what they sent: ==== Contact the company below who are the Australian distributor. They should be able to help you.

It was found that wicks of 1.5 cm and 2 cm length above the rim of the container gave about the same performance, with average boil times 6:18 min and 6:10 min respectively. A wick height of 2 cm did give a boil time of 5:58 min on one occasion. Reducing the height of the wick to 1 cm above the rim gave an 8+ min boil time. The wick to pot distance was kept constant at 1.5 cm for the rest of these tests.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Just to reinforce this, we list here some properties of some the more common fuels we use, including two forms of wax - beeswax and paraffin. Be assured - there are many others. First of all, it is obvious that candle wax burns and makes heat. Small flat candles have long been sold and used to heat 'chafing dishes', and are often known as 'tea candles'. But candle wax has one advantage over most other fuels except for those in the Hexamine class: cold wax is a solid and does not spill or leak in your pack. Compared to Hexamine-class fuels it appears to have extremely low toxicity as well. So for many situations it looks as though it might have some potential. Background Discussion Hard to light Generates lots of fumes after being extinguished Generates acrid fumes while burning some waxes Generates considerable soot Low in power What's Not So Good Stable on the ground Very cheap to make Can be refuelled while running Robust, won't spill What's Good All the experimental work detailed here was done by Forum Reader Mark Hurd. Backpacking Light Senior Editor Roger Caffin offered some advice and wrote the article text, and accepts responsibility for any errors. Wax is a hydrocarbon fuel with an energy density (by weight) comparable to other fuels like canister",
    "textAfterTable": "A candle stove with a cross-wick and a mesh pot-support Surprise: beeswax and paraffin wax are up there with the best! But in fact that is quite reasonable because they are just higher hydrocarbons, in the same general series as propane, butane, gasoline and kerosene. Incidentally, you should treat many of the values given here with some caution as the composition of many of the fuels can vary. (Just what is in gasoline anyhow?) But it is also known that candles do have some problems: typical candles have very small flames and make soot. Can these problems be overcome and a more powerful candle stove created? A coiled-up wick made of corrugated cardboard - it would be very sooty IF you could get it burning Flame Design You might think that this section should be headed 'wick design', but that would be to miss the point. What we are concerned about is the flame, not the wick. We want a flame large enough to heat water at an acceptable rate, while not emitting too much soot. Sadly, at this stage it would seem that some soot is going to be inevitable, so we will try to minimise it. One way of increasing the flame size is to make a bigger wick. In the photo to",
