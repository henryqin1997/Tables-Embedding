    "textAfterTable": "Episode Quotes Meredith: ( opening voiceover) In order to properly treat a problem, a surgeon needs as much information as she can get. So we ask questions. Questions like \"When did the pain begin?\", \"Have you experienced these symptoms before?\", \"Do you have a family history?\", \"Are you currently sexually active?\", \"Have you recently undergone surgery?\" If you're unwilling or unable to answer these and other questions, we're forced to rely on tests for insight. Until those test results come back there's nothing we can do but wait. Alex: I love easy wedding sex, which I'm gonna miss out on now 'cause you jerks can't keep your hands off each other. You made me bring sand to the beach, and it's sand I can't sleep with. Jackson: Since when can you not sleep with interns? Alex: I'm a home owner now. I've grown up. Besides, they get all hung up and sad when you don't want to be their boyfriend. It's not worth the hassle. April: ( sarcastically) You are one classy guy, Karev. Alex: I make an effort. Arizona: Callie. Please don't run. Callie: What? Arizona: It's all been awful. And I've been awful. But I'm just starting to feel like myself",
