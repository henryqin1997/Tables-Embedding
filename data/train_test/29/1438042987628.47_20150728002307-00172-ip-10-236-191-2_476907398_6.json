No. 4,834,890., 88634=The draw cycle can then be reinitiated and an additional quantity of blood drawn from the donor. When the desired quantity of platelets has been accumulated in the chamber 164, clamp 1 can be closed and clamp 2 can be opened. The platelets then need to be resuspended. By means of the pump 141, the platelets in the chamber 164 can then be pumped into the container 198. Quantities of platelets on the order of 4\ufffd1011 cells can be accumulated using the system and apparatus in FIG. 11 in a time interval on the order of 50 minutes., 85074=Subsequent to the desired quantity of platelets having been accumulated in chamber 164, clamps 1, 3 and 6 can be closed and clamp 5 can be opened. The platelets must then be resuspended, for example, by shaking the platelet chamber 164. Platelets can be pumped from the chamber 164 by the pump 141 into the platelet accumulation container 174. By means of this process, platelets on the order of 4\ufffd1011 cells can be accumulated from a single donor. This represents approximately 90 percent of the platelets which were in the blood drawn from the donor.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous variations and modifications may be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concept of the invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific apparatus illustrated herein is intended or should be inferred. It is, of course, intended to cover by the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the scope of the claims. Overcoming this condition requires that the receiving chamber 40 and separating chamber 50 be slowed down until the plasma pump can overcome this pressure drop. Hence, the use of the saline in the known devices to drive all of the air out of the separation chamber and the related fluid flow conduits. On the other hand, in the embodiment of FIG. 5C the shims or dams 112 and 112a prevent movement of the air out of the separation chamber 50 by creating a reservoir which will trap the air within the chamber during a low speed prime with blood. At high speed operation, the centrifugal induced pressure will compress this air away from the dam 112. The presence of a small amount of air in the chamber will not interfere with the pheresis process as long as the air is not permitted to escape into the fluid flow conduits associated with the output port of the chamber.
