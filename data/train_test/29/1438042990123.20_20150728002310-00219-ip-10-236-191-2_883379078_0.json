If the client computer does not support this driver, the terminal server looks for a matching printer driver installed on the terminal server. You can either install a matching printer driver on the terminal server, or you can create a custom printer mapping file. Terminal Services provides printer redirection, which routes printing jobs from a server to a printer that is attached to a client computer or to a shared printer that is available to the client computer. When a user establishes a remote session with a terminal server, the redirected printer will be available to applications running in the remote session.
