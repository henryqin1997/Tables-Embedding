The operation is also fully consistent with the objectives of the Bank\u2019s FY2013-17 country partnership strategy, discussed by the Executive Directors in January 2013. The operation supports the implementation of reforms begun earlier in the series, as well as introducing important new reforms, notably in agriculture and tourism. Shared prosperity should be promoted if the government\u2019s new strategy PSE is effectively implemented, and extreme poverty reduced if the new cash transfer program remains well-targeted and is expanded. The program has two pillars. The first pillar focuses on the management of public resources and has two parts: government accountability and public sector performance. The second pillar concerns growth and private sector development.\u00a0 See Less -, 18550=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR19209 Document Date: JUN 18, 2015, 25760=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR20324 Document Date: JUL 29, 2015, 524=Document Type: Project Information Document Report No.: PIDA24196 Document Date: APR 15, 2015, 14703=Like many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Senegal has struggled to develop its industrial sector in the face of import competition. For basic food products, there is an implicit trade-off between the objectives of maintaining employment and lowering the cost of living, both of which figure prominently in current government policy. ...\u00a0See More + Conflicting pressures have led to a rather inconsistent policy mix of high levels of protection with price ceilings. The products of the three industries examined here\u2014sugar, vegetable oil, and flour\u2014account for roughly 14 percent of the consumption basket of the poor, so distortions in their prices can have a significant effect on poverty reduction. This paper compares domestic prices in Senegal with world prices since 2000, and then explains the difference by examining the protection enjoyed by these industries, along with their market structure. The analysis finds that high protection and market power have resulted in domestic prices which were often two or three times the equivalent world price. Tightening of price ceilings and some liberalization have taken place recently, but consumers have continued to pay above world prices for sugar and edible oil in 2014. The paper estimates that if this differential were eliminated, the purchasing power of households around the poverty line would increase by 3 percent, 227,000 people would move above the poverty line, and the national poverty rate would drop by 1.9 percentage points. The cost to consumers far exceeds the total wage bill paid by these industries. Further liberalization of these industries is recommended, along with phasing out price controls and shifting government policy from protecting traditional enterprises to the promotion of new export-oriented ones.\u00a0 See Less -, 24774=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR20237 Document Date: JUL 23, 2015, 5321=In response to Senegal\u2019s sluggish economic growth over the last decade compared to most countries in the region, the Bank has been focused on supporting government policies to accelerate inclusive growth and poverty reduction. ...\u00a0See More + In January 2013, the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank Group (WBG) discussed the country partnership strategy (CPS) for FY2013-17 for Senegal. The CPS is focused on accelerating inclusive growth and creating employment (pillar one); improving service delivery (pillar two); and strengthening the governance framework and building resilience (the foundation pillar three). This performance and learning review (PLR) highlights adjustments to the CPS in response to new developments since it was discussed, based on implementation performance and lessons learned.\u00a0 See Less -, 16613=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR19067 Document Date: JUN 12, 2015, 3355=Document Type: Procurement Plan Report No.: 96458 Document Date: APR 27, 2015, 10984=Document Type: Brief Report No.: 97844 Document Date: JUN 01, 2015, 1477=Document Type: Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet Report No.: ISDSA12877 Document Date: APR 15, 2015, 2457=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR18627 Document Date: APR 15, 2015, 6149=Document Type: Brief Report No.: 96936 Document Date: MAY 01, 2015, 7635=Document Type: Project Appraisal Document Report No.: PAD1214 Document Date: MAY 22, 2015, 17587=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR19587 Document Date: JUN 12, 2015, 23786=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR18136 Document Date: JUN 29, 2015, 20628=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR19634 Document Date: JUN 25, 2015, 10049=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR19482 Document Date: MAY 29, 2015, 11636=Launched in 2011, the Second Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project (PROGEDE II) for Senegal has been hailed for effectively mainstreaming a gender perspective into an energy project. ...\u00a0See More + Under the project, women have participated more in decision making; developed skills in technical production, entrepreneurship, and organizational management; and benefitted from increased incomes.\u00a0 See Less -, 12676=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7286 Document Date: JUN 02, 2015, 21554=Document Type: Program Document Report No.: 89209 Document Date: JUN 25, 2015}",
