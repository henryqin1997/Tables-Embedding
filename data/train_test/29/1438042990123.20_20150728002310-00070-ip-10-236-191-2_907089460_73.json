            "The campus police are patrolling constantly throughout the day and the check all buildings and around the grounds every night. There are call boxes all over campus where anyone can call for a police escort from building to building or to their car.",
            "The Greeks are all over campus. They sell cookies and candies throughout the year, as well as give out free scantrons and pencils. They touch every charity organization they can get to and are super welcoming to outsiders. For those who are in a Greek organization, manage your time well.",
            "There are a few clubs placed sparingly throughout town, all with good reputations. There is also a bowling alley and quite a few ranches where you can catch a few riding lessons.",
            "Tarleton is Great for any type of student. There are a lot of activities for the outgoing types, but a lot of more intimate events for those who prefer to avoid crowds. TSU is very accommodating.",
            "Tarleton is the school for Traditions. Homecoming week is full of every event imaginable. There is a midnight breakfast featuring spirited, purple pancakes. My personal favorite is the campus' secrete organization, the Purple Poo. A group of 10 males and 10 females dressed from head to toe in mostly purple clothing and dawning an odd mask. Using funny voices to further disguise themselfves they are really a joy to talk to!",
            "Currently the cheapest public university in the state of Texas.",
            "Stephenville is sort of small and boring. There are a few late night clubs or bars if that's your scene, but there is always something good happening on campus. Musicals, Concerts, Dances, Sports, ect.",
            "Lots of sit down, homey restaurants. Perhaps too many Mexican restaurants. Plenty of fastfood joints. Overall, a lot of good options for whatever mood you may be in. There is also a free (normal rates apply of course) text messaging service that will send you near daily coupons!",
            "There are plenty of dorm options at really affordable prices and they are secure. The only bother is if you do not choose your own roommate and get placed with a conflicting personality. There are also great apartments in the area.",
            "Tarleton classes can be rigorous depending on what major you have and what your interests are. There are a lot of opportunities to get extra work done for a class, but you are not required to put in any extra effort outside of general assignments and exams. Honor's classes require much more time than other classes.",
            "Find your mentoring Professor and get involved with research. Never be afraid to talk to a Professor about any concerns, especially when you disagree with them.",
            "Tarleton State makes you feel like you are a part of the family. Professors are very approachable and helpful. Course content is actually useful in real life situations."

The Poo Say signs appear on campus every Tuesday morning and occasionally comment on campus political life and student life. The Poo Say signs are nailed to the trees on campus and most are designed to promote school spirit. Purple Poo members appear in public dressed in costume to conceal their identity. Many members un-mask at the Leadership and Service Awards Ceremony each April while others choose to have their pictures appear in the Grassburr. At commencement, graduating members will pass a purple pig to the university president as they pass across the stage., 367252=Has amazing professors. Has a lot of country people and cowboys. May not be the best for people from the city., 78348=Apply early for the scholarship deadline, Dec. 1. Also, choose to be in a Learning Community., 200950=Beginning in Fall 2012, new Tarleton Texans emerged on campus a week before classes began (Aug. 19-26). Students moved into their residence halls on Aug. 19 and experienced a week full of activities designed to help them meet their academic and social objectives. The week also guided students through the resources available to adjust to Tarleton's environment and culture. Please take advantage of this week. It was very helpful., 435279=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot There is a wealth of knowledge at Tarleton State University. There is a huge variety of classes ranging from mathematics courses to musical courses to theatre courses. There are honors programs available, which I am a part of. The teachers at Tarleton care about the individual student if that student cares about his or her education. I feel so much more intelligent just being on campus and interacting with others in the honors program.
