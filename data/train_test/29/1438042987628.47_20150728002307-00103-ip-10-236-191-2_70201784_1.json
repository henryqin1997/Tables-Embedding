Table 2-2 shows the JMS resources used internally by Oracle User Messaging Service. Artifacts on the File System This section describes various Oracle User Messaging Service artifacts and provides recommendations for disaster recovery. Oracle User Messaging Service (UMS) enables two-way communications between users and deployed applications. It has support for a variety of channels, such as email, IM, SMS, and text-to-voice messages. Oracle User Messaging Service is integrated with Oracle Fusion Middleware components such as Oracle BPEL Process Manager, Oracle Human Workflow, Oracle Business Activity Monitoring (BAM) and Oracle WebCenter Portal. It is typically deployed, along with Oracle SOA Service Infrastructure. Oracle User Messaging Service is made up of UMS Server, UMS Drivers, and UMS Client applications. 2.4.7 Recommendations for Oracle User Messaging Service The database must be recovered to the most recent point in time, along with the Managed Server running the soa-infra application. All policies are stored in the MDS repository, so recovering the database and the Managed Server will ensure that the application runs normally. Recovery Recommendations Oracle recommends that you synchronize the standby database when the application tier synchronization is initiated on the storage. This synchronization occurs automatically because Oracle Data Guard is",
    "textAfterTable": "Artifacts in the Database Oracle User Messaging Service depends on an external database repository to maintain the message and configuration state. Special Considerations Oracle User Messaging Service uses JMS to deliver messages among messaging applications. By default it is configured to use a file-based persistent JMS store; therefore, it depends on the storage device where those files are located. Synchronization Recommendations The application tier must be manually synchronized with the standby site after making changes in the configuration, deploying additional Oracle User Messaging Service drivers, and applying patches. Oracle Data Guard should be configured for Oracle database metadata repositories. Oracle recommends that you synchronize the standby database when the application tier synchronization is initiated on the storage. This synchronization occurs automatically because Oracle Data Guard is configured in Managed Recovery mode (the recommended configuration) for the database. If the standby database is not in Managed Recovery mode, then you should manually synchronize the standby database. Recovery Recommendations The database must be recovered to the most recent point in time, along with the Managed Server running the usermessagingserver application. Oracle User Messaging Service maintains the message and configuration state in an external database repository along with persisting messages in JMS queues, so recovering the database and the Managed Server ensures that the application functions without any issues.
