It is preferred, therefore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein, but only by the appended claims. Once suture anchor 20 is in place, device driver 18 and cannulated tissue-shifting guide 2 are withdrawn from the repair site. The threaded suture anchor 20 is left in place for continuing the repair. Knots in the suture material may be tied using a knot pusher such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,691. The installation procedure is repeated as necessary to install additional suture anchors. Tissue may be subsequently secured with free needles using standard open Bankart repair techniques. Preferably, a mark is formed on the proximal end of the inserter to correspond with the end of the suture anchor eyelet for direct visualization of insertion depth during arthroscopic and open procedures done in conjunction with the guide of the present invention. When device driver 18 is fully inserted, the suture anchor 20 at the distal end thereof projects out through the end of the cannulated shaft 4 and beyond the forked tip 10 into position at the tissue repair site. A power drill is attached to the proximal end of the driver. The suture anchor 20 has a threaded body",
