The trap is caused by an unsolicited message known as an INDICATION from the DMI SP. If these indications are from the component, they are called events. The mapper receives all indications after it has subscribed to the SP by adding an entry into its subscription table. The mapper also sets the filter conditions for receiving every type of event. Because the mapper is already waiting for requests from the agent, this routine is a separate thread. The subagent determines what OIDs are sent with the trap. The following list describes the different types of indications. DmiDeliverEvent This indication is generated by the component. The SP passes it to all the MI applications having their valid entries in the subscription and filter tables maintained by the SP. The snmpXdmid mapper matches the OID prefix to the component ID, generating the event for building the TrapOID. The groupId and attributes are also part of the event. The snmpXdmid mapper uses all relevant information in the event (apart from the OID prefix itself) to generate the TrapOID. The snmpXdmid generates a SNMP-specific trap, with specific trapID=14.
