However, the pressure differential may be small and can be affected by the atmospheric conditions outside the battery., 28663=Microactuators are further described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,969,938; 5,069,419; 5,271,597; and publications such as \u201cFluister: semiconductor microactuator\u201d described in Instruments and Apparatus News (IAN), October 1993, p. 47, and Electronic Design, Nov. 1, 1993, p. 3., 41308=The cell contains a negative electrode 1 that is adjacent to and in electrical contact with the cover 2, which can be the negative terminal of the cell. The negative electrode includes an active material mixture comprising an electrochemically active material, such as zinc, and an electrolyte, preferably an aqueous electrolyte with a solute such as KOH. The zinc is preferably a low gassing zinc alloy, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,629, incorporated herein by reference, particularly when the cell contains no added mercury. Alternatively the zinc can be a low expansion zinc, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,709, incorporated herein by reference, such as an alloy of zinc alloyed with bismuth, indium and aluminum, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0106461-A1, incorporated herein by reference. The negative electrode mixture can be a gelled mixture, using an acrylic acid polymer in the 100% acid form (e.g., CARBOPOL\ufffd 940 or 934, available from Noveon, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, USA) as a gelling agent. The mixture can also include various organic and inorganic compounds as additives, such as additives that can reduce hydrogen gas generation in the cell. Examples of such additives include zinc oxide, indium hydroxide, and a polyethylene glycol compound (e.g., a methoxyethylene glycol such as CARBOWAX\ufffd 550, available from Dow Chemical, Midland, Mich., USA)., 27459=Another approach that has been proposed is to use microvalves to control the amount of air entering the cells (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,641,947 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0186099), but external means, such as fans and/or relatively complicated electronics can be required to operate the microvalves., 56426=In addition to the printing device, additional devices and processes can be utilized in combination to produce the microvalve assembly. For example, devices can be utilized to create apertures or vents in one or more layers of the microvalve assembly; to remove a portion of a layer or coating of the microvalve assembly such as by a process, but not limited to, cutting, melting, washing, dissolving, or the like; and to join portions of the microvalve assembly. Accordingly, additional devices that can be used to prepare a microvalve assembly, individually or in combination, include, but are not limited to, die cutting devices, drilling devices, chemical and photochemical etching processes, and devices such as lasers, laminating devices, machining or micromachining devices, or the like. Devices and processes can be utilized that wash away or melt out a portion of one or more (a) temporary layers such as a filler plug, or (b) permanent layers of the microvalve assembly to create a desired form such as, but not limited to, a cavity or fluid transport channel, or a free space to allow movement of one or more parts. One or more layers can be printed which do not adhere to parts of the substrate or subsequent layers so they function as parting layers allowing movement of adjacent parts. Examples of various materials and techniques are set forth in U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0201175, U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,730, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,830,922, herein fully incorporated by reference., 22098=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/522,704, filed Oct. 29, 2004., 25601=A disadvantage of these cells is that the maximum discharge rates they are capable of can be limited by the rate at which oxygen can enter the oxygen reduction electrode. In the past, efforts have been made to increase the rate of oxygen entry into the oxygen reduction electrode and/or control the rate of entry of undesirable gases, such as carbon dioxide, that can cause wasteful reactions, as well as the rate of water entry or loss (depending on the relative water vapor partial pressures outside and inside the cell), that can fill void space in the cell intended to accommodate the increased volume of discharge reaction products or dry the cell out, respectively. Examples of these approaches can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,558,828; 6,492,046; 5,795,667; 5,733,676; U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0150814; and International Patent Publication No. WO 02/35641. However, changing the diffusion rate of one of these gases generally affects the others as well. Even when efforts have been made to balance the need for a high rate of oxygen diffusion and low rates of CO2 and water diffusion, there has been only limited success.}",

The scope of protection afforded is to be determined by the claims and by the breadth of interpretation allowed by law. An electrochemical cell according to the invention can be part of a battery comprising one or more cells. In one preferred embodiment more than one battery cell can share a single microvalve assembly, and in another preferred embodiment each cell can have a separate microvalve assembly. In other preferred embodiments, microvalve assemblies can be located within or on the battery housing, or they can be mounted on a portion of an appliance in which the battery is installed. Similarly, in one preferred embodiment more than one cell can share the same control unit, and in another preferred embodiment each cell can have a separate control unit. In other preferred embodiments, control units can be located within on or on the battery housing, or at least portions of the control units can be mounted on a portion of an appliance in which the battery is installed. As disclosed above, a preferred embodiment of an electrochemical cell using a microvalve assembly according to the invention is an air-depolarized cell. Another preferred embodiment is an air-assisted cell. Yet",
