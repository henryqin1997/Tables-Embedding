            "Crum Creek is awesome and the Crum Regatta that happens is fun! Screw Your Roommate is a very fun and quirky tradition. The Yule Ball is a lot of fun to attend as they have snacks catered to Harry Potter themes!",
            "Lounge on Parrish Beach, go into the city, meet up with friends at Hobbs (the only coffee shop in town), have study parties in Parrish or McCabe!",
            "First semester will be pass/fail, but don't take classes too lightly even then! Start off your college career with a good handle on work and time management so that you're not suddenly bombarded with worries when grades start to matter! Also, definitely take the time to visit professors during office hours! They genuinely want to help you and meet with you and can offer great tips/advice.",
            "A lovely campus that's in a quaint, small town, but also close to a large city for whenever you need to get out of the bubble. The professors and fellow students are wonderful. The academic rigor can get to be too much for some, but the professors and deans really care about you and are willing to work with you if you are struggling."

Tips for prospective students Take advantage of everything the school offers! Create a project. Bang for the buck The school is expensive but has a big endowment, which translates to a lot of financial aid. Appealing for more aid does help if you can point out some concrete reasons--I appealed my first financial aid offer and got a better one. About half of the students here are getting some sort of assistance. Am enjoying being here Swarthmore is small and can get feel a little cramped sometimes, and often you'll find yourself with too much work to fully take advantage",
