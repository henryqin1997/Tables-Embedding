Weldon, Esq., who is impropriator of the rectory. The tithes amount to \u00a3830. 15. 4 1/2., of which \u00a3553. 16. 11. is payable to the impropriator, and \u00a3276. 18. 5 1/2. to the vicar; and the vicarial tithes of the union, to \u00a3415. 7. 8 1/4. The glebe-house is a neat residence; the glebe comprises 10 acres. The church is a small edifice, and has been recently repaired. In the R. C. divisions the parish is the head of a union or district called Bagenalstown, comprising also part of the parishes of Agha, Fenagh, and Slyguff. The chapel, a handsome edifice lately erected at an expense of \u00a32000, is situated at Bagenalstown; and there are chapels also at Newtown and Ballinkillen, and places of worship for Wesleyan Methodists and Walkerites., 1503=The townland is situated to the north of the modern town of Muine Bheag, founded by Walter Bagenal in 1790 and known locally as Bagenalstown. This is one of the few Irish towns to be laid out on the street/avenue system, quite common in North America and Australia as most colonial towns date from 1800., 1073=The area surveyed in the summer/autumn of 2003 stretched from the Barrow to slightly beyond the railway bridge. The survey found evidence of a small community living close to the river from the 5th century BC to the 7th c AD. All of the buildings found were simple huts (round and sometimes oval in plan] with a clay/wattle wall and roof of thatch. Only one example of a building with a dry-stone wall was found. Possible reasons for choosing this location is a) proximity to the Barrow for fishing and transport and b) a stream once flowed from farther north past the settlement and into the Barrow. This stream is no longer visible but can be traced underground, beneath the present Mc Grath Park and pitch & putt grounds. Another discovery was that the river was at various times in the 1st millennium much higher than present highest levels. The low lying areas adjoining the present canal i.e. the malting plant, Bagenalstown House, lower end of The Parade and the roadway between, was underwater for long periods., 5513=DUNLECKNEY, a parish, in the barony of IDRONE EAST, county of CARLOW, and province of LEINSTER, on the road from Carlow to Burris; containing, with the post-town of Bagenalstown, 4217 inhabitants. This place, which is situated on the river Barrow, was anciently the seat of the Kavanaghs, Kings of Leinster; and in 1300 a preceptory of Knights Templars was founded here, which continued only till 1308, when it was suppressed. It was also the residence of the Bagenal family from the 16th to the 18th century, and is at present the property of Walter Newton, Esq. In 1545, a battle took place at Ballynakill, near Garry hill, in this parish, between the Kavanaghs of the latter place and those of Polmonty, in which, after 100 on each side were slain, the former were victorious and secured possession of the territory which was the object of their contention., 5703=Topographical Dictionary of Ireland by Samuel Lewis 1837}",

    "textAfterTable": "The area between the tennis courts and the McGrath Park is at present occupied by a mound of earth with trees planted around the periphery. The present feature probably dates from the early 19th c. In the 4th century however this was the site of a double ringed fort or rath. On examination it proved to have two timber pallisades around a raised central platform. Beyond the pallisades was a high bank with water filled ditches on either side. Access to the fort was by two offset bridges spanning the water filled ditches. Inside the rath were two oval buildings, one large and one small. The fort was used for defensive purposes for about 200-300 years after its construction. This would suggest the home of a local chieftain or person of wealth/influence. The construction of the rath required the demolition of several existing huts. Plus ca change!
