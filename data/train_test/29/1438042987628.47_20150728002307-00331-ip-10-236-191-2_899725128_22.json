Our average tuition is around $30,000 a year, but the school does offer many scholarships to help out the students. We have a great faculty, (75%+ possess a doctorate in their particular field). And we also have a student to teacher ratio of 12:1 meaning small class sizes.

There are tutoring programs, along with a writing center for students who need to get their paper's reviewed. In the writing center, they also help you brainstorm your essay topic. Tips for prospective students If you do decide to come to Widener, join a club or two. Stay active on campus in extracurricular activities. Also get a planner, you will need to have good time management or you will be a mess.
