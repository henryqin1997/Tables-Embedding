This index cross-references those requirements to the applicable pages where they are fulfilled in this report., 2533=On behalf of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), I am pleased to submit this Semiannual Report to the U.S. Congress. This report summarizes significant OIG activities during the period from October 1, 1998, through March 31, 1999, in compliance with Sections 4 and 5 of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{25324=The OIG's audits and investigative activities since August 1998, together with other initiatives that are still in progress, have specifically addressed challenges 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10., 38330=The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 requires the OIG to annually audit NRC's Principal Financial Statements. The report contains (1) the principal statements and the auditors' opinion on those statements, (2) the auditors' opinion on management's assertion about the effectiveness of internal controls, and (3) a report on NRC's compliance with laws and regulations. Written comments were obtained from the CFO and are included as an appendix to the independent auditors' report., 28032=The U.S. Congress first appropriated monies to the NRC to use as an Official Representation Fund (hereinafter referred to as the \"fund\") in 1976. When Congress annually appropriates monies to NRC for official representation expenses, it gives a dollar limit on the amount of official representation expenses. The NRC must use this fund primarily for NRC-sponsored protocol functions and international cooperation activities that satisfy the intent expressed by Congress. For FY 98, the fund had an available total of $38,000, which included an appropriation of $20,000 for the current year, plus a carryover of $18,000 from previous years., 70897=In the external licensee arena, the OIG conducted an active information exchange with the responsible NRC programs, as well as the Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada, Senator Robert Bennett's Year 2000 Technology Problem Committee, and the Rx2000 Solutions Institute. During this exchange, the OIG provided suggestions in a number of areas. Also, based on our initiative and participation in one of the Rx2000 Solutions Institute meetings, the OIG became aware of the problems that exist with vendor certifications and embedded chips. In addition, the OIG's contacts led to officials of the Institute participating in a hearing conducted by Senator Bennett's committee., 74291=According to officials in the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), the OMB's Y2K program reporting guidance -- which focused on mission critical repairs and replacements, nonmission critical repairs, and budget information that excluded systems life cycle work -- led to the decision to view systems life cycle replacement work as outside of the NRC's official Y2K program. The OIG did not disagree with the OCIO's interpretation of the OMB's guidance on reporting. Nonetheless, the OIG emphasized that the remaining noncompliant systems still need to be replaced in order for the agency to be ready for the Year 2000. For example, the forthcoming Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) is one such replacement for other agency systems that are not Y2K compliant., 30206=In June 1998, the OIG initiated a review of the NRC's license renewal program in response to industry, public, and Congressional interest. The OIG's objectives were to determine if (1) the NRC actually required 3 to 5 years, as projected, to process and decide on a renewal request, and (2) licensees believe the NRC has provided clear and reasonable guidance regarding what should be submitted in support of a license renewal application., 21397=In the case of the NRC, Congress established an independent Office of the Inspector General (OIG) through the 1988 amendment to the Inspector General Act. Today, the OIG's primary mission is to assist the NRC by identifying ways to improve the agency's programs and operations by preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse. The OIG accomplishes this mission by performing audits, special evaluations, investigations, and Event Inquiries., 42877=The GPRA does not require IGs to audit agency performance information. However, the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 requires IGs to annually audit their agency's financial statements. The implementing audit guidance, OMB Bulletin 98-08, \"Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements,\" requires that financial statement audits include an examination of performance data to provide reasonable assurance that \"transactions and other data that support reported performance measures are properly recorded, processed, and summarized to permit the preparation of performance information in accordance with criteria stated by management.\" To satisfy this requirement, auditors \"shall obtain an understanding of the components of internal control relating to the existence and completeness assertions relevant to the performance measures included in the Overview of the Reporting Entity.\", 40965=To assist the NRC in evaluating its management control program, the OIG annually reviews the NRC's program. The OIG reported that the NRC's absence of a managerial cost accounting process constitutes a material weakness. Such a process is required by Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards Number 4, Managerial Cost Accounting Standards, issued in July 1995. The original effective date was for reporting periods beginning after September 30, 1996. Because of concerns raised by the Chief Financial Officers Council, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board amended the effective date for periods beginning after September 30, 1997 (FY 98)., 42380=In 1993, Congress passed the GPRA, which mandated that Federal agencies must establish strategic plans and prepare annual performance plans. The first performance plans, due for FY 99, are to establish measurable goals that define accomplishments expected during the year. The GPRA also requires agencies to submit annual reports to Congress comparing actual performance to the goals expressed in the performance plan. The first of these reports, for FY 99, is due on March 1, 2000., 73129=Because the NRC announced in February 1999 that it had completed work on all internal computer systems needed to address the Year 2000 problem, March seemed to be an opportune time to revisit the internal Y2K issue. As part of this effort, the OIG reviewed documentation and conducted interviews pertaining to computer systems remediated since November, systems related to the operation and maintenance of the NRC headquarters facilities (i.e., elevators, security, energy management, and fire alarms), telecommunications system components, and agency contingency planning efforts., 76955=From October 1, 1998, through March 31, 1999, the OIG reviewed more than 200 agency documents, including approximately 150 documents issued by the Office of the Secretary (SECYs) and 57 regulatory actions and statutes. Upon completing this review, the OIG provided regulatory commentaries, which are intended to assist in preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse within the agency. Specifically, the commentaries advise agency managers of the importance of considering aspects of agency policy and procedures that impact the OIG's mission, functions, and responsibilities. The commentaries also address issues related to preserving the independence and integrity of the OIG under its statutory precept. In addition, the OIG initiated dialogue with the agency on process-related as well as policy-related concerns, and cooperative efforts resulted in guidance to the agency staff. This section summarizes the commentaries that raised the most significant issues., 45724=In 1996, the U.S. Congress enacted the Clinger-Cohen Act (formerly called the Information Technology Management Reform Act) to reform the guidance regarding Government acquisition of information systems. The NRC's primary vehicle for acquiring information systems is called the Comprehensive Information Systems Support Consolidation program (CISSCO). During this reporting period, the OIG initiated an audit of the NRC's controls related to work performed under CISSCO. The objectives of the audit are to determine (1) whether the NRC has implemented adequate controls over the use of CISSCO resources, and (2) whether existing quality assurance measures are effective. (Addresses Management Challenges #2 and #4), 45041=To the extent possible, reviews conducted under each tier will examine the data systems used, and determine the accuracy and reliability of the data used to support reported outcome goals and output measures. The OIG believes that this approach satisfies the requirements of the Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990 and the intent and spirit of the GPRA., 33631=The Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA) requires Federal managers to establish a continuous process for evaluating, improving, and reporting on the internal control and accounting systems for which they are responsible. The FMFIA also specifies that, by December 31 of each year, the head of each executive agency submits to the President and Congress (1) a statement on whether there is reasonable assurance that the agency's controls are achieving their intended objectives, and (2) a report on material weaknesses in the agency's controls. OMB Circular A-123, Revised, Management Accountability and Control, is the implementing guidance for FMFIA. The policy and procedures for the NRC's management control program are documented in Management Directive (MD) 4.4, \"Management Controls.\", 71584=In March 1999, as we continued to monitor these issues, the OIG provided the agency with a summary of our followup activities in these areas. With regard to power plants, the OIG stated the belief that the agency continues to pursue a suitably aggressive program. The OIG pointed out that the addition of audits covering all plants will solidify the NRC's assurance that Y2K problems at reactors will be minimal. Additionally, the OIG was encouraged to learn that (1) the agency is more fully including Resident Inspectors in this effort, and (2) the agency recognized the importance of adding sample audits of contingency planning to the effort., 108648=The OIG established a toll-free number (1-800-233-3497) to provide NRC employees, contractors, and others with direct access to OIG's Hotline Program. Hotline procedures and guidelines were carefully developed to ensure the confidentiality (unless totally unavoidable) of NRC employees wishing to report incidents of possible fraud, waste, and abuse within the NRC. Trained OIG staff are available to answer calls Monday through Friday, between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. (eastern standard time)., 18617=In passing the Inspector General Act of 1978, the U.S. Congress sought to ensure integrity and efficiency within the Federal Government and its programs. To achieve that objective, each Inspector General (IG) has a dual reporting responsibility to the Congress and the head of the respective agency. Each IG submits semiannual reports to the agency head and Congress regarding their findings, conclusions, and recommendations for corrective actions. The IGs may also issue immediate reports on particularly serious or flagrant problems they discover. Indeed, the IGs are required to keep the agency head and Congress fully and currently informed of serious issues and concerns related to the administration of programs through these reports and other mechanisms, including in-person meetings and testimony at hearings., 56890=The OIG conducted this inquiry based on information received from several current and former licensee employees at the Millstone Power Station who alleged potential wrongdoing on the part of NRC staff and a consulting firm tasked with independent, third-party oversight of Millstone's Employee Concerns Program (ECP). The third-party oversight of the licensee's ECP was ordered by the NRC in October 1996 because of agency concerns about past failures in the licensees' management processes and procedures to effectively handle safety issues raised by its employees., 17583=For Fiscal Year 1999 (FY 99), the NRC's total budget authority is approximately $470 million, which includes an appropriation of $4.8 million for the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). The NRC is relatively unique among Federal agencies because it is required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 to assess fees in order to recover 100 percent of its budget authority, less the amounts appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund for high-level waste activities, and from the General Fund for regulatory reviews and other assistance provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Therefore, the NRC must employ sound financial practices to fully comply with its legislative mandates. The OIG's financial audits help the NRC to meet these objectives., 14600=In 1974, the U.S. Congress established the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) as an independent Federal agency responsible for regulating the Nation's nonmilitary uses of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials, in accordance with the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. That act, together with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, defines the mission of the NRC. Specifically, the NRC's primary mission is to ensure that nonmilitary uses of nuclear materials in the United States are carried out in a manner that adequately protects the health and safety of the public, as well as the environment, while promoting the Nation's common defense and security. The NRC accomplishes its mission through activities surrounding the following responsibilities:, 23810=In response to a Congressional request in August 1998, the OIG updated the list of what it considers to be the 10 most serious management challenges facing the NRC:, 73725=On the basis of this review, it appears that the NRC did, in fact, complete its repair and replacement work on the mission critical, business essential, and non-critical systems that fell under the purview of the \"Y2K program\" reported to the OMB. However, the OIG also identified eight noncompliant systems that are being replaced as part of the agency's systems life cycle work. This means that while the \u00d2Y2K program\" is complete as defined for OMB reporting purposes, the agency's work to prepare for January 1, 2000, is not., 32000=In November 1998, the OIG briefed the NRC's Chief Information Officer (CIO) on the results of its initial assessment of the agency's efforts to address the Year 2000 (Y2K) issues as they relate to mission-critical and other internal systems. Because of the pressing deadline for completing Y2K programs, the OIG focused on providing information and suggestions to the agency as quickly as possible. Therefore, the OIG provided input during the course of the review, rather than waiting to complete the assessment and issue a formal report. The OIG believes that this approach allowed us to contribute to the NRC's efforts in a timely and cooperative manner. As a result, the NRC staff swiftly addressed any issues raised during the course of the OIG's review. The OIG concluded that it appears that the agency has a thorough and effective Y2K management program. The OIG was particularly impressed with the methodology applied and documentation maintained regarding systems repaired by the OCIO., 83196=Held on February 9-11, 1999, at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia, this year's conference was well-attended by representatives from both the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency. The 3-day conference featured speakers from agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Justice (DOJ) Criminal Division, and Public Integrity Section, as well as senior attorneys from the Civil Division. Presentations by the DOJ speakers covered computer crimes and computer investigative techniques, subpoenas, evidence issues, and civil recovery. In addition, counsels from the OIG offices of the NRC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Administration provided a panel presentation on current topics and issues including subject warnings, fraud awareness, and evidentiary discovery., 40346=Issues two and three are considered substantial noncompliances with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA). Further, the prior year's reportable condition related to business continuity plans the general ledger system and fee systems remains in substantial noncompliance with FFMIA. Tests of compliance with selected provisions of other laws and regulations disclosed no other instances of noncompliance. (Addresses Management Challenge #6), 72245=However, the OIG identified a continuing concern regarding the agency's Y2K efforts with respect to materials licensees. For example, the OIG found that the NRC's external World Wide Web page for the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards Y2K efforts remains rudimentary, with only dated information. Moreover, the site provides no clear links to locations with highly relevant and useful information, such as the Rx2000 Solutions Institute. The OIG's concerns are particularly relevant to the NRC's ability to help build public confidence in its licensee's efforts, or to at least ensure public awareness of the status of those efforts. In the OIG's opinion, given the short amount of time left until the Y2K issue may impact NRC licensees, public awareness and confidence in the efforts of NRC's licensees can be addressed only through proactive disclosure., 69274=The OIG has been actively involved with periodic assessments of the NRC's program to address computer-related concerns surrounding the Year 2000 (Y2K) issue. In June 1997, the OIG issued a Special Evaluation report regarding the agency's progress on the Y2K issue. In that report, the OIG identified several actions that the agency could take to improve its Y2K program. In response, NRC management initiated actions related to each of the OIG's suggestions, made other changes, and substantially improved the Y2K program. However, the issue continued to garner significant attention from Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), the Executive Office of the President, and others.}",
