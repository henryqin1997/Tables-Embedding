            "Any one going for the sciences, political sciences, liberal arts, business, and almost anything else. It's a big school so it has most majors. Their undergrad science is good and the city gives you intern/research opportunities. And for political sciences, Albany is the capital region and has many government offices, buildings, and events. It has all sorts of personalities so I can't say what kind of people it would be good for. Those with high academic standing from high school would do well to join the honors college. It gives them the opportunity to get some wonderful classes, good housing, and other bonuses such as tickets to the school's preforming arts shows and the ability to borrow a book from the library for a full semester.",
            "Yes, it has a party reputation. No, you don't have to do that. There are lots of people to meet, and in general, I found you just have to reach out a little to start up a good conversation. JOIN THE CLUBS! I never thought I would like fencing until I went to the first practice and loved it. Now I am going with the club to competitions in other schools. And I never pictured I could learn salsa dancing as well. Just keep an open mind and never give up. You can learn a lot if you're willing to see it.",
            "For all they do, and compared to all the other schools, YES! It has one of the best prices and you get a lot back. Private schools can nickle and dime you to death it seems. But since it is state funded, things are kept pretty nice, there are many facilities at your reach, and you are in a good location for research.",
            "Albany is great because you are in a city so many things are so near by. But the campus is separate enough so you don't feel like you're crowded in a city. I joined several clubs which I never pictured myself ever doing and found a number of amazing people to hang out with. To be honest, I didn't want to come to UA at first. I hated the idea. Until one time I visited and I felt comfortable with the place. Now I coming here was one of the best choices I have ever made.",
            "I'm learning so much in the books and so much more outside of it! Take advantage of your teacher's office hours, join some clubs, meet people and have fun. The honors courses are exceptional and I can't believe how much my process of thinking has changed. It's a different experience for everyone. Mine has been amazing. You just have to go forward and make it your own."

Because it is in the North, near Canada. Start bringing heavy winter jackets starting from October. April and May is the season for decent to humid weather conditions. It can get HOT. Do not expect snow days, unless the amount of snowfall accumulated is more than 6 inches or icy conditions occur. Be aware that roommates may not always be that friendly in the beginning. Do not succumb to peer pressure or group activities that do not engage your personality, you'll only hurt yourself in the end., 454069=The food is nothing special. There are 4 dining halls on the campus, one in each quadrant. These dining halls rotate the foods they serve daily and are open from around 7:30 am to 8:00 pm with the exception of one hall. I personally think closing the hall at 8:00 pm is a little to early but it's not entirely that bad. The campus center also has several dining options where you can get sub sandwiches, pizza slices, sushi, deli sandwiches, chinese, and mexican food depending on your meal plan. These places are open until 11:00 pm on weekdays so I always try to utilize these places to the best of my ability. The campus center food usually tastes better than the dining hall food. There is also a food market where you can purchase milk shakes, all sorts of beverages, freezer foods, dry foods like crackers, candy, and hot soup until late at night as well. The milk shakes are surprisingly good so I recommend trying those at least once. If you keep some snacks in your room for late a night, you shouldn't be too hungry most of the time.}",
