Macroeconomic uncertainties might hinder its Research Chemicals business whereas growth in Bioscience and Hitech is expected to drive SAFC sales for the remainder of the year. The acquisitions of BioReliance and Research Organics are expected to boost sales by 6%., 62582=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 14848=by Zacks Equity Research \u00a0\u00a0Published on July 24, 2012 |, 20172=Global lab chemical and life sciences company Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (SIAL - Analyst Report) posted adjusted earnings of 97 cents per share in the second quarter of 2012, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate while exceeding the year-ago earnings of 93 cents., 23555=However, since Sigma-Aldrich expects sales from the Research Chemicals business (which constitutes two-third of its revenue) to slowdown in the latter half, it has reduced its earnings guidance for the year. The company now expects adjusted earnings of $3.80 to $3.90 per share in 2012, down from the earlier range of $3.90 to $4.05. BioReliance and Research Organics acquisitions are expected to add roughly 5 cents to 7 cents a share to earnings in 2012., 62643=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm.}",
