            "The Institute`s range of interest is broad. Currently, their effort concentrates mostly on automatic speech signal processing, esp. Czech synthesis (covered by two grants, and also by international projects, the former COST 233 - Prosodics of Synthetic Speech, and its present follow-on, COST 258 - Naturalness of Synthetic Speech). The research also goes on in phonetic and phonologic variability of sound phenomena in speech communication.",
