As pull out handle 14 is moved from the full line inoperative position to the dash line operative position of FIG. 1, elongated rod 70 is pulled through opening 76 to rotate latch release lever 68 through an arc of approximately 45\ufffd from the full line inoperative position of FIG. 4 to the dash line operative position therein. This moves a conventional latch release rod, not shown, attached to aperture 72, downwardly to operate the door latch. The parameters of movement of lever 68 can be varied by varying the length of the helical twist of rod 70 and the length of the release lever. A relatively small movement of rod 70 in a direction perpendicular to the door can result in a relatively large rotative motion of lever 68 in a direction parallel to the door. Additionally, the relation of the length of extension 48 to the length of gripping portion 46 gives an approximate 2:1 mechanical advantage in operating latch release mechanism 16. This helps provide smooth and easy operation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations When button 132 is pushed by an operator into the dash line operative position, rod 140 moves linearly through an opening 148, identical to opening 76, to rotate latch release lever 118 down to the dash line position of FIG. 8 and release the vehicle latch as in the previous embodiment through a latch release rod hooked to aperture 150. Upon release of the button 132, the lever 118 is returned to its in-operative position by spring 142. While rod 140 moves in the opposite direction from rod 70 of the first embodiment, it moves a similar distance and occupies a similar space in the direction of door panel 22'. It will be understood that other handles or actuating members could be employed to move rods 70 or 140 if desired. In addition, different lengths for latch release levers 68 and 118 and different total angles of twist in rods 70 or 140 could be employed to give different degrees of rotary motion to the latch release lever 68 or 118 without departing from the spirit of the invention. The push button 132 has a hollow, generally rectangular shape and fits within housing 106. The side walls 133 of the button terminate in a flange 134 cushioned by gasket 135 and engageable with shoulder 116. A push rod 136 is staked at one end into a bore 138 inside of button 132 and has a square",
