The data interface 10 transfers data between a high speed parallel data bus 12, such as an ANSI X.3.131-1986 SCSI bus, to a parallel printer output bus 14, such as a bus for a printer having a Data Products Interface (DPI). A microprocessor 16 supervises the operation of the data interface 10 by following the instructions of a program that is stored in PROM 18 and in local RAM 20, if necessary. The microprocessor 16 is connected to the PROM 18 and the RAM 20 by an address bus 22, a data bus 24, and a control bus 26. The microprocessor 16 uses the address bus 22, the data bus 24 and the control bus 26 to control the flow of instructions and information throughout the data interface 10.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Thus, it will now be understood that there has been disclosed a method and apparatus for arbitrating for a high speed DMA bus which provides an extremely rapid switch from control by the DMA controller to control by the microprocessor. While the invention has been particularly illustrated and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form, details, and applications may be made therein. It is accordingly intended that the appended claims shall cover all such changes in form, details and applications which do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the invention. Referring now to FIGS. 4A-4E a logic diagram is shown of one embodiment of the DMA Arbitrator and Sequencer 40A shown enclosed within a dashed line, the ARDY logic circuit 40B shown enclosed by another dashed line, and some of the related circuitry. This logic diagram taken in conjunction with FIGS. 2A and 2B and this specification, provides one skilled in the art with all the information required to make and use the invention. Those skilled in the art will also recognize that much of the logic in the DMA Arbitrator and Sequencer 40A may be provided by a single programmable array logic chip, e.g. the circuit 40A' enclosed by the inner dashed lines. Alternatively, the circuit 40A' and the ARDY logic circuit 40B could be provided",
