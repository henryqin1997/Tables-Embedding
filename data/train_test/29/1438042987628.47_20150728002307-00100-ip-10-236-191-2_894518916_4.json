    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 Sometimes you might encounter edit conflicts if several people are working on the wiki page at once. We can mostly avoid those by keeping notes of the bugs we encounter in a text editor and file several of them later at once (don't forget to save). You can edit single sections of this page if you you check Enable section editing via edit links in your TechBase Preferences. Hints You can use the tag <s>...</s> to mark a bug as done like this. After adding triaged bugs on this page, you should keep an eye on their bugzilla status. Add yourself on the CC field in bugzilla to be informed about updates. When a bug is closed on bugzilla, it should be updated on this page. Keep this page updated! Please list bugs here to get a second opinion before making the change in bugzilla. This also gives a record of what we've done for the developers to check. Double Check! Prioritizing is good. If a major feature doesn't work, that is important. Let's keep track of them. Is it a big bug? Some of the bugs are introduced by the distributions packaging them. Those bugs should be closed as DOWNSTREAM.",
