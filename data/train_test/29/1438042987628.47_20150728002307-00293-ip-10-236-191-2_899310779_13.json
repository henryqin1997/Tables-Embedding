            "I have never felt unsafe on campus. The campus is very small and well-lit at night and there is constant security patrolling the campus.",
            "There are not any fraternities/sororities.",

            "Great for first-time students, those who are having to pay out-of-pocket for college, and people who prefer smaller class sizes.",
            "None that I am aware of.",
            "Dyersburg State is one of the cheapest colleges I have found, but the quality of the classes far above what you would expect for the price. I am very thankful that I decided to attend to get all of my basic course credits that would have been double or triple the price at a four-year institute.",
            "Dyersburg is a very small town, but there are usually events on-campus to attend, along with the town having a movie theatre. You could also travel to nearby Union City to visit the Discovery Park of America or travel to Jackson for plenty of restaurants, shopping, etc.",
            "There is an on-campus cafe with plenty of seating. Also, there are plenty of vending machines in each building.",
            "There is not any on-campus housing.",
            "Most classes are very basic, but you will get out of the class what you need. I have never had to struggle or stress about having work done for all my classes at one time. All my professors work with me if I need help, but you have to make sure you keep communication open if you need help.",
            "Even though you can only achieve Associate's Degrees at Dyersburg State, I would highly recommend attending here first before transferring to a larger, four-year college. It will save you money on basic classes and the classes will be easier, especially if you're nervous about the workload of attending college.",
            "Dyersburg State is a great college for first-time students or people who are interested in at least giving college a try. The classes are small, so there is plenty of one-on-one time with professors if you need help. The campus is small and everything is easy to find."

It is important to have fun, but it is more important to stay focused on studies than anything. Always show respect for your professors because they are there to help you at this college. Take advantage of the teacher student ratio of 1:30., 7231=This review is based on the experience of taking a dual enrollment class at the Covington campus. I plan to attend the Covington campus in the fall. I learned a lot during my time at Dyersburg State. So much so that I raised my ACT English score (the subject of my dual enrollment class) 4 points. The class set a lot of grammar rules in stone for me. I have always second guessed my reasoning on a lot of those rules, so this was incredibly helpful. The flip side of that is that it taught me a lot about BEING in college. It taught me how important each day of a class is and how I need to make it a high priority because it is preparation for me future. Before this class I had never heard of a syllabus-- by now I've heard it more times than I have cared to. It taught me how to speak up even when no one else will (or no one else cares to have an opinion.) .Those are some pretty important life skills. Unfortunately, my teacher didn't always stick to the books. As much as I enjoy any type of civilized debate (including the ones I participated in during class), I didn't pay more than a hundred dollars for English books so I could defend my beliefs/religion. I'm a big advocate for getting what's been paid for, and with this specific teacher, I didn't always get that. I have grown mentally, intellectually, and spiritually because of my experience at DSCC. All in all, it was a good experience even though I messed up quite a bit along the way, 63421=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Dorm Life there currently aren't any dorms, but they are reviewing the need for them and are looking at building some. Academic Rigor the level of information is the same as anywhere else, but the instructors here make things easier to understand and retain. Tips for prospective students don't be afraid to ask questions, they are very helpful. In three sentences dscc is a wonderful college. i transferred to another college but decided to go back to dyersburg. the teachers are helpful, and it is easy to find any help you",
