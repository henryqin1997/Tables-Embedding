Start behind the Safety Car, we\u2019ll go around, do a lap, the Safety Car will come in and then that is virtually lap two of the race \u2013 this is lap one of the race.

            "The Mercedes drivers get their usual information about each others\u2019 driving techniques. OK Lewis, gap now 5.4. Loss to Nico, braking, turn six [Brooklands].",
            "By lap seven Rosbreg is almost 14 seconds ahead of third-placed Button, with Hamilton between them. So Nico, you are in your Safety Car window.",
            "Just struggling with overall grip.",
            "OK, understood.",
            "OK, so try an earlier and faster apex in turn 15 [Stowe].",
            "So Nico braking later, turn 15. And half tenth faster, sector one. Gap at 5.5. You are in your Safety Car window.",
            "Warning \u2013 on corner 18 [Club], we have to stay on the track on corner 18.",
            "Ricciardo passed Hulkenberg on lap nine. OK mate, nice job. Let\u2019s get after Alonso.",
            "Gutierrez has collided with Maldonado at Vale Is the car OK, Esteban?",
            "Not, it is not OK!",
            "No reply is heard from Gutierrez\u2019s car \u2013 but he can be heard crunching through a gravel trap and into retirement. Understood, is it just the front wing?",
            "OK Checo, so this is the Bianchi, Vergne, Grosjean, Maldonado train ahead, OK? So it\u2019s Bianchi at the head of these three cars ahead of you.",
            "Ericsson is cruising with apparent suspension damage I have a damaged car. Front suspension, left.",
            "OK, roger. If it\u2019s safe to bring it back, bring it back.",
            "Still yellow, yellow, turn one, two [Abbey/Farm]. Be more progressive with the steering, turns one and two. And be aware, fuel is to target, but you do not have excess. We\u2019re just safe at the moment.",
            "At the next stop, what are you thinking on front wing?",
            "I have no idea. Because we have got two big issues. I don\u2019t know.",
            "Copy that. We\u2019re fighting the wind, I think. It\u2019s the wind.",
            "Well maybe I should take more flaps, because the high-speed understeer is absolutely killing us. I can handle the stability with my torque and engine braking.",
            "Copy that Nico. Watch the track limits in turn nine [Copse]. Track limits, turn nine.",
            "OK, Jenson. Let\u2019s work the front-left tyre a little harder, if you can. More temperature in the front-left.",
            "So two tenths faster, sector two. So pitting the hards for the next stint, we\u2019re thinking one turn down, maybe one and a half. Let me know what you think.",
            "One turn, I think.",
            "Rosberg made his first pit stop on lap 18. So Nico we may extend one more lap. Just let us know how the tyres are looking, look like they\u2019re coming back a little bit.",
            "Tyres are good.",
            "Copy, we\u2019re going to go one more lap.",
            "Great job, Max. It was a 44.4 from Kobayashi. He\u2019s within reach, let\u2019s get him in the next lap or two.",
            "Ricciardo pits for the only time in the race. You\u2019ll come out behind Sutil, ahead of Vergne. Maybe close behind Sutil.",
            "OK Lewis you\u2019re the fastest man on track.",
            "So Vettel ahead\u2019s on a two stop anyway, Nico. So let\u2019s settle down and try and make this one work.",
            "And how are the tyres?",
            "Having started 14th Bottas has just passed Button for third behind the two Mercedes. Brilliant stuff, Valtteri.",
            "So push hard now, Nico. Push hard now. It won\u2019t be long.",
            "So we\u2019re going to be target, plus two. Target plus two. You are one tenth faster, sector one.",
            "OK Lewis, three tenths faster sector one. It\u2019s hammer time.",
            "Tyres are OK. Tyres are OK.",
            "Great management, Valtteri. To safeguard our day we need to run this tyre right to the end of its life. So how many laps do you think left?",
            "Difficult to get the exact [unclear] so, I think the wear is OK. So, could be up to ten laps.",
            "Copy, good feedback. We\u2019ll just keep an eye on lap times. That\u2019s good news.",
            "Next car in front is Jev, four seconds. Use the hards for him \u2013 41.5 last timed lap. Forty-one point five.",

            "OK Daniel. Hulkenberg ahead is one-stopping. Need to get past him as soon as possible.",
            "So we\u2019re continuing to look at the problem, Nico. No information at the moment.",
            "Pace much better. You\u2019re much closer to Maldonado now.",
            "You have now jumped a lot of cars ahead. We\u2019re looking good. Nice job, mate.",
            "What about tyres? Tyre phase and balance?",
            "All good. Car now is a little bit too much on the nose, so 1.4 [unclear].",
            "Copy.",
            "Behind Vergne is clear, he\u2019s on two stops. His tyres are seven laps old Mediums.",
            "So tyres were evenly worn front and rear. Front a little bit more \u2013 50 percent remaining.",
            "So, menu ten to one. Change to gearbox settings should be transparent. Menu ten to one.",
            "Tyres are starting to drop off.",
            "OK copy that message, Lewis. One more lap. One more lap.",
            "This is a good in-lap, Lewis. Just keep on it.",
            "OK Daniel. Everybody ahead will have to stop again. Three cars will have to fit hards and they will be slow. Three cars ahead will fit hards.",
            "The last two laps, Alonso\u2019s gone off the circuit at Copse.",
            "OK Jenson, understood. Understood. Doing a great job.",
            "OK Jenson, Yellow G3. Yellow G3. Target plus two.",
            "While Rosberg put on mediums again at his first pit stop, Hamilton switched to the hards. Although hewas warned they would take a while to warm up his first full lap out of the pits turned out to be the fastest of the race. OK Lewis, this tyre has a warm-up slope on the outlap, so we suggest diff entry five for this tyre. Diff entry five.",
            "Don\u2019t worry about the pit stops, guys. But let\u2019s get a good one next one, OK?",
            "OK Jenson, so we are still looking for target plus two. Alonso\u2019s pitted but has a five second stop-go, so this is all good.",
            "So Lewis pushing very hard at the moment. Consider brake balance rearwards for ten to 13. Gap to Lewis, 4.8.",
            "And HPP4 position ten when you can. Another nine-tenths that last lap. Gap at 3.2.",

            "Copy that, Nico. We will advise. No change at the moment on gearbox settings.",
            "Cause I could stop shifting so much, if you need to.",
            "OK, really having big problems with the gearbox so please advise. Staying in fifth gear at the moment. I lost it again on downshifting.",
            "Some of these messages may not be in chronological order as they were edited differntly on different channels. So Nico menu ten to eight and leave it in eight.",
            "Stay in sixth, Nico. Stay in sixth.",
            "Yeah, I don\u2019t have drive at the moment.",
            "If you don\u2019t have drive, try shifting Nico.",
            "OK Lewis, Nico is reporting a gearbox issue. He has a shift problem. So don\u2019t take any risks.",
            "OK Lewis, so Nico is trying to get this car home. So take no risks. Just caution with the traffic.",
            "OK Lewis, so gap to the car in third place in 24 seconds.",
            "OK, I\u2019m trying everything. Anything else I can do?",
            "OK, not at the moment. We\u2019re still looking.",
            "Driver default 01. Try driver default 01.",
            "OK, anything else?",
            "Stand by. So we\u2019ve got about thirty seconds before we need to turn off, Nico\u2026",
            "Twenty seconds before we need to turn off\u2026",
            "OK, so stop stop. Turn off. Stop, stop. Turn off, Nico. Going to save the engine.",
            "OK Lewis just look after the car as much as you can. Yellow, yellow, Maggotts/Becketts. I\u2019m afraid Nico\u2019s had to stop.",
            "How\u2019s our pace? Is it worth going longer?",
            "We are looking into it, we are looking into your question.",
            "Yep, pace is still good. You\u2019re now the second quickest car on track. Rosberg has retired.",
            "So for info, Vettel ahead is on 21-lap old used [medium tyres], so he has to stop again. So in reality, we\u2019re in P2. So keep your head down, we need to get to the end.",
            "Try to go forwards on bias if you can. It might help the rear temps. We don\u2019t need that help for reliability, just for tyre temps. It might help tyre temps.",
            "Nico, so we\u2019re 20 laps to go. You should be able to push these [tyres] all the way to the end.",
            "So Max, for the race situation, because we were in the pit-lane we missed that extra formation lap, which put us one lap down to the field. So we are one lap down to Jules, we\u2019ll keep pushing to the end, hopefully we can catch back up to Kobayashi and regain that position and we\u2019ll keep pushing and take positions as other people go out. Sorry for the situation but you\u2019re doing a great job, keep pushing.",
            "How far to Kobayashi?",
            "Kobayashi is about 70 percent of a lap ahead. Kobayashi\u2019s in turn four [The Loop] now. So we need to make that up to him, but he\u2019s lapping much slower so we\u2019ll see how we\u2019re doing pace wise and he\u2019ll hopefully be stopping again.",
            "Perez passed Sutil on lap 37. C\u2019mon Checo, let\u2019s try and get him [Sutil] nice and early. So he doesn\u2019t disrupt our rhythm.",
            "Watch overlaying brake and throttle. Watch overlaying brake and throttle.",
            "While Vettel pitted on lap 10 and had to make another pit stop to get to the end, Ricciardo\u2019s first pit stop was on lap 15 and he felt able to make his tyres last until the flag. Daniel, do you think you can do 15 more laps? Do you think you can do 15 more laps on this set?",
            "Yes.",
            "OK, understood.",
            "Sutil is going wide in turn nine [Copse] all the time.",
            "Copy that. Good info. Thank you.",
            "Vettel came out of the pits ahead of Alonso on lap 34 but was passed by the driver, who defended vigorously when Vettel attacked him back. He can\u2019t do that! I would\u2019ve crashed into him!",
            "Understood. You\u2019ve got plenty of laps. Let\u2019s do it again.",
            "Alonso complains in Eng-talian. Track limits a tutti, eh? [Track limits for all, eh?]",
            "What\u2019s going on with the brakes again? I mean, how can I race?",
            "We are pushing for you, we are looking into it. Keep racing as good as you can.",
            "Track limits [unclear]!",
            "Understood. Track limits for everyone and the car behind [Vettel] included.",
            "So Jenson, Ricciardo on 24-lap-old tyres. You\u2019re currently six tenths faster than Ricciardo. Six tenths faster.",
            "These tyres are pretty good. There\u2019s a lot of life left in them.",
            "OK, copy that Lewis.",
            "Are you happy with the tyre energies? For me it feels OK.",
            "For sure. Don\u2019t push any harder than this. We\u2019re in a safe position.",
            "OK Jenson. We think Ricciardo will try and get to the end. We think he will try and get to the end, so we need to chase him down and pass him on track.",
            "Pace is good. You\u2019re doing a very good job. Gap to Button \u2013 nine seconds. Still nine seconds to Button. He\u2019s doing 39.0s.",
            "\u2026and another one. So track limits, Alonso. Went wide again.",
            "Understood. You need to use the charge. Either charge ten or use overtake. One or the other.",
            "Appears to be in reference to the pair going side-by-side into Copse on lap 42. He didn\u2019t leave a space! I could\u2019ve easily given him a puncture!",
            "Understood. Stay patient. You\u2019re clearly quicker.",
            "OK Daniel, you do not need to look after the right-hand side tyres. You can push in left-hand corners. Push in the left-hand corners.",
            "And we are reporting track limits to the race direction.",
            "OK Daniel, pace management is good at the moment. You\u2019re doing a good job at the moment. Button will not catch you.",
            "OK Kevin, ten laps to go. Tyres are good, we can push more. Let\u2019s close up on Vettel and Alonso, see if we can get them in the end.",
            "OK, still half a second faster. Still half a second faster. We are catching him [Hulkenberg].",
            "And another one.",
            "Understood",
            "And another one\u2026",
            "Daniel, if you can maintain a 39.2, Button will not catch you. If you can maintain 39.2, it will be easy.",
            "OK, understood. Thank you.",
            "Temps OK?",
            "Yeah, temps are looking better now. Just keep working at it.",
            "OK Daniel, should be easy, but don\u2019t let him get DRS. Do not let him get within DRS. We need to keep a good five second margin.",
            "Vettel finally passed Alonso after another close encounter between the pair at Brooklands, which appears to be what he is referring to here. He did the same thing again! He can\u2019t do that! If I don\u2019t move out of the way, he\u2019s launching me off the track!",
            "Good job. OK Sebastian, five laps to go. Button ahead, 39.0.",
            "While Vettel was complaining about Alonso, Alonso was complaining about Vettel. He takes the DRS thanks to the track limits at the last corner! He take the DRS out of turn five [Aintree] and out of turn nine [Copse]! Either way! What more I need to do?",
            "That is clear. That is clear.",
            "Yes and he got the position immediately! Immediately! If not five seconds at the end of the race\u2026 [edited]",
            "Some of these messages may not be in chronological order as they were edited differntly on different channels. I need to get back the position immeditately.",
            "Jenson this is really good. Currently more than one second a lap faster than Ricciardo.",
            "OK Daniel, three laps to go. Button\u2019s last lap was a 38.5. Gap is now four seconds. Four seconds gap. Pick up the pace a little bit.",
            "The burning smell was likely Maldonado\u2019s smoking engine ahead Check the brakes, because I can smell something. I can smell something burning.",
            "Understood. Understood.",
            "Maldonado has pulled off circuit with a smoking engine Stop the car please, Pastor. Stop the car. Stop the car.",
            "Yeah, I will stop.",
            "Maldonado ahead may be leaking oil. May be oil from Maldonado car ahead of you.",
            "OK Jenson, this is the last lap. Starting the last lap. Big grandstand finish, JB.",
            "OK Lewis exercise a bit of caution sector three, may be some oil down. Maldonado stopped turn one [Abbey], there is a yellow there.",
            "You can\u2019t touch this, Lewis! Home grand prix win! Beautiful work. Lap it up boy!",
            "England! What a great feeling guys! I couldn\u2019t be happier. I\u2019m sorry about yesterday but fantastic job today, this weekend, as always.",
            "Great drive Lewis! Fantastic drive, really controlled. Well done!",
            "Hamilton celebrated with doughnuts on his return to the pits. OK Lewis, let\u2019s look after this motor. We need it again.",
            "Wow! We said this morning, Valterri, that was going to be fun, but I don\u2019t know where you pulled that one from. That was absolutely unbelieveable! Great recovery by the whole team after difficult weekend, especially yesterday. But absolutely unbelievable drive. Well done!",
            "Yes! [Laughs] Thank you. Thank you guys. Every single one. At the factory, at Mercedes, in the race team. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We\u2019re on the right way.",
            "Come on! Woo!",
            "Nice job. I could tell you wanted to one stop all weekend, mate!",
            "Nice. Last lap couldn\u2019t have come sooner!",
            "He made us sweat a little bit, last lap!",
            "That\u2019s a great drive. Such a shame we just missed out on the end there. But a great drive. I think at the beginning of the weekend, we\u2019d have taken P4, so top job Jenson.",
            "In his 15th British Grand Prix Button once again failed to finish on the podium, crossing the line less than a second behind third-placed Ricciardo. [Sighs] He was one more lap! One more lap\u2026",
            "Yeah, I know. I know. It\u2019s incredibly Frustrating. I think for the whole weekend, we deserved it as well. But, never mind. P4 is a good result and, yeah. It\u2019s been a nice day. So, Lewis won the race. Bottas had a very impressive race from where he qualified and was second. Ricciardo obviously just ahead of us third. We were fourth. Vettel and Alonso had a big battle and Vettel won that, so P5. Alonso P6. Kevin seventh. Hulkenberg eighth and the two Toro Rossos Kvyat and Vergne ninth and tenth.",
            "Yeah, it was a tough old race. Strange with the different tyres. The variety of them was much better with us \u2013 I don\u2019t know why that is. Just general grip. Less movement with the tyre \u2013 I guess that\u2019s why.",
            "Yep, OK. Understood. I think, yeah, our pace on the Hards was not too bad at all.",
            "Alright, good job Sebastian. Sorry mate. We picked the wrong one there. You\u2019re P5. We decided to keep Daniel out. So Daniel did one stop. He\u2019s P3.",
            "Yep. I saw that. Did what we could from where we were. But.. yeah. Decided for the wrong one then.",
            "Your move on Fernando\u2026 I tell you what\u2026 big set of balls to go wheel-to-wheel with him through Woodcote. So, I mean, that was move of the race there. Move of the race.",
            "We finished in P7. Pretty tough race. Obviously we had quite a bit of traffic and I think that maybe hurt our tyres a bit. But I think you did a good solid job. We\u2019ll have a look and see if there\u2019s anything else we can do better.",
            "Good job Nico. So P8. P8. That was a good job, that.",
            "Yeah, cheers guys today. Unbelieveable. It\u2019s [unclear] like it was on Friday. It\u2019s so difficult to drive. We just need to get on top of that.",
            "Copy that, Nico. Copy that.",
            "P9, Daniil. P9. Well done, well done. Very good race.",
            "OK guys. I gave it everything. I gave it all I could.",
            "Yeah, we saw that. We saw that. We all think that you did a very good job. Well done, well done.",
            "Vergne took a point having been 18th at the restart. OK Jev. Good job, despite the problems at the first start. Car in the points. Very good drive. Very good, solid drive."
