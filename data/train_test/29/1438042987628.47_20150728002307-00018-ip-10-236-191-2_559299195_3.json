            "This leaflet reminds students about the meaning of powers, square and cube roots",
            "Perform calculations using indices + state and use the laws of indices + use scientific notation",
            "Powers are used when we want to multiply a number by itself repeatedly",
            "This leaflet reminds students of the laws used for manipulating indices",
            "When a number is to be multiplied by itself, a power or index can be used to write this compactly. In this leaflet, we remind you of how this is done, and state a number of rules, or laws, which can be used to simplify expressions involving indices",
            "A power, or index, is used when we want to multiply a number by itself several times. This leaflet explains the use of indices and states rules which must be used when you want to rewrite expressions involving powers in alternative forms",
            "This is a complete workbook on Indices covering definitions, rules and lots of examples and exercises. It can be used as a free-standing resource, or can be read in conjunction with mathtutor - the companion on-disk resource",
            "An indicial equation is one in which the power is unknown. Such equations often occur in the calculation of compound interest",
            "A power, or an index, is used when we want to multiply a number by itself several times. It enables us to write a product of numbers very compactly. The plural of index is indices. In this leaflet we remind you of how this is done, and state a number of rules, or laws, which can be used to simplify expressions involving indices.",
            "This leaflet reminds students how to interpret negative or fractional powers",
            "Sometimes it is useful to use negative and fractional powers. These are explained in this leaflet",
            "On completion of this worksheet you should be able to evaluate terms with indices and simplify algebraic expressions using indices",
            "A knowledge of powers, or indices as they are often called, is essential for an understanding of most algebraic processes. In this section you will learn about powers and rules for manipulating them through a number of worked examples",
