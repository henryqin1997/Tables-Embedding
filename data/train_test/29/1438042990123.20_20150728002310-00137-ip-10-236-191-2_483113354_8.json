    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{15837=The base cup portion of 2-liter soda containers is generally made from a high density polyethylene plastic material (HDPE). This type of material, it has been estimated, comprises about 31% of plastic production of the U.S. total for the 1987 year. However, plastic is the fastest growing segment of the post-consumer waste stream because it is lightweight, versatile, and convenient, and so this number continues to increase. Thus, a 2-liter bottle of soda is generally made from two plastic components, PET or PETE and HDPE. The supplemental use provided by the present invention for the plastic soda bottle such that it will not be merely tossed aside after its original use is extremely advantageous both from an environmental perspective and, in addition, potentially, it has financial rewards to the person who can recycle the container into the useful article of merchandise., 15176=Soda containers and plastic bottles have been recycled into landfill liners, insulation foam, skis, surfboards, sailboat hulls, fiber fills, carpeting, fence posts, paint brushes, strapping, certain engineering plastics, geo-textiles and non-food bottles. Based upon the information currently available to the inventor, as of 1987, about 7% of the U.S.'s total production of plastics concerns the manufacture of polyethylene terephalate (PET or PETE), a very strong and durable plastic used for soda bottles and other food containers. If recycling of this product alone were more successfully achieved, the environment would greatly benefit., 10831=This application is a division of application Ser. No. 08/154,820, filed Nov. 19, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,108, issued Nov. 7, 1995.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While this invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it should be understood by those skilled in this art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the true spirit and scope of this invention. All such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims appended hereto. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a holding handle 40 is provided to the container. Preferably, the handle comprises a clear, hollow tube of plastic of suitable length. The length should be sufficient so that a user's hand can be placed around the handle without contacting the fold-over flap. Each end of the handle 40 is secured through the side wall 14 of the bottle 10, just below the horizontal cut 20, adjacent to end points 21 and 25. The handle or shoulder strap, of course, provides increased utility to the container, in that it can function as a purse. The base 12 of the bottle 10 is provided with a button or knob 28. Preferably, the button or knob 28 is secured to the base by an elastic thread 30 passing through holes of the knob. The thread is secured to the base of the bottle by a rubber-like grommet 32. The elastic thread allows the knob easily to be hand manipulated. The fold-over flap 26 is provided with a loop 34 which, according",
