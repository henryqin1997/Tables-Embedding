Orthogonal transforms are carried out on the blocks of data in the orthogonal transform circuits 13 through 15. In the practical examples shown in FIG. 5, the frequency range is wider and the time resolution is greater (that is, the block length is shorter) with increasing frequency. There are 1024 samples in the frame, and also 1024 samples in the block BLL for signals in the low-frequency range of 0 Hz to 5 kHz. The same frame of input data in the middle-frequency range of 5 to 10 kHz is divided into two blocks BLM1 and BLM2, each having a block length equal to one-half of the block length TBL of the low-frequency range block BLL, i.e., TBL /2. The frame of input data in the high-frequency range of 10 to 20 kHz is divided into four blocks BLH1, BLH2, BL.sub. H3, BLH4, each having a block length equal to one-fourth of the block length TBL of the low-frequency range block BLL (and the frame length), i.e., TBL /4., 51319=The inventor's assignee has proposed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2-221364 (1990), 2-221365 (1990), 2-222821 (1990), and 2-222823 (1990), a technology for compressing a digital audio input signal and recording the compressed digital signal on a recording medium in bursts of a predetermined volume of data., 87861=A discussion of MDCT processing may be found in, for example, J.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations If the selection being copied is of a longer duration, the recording on the second recording medium may be monitored at a regular time intervals throughout the selection, instead of monitoring only at the beginning of the selection. This may be achieved by skipping playback data at a regular time interval. The magneto-optical disc 1 may be driven at a higher recording velocity than the steady-state recording velocity to enable copying to be carried out at a higher rate than that corresponding to the data compression ratio. In this case, high-speed copying may be done at a maximum speed determined by lowest of the maximum recording rate, the maximum reproduction rate, or the maximum signal processing rate. The second recording medium may also be any of a variety of semiconductor memory devices, such as an IC memory cartridge or an IC memory pack. The present invention may also be applied to a signal processing apparatus for processing other forms of digitized analog signals such as digital speech signals, or digital video signals, in addition to the abovementioned audio PCM signals. In this case, the synthesis of the minimum audibility curve may be dispensed with, in which case the minimum audibility curve generator 32 and the synthesis circuit 27 are eliminated, and the output of the subtractor 24 is directly connected to the subtractor 28 after deconvolution by the divider 26.
