As shown in FIG. 1, these tracks are divided into segments. The number, length, and distribution of the segments used are preferably as disclosed in co-pending application entitled \"Segmented Routing Architecture\", filed June 22, 1990, assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, expressly incorporated herein by reference. FIG. 1 shows a schematic exemplary example of an assortment of segment lengths distributed among the conductors, although those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that it is only exemplary and that other segment length distributions may be used. Thus track 40 includes segments 64 and 66; track 42 includes segments 68, 70 and 72; track 44 includes segments 74 and 76; track 46 includes segments 78, 80, and 82; track 48 includes segments 84 and 86; track 50 includes segments 88 and 90; track 52 includes segments 92 and 94; track 54 includes segments 96 and 98; track 56 includes segments 100 and 102; track 58 includes segments 104 and 106; track 60 includes segments 108, and 110; track 62 includes segments 112, 114, and 116., 40664=The segments which make up the horizontal and vertical tracks in the second and third interconnect layers are joined together by user-configurable interconnect elements. In a presently preferred embodiment, these user-configurable interconnect elements may be antifuses such as those disclosed and claimed in co-pending application Ser. No. 508,306, filed Apr. 12, 1990, entitled \"Improved Electrically programmable Antifuse Element\", and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, which application is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other user-configurable elements which may be located in the insulating layer between the second and third interconnect layers may also be suitable for use in the present invention. The decision of whether to place such elements between all adjacent segments in a single track is a matter of design choice and largely depends on the particular application. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, user-configurable interconnect elements identified by reference numerals 262, 264, 266, 268, 270, 272, 274, 276, 278, 280, 282, 284, and 286 are shown shunting series pass transistors 234, 236, 238, 208, 240, 244, 200, 222, 248, 250, 210, 218, and 254, respectively., 25228=This application is a continuation of co-pending application Ser. No. 07/561,110, filed Aug. 1, 1990, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,571., 37403=The third interconnect layer also includes a plurality of conductive tracks, running in a second direction (shown as vertical in FIG. 3) identified by reference numerals 120, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 136, 138, and 140, which are also divided into segments. The number, length, and distribution of the segments used in the third interconnect layer are also preferably as disclosed in co-pending application entitled \"Segmented Routing Architecture\", filed Jun. 22, 1990. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, track 120 includes segments 142 and 144; track 124 includes segments 146, 148, 150 and 152; track 126 includes segments 154, 156, and 158; track 128 includes segments 160 and 162; track 130 includes segments 164, 166, and 168; track 132 includes segments 170 and 172; track 136 includes segments 174, 176, 178, and 180; track 138 includes segments 182, 184, and 186; track 140 includes segments 188 and 190.}",

These other embodiments are intended to fall within the scope of the present invention which is to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. Referring again to FIG. 1, the gates of all of the series pass transistors which line up by row or column are commonly connected to a gate drive line. Thus, gate line 380 controls the gates of series pass transistors 232, 234, 240, 246, 248, 252, 256, and 258; gate line 382 controls the gates of series pass transistors 236, 238, 242, 244, 250, 254, and 260; gate line 384 controls the gates of series pass transistors 202, 208, 214, 220, and 226; gate line 386 controls the gates of series pass transistors 200, 204, 212, 222, and 230; and gate line 388 controls the gates of series pass transistors 206, 210, 216, 218, 224, and 228. Circuitry for controlling the operation of the series-pass transistors is preferably located outside the periphery of the array of function circuits and is disclosed in U.S. Pat.
