Immediately a dental clinic with one officer in attendance was set up at their collecting station. This clinic was maintained until the unit left the division area two months later., 71022=1951, 69344=II.

This follow up was initially intended to be utilized to survey the effectiveness of psychiatric treatment at division level. FORM #1 [Ed.-none of the forms and graphs referenced are included in this version] was forwarded on those cases diagnosed as Psychoneurotic Disorders and Immaturity Reactions thirty days following their being returned to duty.\u00a0 Such a follow-up was not applied to those cases diagnosed as Character and Behavior disorders since those cases, once diagnosed as once diagnosed and returned to duty were considered administrative, not medical problems., 13619=1049, 22586=Medical intelligence at Division level depends almost entirely on PW interrogation. Opportunities for interrogation were limited because of the few prisoners taken. Efforts made by the Surgeon's Section during 1952 to realize medical intelligence were not completely adequate. This problem was examined during the period the Division was in reserve at the end of the year and an active program, in coordination with G-2, to procure maximum medical intelligence at Division level has been initiated., 50646=Conforming with a general order to disperse the units of the division, the 7th Medical Battalion moved into a position where it became impractical to maintain the previously existing dental service. Consequently, in September the service was redistributed, placing three (3) Dental Officers with each Regiment, one (1) with the 1st Clearing Platoon, one (1) at Division CP, one (1) at Division Rear, two (2) with Division Artillery, and one (1) with the Eighth Army Artillery. The Division Prosthetic section was placed with the 13th Engineer Battalion., 110514=This operation occurring in October of this year represented the first major offensive action by this division. Previously in this report the neuropsychiatric statistics (GRAPHS 1 & 2) were correlated with those tactical situations in which the division's prime function was \"holding\" and maintaining the initiative with aggressive patrol action. Here it is planned to correlate neuropsychiatric statistics with the division's major offensive action of the year., 78888=From 25 April to 10 November 1952 the division was again committed to a combat status. From 25 April to 1 October 1952 combat units of the division participated in relatively light action, consisting mostly of minor probes and aggressive patrols. On approximately 1 October 1952 the artillery units of the division began a sustaining fire concurrent with increasingly heavier enemy probes which were concentrated against the outpost positions. This action continued until 14 October 1952 at which time the division was committed to \"Operation Showdown\" in the Kumwha Area. This operation was the major offensive action undertaken by the division during the year. This operation continued until the latter part of October 1952., 127959=3.\u00a0\u00a0 Provisions of Tng Memo #3 will be complied with except that the normal training day will be from 0730 to 1200 and from 1300 to 1630., 12643=January, 100506=Mar, 79632=On November 14, 1952 the division moved into a reserve area where it remained through November and December 1952. On 26 December 1952 the division was again committed to a combat status., 36034=e. Extra-military Sanitation: While the division was in reserve in the Kapyong Area during March, six (6) cases of relapsing fever were diagnosed among the local civilian population. All homes and inhabitants in this area were dusted. Delousing of indigenous personnel, laborers, prisoners, stragglers and refugees and native dwellings has been a continuous systematic process., 84480=May, 124332=a.\u00a0 The training cycle will commence on 21 November 1952 and will be of three weeks duration. Training will be scheduled thru the Bn S-3. The normal training period will be scheduled from 0700 to 1200 and from 1300 to 1700, Monday thru Saturday with additional training to be conducted during the hours of darkness., 50064=The 7th Division replaced the 2nd Division on the line during the third week of April, in the Chorwron-Kumwha area. The disposition of the dental personnel remained unchanged. Operative vans and prosthetic van were recalled to the Medical Battalion where they formed the nucleus of a centralized clinic., 62604=7 November 1952, 127728=1.\u00a0\u00a0 Recission:Training\u00a0 Memo No. 4, this Hq, dtd 10 Dec 52, 115348=In the first 2-3 weeks of October 1952 these units maintained sustained firing as the result of enemy probes and artillery fire and they supported \"Operation Showdown\". A marked increase was noted in the number of individuals referred for neuropsychiatric evaluations. However, 46% of the cases from these units evaluated showed evidence of physical fatigue without psychiatric disease, and 22% of the cases were diagnosed as Character and Behavior disorders. (GRAPHS # 5 and #14), 91083=Jan, 83435=Feb., 106608=During the month of January 1952 the toctica1 situation of the division was similar to that of May-September 1952 and a definite correlation was noted., 66074=OFFICERS AND EM PRESENT FOR DUTY DURING 1952, 58057=3. Training. A continuous program of on-the-job training was conducted throughout the year for both officers and enlisted men. In addition, during the six week reserve period in November and December, an intensive lecture and demonstration course was instituted for the enlisted men. Emphasis was placed upon forms and records, handling patients, and supply economy. Attached is a detailed outline of the course of instruction together with references used and time allotted. (See Incl III, Course of Instruction and Training for Dental Technicians)., 12912=1257, 36827=(2) Hemorrhagic Fever. A total of one hundred thirty-five (135) confirmed cases of Hemorrhagic Fever occurred, the peak period being in June and July when there were eighty-five (85) confirmed cases. The division was in the endemic areas of the Chipori-Kumwha valley region during this period. It is felt that intensive efforts to control rodents and the use of miticide prevented a reoccurrence of a high peak as would normally be expected during November., 123857=b.

During this time the troops of the command received advanced tactical and technical training., 117622=CORRELATION OF CONSTRUCTIVE MONTHS SERVED TO NEUROPSYCHIATRIC CASES FOR OCTOBER 1952, 49092=In January 1952, the 7th Infantry Division was occupying a sector on line in the Punch Bowl area. This area is in the general vicinity of Chong-Ni, Imdang-Ni, and Sin-Chon, Korea. Dental officers were assigned to Regimental Collecting Stations, Medical Battalion, Division Artillery, Division CP, Division Rear and Replacement Company, 15th AAA and 13th Engineers., 34347=a. Insect Control: Larvaciding and draining of all rice paddies and other ground forms containing standing water in areas occupied by the 7th Infantry Division began in April and continued through October. T-6s and C-47s from the Fifth Air Force were used for dusting and spraying. L-19s were used for areas otherwise inaccessible. Beginning in August the MLR was sprayed by mobile sprayers with 5% DDT every ten (10) days. This materially reduced the mosquito and fly population., 59107=The survey figures for the year 1951 indicate that approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of the divisional strength required extensive, definitive dental treatment and were classified as III, IV, V. Though there was a great increase in the number of patients treated, and operations accomplished, in 1952, as compared to 1951, the survey picture was not changed materially in the past year. (See Incl IV, Statistical Section). There are two reasons for this; the lack of standard, adequate, dental qualifications for men leaving the ZI and the rapid turnover of personnel due to rotation or expiration of category. The plan used at present calls for a survey at six (6) month intervals. The command is surveyed, and those requiring the greatest amount of treatment are given priority. When the command is again surveyed in six (6) months many of those who have received the benefit of dental treatment have rotated and the replacement personnel who are now picked up in the survey are, percentagewise, in the same poor dental health their predecessors were. The survey picture will, 99596=Jan, 14757=July, 102780=Aug, 29338=b.\u00a0 Definitive Treatment - Definitive surgical treatment was initiated in Clearing Company, 17 October 1952. Uncomplicated soft tissue injuries were debrided under local or general anesthesia, and either further evacuated or held for closure and return to duty. When held for return to duty, the wound is debrided and the patient held on the ward 4 days awaiting the secondary closure. After closure he is further held until complete healing has occurred whereupon he is returned to his unit to be followed by the unit surgeon. This activity furnished early surgical management, often not otherwise available, for the moderate wound. It was a complete success (see table #2), but engenders certain logistical and professional demands that must be recognized and anticipated. The major items are:, 10382=The 7th Infantry Division was defending in the Mungdungni (Punchbowl Area) at the first of the year and continued this mission until 22 February 1952. Combat activity, at this time, was minimal. From 22 February 1952, until 26 April 1952, the Division moved to and remained in reserve in the Hwachon-Kapyong area and at Inje. During the period 26 April through 15 November 1952, the Division was once again committed, having responsibility for the sector running west from Kumwha to the right border of the Chorwon Valley. Combat activity was characterized by raids and patrols commencing in June and continuing until onset of the rainy season in August when it decreased to very minor actions. Fighting was resumed to nearly full scale magnitude in October when CCF [Chinese Communist Forces] probes against the OPLR [Outpost Line of Resistance] resulted in sanguinary skirmishes in the early part of the month and the Division undertook the Triangle Hill assault the latter part. Relief of the Division from Hill 598, 25 October 1952, decreased the total amount of combat but intense skirmishes on the OPLR continued through 14 November 1952, when the Division again passed into reserve. The Division remained in reserve the remainder of the year; its relief of the 2nd Infantry Division in the sector west of Chorwon was completed in the very last days of December., 83085=Jan., 51267=In late November the 25th Division replaced the 7th Division on the line, and the division moved into reserve. The 17th Regiment was immediately dispatched for duty on Koje-Do and Cheje-Do, and the three (3) dental officers assigned to the regiment at the time moved with it. The 31st Regiment moved to Hwachon and the 32nd Regiment and the balance of the division remained at Kapyong. At this time a concentrated effort was again made to accomplish a maximum amount of dental work. The division remained in reserve until late December when it replaced the 2nd Division in the sector west of Chorwon. The last day of the year found the dental service in a new area, once again preparing to accomplish its mission in the field in the most efficient manner possible., 31281=Dec, 15814=October, 132105=37-2810, 43190=b. Property Exchange.\u00a0 During the October-November operations in the Kumwha area insufficient blankets and evacuation bags were brought in or made available to Division by the various Eighth Army agencies involved to effect adequate property exchange. As a result Division was depleted in these items to the point where the medical installations were, at the end, becoming unable to furnish all desirable cover to their departing patients. Secondarily, administrative difficulties arose in accounting for these items in the instances that responsible officers accepted shortages in order to keep their patients warm. Closer coordination between the Division Surgeon, Division Medical Supply Office and the Army supporting units in respect to this problem should prevent its recurrence., 103690=Oct, 86225=Oct., 69721=IV. Surgical Dentistry (14 hours) ref - M-203-1, MFSS June TC Maxillofacial 19-1951., 98685=Of the total cases tabulated for the year diagnoses, 76% of the Psychotic Disorders, 54% of the Psychoneurotic Disorders and 32% of the Character and Behavior Disorders were reported from May-September 1952., 69970=V. Prosthetics (14 hours) ref - TB-148 15 Jan 48:, 52530=2. Operative Vans. The 7th Division has the additional dental support of two (2) Dental Operative Vans, the only equipment of this type in Korea. These units are complete mobile dental clinics. They have proved extremely useful in situations where units needed additional dental support for a short time. They can be dispatched and be operating within thirty (30) minutes of arrival. In November the division made an effort to reduce the equipment in all units to T/O & E levels. Since the Operative Vans were in excess of T/O & E, they were marked for evacuation by the Division G-4; however, their presence was subsequently justified and the order rescinded. Attached is the letter of justification for the retention of the vans, written by Captain R. A. Dietzschold as Division Dental Surgeon (See Incl #1)., 91368=June, 123800=a. Tng Memo No. 9, Hq 7th Inf Div, dtd 11 Nov 52., 85526=Aug., 30968=SURGICAL CASES 1952, 104145=Nov, 13267=1120, 39440=(a) Litter accessories. Three (3) items, litter pads, litter backrest and a removable litter cover (zippered) were tested during the October-November combat operations. The backrest was rejected completely. The zippered litter cover was found to be moderately useful in providing clean litters but its disadvantage in reducing litter rigidity prevents it from being a suitable replacement for the canvas cover and it does not contribute enough to be worthwhile carrying as an additional item. The litter pad was well-received by all who used it. It furnished much better insulation beneath the patient lying on a litter and is a much more comfortable surface. Though expendable, it was capable of considerable reuse. It was recommended that corner tie strings or some form of fastener be provided to fix it to the litter; also, that consideration be given to turning out this material in large sheet size for use as blankets and general purpose insulation., 127810=2.\u00a0\u00a0 The training prescribed by Tng Memo # 3, this Hq, dtd 17 Nov 52, will be continued for 3 additional weeks beginning 15 Dec 52., 111080=In early October 1952the enemy began multiple probes in increasing strength, with increased artillery fire. The unit sustaining the brunt of this action (GRAPH # 3) had an increase in the number of cases referred for neuropsychiatric evaluation. Initially the cases represented a high percentage of Character and Behavior Disorders who were returned to duty as soon as evaluated. As the action increased approximately 50% of the caseswere diagnosed in two groups: 1. Those individuals manifesting physical exhaustion alone, who after receiving rest, food, and the change of clothing returned to their units within 12 hours. 2. Those individuals manifesting in addition to physical exhaustion, transient personality disorders due to the acute stress imposed on them by the tactical situation. Such cases were fed, clothed in clean clothing after shower and permitted a longer period of rest and then returned to duty. Sedation was required in only 3 of these individuals. A rest of 12-24 hours resulted in complete reversal of this personality state. Of the remaining 50% - 29% of the cases seen were diagnosed as psychoneurotic disorders almost all of whom were mild transient in nature and returned to duty directly. The remaining 21% included Character and Behevior disorders, Immaturity disorders and \"Others\". On 14 October 1952 the 7th Division began \"Operation Showdown\", the first large offensive action directed by this division in the year. In reviewing this operation from a psychiatric viewpoint the pattern followed that found during the initial offensive action by the enemy. The highest psychiatric rate was not sustained in those units which were involved in the offensive assault (GRAPH #3 & #4) since after these units secured the positions they were withdrawn (hit and run). The units (GRAPH #5) which were employed to hold these positions against the enemy's counterattacks sustained a much higher rate of patients evacuated for psychiatric evaluation. 64% of the cases from this unit manifested either physical fatigue alone (25%) or Combat Exhaustion (39%), which indicated the role that such factors as lack of rest, food, and the psychological effect of \"waiting for the counter-attacks\" play in increasing the evacuation of combat personnel for psychiatric evaluation. It may have been noted that the term \"NP Casualty\" has not been used because such cases that manifest primarily physical fatigue are not psychiatric casualties. The forward medical units are to be commended during that tactical situation since the principle of treating such cases as far \"forward\" as possible was applied as well as the tactical situation would permit., 12997=February, 31224=Nov, 46744=Annex A - Annual Report Medical Service Activities, Dental, 1952, 77059=December 1951, 87622=Your attention is directed to the above Figure #1 - illustrating, the total number of cases, number of ward, and number of OPD cases seen respectively in the past year. During the month of October 1952, as it has been noted before, this division was committed to its initial offensive action of the year, and over one third of the ward cases seen were diagnosed as Combat Exhaustion requiring additional rest and therapy placing them in the ward category. However in November and December 1952 the ward cases have been reduced to a minimum. Therefore it must be understood that at the present time such statistics as % Returned to duty, % Repeater rate, % Evacuated are applied only to those few individuals who are considered ward cases, or those individuals lost to their units for more than 24 hours. A true picture of the mental health of the command, regardless of statistics, is thereby obtained., 91140=Feb, 27637=a.\u00a0 Medical - Medical care can best be appraised against the background of hard fighting at Kumwha occurring 14-25 October 1952, when the medical service had its only serious test during the year. In general, medical care has been excellent. During the Kumwha action, gross traumatism in large quantity presented for the only time in 1952. None of the medical personnel in Division had ever been exposed to such casualty experience before. Adaptation to this work load was rapidly and successfully made; however, some standard points in management of battle casualties can once more be reiterated., 37292=(3) Venereal Disease. There were two thousand seven hundred ninety-six (2796) cases of venereal disease reported during 1952. The incidence has generally declined during the second half of the year. A large majority of contacts occurred while troops were on R and R in Japan and on pass in rear area centers of population. During the period the division was in reserve, in November and December, separate chemical prophylactic stations were established at approximately fifty percent (50%) of the major subordinate units of division., 58635=The availability of supplies was generally adequate throughout the year. Certain prosthetic items, however, were critically short and hampered the production of this section. From January to April, alignate impression material was not available. From April to June, gold and solder were in short supply. In the period from June to December a shortage of prosthetic teeth prevailed. These shortages have since been rectified., 86578=Nov., 91197=Mar, 49464=Toward the end of February the division was replaced in the line by the 25th Division. The division moved into reserve in the vicinity of Kapyong, Hwachon, and Inje. The dental officers moved with the units they were serving and remained with them. A dental survey was completed prior to this move. Upon occupying the reserve positions a plan was immediately formulated to concentrate the dental effort on reducing the number of class III, IV, and V patients. The two operative vans and the prosthetic van were moved from unit to unit reinforcing the efforts of the attached dental personnel., 107711=One case had been evacuated in April 1952 to the 123rd Medical Holding Company in Seoul where he was reassigned since he manifested features of immaturity, making him ineffective for combat duty. The remaining case had been transferred to an assignment in Army area for reasons other than his diagnosis., 83784=Mar., 70028=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Prosthetics detachment (KK) (Mobile) TC 19-1951., 16167=November, 84132=Apr., 100051=Feb, 91426=July, 14406=June, 36419=f. Nutrition: The nutritional status of all troops has been excellent. In May the 13th Engineer Combat Battalion constructed underground coolers for food storage for all units., 14672=1008, 127594=TRAINING MEMORANDUM\u00a015 December1952, 11784=1.\u00a0 Officer - The Division has been chronicallyunderstrength in Medical Service Officer Personnel for practically the entire period. The shortage has tended to increase toward the end of the period promising to become critical in early 1953. See Table #1 for total strength by Category:, 47451=10 February 1953, 13704=April, 78023=1952, 9153=13 February 1953, 105804=In contrast, in October the division was committed to \"Operation Showdown\". In this period less than \u00bd of 1% of the cases evaluated were diagnosed as Psychotic Disorders, approximately 18% as Psychoneurotic Disorders and 13% as Character & Behavior Disorders.\u00a0 Of the total number of cases evaluated in this offensive action were diagnosed as either Combat Exhaustion (18%) and Observation Psychiatric, no disease found (26.5%). The latter diagnosis was applied to those individuals manifesting marked physical fatigue without evidence of psychiatric disease, as is seen in the Combat Exhaustion cases (transient personality, 130983=Stone, Tent, M-1941, 105505=Review of (above) Figure #3 further reveals that from May-September 1952, of the yearly total of such cases tabulated, 48% of the cases of SIW, 54% of the Recommendations for Administrative Discharge (primarily under provisions AR 615-368) and 45% of Courts-Martial Clearances were reported., 15107=August, 100960=Apr, 78485=The Seventh Infantry Division was committed to the line from the latter part of 1951 to approximately 19 February 1952. This period was one of relatively light action consisting mostly of minor probes and patrol action., 71087=1952, 31167=Oct, 91484=Aug, 117729=We attempted to correlate the incidence of individuals nearing rotation among the neuropsychiatric cases seen during the month of October 1952. Through the cooperation of the Adjutant General Section of this division the CMS of 170 of the total cases seen were obtained (GRAPH #15), and it was noted that the large majority of the Neuropsychiatric Cases seen fell in the 20-30 point group and only approximately 6% of the total were individuals with sufficient points to rotate. It was therefore concluded that the factor of rotation affected only slightly the neuropsychiatric casualty rate for the month of October 1952, in this division., 37833=h. Preventive Medicine Detachment. The 151st Preventive Medicine Detachment in D/S of division was replaced on 25 February by the 37th Preventive Medicine Detachment. The service of these troops has been of immeasurable assistance in controlling rodents and insects for this division., 15459=September, 69169=I.

Investigation revealed that the policies outlined by the Neuropsychiatric Division as to the diagnosis and disposition of neuropsychiatric cases were not being applied both within division level and in extra-division units. Concurrently with the assignment of the present Division Neuropsychiatrist in the latter part of September 1952, a more rigid policy was outlined by the 8th Army Neuropsychiatric Division through command channels whereby no individuals were to be given a neuropsychiatric diagnosis by other than a qualified neuropsychiatrist, nor would such cases be referred for evaluation through other than the unit neuropsychiatrist. In this regard, the 7th Division neuropsychiatrist was given the fullest cooperation by both command and Medical personnel. As a result every individual requiring neuropsychiatric evaluation was referred directly to the division neuropsychiatrist., 91254=Apr, 47113=DENTAL 1952, 8622=ANNUAL REPORT MEDICAL SERVICE ACTIVITIES, 1952, 41142=(c) Insulated Tents. The tent, frame type, insulated sectional, with floor, 1948 (Jamesway) was used extensively in 7th Division; its use devoted entirely to medical purposes. It is the best form of winter shelter for sick and injured available. Generally, its use forward of Collecting Station is not feasible because proximity to enemy fire almost always renders bunkers necessary. This tentage is a bulk and weight problem, which would be of serious magnitude in a moving situation., 87319=1036, 35190=c. Sanitary Instruction: A demonstration sanitation area using models was established in May. Teaching films on the prevention of malaria and cold injuries were shown with the regular evening moving picture to all troops. Pamphlets on the prevention of malaria were distributed in June and July. During November an extensive program of two (2) hours of cold weather indoctrination was given to all troops., 36635=(1) Malaria. There were eighty-five (85) cases of malaria during the reported year, a peak of eighteen (18) cases occurring in April and another peak of twenty-four (24) cases in June., 98282=The number of cases evaluated and subsequently evacuated with psychotic disorders were highest in those months May-Sept. 1952 in which the combat units remained in relatively static positions on the line. In those months the initiative was primarily on the part of our forces, consisting of numerous aggressive patrols on enemy positions with relatively no change in the Main Line of Resistance.}",

The Seventh Infantry Division was committed to the line from the latter part of 1951 to approximately 19 February 1952. This period was one of relatively light action consisting mostly of minor probes",
