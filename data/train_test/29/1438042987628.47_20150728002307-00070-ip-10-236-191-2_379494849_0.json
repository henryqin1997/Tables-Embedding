Sizes run X-Small to X-Large. The BarbaraM is constructed from Cordura Stretch fabric.

The shorts are cut with a relaxed, slender fit in the hips and a looser fit through the legs. The waist comes with an internal adjustment system that helps you achieve a perfect fit without the added bulk of a belt. Two pockets give you storage options on the back of the pants. A single cargo pocket on the left leg gives you additional storage for nutrition or a spare tube.These shorts don't come with a chamois but can be easily integrated with your favorite liners on days when you need the support.
