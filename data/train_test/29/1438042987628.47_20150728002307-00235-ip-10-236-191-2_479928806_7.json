    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets While the invention has been described in the context of a preferred embodiment, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be modified in numerous ways and may assume many embodiments other than that specifically set out and described above. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all modifications of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Chip select circuit 32 provides the chip select signals programmably through thirteen integrated circuit pins. However, as is conventional in highly-integrated data processors or microcontrollers, the pins are shared with other pin functions or ports of data processor 30 and are programmably selected so that the output signals can be configured for different end-use applications. Pin configuration stage 240 includes thirteen pin configuration logic circuits, including representative pin configuration logic circuits 241, 242, 243, and 248. Each pin configuration logic circuit has a first input connected to DECODE BUS 201, a second input connected to TIMING BUS 202, and an output for providing a dedicated chip select signal. Pin configuration logic circuit 241 provides an output signal labelled \"CSBOOT\". Pin configuration logic circuit 242 provides an output signal labelled \"CS0\" or alternatively \"CSBOOT OE\". Pin configuration logic circuit 243 provides an output signal labelled \"CS1\". Pin configuration logic circuit 248 provides an output signal labelled \"CS11\". Pin Configuration Stage 240",
