At village level, Farina, Demey and Hardouin (1991) described a technique used by villagers in Togo to produce eggs and larvae of termites for poultry feeding. Fibrous wastes such as maize, sugar cane and millet stovers were used as substrates and were covered with clay pots or jute sacks on an ant hill. The termites were harvested after three to four weeks and fed to chicks. Similarly, Soukossi (1992) describes a technique of producing maggots in Burkina Faso using maggot culture tanks of 1 m3, filled with water, adding cereal stovers and poultry droppings as substrate. The larvae that developed five to ten days later were harvested and fed to poultry. Forages also form part of the scavenged feed resource. Perez (1997) reported on the use of green-feed cassava and soya forage in a 50:50 ratio to substitute commercial feeds. Baksh (1994) suggested an example of an integrated poultry cropping system where a rotation design is used to produce vegetables and poultry products., 21565=Major diseases of poultry in Africa that have been predominantly identified in commercial poultry are Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bursal disease (IBD) or Gumboro, Marek disease (MD), fowl typhoid, cholera, mycoplasmosis and coccidiosis (Adene, 1996). However, Chabeuf (1990) argued that the most devastating disease of village chickens in Cameroon is ND, whereas in commercial poultry, coccidiosis, MD and IBD are more prevalent. Research work in other African countries such as Benin (Chrysostome et al., 1995), Burkina Faso(Bourzat and Saunders, 1990), Mauritania (Bell, Kane and Le Jan, 1990) and the United Republic of Tanzania (Yongolo, 1996) supports the argument that ND is the most devastating disease of village chickens., 11884=Production data of growth rate and egg production are calculated with the National Research Council (1984 formula:, 23938=A number of countries have carried out virus isolation and obtained virulent strains (Table 5). Country reports in a symposium on ND vaccines for village chickens indicated that the disease is endemic in Zambia, Malawi, the United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, Namibia and Botswana. Zimbabwe was reported to be an ND-free country until the first outbreak in 1967, which was controlled after two years. According to Huchzermeyer (1993), the 1967 outbreak was halted by a single vaccination with a killed aluminium hydroxide-absorbed ND vaccine and strict movement control. There were further outbreaks in 1986 and 1994, and recently there have been more sporadic outbreaks, particularly in village chickens., 23301=In view of the above, it is not surprising that Newcastle disease is the most researched disease in village chickens. There is an extensive literature on the epidemiology and control of ND as reviewed by Alexander (1991), Awan (1993) and Yongolo (1996). In 1991, FAO sponsored an international workshop on production and quality control of ND vaccines for rural Africa (Rweyemamu et al., 1991). Recently, there has been increasing concern on control of ND in village chickens, stimulated by the introduction of a thermostable orally administered vaccine (V4) in Southeast Asia, mainly supported by ACIAR (Copland, 1987)., 39688=The advantages of household poultry in improving household food security and increasing household welfare have been reported in other regions. In India, Desai (1996) reported successful rural poultry projects involving women, which led to increased production and empowering of women through provision of training and credit. Similar projects have been reported in Thailand and Honduras (FAO, 1994; Bradley, 1996), as well as Bangladesh (Saleque and Mustafa, 1996). The importance of organizational and capacity building in enhancing increased rural women's poultry production featured highly in the projects in Asia and Latin America. The recent developments in the importance of poultry in household food security, especially for the poorer members of the community, including increased distribution of resources through involvement of women, have been appreciated globally. Household poultry has been included in the FAO Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS) (FAO, 1997b), endorsed in the Rome Declaration and World Food Summit Plan of Action in November 1996 (FAO, 1997a)., 2330=In 1989 the formation of the African Network for Rural Poultry Development (ANRPD) was proposed in an international workshop on rural poultry production in Africa at Ile-Ife, Nigeria, and this proposal was endorsed in 1990 in a seminar on smallholder poultry production, in Thessaloniki, Greece (Table 2). The formation of the network, which has technical and financial backing from FAO, was a major milestone in rural poultry development in Africa. One of the main activities of ANRPD has been the production of a newsletter as a medium for dissemination of information and developments in rural poultry in Africa. Annex 1 shows the international poultry periodicals. Most of these periodicals publish academic and scholarly articles, and some publish trade information for a target group. The ANRDP workshop in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia recommended collation of the grey literature on rural poultry and its publication in mainline scientific journals, publications and books (ANRPD, 1995)., 33558=The importance of rural poultry in national economies of developing countries and its role in improving the nutritional status and incomes of many small farmers and landless communities has been recognized by various scholars and rural development agencies in the last two decades (FAO, 1982, 1987; Bembridge, 1988; Creevey, 1991; Mokotjo, 1990). However, rural poultry does not rate highly in the mainstream national economies because of the lack of measurable indicators of its contribution to macroeconomic indices such as gross domestic product (GDP). Economic evaluation of livestock at household and national levels is complicated by the multiple functions of livestock in the economy. Moreover, estimating the value of rural poultry is even more difficult than for other livestock because of the lack of reliable production data. Mutizwa-Mangiza and Helmsing (1991), in assessing the contribution of various components of the rural farming system to household subsistence in Zimbabwe, could not estimate that for the livestock production subsystem, although the study concluded that diversification, including keeping of livestock, increased household food security. Similarly, in the Gambia, a national agricultural survey had to omit the poultry component owing to lack of measurable indicators for this sector (Y. Jalo, personal communication)., 22722=A study on the incidence of worms in chicken farms in Nigeria found that the most common species were Ascaridia galli, Prosthogonium spp., Strongyloids avium and Heterakis gallinarum (Tona, 1995). Raillietina spp. and Davainea progglottina occurred only in free-range chickens. In the United Republic of Tanzania, a survey on the prevalence of helminths in village chickens showed a high incidence of Tetrameres americana, Hetarakis gallinarum and species of Hetarakidae, Trichuridae and Raillietinidae (A. Permin, 1996, unpublished)., 14664=Source: Horst, 1988., 27750=Newcastle disease is probably the only disease identified by farmers in rural areas on the basis of clinical signs. Therefore, ND has acquired specific local names such as Fengle or Enkuref in Ethiopia, Pappa in Mauritania (Bell, Kane and Le Jan, 1990). Kideri, Mdonde, Mdondo, Sotoka ya kuku, Kifwa or Ikula in the United Republic of Tanzania (Yongolo, 1996) and Chibwububu in Zimbabwe (farmers in Zimbabwe, personal communication). Development of appropriate surveillance standards to support farmer identification would enhance an active disease reporting system in village chicken production systems. Use of rapid tests in identifying poultry diseases at farm level has been suggested by various workers as one of the strategies to enhance disease control in rural poultry (Bell, 1991; Verma, 1996). A newly initiated coordinated research programme on increasing farmyard poultry production in Africa initiated by the Joint FAO/ International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, supporting the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serological ND screening, will probably enhance disease control (ANRPD, 1997).}",

The ANRDP workshop in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia recommended collation of the grey literature on rural poultry and its publication in mainline scientific journals, publications and books (ANRPD, 1995). As shown in Table 2, FAO and other development agencies have increasingly promoted the development of rural poultry through expert consultation meetings, workshops and seminars. The volume of literature showed that there is a paucity of data on rural poultry stored in readily accessible systems. Bessei (1988) reported inaccessibility of information on rural poultry production as a major constraint to development. Classification of the citations by publication year and type of publication produced the trend shown in Figure 2. Other",
    "textAfterTable": "1996 Symposium on Rural Poultry Development, 20th World Poultry Congress, New Delhi, India, 2 to 8 September 1996 Another trend observed in the present review (Figure 3) is that there has been little basic research on various aspects of rural poultry in Africa, except for diseases. As such, most of the citations were general studies of rural poultry development. In the last two decades, socio-economic studies have been incorporated in some programmes, which is possibly a result of the recent introduction of user differentiation and participatory approaches in research and development. FIGURE 3 Rural poultry topics VILLAGE CHICKEN PRODUCTION AND HEALTH Genetic resources According to Horst (1988), the genetic resource base of the indigenous chickens in the tropics is rich and should form the basis for genetic improvement and diversification to produce a breed adapted to the tropics. Horst (1988) described nine major genes of the indigenous chicken (Table 3) that can be used in genetic improvement programmes. There is little information on the genetic make-up of the indigenous chickens of Africa. However, information collated in the FAO Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) shows that these genes are prevalent in the local populations across the African countries (Table 4). Information on the use of the morphological marker genes given in Table 3 for genetic improvement is scanty. Mathur, El-Hammady and Sharara (1989) reported an increase in egg production through incorporating naked neck (Na) genes in a crossbreeding",
