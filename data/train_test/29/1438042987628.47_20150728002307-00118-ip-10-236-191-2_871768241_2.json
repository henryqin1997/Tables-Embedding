    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{47103=10/1/14: The Canadiens made a somewhat unexpectedly strong playoff run last season, which has raised expectations in Montreal. The biggest news over the summer was getting star defenseman P.K. Subban under an extended contract. Subban has developed into one of the best blue liners in the league and is expected to be one of the key team leaders this season. The regular season is only a few more days away. The Habs open up with four road games: at Toronto on October 8, at Washington on October 9, at Philadelphia on October 11 and at Tamp on October 13. The first home game is against the rival Bruins on Thursday, October 16., 55274=2/5/15: The first week back from the All Star break featured a number of games that were compelling because of where the teams stood in the standings or who was playing. Blues and Predators were one game. Blackhawks and Kings were another. And Montreal and the New York Rangers featured the a rematch of the Eastern Conference Finals from 2014, as well as two of the best goalies in the league. This time, Montreal (with Carey Price) earned the 1-0 victory, allowing the Canadiens to keep pace with the Tampa Bay Lightning. It is clear that these two Original Six teams do not like each other, and they may be on a collision course for a rematch this season., 47779=10/8/14: The Montreal Canadiens made it to the Eastern Conference Finals last season before being eliminated by the New York Rangers. They are a quality team and could well end up representing the East in the Stanley Cup this season. In the short term, they may be without newly acquired forward P.A. Parenteau, who suffered an upper body injury in a preseason game last week against the Ottawa Senators. Parenteau can score, but is better known for setting up his linemates and registering assists. Montreal opens the season with four straight road games against Toronto (October 8), Washington (October 9), Philadelphia (October 11) and Tampa (October 13)., 45661=Montreal Canadiens tickets allow fans the opportunity to see a historic original six team add to its legacy. Founded in 1909, the Canadiens have had dozens of all-time greats make the journey to the NHL Hall of Fame through Montreal. With legends like Guy Lafleur, Maurice Richard and Patrick Roy all donning La Sainte-Flanelle, you can be assured this proud tradition will continue on for years to come. The Canadiens play their games at Bell Centre and have called the venue home since it was opened in 1996., 45057=The Montreal Canadiens are a battle-tested team with a great combination veteran leadership and talented youth. After being ousted in the Eastern Conference finals in 2010, the Habs are primed for another deep playoff run this season. With leaders like Hal Gill, Brian Gionta, Scott Gomez and breakout star P. K. Subban, the Canadiens look to bring a record 25th Stanley Cup back to Montreal in 2011.}",
