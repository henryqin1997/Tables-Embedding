Another day, another really solid pitcher who will probably dominate the hapless Pirates offense. Shaun Marcum, RHP (30) Where To Watch: \u00a0Root Sports, MLB.TV, FSWI First Pitch: 7:05 PM EST Pirates Charities is a great resource for the community, unlike the team itself over the past 20 years. So please, spare me the tears, these guys don\u2019t deserve your sympathy. A charity event that THE PLAYERS COULD HAVE POSTPONED! \u00a0THEY DIDN\u2019T HAVE TO EVEN GO TO IT! THEY CHOSE TO GO TO IT! Charity had nothing to do with the Pirates losing. \u00a0This isn\u2019t some new phenomena, it\u2019s just an easy excuse. \u00a0A way to blame Nutting for something because that\u2019s what Pirate fans are conditioned to do. \u00a0The Pirates have been sucking LONG before they were made to hang out and shoot the shit with a bunch of rich guys. No one would be criticizing this charity event if the Pirates were still winning. \u00a0They aren\u2019t, so now charity is unimportant. \u00a0 \u201cOther teams don\u2019t do that!\u201d. \u00a0So what? \u00a0If the Pirates have done one thing right it is their involvement in the community. \u00a0The Pirates organization is VERY involved in the community. \u00a0Much more so than the sacred cow Pittsburgh Steelers, and more than most other MLB teams. Pathetic. That\u2019s right, the most we hear them complaining about is charity.",
