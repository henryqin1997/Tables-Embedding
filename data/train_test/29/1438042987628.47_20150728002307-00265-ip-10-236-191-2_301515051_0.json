    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70991=I couldn't help but notice that Kittle had one triple for every 1000 PA. McGwire's ratio was a little worse. They are both worse than Ernie Lombardi., 88237=Someone mentioned that most of the guys in the original list played in the 1980s. Another indicator that the guys on both the original list and the active players list in @9 are recent is that all but one appeared as a DH at least once in his career. The type of player who would hit home runs instead of singles is the type that teams have traditionally looked for to fill the DH spot. I remember when Rod Carew got cut by the Angels in spring training 1986, he tried to find another major league job at either 1B or DH, but he didn't find one because he hardly ever homered (even winning the batting crown in 1972 with zero homers), and teams tended to look for power hitters for those two spots., 89493=Darren Daulton, another career-long NL'er, just made it into the interleague era, serving as the Phillies' first-ever DH wherever they played their first road game against the AL during his last season, 1997., 34661=First, I actually saw McGwire hit a single in 1998. He got doubled off of first, however., 29293=This entry was posted on Wednesday, February 9th, 2011 at 6:29 am and is filed under Season Finders. You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed. Both comments and pings are currently closed., 92643=FinalYear - Player - Ratio 1996 - Rob Deer - 49.8 1986 - Gorman Thomas - 42.3 1969 - Don Lock - 41.3 1968 - Mickey Mantle - 40.3 1966 - Jim Gentile - 39.149 1935 - Babe Ruth - 39.083 1934 - Hack Wilson - 29.7 1898 - Bill Joyce - 28.3 1893 - Charlie Bennett - 25.6, 91219=*-played in 2010, 78189=Wow, Kinda shocked there, but I figured if he was going to be passed it would be by a similarly high HR/BB guy, but who SO much more. Bonds only had his Rookie season go above 100K. Which is remarkable. In 15 years, Bonds' 1500Ks won't make the top 100. Jeter might even get to 2,000 Ks. And I think Biggio had over 1600. But good look. I wonder if Thome is the leader, or if there is another Thome-type we haven't thought of?, 73787=35-39 - 12.2% - Killebrew 35-37 - 13.1% - Kingman 35-37 - 9.5% - G. Vaughn 35 - 6.4% - G. Thomas (it's 9.4% if you use his 34-35 age seasons) 34-36 - 10.1% - Tettleton Rob Deer had 2 singles in 64 PAs at age 35 32-36 - 10.9% - Balboni. 33-36 - 11.0% - Buhner 34-36 - 13.9% - Burnitz 35-37 - 12.6% - Valentin 35-37 - 8.4% - McGwire (includes a 65 HR season - using his last 2 partial years it's 8.0%) Strawberry is at 11.4% after age 30 (never realized he had less than 1200 PAs total after age 30 - ouch) 32-34 - 9.5% - Hundley 32-34 - 13.4% - Cruz 34-36 - 9.6% - Tenace 33-35 - 12.9% - Daulton 37-39 - 13.7% - Schmidt, 97232=Kds @35 -- Actually, Thome's RHP/LHP frequency last year was virtually the same as his career rate. In 2010, lefty pitchers accounted for 27.6% of his PAs; for his career, 28.4%., 88952=The one who never served as DH is Mike Schmidt, whose whole career, except for his 1972 September call-up, was in the DH era, but he played his whole career in the NL before interleague play started. I'd have to look up if the DH was used in the 1980 or 1983 World Series, but he was still a highly-regarded defensive player in 1980 and possibly also in 1983, so even if it was used in one or both Series, he was likely at third base while someone else DH'd. Maybe he had some plate appearances as the DH in spring training!, 96251=I had his 1967 baseball card, which I recall showed him as a Senator, although he played for \"my\" Phillies all year., 94019=Buhner was traded for Ken Phelps, who misses the list because he only had 2287 PA. But his 249 1B and 10.9% are certainly notable., 71998=If you look at Bonds' counting #s, 2558 BBs, 1539 SOs, 106 HBP, 762 HRs - that is just shy of 5,000 PA (4965) where the fielders had zero impact on the play. I think if you throw in ground-rule doubles as PAs (and other freak plays) where there is no chance of fielding the play, Bonds goes well above 5,000 PAs where he eliminated the defense. 40% of his plate appearances, without a glove touching a ball in play. That has to be a record! Last year, Mark Reynolds had over 50% of his PAs result in no fielding chances. Actually over 56% of his PAs. Most likely a record I am too lazy to research.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Provided by Baseball-Reference.com: View Play Index Tool Used Generated 2/9/2011. The cutoff to make this list is exactly 1 single in 8 plate appearances, meaning that the singles totals for each guy was less than 12.5% of his plate appearance total. Most of the names here aren't too surprising. It includes some power hitters who also walked a lot, pushing their single per PA number down. This includes guys like Bonds, Schmidt, Killebrew, and McGwire. Then there are guys who just didn't hit all that well but stuck around long enough to get 3000 PAs thanks to hitting some homers. This includes guys like Kittle, Deer, Balboni, and Thomas. The more surprising inclusions to me are the guys who didn't hit particularly poorly--say in the .250s. This includes Burnitz, Strawberry, and Buhner. These were guys with a good amount of power who also walked a fair amount.
