I\u2019d bought myself a standard YHA-issue cotton sleeping sheet to use in youth hostels, not even thinking twice about the fact that it took up about a fifth of the space in my backpack, and weighed as much as a couple of Lonely Planet books \u2013 the brick sized ones., 97259=The BBC have announced that their World Service broadcasts to Europe will close on February 18th, 2008. The World Service has been broadcasting in a number of forms since 1938, and has been one of the most reliable broadcasters of news and information programs available, and I dare say has been invaluable to many a traveller on the road in that time. Unfortunately, the BBC now expect people to hear their service via local rebroadcasts (which tend to only be available in big cities, if at all), the internet (hard to get to that when you\u2019re on the move) or satellite radio (not exactly something you want to put in your backpack)., 96573=I was staying in a hostel in Florence back in March 1999, when NATO commenced its bombing campaign over parts of Kosovo and Serbia. The hostel didn\u2019t have a TV room, and there was certainly no English programming on the radio in the city at that time; if I hadn\u2019t had my shortwave radio with me, I probably wouldn\u2019t have even known anything was going on, just across the Adriatic. Now, many might argue that knowing about this might not have helped me in the least \u2013 but who knows; I could well have been heading to Croatia at the time, and there\u2019s nothing to say the NATO attacks might not have reignited the conflicts that had been going on in that area for many years., 79219=I\u2019m currently in the US, and hope to be giving a good rundown of all the places I visit, as well as a guide to New Zealand, where I spent much of January and February this year. And in a couple of months, Europe!}",
    "textBeforeTable": "I\u2019ve listed the prices of a few of their e-books, in both Australia and the UK, in the table below, along with the price of the same book in a Kindle version, if available. How can anyone justify this at all? I also have access to a server based in the UK, so I checked the price of the same e-book when purchased there: \u00c2\u00a313.59 (US$22.27). So Australians are being charged a disgusting 73%25 more for the same electronic book than UK or US residents would have to pay. When I go to the Lonely Planet website and look at their Germany Travel Guide book, from here in Australia, the price for their \u201cbuy all chapters\u201d PDF edition is AUD$35.99 (US$38.49). I asked a friend of mine in the US to look up the same book from there, and she said it would cost her US$22.49. I was interested to see if this pricing scheme is still in operation \u2013 and, yes, it is. I couldn\u2019t believe it. An electronic book has no delivery costs, and yet they were operating a multi-tiered pricing scheme for them, based on the country from which your credit card is issued. Just over a year ago, I was in Canada, about to fly on to the UK. I was browsing Lonely Planet\u2019s website, looking to buy one of their electronic books in PDF form, for England and Scotland. I found one, at what seemed like a",
