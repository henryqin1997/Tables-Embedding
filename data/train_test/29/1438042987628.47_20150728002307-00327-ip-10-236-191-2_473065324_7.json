The at least one CPU 50 or DSP processor 70 can be programmed with certain parameters to implement such measurements of power quality which can be implemented in firmware (e.g., embedded software written to be executed by the CPU or at least one DSP Processor) within the at least one CPU 50 or DSP Processor 70 or by software programming for the at least one CPU 50 or DSP Processor 70. The different techniques for measuring power quality with the IED of the present disclosure are described below. Each of these techniques is implemented by the IED of the present disclosure by firmware in the at least one CPU 50 or DSP processor 70. In the at least one CPU 50 or DSP processor 70, a series of bins are used to store a count of the number of power quality events within a user-defined period of time. These bins can be by way of illustrative, non-limiting example registers of a RAM. These bins can be for a range of values for one parameter such as frequency or voltage by way of illustrative non-limiting example provide the acceptable range for testing the input signals within a specified period of time for the IED. In this way, it can be determined if the measurements are within acceptable parameters for power quality complying with government requirements and/or user needs. FIG. 4 illustrates an example of frequency bins for when the IED of the present disclosure measures for frequency fluctuations. The IED of the present disclosure can measure frequency fluctuations. The nominal frequency of the supply voltage by way of illustrative and non-limiting example is 60 Hertz (Hz). Under normal operating conditions, the mean value of the fundamental frequency of the supply voltage can be measured over a set time interval such as by way of illustrative, non-limiting example over 10 seconds and is within a specified range such as, by way of an illustrative, non-limiting example as shown in FIG. 4, 60 Hz+\u22122% (58.8-61.2 Hz) for preferably a majority of the week\u2014by way of illustrative, non-limiting example 95% of the week, and within a specified range of by way of illustrative non-limiting example +\u221260 Hz+\u221215% for a specified percentage of the week by way of illustrative, non-limiting example 100%. For this example in FIG. 4, the bins can be set in a specified range of the mean value of the fundamental frequency of the supply voltage frequencies\u2014in this illustrative example the range for passing this test for power quality of this example can be within 2 percent of 60 Hz so the frequency bins 80, 81 would be between 58.8 Hz and 61.2 Hz for 95% of a 10 second intervals during the week of the test. If the frequency is not within this range for at least as this long, then the IED of the present disclosure has determined that this power quality test has failed. These values can be programmed into the at least one CPU 50 or DSP processor 60.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{100954=This application also claims priority to an application entitled \u201cINTELLIGENT ELECTRONIC DEVICE WITH ENHANCED POWER QUALITY MONITORING AND COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES\u201d filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on Apr. 3, 2007 and assigned Ser. No. 60/921,651, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference., 164852=An exemplary operation of the transient capture/scaling circuit path 11 is now described. In operation, an input channel voltage range of \ufffd1800 peak-to-peak volts is reduced by a resistor divider 5. Reduction is from \ufffd1800 peak to peak volts to 5.5 peak-to-peak volts. In one embodiment, the amplifier 14 of transient capture/scaling circuit path 11 has a gain of 1/5.53 (i.e., 0.18). A positive offset voltage of 1.00 volts is added to the signal output of amplifier 14 to ensure that the output voltage of amplifier 13 is always positive. For example, a +/\u22125.5 peak-to-peak volt input to amplifier 14 results in an output voltage in the range of +/\u22120.997 volts, which ensures that the output voltage of amplifier 13 will be positive., 163235=The transient capture/scaling circuit path 11 is capable of scaling a wide range of input voltages on the voltage channel inputs, Va, Vb, Vc. By way of example, the transient capture/scaling circuit path 11 can scale input voltages of \ufffd1800 volts peak to peak. It should be appreciated that the actual voltage dynamic range of the transient capture/scaling circuit path 11 can be modified as per customer specifications. It should be noted that the transient capture/scaling circuit path 11 is configured to handle peak-to-peak voltages., 234536=This feature is implemented by firmware in the at least one processor such as the DSP processor 70 as follows: The DSP Processor has a 256*16=4096 samples circular buffer in its Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) and after collecting 256 new samples, the DSP Processor 70 executes a task. This task will first find what is the current frequency and period, such as 60 Hz, then 1024 samples per cycle, then by looking back 1024 samples from the current 256 samples, find out the corresponding 256 samples in the previous cycle, then comparing each sample, if one of them is not satisfied in Equation 1, then set flag, but the final report is updated with a half cycle finished point, that means clearing the flag at the index of the half cycle finished point., 151360=In a further embodiment, the IED 10 will include a communication device 32 for enabling communications between the IED 10, and a remote terminal unit, programmable logic controller and other computing devices, microprocessors, a desktop computer, laptop computer, other meter modules, etc. The communication device 32 may be a modem, network interface card (NIC), wireless transceiver, etc. The communication device 32 will perform its functionality by hardwired and/or wireless connectivity. The hardwire connection may include but is not limited to hard wire cabling e.g., parallel or serial cables, RS232, RS485, USB cable, Firewire (1394 connectivity) cables, Ethernet, Fiber Optic, Fiber Optic over Ethernet, and the appropriate communication port configuration. The wireless connection will operate under any of the various known wireless protocols including but not limited to Bluetooth\u2122 interconnectivity, infrared connectivity, radio transmission connectivity including computer digital signal broadcasting and reception commonly referred to as Wi-Fi or 802.11.X (where x denotes the type of transmission), satellite transmission or any other type of communication protocols, communication architecture or systems currently existing or to be developed for wirelessly transmitting data including spread spectrum 900 MHz, or other frequencies, Zigbee, WiFi, or any mesh enabled wireless communication.}",
