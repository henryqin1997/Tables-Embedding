When Fox passed on the pilot, Crypt Keeper segments were tacked onto the three stories (Yellow, Showdown, and King of the Road), and HBO ran them as Tales from the Crypt episodes., 28737=Two movies, Demon Knight (1995) and Bordello of Blood (1996) were released in theaters. A third movie, Ritual was slated for theatrical release in 2001, but was only distributed internationally (without the Tales from the Crypt connection) until 2006 when it was released on DVD in the United States, with the Cryptkeeper bits restored., 25732=A list of famous directors includes Michael J. Fox, Tom Hanks, Kyle MacLachlan and Arnold Schwarzenegger (who also had cameos in their episodes). Many well-established film directors also contributed episodes. They include Robert Zemeckis, Richard Donner, Howard Deutch, John Frankenheimer, William Friedkin, Walter Hill, Tom Holland, Tobe Hooper, Mary Lambert, Peter Medak, Russell Mulcahy, Elliot Silverstein, Vincent Spano, and Freddie Francis, who directed the original 1972 film., 46419=In 2000, Capitol Records released another album titled Tales from the Crypt: Monsters of Metal.[12] This album is a compilation of horror-themed songs from popular metal bands with wraparound narration by the Cryptkeeper (John Kassir)., 34439=A kid's game show called Secrets of the Cryptkeeper's Haunted House was featured on CBS from 1996 to 1997. The Cryptkeeper (again voiced by John Kassir) was the announcer of the show (he would often break into the action with appropriate wisecracks), and contestants competed in physical challenges on a variety of elaborate haunted house sets at Universal Studios Florida. In addition to The Cryptkeeper, the series also boasted an original character named Digger the Skeleton (voiced by Danny Mann)., 8006=Tales from the Crypt, sometimes titled HBO's Tales from the Crypt, is an American horror anthology television series that ran from June 10, 1989, to July 19, 1996, on the premium cable channel HBO for seven seasons with a total of 93 episodes. The title is based on the 1950s EC Comics series of the same name and most of the content originated in that comic or the six other EC Comics of the time (The Crypt of Terror, Haunt of Fear, Vault of Horror, Crime SuspenStories, Shock SuspenStories and Two-Fisted Tales). The show was produced by HBO with uncredited association by The Geffen Film Company and Warner Bros. Television (all part of a production consortium officially called Tales from the Crypt Holdings)., 29288=As a follow-up to Demon Knight, producers planned to make a film titled Dead Easy (aka Fat Tuesday), a New Orleans zombie romp. \"We were rewriting it, and it was getting scarier and more intense, but a lot of the humor had been lost, and we always felt that was an important part of Tales from the Crypt -- scare people, then let them laugh.\" Gilbert Adler told Fangoria in 1996.[4] The third film that was planned, Body Count, also never found its way to the screen., 38480=After the original series ended, a spin-off called Perversions of Science premiered in 1997 on HBO, this time being based on science fiction instead of horror. The series only lasted for a short run, and was cancelled the same year. This iteration of the franchise featured a stylized female robot host in place of the Cryptkeeper., 58034=In the 1995 film, Casper, Dr. Harvey morphs into the Crypt Keeper doing a pose from Edvard Munch's The Scream while looking at the bathroom mirror being possessed by Stretch, Fatso, and Stinkie. John Kassir reprised his role., 31059=In 1993, a Saturday morning cartoon called Tales from the Cryptkeeper was spun off from the HBO series. Produced by Nelvana for ABC, the violence of the prime-time series was substantially toned down and the gore was omitted. Nelvana employed a child psychologist to review the scripts to ensure the episodes would be suitable for young viewers.[6] The Cryptkeeper puppet was considered as the host for the series[6] but it was ultimately decided that it might frighten youngsters, so instead an animated version was created (which bore more of a resemblance to the puppet than the version of The Cryptkeeper that originated in 1950s EC Comics) and John Kassir was retained as his voice. \"Nelvana created a kinder, gentler personality for the children's Crypt Keeper, and it feels a little uncharacteristic at times,\" Kassir later said.[6] In addition to the Cryptkeeper, EC Comics' mascots The Vaultkeeper and The Old Witch also made frequent appearances, often fighting with the Cryptkeeper for control of the show's hosting duties. The series lasted two seasons on ABC with a total of 26 episodes., 43324=In 1994, a Christmas album, Have Yourself a Scary Little Christmas, was released by The Right Stuff, a subsidiary of Capitol Records. Most of the songs are spoofs of holiday standards performed by the Cryptkeeper, such as \"Juggle Bills\" (Jingle Bells), \"We Wish You'd Bury the Missus\" (We Wish You a Merry Christmas) and \"Deck the Halls with Parts of Charlie\" (Deck the Halls), with narration and a few original songs mixed in. The CD booklet includes a black and white reprint of the comic \"And All Through the House.\" The album is now out of print., 54843=Reruns aired for a brief time on FOX in 1995 under the name Primetime Tales of the Crypt and also aired late-night on CBS in 1997, it also aired on SyFy, as well as Chiller and Fearnet., 51023=Warner Home Video has released all 7 seasons of the series on DVD for Region 1. The DVDs for Seasons 1\u20133 are unique because they feature all-new Crypt Keeper introductions and segments. No such segments were filmed for Seasons 4\u20137. A Region 2 release of the whole series has been announced for Germany by '84 Entertainment, who will start selling the Season 1 DVD boxset from June 4, 2010 on.[13], 28124=Originally the Crypt theatrical films were planned as a trilogy. \"They felt that in order to make this thing work, we had to do it essentially like the series, which began with three half hour episodes, so we decided to do three movies,\" Joel Silver told Fangoria magazine in 1995.[3] Ultimately three films were made, but the trilogy didn't pan out as originally intended., 39561=In 1991, Big Screen Records released a soundtrack album featuring assorted music from the series.[10] The album includes the theme music, suites from 11 episodes and an original song titled \"Crypt Jam\" performed by The Cryptkeeper (John Kassir). A music video for \"Crypt Jam\" was filmed and is available as an extra on the Region 1 Season 3 DVD.[11], 32851=In 1999, the show was revived on CBS for an additional 13 episodes under the title \"New Tales from the Cryptkeeper.\" Due to new U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations that demanded more educational value in cartoons, the final batch of episodes was radically dumbed-down and included much more streamlined morality lessons. Although it was once again produced by Nelvana and the opening credits sequence featured clips from the ABC series, the style of the animation underwent a substantial change, with characters appearing much more rounded and cartoon-like. The Vaultkeeper and The Old Witch were omitted, and the Cryptkeeper generally appeared in disguise interacting with characters throughout each episode., 35855=In 2000, several Tales from the Crypt \"radio shows\" were recorded for Seeing Ear Theatre, an online subsidiary of The Sci-Fi Channel, and were offered free as streaming RealAudio files on their website,[7] as well as for sale on Audible.com. Although 13 episodes were planned (with forthcoming episodes listed as \"TBA\"), only 8 stories were recorded.[8] Seven of the eight shows were released on CD in 2002 by Highbridge Audio[9] (\"This Trick'll Kill You\" was omitted from the CD set[8]).}",
