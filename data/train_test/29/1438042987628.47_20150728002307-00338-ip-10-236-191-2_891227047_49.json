            "There's not much to do for fun around there. Unless you're throwing your own party or CAB (Campus Activities Board) is doing something, its pretty boring. There are frequent Meltdowns in the Plaza and you never know when the Greeks will come out.",
            "I do not like the food... at all. The only thing I really look forward to is Fried Chicken Wednesday and the breakfast in the cafe. We recently got a pizza hut though. Watch out for the weekend hours on places because they are weird.",
            "As for the looks of the dorms and the amount of space they give you, thats a turn off. But the people you live with and the activities held are really fun.",
            "The academics are very good, the teachers are great, although their office hours could be a little better. Most are good with answering calls or responding to emails, so there are plenty of ways to get in touch with them.",
            "Stay on top of your own paper work and information. While the academics are great the schools financial offices are quick to lose things and change things around. Careful to check all costs and ask questions about what you are paying for.",
            "SCSU is a GREAT school, the students are very friendly they have great activities and the students that attend are very passionate about their studies."

The most renowned in our city is the Orangeburg Massacre that took place in 1968 that left many injured and 3 young men killed. In the front of our campus, there is a special memorial in reverence to that incident and also our gymnasium is named in their honor.}",

Tips for prospective students If you are a prospective student you should be determined and serious about your education at SCSU and if you are then you will go far. Bang for the buck SCSU has really give me a Bang for my Buck'. I feel that all the money being spent for me to attend SCSU has been used wisely. The classes are productive and the teachers really care and are there to help. There are free resources, such as tutors to help when there's a need. The campus is nice and I feel safe when I am on campus. Am enjoying being here All though I do become rather homesick",
