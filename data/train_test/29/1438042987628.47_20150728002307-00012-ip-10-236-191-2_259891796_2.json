EWLC is not available on zEnterprise 114 (z114) servers. EWLC enables qualifying customers to pay for sub-capacity eligible\u00a0IBM software based on the utilization of the LPAR or LPARs where that product executes. This sub-capacity pricing provides the potential to lower software charges on a standalone z10 BC, z9 BC, z890 or z800., 467=Customers operating a z10 BC, z9 BC, z890 or a z800 in a qualified Parallel Sysplex may elect to have their server priced as a stand-alone machine (zELC, EWLC and TWLC) or may elect aggregated PSLC or aggregated WLC pricing, subject to applicable terms and conditions. If the customer selects aggregated pricing then zELC, EWLC and TWLC price structures do not apply. While EWLC is MSU-based, aggregation of MSUs is not permitted if EWLC is selected., 1182=z10 BC, z9 BC and z890 standalone customers will have EWLC pricing. All sub-capacity eligible products will be priced using the EWLC pricing metric. The remaining, non-sub-capacity eligible products will be priced using the Tiered EWLC (TWLC) price structure. The TWLC price structure, for non-subcapacity products offers flat pricing based on z10 BC, z9 BC and z890 server capacity using a tiered structure.
