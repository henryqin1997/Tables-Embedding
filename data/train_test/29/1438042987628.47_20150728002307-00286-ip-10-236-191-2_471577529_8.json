    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{107387=FIG. 19 is a flowchart of process steps for a routine that calculates the firing frequency and auto trigger delay for each of blocks 0 to 3 utilizing the formulas of FIG. 18 described above. As seen in FIG. 19, in step S1901 the routine begins. In step S1902, an ATTRGCNT (auto trigger count) value is set for each of blocks 0, 1, 2 and 3. The ATTRGCNT value for each block corresponds to the number of pixels assigned to each block as described above with regard to FIG. 16. In FIG. 16, blocks 0 and 2 were each assigned 150 600 dpi pixels and blocks 1 and 3 were each assigned 180 600 dpi pixels. Therefore, the ATTRGCNT values set for each of blocks 0 to 3 correspond to 150, 180, 150 and 180, respectively. As previously stated, these values are based on a selected design for the spacing of cockling ribs 59, a number of blocks assigned for the spacing, and the number of pixels printed per pulse. Therefore, it is not necessary that the ATTRGCNT values be set to 150, 180, 150 and 180 and these values can vary based on a selected design and the invention can be implemented accordingly to achieve a desired result., 61046=Power cord connector 29 is utilized to connect printer 10 to an external AC power source. Power supply 27 is used to convert AC power from the external power source, and to supply the converted power to printer 10. Parallel port 30 connects printer 10 to host processor 2. Parallel port 30 preferably comprises an IEEE-1284 bi-directional port, over which data and commands are transmitted between printer 10 and host processor 2. Alternatively, data and commands can be transmitted to printer 10 through USB port 33., 75918=As shown in FIG. 9, and as previously mentioned, disk 8 stores program instruction sequences for a windowing operating system and for various application programs such as graphics application programs, drawing application programs, desktop publishing application programs, and the like. In addition, disk 8 also stores color image files such as might be displayed by display 4 or printed by printer 10 under control of a designated application program. Disk 8 also stores a color monitor driver in other drivers section 89 which controls how multi-level RGB color primary values are provided to display interface 72. Printer driver 84 controls printer 10 for both black and color printing and supplies print data for print out according to the configuration of printer 10. Print data is transferred to printer 10, and control signals are exchanged between host processor 2 and printer 10, through printer interface 74 connected to line 76 under control of printer driver 84. Printer interface 74 and line 76 may be, for example an IEEE 1284 parallel port and cable or a universal serial bus port and cable. Other device drivers are also stored on disk 8, for providing appropriate signals to various devices, such as network devices, facsimile devices, and the like, connected to host processor 2., 100129=Referring again to FIG. 18, for the top surface (block 2), the timing (auto trigger timing (ATTRGDelay)) is adjusted for the offset amounts A and C, respectively. That is, assuming that the bottom surface (block 0) is the target surface, the timing for firing the nozzles in block 2 is adjusted for the offsets (\u0394FWD and \u0394REV) as described above. With regard to adjustment of the firing frequency, it is assumed that the top surface is flat as shown in block 2 of FIG. 16, and therefore no adjustment is required for the Interval (GA_ATTRGPER) and the ink droplets are ejected at the same frequency as the bottom surface, i.e. 1334 state., 99125=FIG. 18 is a table that summarizes the calculations for adjusting the firing frequency and the auto trigger delay for each of the blocks shown in FIG. 16. As can be seen in FIG. 18, since block 0 is the bottom surface (the reference surface), no adjustment in the timing of the firing (auto trigger delay (ATTRGDelay)) is required for either the forward or reverse scans. Additionally, no adjustment is required for the firing frequency (Interval (GA_ATTRGPER)) in block 0 since this is the target surface as described above. In FIG. 18, the Interval (GA_ATTRGPER) for block 0 is given as 1334, which refers to the gate array state. The value 1334 is derived from a gate array of 41.6667 \u03b7sec/unit and a nozzle firing frequency of 55,000 \u03b7sec (55 \u03bcsec or 18 KHz), where 55,000 \u03b7sec\ufffd41.6667 \u03b7sec=1334. Therefore, for simplicity, the Interval (GA_ATTRGPER) is referred to as a 1334 state. Similarly, a 9 KHz firing frequency would correspond to a 2668 state., 84586=FIG. 11 depicts a block diagram of a combined configuration for control logic 94 and I/O ports unit 96, which as mentioned above, I/O ports unit 96 may be included within control logic 94. In FIG. 11, internal bus 112 is connected to printer bus 97 for communication with printer CPU 91. Bus 112 is coupled to host computer interface 113 (shown in dashed lines) which is connected to bi-directional line 76 for carrying out bi-directional communication. As shown in FIG. 11, bi-directional line 76 may be either an IEEE-1284 line or a USB line. Bi-directional communication line 76 is also coupled to printer interface 74 of host processor 2. Host computer interface 113 includes both IEEE-1284 and USB interfaces, both of which are connected to bus 112 and to DRAM bus arbiter/controller 115 for controlling RAM 99 which includes print buffer 109 (see FIGS. 9 and 10). Data decompressor 116 is connected to bus 112, DRAM bus arbiter/controller 115 and each of the IEEE-1284 and USB interfaces of host computer interface 113 to decompress print data when processing. Also coupled to bus 112 are line feed motor controller 117 that is connected to line feed motor driver 34 a of FIG. 9, image buffer controller 118 which provides serial control signals and head data signals for each of print heads 56 a and 56 b, heat timing generator 119 which provides block control signals and analog heat pulses for each of print heads 56 a and 56 b, carriage motor controller 120 that is connected to carriage motor driver 39 a of FIG. 9, and ASF motor controller 125 that is connected to ASF motor driver 41 a of FIG. 9. Additionally, EEPROM controller 121 a, automatic alignment sensor controller 121 b and buzzer controller 121 are connected to bus 112 for controlling EEPROM 102, an automatic alignment sensor (generally represented within sensors 103 of FIG. 9), and buzzer 106. Further, auto trigger controller 122 is connected to bus 112 and provides signals to image buffer controller 118 and heat timing generator 119, for controlling the firing of the nozzles of print heads 56 a and 56 b., 108640=In step S1903 the frequency (Interval, GA_ATTRGPER) is calculated for each block. Then, in step S1904, the position of carriage 45 along a scan direction (x)(CRPosition(x)), the print speed (i.e. 1334 state or 2668 state), and the print direction (forward or reverse) are obtained. Next, in step S1905 an auto trigger delay (ATTRGDelay) is calculated and in step S1906 an auto trigger offset (ATTRGOFS) is calculated. Finally, if an auto alignment process has been performed, and an auto trigger delay amount has been determined for the auto alignment, then the auto alignment auto trigger delay amount is added to the auto trigger delay (ATTRGDelay) value calculated in step S1906.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention has been described with respect to particular illustrative embodiments. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments and that various changes and modifications may be made by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus, for high grade paper, some of the values in the formulas of FIG. 25 are adjusted to compensate for the closer proximity of the paper bottom surface to the print head, and may be adjusted for the different block sizes as well. However, the process steps of FIG. 19 and the description with regard to FIG. 20 applies equally to the present embodiment as with the previous two embodiments. Referring again to FIG. 24, reference number 205 is the bottom surface for plain paper and reference number 205\u2032 is the bottom surface for high grade paper. Surface 205 is located a distance h1 from the top surface 202, whereas, surface 205\u2032 is located a distance h2 from the top surface 202. As can be seen in FIG. 24, the offset distances A and C are smaller (shown as A\u2032 and C\u2032) due to the closer proximity of the bottom surface 205\u2032 to the print head. Accordingly, the values for A and C in the formulas of FIG. 25 are adjusted for the smaller offset distance and are changed from \ufffd(0.5)pix to \ufffd(0.2)pix.",
