This type of detector not only allows measurement of x-ray emitting radionuclides (e.g., plutonium activity via the L x-rays) but also has the ability to detect \u03b3-ray emitting radionuclides., 24613=Computer subroutines interpret the pulser data and, by a process of cross-correlating the pulser peaks with a unit Gaussian-shaped function, permit the pulser peaks to be analyzed as if they were \u03b3-ray peaks. The dual-energy pulser is periodically calibrated with a radioactive source emitting \u03b3-rays and x-rays whose energies are precisely known and span the energy range of interest (a source containing 57 Co - 14, 122, and 136 keV, 60 Co - 1173 and 1332 keV, and 137 Cs - 661 keV was used for calibration). The pulser will maintain its energy calibration over a period of weeks to months., 31117=The spectrometer is equipped with a dual-energy pulser 22 that injects periodic rectangular-shaped pulses into the test input of the resistive feedback pre-amplifier 16, as determined by a pulser control and separation logic 24. The pulser has been developed over a 20-year time frame by EG&G Idaho, Inc. The pulser is a miniaturized control package about 2\"\ufffd1\"\ufffd1/4\" and is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,968,889 having a common assignee with the instant disclosure. The pulser operates at about 100 Hz (50 Hz each) and in the application described herein emits a first lower-energy pulse 26 of \u02dc12 keV and a higher-energy pulse 28 of \u02dc1330 keV, as controlled by logic module 24. The lower- and upper-energy pulser pulses 26 and 28 are time tagged so that after being processed by the ADC 22 their channel addresses are increased by addition of respective constants to route them to regions of the spectrum above, and isolated from, the photon spectrum, as shown in FIG. 2. As shown in the example spectrum of FIG. 2 (from another pulser application) , the lower-energy pulse channel has been increased from channel 724 at 30 by the offset of 7312 to channel 8036 at 32. Similarly, higher-energy pulse 34 at 7230 has been increased to channel 8124 at 36 by the offset of 894. These offset calibration pulses are beyond the \u03b3-energy range. The positions of the pulser peaks, together with their previously measured energy equivalent, are used to determine two parameters (a and b) of the energy-channel relationship of equation (1):, 45727=In order to determine the accuracy achievable with this method, \"mixed\" standards of plutonium containing 103 pCi/g of 239 Pu and a smaller amount of 241 Am were prepared, counted, and analyzed as if they were samples. The results from 900-second and 1800-second counts and the lower limit of detection (LLD) are presented in Table 1. Note that plutonium activity levels as low as 103 pCi/g can be measured in the presence of 4 pCi of 241 Am per gram of soil to an accuracy of 13% in a 900-second count., 40133=Measurement of L x-Ray Response Spectra. Measurement of the L x-ray response spectra for plutonium and americium involved the preparation of a set of three \"standard\" samples of clean soil having a consistent composition and simulating the composition of the unknown samples to be analyzed. If different types of soil samples (density, elemental, or Pu isotopic composition) are anticipated, additional sets of response spectra shall be obtained. The three calibration samples within each set consisted of an unspiked (no added radionuclides) sample, a sample spiked uniformly with a known activity of high purity Pu (1000 pCi/g of 239 Pu equivalent), and one spiked with a known activity of high purity 241 Am (1000 pCi/g). Depending upon the samples being analyzed, other x-ray spectra of interfering radionuclides may be included as component standards (response spectra). After installation of the spectrometer, individual spectra of each calibration standard from each set were acquired for a known time (\u02dc10,000 seconds) and at the same energy scale. These spectra provide spectral shapes and intensities for known amounts of radionuclides plutonium and americium present as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. Sufficient statistics in each calibration spectrum were acquired so that the associated statistical uncertainty can be considered negligible relative to the statistical uncertainty of the \"unknown\" sample spectra. This is accomplished by using extended count periods. The energy scale for each spectrum is measured by the dual-energy pulser peaks present in each spectrum and (if necessary) the energy scales are adjusted prior to analysis to make them all the same., 30603=The detector 10 consists of a large area (60-mm dia.), thin window, coaxial-type Ge detector capable of efficiently measuring photons (x and \u03b3 rays) 12 and 14 with energies ranging from about 8 keV to greater than 2000 keV. This type of detector not only allows measurement of plutonium and americium activities via emitted L x-rays and 241 Am via either its L x-rays and 26-keV \u03b3-ray or the 60-keV \u03b3-rays but is also capable of efficiently detecting \u03b3-rays from other radionuclides., 15922=The U.S. Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC07-76ID01570 between the United States Department of Energy and EG&G Idaho, Inc.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed, various modes of carrying out the principles disclosed herein are contemplated as being within the scope of the following claims. Therefore, it is understood that the scope of the invention is not to be limited except as otherwise set forth in the claims. The L x-ray spectrum measurement technique presented herein has been demonstrated to have the capability to analyze \u02dc12 g soil samples contaminated by plutonium down to 50 pCi/g for count times as short as 15 minutes (900 seconds). Spectral fitting of the sample spectra with response spectra permit this process to be performed automatically with built-in quality-assurance checks. Analysis of \u03b3-ray emitting radionuclides is achieved by the use of a \u03b3-ray spectral analysis package on the upper portion of the same photon spectrum as accumulated for the L x-ray spectrum. It is believed that this technique can be expanded to the analysis of a variety of other x-ray and 7-ray emitting samples (e.g., flux monitors), samples contained on filter paper (e.g., particulate material on air filters), and from different waste forms (e.g., glass). With modifications, this system can be incorporated into a portable, battery-powered, in-field instrument.
