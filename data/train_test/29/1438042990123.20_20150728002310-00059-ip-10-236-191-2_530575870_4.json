The art gallery adjacent the wine place has been filling up.\u00a0 I've enjoyed meeting local artists and seeing their work.\u00a0 We had a potluck recently and they are just as good at cooking as they are at their art!\u00a0 I brought wine, of course.\u00a0 We shared a meal, drank a few toasts, and each artist talked about their work.\u00a0 These folks are\u00a0not only\u00a0artistic\u00a0and\u00a0good cooks,\u00a0but\u00a0they are kind\u00a0souls as\u00a0well.\u00a0\u00a0They're\u00a0welcoming spring by working\u00a0in the garden.\u00a0 I feel like I'm the non-artist that has been adopted by a family of creative types.\u00a0 Sitting around the table with the artists, I did a lot of listening.\u00a0 I remembered when I began in the wine world and the vocabulary was unfamiliar to me.\u00a0 The art world has a vocabulary that is unfamiliar to me, but amongst these people was the same convival spirit of pride in their work\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0at\u00a0the core\u00a0of\u00a0the wine\u00a0world.\u00a0\u00a0 This Saturday 3/26/11 my very favorite winemaker Sandee Piluso is my guest for tasting.\u00a0 Please come meet her and take a stroll through the gallery.",
