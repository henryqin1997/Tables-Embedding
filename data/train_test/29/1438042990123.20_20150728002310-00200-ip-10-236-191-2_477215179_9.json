For example, 3-(1,1-dimethylethoxy)-1-chloropropane can be synthesized by the reaction of 3-chloro-1-propanol with 2-methylpropene according to the method of A. Alexakis, M. Gardette, and S. Colin, Tetrahedron Letters, 29, 1988, 2951. The method of B. Figadere, X. Franck and A. Cave, Tetrahedron Letters, 34, 1993, 5893, which involves the reaction of the appropriate alcohol with 2-methyl-2-butene catalyzed by boron trifluoride etherate, can be employed for the preparation of the t-amyl ethers. The alkoxy, alkylthio or dialkylamino substituted ethers, for example 6- 3-(methylthio)-1-propyloxy!-1-chlorohexane, can be synthesized by reaction of the corresponding substituted alcohol, for instance 3-methylthio-1-propanol, with an alpha-bromo-omega-chloroalkane, for instance 1-bromo-6-hexane, according to the method of J. Almena, F. Foubelo and M. Yus, Tetrahedron, 51, 1995, 11883. The compound 4-(methoxy)-1-chlorobutane, and the higher analogs, can be synthesized by the ring opening reaction of tetrahydrofuran with thionyl chloride and methanol, according to the procedure of T. Ferrari and P. Vogel, SYNLETT, 1991, 233. The triphenylmethyl protected compounds, for example 3-(triphenylmethoxy)-1-chloropropane, can be prepared by the reaction of the haloalcohol with triphenylmethylchloride, according to the method of S. K. Chaudhary and O. Hernandez, Tetrahedron Letters, 1979, 95., 93231=This application is related to commonly owned copending Provisional application Ser. No. 60/001,895, filed Aug. 4, 1995, and claims the benefit of its earlier filing date under 35 U.S.C. 119(e)., 141664=Examples of methods to hydrogenate the copolymers of this invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,970,254, 5,166,277, 5,393,843 and 5,496,898, the entire disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference. The hydrogenation of the copolymer is conducted in situ, or in a suitable solvent, such as hexane, cyclohexane or heptane. This solution is contacted with hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst, such as a nickel catalyst. The hydrogenation is typically performed at temperatures from 25\ufffd C. to 150\ufffd C., with a archetypal hydrogen pressure of 15 psig to 1000 psig. The progress of this hydrogenation can be monitored by InfraRed (IR) spectroscopy or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The hydrogenation reaction is conducted until at least 90% of the aliphatic unsaturation has been saturated. The hydrogenated copolymer is then recovered by conventional procedures, such as removal of the catalyst with aqueous acid wash, followed by solvent removal or precipitation of the copolymer., 138569=As noted above, if desired, the protecting groups can be removed from the copolymer. This deprotection can be performed either prior to or after the optional hydrogenation of the residual aliphatic unsaturation. For example, to remove tert-alkyl-protected groups, the protected polymer can be mixed with Amberlyst\ufffd 15 ion exchange resin and heated at an elevated temperature, for example 150\ufffd C., until deprotection is complete. Tert-alkyl-protected groups can also be removed by reaction of the polymer with para-toluensulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, or trimethylsilyliodide. Additional methods of deprotection of the tert-alkyl protecting groups can be found in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991, page 41., 154026=Another possible application in coatings would be the use of new dendrimers, based on the use of the polymer with hydroxyl functionality at the termini thereof to form the core for dendritic hybrid macromolecules based on condensation or addition polymerizations, utilizing the hydroxyl functionality as the initiating site (see, for example Gitsov and Frechet, American Chemical Society PMSE Preprints, Volume 73, August 1995., 144397=Examples of useful linking or coupling agents include halosilanes, such as silicon tetrachloride and methyl trichlorosilane; halostannanes, such as tin tetrachloride; phosphorus halides, such as phosphorus trichloride; and isomeric (mixtures of ortho, meta and para) dialkenylaryls and isomeric di- and trivinylaryls, such as 1,2-divinylbenzene, 1,3-divinylbenzene, 1,4-divinylbenzene, 1,2,4-trivinylbenzenes, 1,3-divinylnaphthalenes, 1,8-divinylnaphthalene, 1,2-diisopropenylbenzene, 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene, 1,4-diisopropenylbenzene, 1,3,5-trivinylnaphthalene, and other suitable materials known in the art to be useful for coupling polymers, as well as mixtures of coupling agents. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,639,517 and 5,489,649, and R. P. Zelinski et al in J.Polym.Sci., A3, 93, (1965) for these and additional coupling agents. Mixtures of coupling agents can also be used. Generally, the amount of coupling agent used is such that the molar ratio of protected living polymer anions to coupling agents ranges from 1:1 to 24:1. This linking process is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,409,357 and by L. J. Fetters in Macromolecules, 9,732 (1976)., 127672=The initiator precursor, omega-thio-protected-1-haloalkanes (halides), can be prepared from the corresponding halothiol by standard literature methods. For example, 3-(1,1-dimethylethylthio)-1-propylchloride can be synthesized by the reaction of 3-chloro-1-propanthiol with 2-methylpropene according to the method of A. Alexakis, M. Gardette, and S. Colin, Tetrahedron Letters, 29, 1988, 2951. Alternatively, reaction of 1,1-dimethylethylthiol with 1-bromo-3-chloropropane and a base affords 3-(1,1-dimethylethylthio)-1-propylchloride. The method of B. Figadere, X. Franck and A. Cave, Tetrahedron Letters, 34, 1993, 5893, which involves the reaction of the appropriate thiol with 2-methyl-2-butene catalyzed by boron trifluoride etherate, can be employed for the preparation of the t-amyl ethers. Additionally, 5-(cyclohexylthio)-1-pentylhalide and the like, can be prepared by the method of J. Almena, F. Foubelo, and M. Yus, Tetrahedron, 51, 1995, 11883. This synthesis involves the reaction of the appropriate thiol with an alkyllithium, then reaction of the lithium salt with the corresponding alpha, omega dihalide. 3-(Methylthio)-1-propylchloride can be prepared by chlorination of the corresponding alcohol with thionyl chloride, as taught by D. F. Taber and Y. Wang, J. Org, Chem., 58, 1993, 6470. Methoxymethylthio compounds, such as 6-(methoxymethylthio)-1-hexylchloride, can be prepared by the reaction of the omega-chloro-thiol with bromochloromethane, methanol, and potassium hydroxide, by the method of F. D. Toste and I. W. J. Still, Synlett, 1995, 159. T-Butyldimethylsilyl protected compounds, for example 4-(t-butyldimethylsilylthio)-1-butylhalide, can be prepared from t-butyldimethylchlorosilane, and the corresponding thiol, according to the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,493,044., 149401=Additionally, a wide variety of symmetrically or asymmetrically functional polymers may be produced by reacting the living polymer (II) of Equation 2 above with various functionalizing agents. For example, addition of carbon dioxide (see J.Polym.Sci., Polym.Chem. 30, 2349 (1992)) to polymer (II) would produce a polymer with one protected hydroxyl and one carboxyl group, or the living polymer (II) may be reacted with 1,5 diazabicyclo-(3.1.0) hexane as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,991 to produce a polymer with one protected hydroxyl and one amino group. A polymer with one protected hydroxyl group and one protected amino group can be prepared by reaction of the living anion (II) with a protected amino propyl bromide, see Macromolecules, 23, 939 (1990). Reaction of the living polymer anion (II) with oxetane or substituted oxetanes (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,637) would afford a polymer which contained one protected hydroxyl and a hydroxyl group. A polymer with two protected hydroxyl groups can be prepared by reaction of the living anion (II) with a silicon derived acetal, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,899., 94267=Living anionic polymerization of styrene and diene monomers was first described by Szwarc and his coworkers. See M. Szwarc, Nature 178, 1169 (1956) and M. Szwarc, et al., J.Am.Chem.Soc. 78, 2656 (1956). While living anionic polymerization can be effective for the controlled polymerization of various conjugated unsaturated compounds, such as dienes and alkenylsubstituted aromatic monomers, anionic polymerization of other types of monomers, and in particular olefins such as polyethylene, can be problematic., 139377=Tert-butyldimethylsilyl protecting groups can be removed by treatment of the copolymer with acid, such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, para-toluensulfonic acid, or Dowex\ufffd 50W-X8. Alternatively, a source of fluoride ions, for instance tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride, potassium fluoride and 18-crown-6, or pyridine-hydrofluoric acid complex, can be employed for deprotection of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl protecting groups. Additional methods of deprotection of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl protecting groups can be found in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991, pages 80-83., 95164=Block polystyrene/polyethylene copolymerization has been accomplished with polystyryllithium as the initiator, ethylene and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), followed by termination with methanol. Endo and Otsu, Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1990, 19, 1372. However, this process can result in various side reactions, including early chain termination resulting in olefinic chain ends; metalation of TMEDA resulting in polyethylene with nitrogen-containing chain-ends; chain transfer resulting in an early chain termination and a polystyryllithium-co-polyethylenyllithium., 165838=A 500 ml, three-necked Morton flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 125 ml pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a Claisen adapter fitted with a thermocouple, a reflux condenser, and an argon inlet. This apparatus was dried in an oven overnight at 125\ufffd C., assembled hot, and allowed to cool to room temperature in a stream of argon. Lithium dispersion was washed free of mineral oil with hexane (2\ufffd70 ml), and pentane (1\ufffd70 ml), then dried in a stream of argon. The dry dispersion, 10.57 grams (1.520 moles) was transferred to the flask with 250 ml cyclohexane. Coarse sand, 45.3 grams, was added to the reaction mixture. This suspension was stirred at 600-675 RPMs, and heated to 37\ufffd C. with a heating mantle. The heat source was removed. 1-Chloro-3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propane, 19.64 grams (0.1615 mole) dissolved in 120 ml. Cyclohexane was added dropwise. An exotherm (up to 52\ufffd C.) was detected after 7% of the feed had been added. A dry ice/hexane cooling bath was applied to maintain the reaction temperature at 41\ufffd-44\ufffd C. The total feed time was thirty-two minutes. An exotherm was noted until the last drop of feed was added, then the temperature was maintained at 36\ufffd-40\ufffd C. for an additional thirty minutes. The reaction mixture was then transferred to a sintered glass filter while still warm. The filtration was complete in three minutes with three psi argon pressure. This afforded a hazy suspension. Yield=400 ml, 298.2 grams. Active C--Li=0.361M (0.469 m/kg) at 40\ufffd C. Yield (based on active C--Li=87%., 123865=Anionic polymerizations employing the monofunctional siloxy ether initiators are conducted in an inert solvent, preferably a non-polar solvent, using an olefinic monomer which is an alkenylsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of about 0\ufffd C. to about 100\ufffd C. The polymerization reaction proceeds from initiation to propagation and is finally terminated with appropriate reagents so that the polymer is mono-functionally or di-functionally terminated. The polymers may have a molecular weight range of about 1000 to 10,000 but the molecular weight can be higher. Typically 5 to 50 milli-moles of initiator is used per mole of monomer., 114270=Anionic polymerizations employing the tertiary amine initiators are conducted in an inert solvent, preferably a non-polar solvent, using an olefinic monomer which is an alkenylsubstituted aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of about 0\ufffd C. to about 100\ufffd C. The polymerization reaction proceeds from initiation to propagation and is finally terminated with appropriate reagents so that the polymer is mono-functionally or di-functionally terminated. The polymers may have a molecular weight range of about 1000 to 10,000 but the molecular weight can be higher.

The polymerization reaction proceeds from initiation to propagation and is finally terminated with appropriate reagents so that the polymer is mono-functionally or di-functionally terminated. The polymers may have a molecular weight range of about 1000 to 10,000 but the molecular weight can be higher. Typically 5 to 50 milli-moles of initiator is used per mole of monomer., 157445=The polar functional groups of the polymer chain ends allow the polymers of this invention to alter the surface properties of polymers like polyethylene (including high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene and linear low density polyethylene), polypropylene, polyisobutylene and copolymers and blends thereof. When the polymers of this invention are blended with non-polar polyolefins, the polar functional groups on the chain ends, being incompatible with the non-polar polyolefin, will phase separate and migrate to the surface of the polyolefin. The functional polymers of the invention can be added in amounts ranging from 1 to 25% by weight based on the weight of the polyolefin. Properties such as surface adhesion are thus greatly enhanced, leading to improved adhesion of pigments in printing inks for labels, composite layering, and other adhesive applications. An alternative approach to modification of polymer surfaces to alter properties by introduction of functional groups has been the use of chemical reagents such as alkyllithiums (see, for example, A. J. Dias, K-W Lee, and T. J. McCarthy, Rubber & Plastics News, 18-20, Oct. 31, 1988, and A. J. Dias and T. J. McCarthy, Macromolecules, 20, 1437 (1987).}",

The invention is defined by the following claims, with equivalents of the claims to be included therein. Carboxylation of the block copolymer was similar to the above hydroxylation except that carbon dioxide was used as the functionalizing reagent. Thus, carbon dioxide (flow rate: 4 LPM) was added to the poly(styrene-b-ethenyl)lithium (100 mL, 0.035M, in cyclohexane solution, 3.5 mmol, Mn =1,900 g/mole, PDI=1.10) at room temperature for 2 hours without stirring. After termination by addition of a few mL of HCl (0.1 vol. % of concentrated HCl in methanol), the polymer was precipitated into excess methanol. The polymer was dried in a vacuum oven. Yield of functionalization=47%. Amination of poly(styrene-b-ethenyl)lithium was effected by adding 1-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-1-phenylethylene (10 mL, 0.14M cyclohexane solution, 14.0 mmol, 1.2 molar excess) to poly(styrene-b-ethenyl)lithium (100 mL, 0.035M, in cyclohexane solution, 3.5 mmol Mn =1,900 g/mole, PDI=1.10) in cyclohexane at room temperature. The crossover reaction was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy by observing a peak maximum at 410 nm after addition of 1-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-1-phenylethylene. The reaction mixture was kept at room temperature for 3 days. After termination by addition of a few mL of degassed methanol, the polymer was isolated by precipitation into excess methanol.
