Life Changing Helpful Unfulfilling\u00a0 rate this script \u00a0 INSTALLATION This script is packaged as a vimball. If you have the \"gunzip\" decompressor in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the vimball or via the :UseVimball command. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0vim ReloadScript*.vmb.gz \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0:so % To uninstall, use the :RmVimball command. DEPENDENCIES - Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. install details \u00a0 DESCRIPTION Re-sources a Vim script. The script may use a multiple inclusion guard variable g:loaded_{scriptname} (with {scriptname} having either the same case as specified or all lowercase.) If you specify the bare scriptname (without .vim extension), the script must reside in plugin/{scriptname}.vim somewhere on 'runtimepath'. Otherwise, the passed filespec is interpreted as the file system location of a Vim script and sourced as-is. If you execute :ReloadScript without passing a scriptname, the current buffer is re-sourced. RELATED WORKS - scriptease.vim (vimscript #4394)",
