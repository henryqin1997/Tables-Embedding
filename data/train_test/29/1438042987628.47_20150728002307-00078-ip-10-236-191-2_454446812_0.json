    "textBeforeTable": "Five-year ROIC range: Return on invested capital basically shows you how efficiently a company is converting its debt and equity into profits. We want companies that can do a lot with a little. By looking at the five-year range, we can start to gauge both the power and the consistency of a company's profit engine. Five-year analyst estimates: This column shows us how much EPS growth analysts expect over the next five years. Just keep in mind that analysts tend to grossly overestimate a company's prospects. Five-year EPS growth: Since sales growth means nothing if it doesn't ultimately fall to the bottom line, I've also included each company's five-year trailing EPS growth rate. Five-year sales growth: I rank each company's sales growth, to capture its pure trailing expansion without regard to the vagaries of earnings. Below, I've listed the top sales growers in precious metals and minerals over the last five years. Keep in mind that I rank the gold miners separately. Here's how to interpret each data column. Of course, any company can promise a rosy, growth-rich future. Figuring out which companies can actually deliver is far trickier. In this series, I take the first step by identifying companies that have put up the best growth track records in their respective sectors. The short answer: growth. Companies that can grow their earnings meaningfully could make lofty current P/E ratios look cheap in hindsight. Why are investors willing to pay only 10 times earnings for",
    "textAfterTable": "Source: Capital IQ, a division of Standard & Poor's. NM = not meaningful; EPS growth that is not meaningful results from losses during the period. N/A = not applicable; analyst estimates that are not applicable result from lack of analyst coverage. Use the table above as a first step to help you generate ideas for your own further research. Once you identify stocks worth a closer look, the following three steps will help you further assess their growth prospects: Carefully study the table for possible danger signs, such as high sales growth but low EPS growth, analyst growth expectations significantly trailing past growth, and low ROIC figures. Then follow the trail. Find out how the company achieved its prior growth: organically, or via acquisition? Can it sustain that previous growth? Pay attention to how management plans to implement its growth plans. Does its strategy seem prudent and plausible to you? Looking at the list of miners, we see that only Silver Wheaton and Pan American Silver (though it was slightly unprofitable five years ago) have been able to achieve consistent profitability. It's important to keep in mind that when commodities prices are hot (as they have been), it's a boon to the miners. If we see the commodities markets tank, though, there's danger. And also remember that we also have to look to the operations of the miners themselves. A rising tide lifts all boats, but not if your boat has a hole in it.",
