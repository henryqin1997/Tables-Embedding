The fluffed fibers were mixed with 1 percent by weight maleic anhydride powder based on the oven-dry weight of solids. The samples were each sealed in aluminum foil and heated at a temperature of 108\ufffd C. for 10 minutes. The samples were then redispersed in water, providing 1000 mL each of 2 weight percent solids suspension. Sufficient dilute NaOH was added to each slurry to raise the pH to 10. Each sample was then rinsed twice with distilled water using a Buchner funnel to rinse and dewater the pulp. The pulp samples were then re-slurried to 1000 mL in distilled water.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having now described various aspects of the invention and preferred embodiments thereof, it will be recognized by those of ordinary skill that numerous modifications, variations and substitutions may exist within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. As shown by the foregoing samples, paper samples treated with powdered maleic anhydride (samples 2 and 3) had a significant increase in the carboxyl content compared to untreated samples and compared to samples treated with same amount of maleic anhydride from an acetone solution. In all of the maleic anhydride treated samples, the internal bond strength was reduced which indicated that the curing conditions were beyond the optimum time and temperature for effective treatment with maleic anhydride.

The washed samples were then reacted with calcium acetate to liberate acetic acid and the acetic acid was titrated with HCl to provide the carboxyl content of the pulp. The results of the treatment are given in the following table. In order to compare the effect of",
