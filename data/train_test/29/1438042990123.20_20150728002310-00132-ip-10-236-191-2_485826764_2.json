With a win Friday at Michigan, the Crimson will be 4-1 for the first time since 2004-05. 50/50 Harvard shot 50.9 percent against BYU and 50.0 percent at Holy Cross, marking the first time the Crimson has shot at least 50.0 percent from the field in back-to-back games since Feb. 4-5, 2011 against Princeton and Penn. Harvard last shot 50.0 percent or better in three straight games Jan. 31-Feb. 7, 2004 against Columbia, Penn and Princeton. #MaudeCantMiss Senior co-captain Emma Golen has connected on 12-of-15 three-point attempts (80.0%) to start the season, including a 4-of-4 performance at North Dakota State.

Junior Christine Clark is on pace to become the next Crimson to eclipse the 1,000-point plateau as she has recorded 871 points through two-plus seasons. Including this year, Harvard has had a 1,000 point scorer on the floor in four of the last five seasons.

D-Fence Dating back to last season, the Crimson is 14-1 when holding opponents to less than 60 points and 20-4 when allowing fewer than 70 points. Fabulous Fagbenle Sophomore Temi Fagbenle was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Week on Nov. 12 after averaging 12.5 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 3.0 apg and 2.5 bpg in the first two games of her career. Fagbenle is the first Crimson to earn the award since Christine Clark won it three times in 2010-11, and is the first to take home the first honor of the year since Allison Feaster '98 did so to open the 1994-95 campaign. Double Dipping Temi Fagbenle and Victoria Lippert combined for two double-doubles through the team's first three games. It took the Crimson six games to record its first double-double last season while its second didn't come until game 12. Fagbenle became the first Crimson rookie to register a double-double since Christine Clark's 18-point, 10-rebound performance against Dartmouth on Jan. 15, 2011, and was the first Crimson rookie to do so in her first weekend of action since Hannah Peljto '04 went for 21 points and 10 rebounds in the season opener against St. Peter's on Nov. 17, 2000. 3's are Wild The Crimson went 12-of-26 (46.2%) from beyond the arc on opening night, marking the team's highest three-point percentage\u00a0 with a minimum of 10 attempts since going 14-of-27 (51.9%) against NJIT on Jan. 9, 2011. Harvard's 12 made three's were also a team high dating back to that same matchup with the Highlanders. Welcome to the Show Sophomore Temi Fagbenle made her collegiate debut at North Dakota State, scoring 12 points on 5-of-7 shooting to go with eight rebounds, five assists, three blocks and three steals. Fagbenle's 12 points were the most for a Crimson student-athlete making her debut since Victoria Lippert registered 14 in an 82-81 win over Boston College on Nov. 14, 2009. She also became the first Crimson to lead her team in both rebounding and assists while making her debut since Brogan Berry's '12 10-rebound, five-assist performance against Loyola (Md.) on Nov. 15, 2008. You Can Count on Clark Junior Christine Clark has started all 62 games for the Crimson over the last three years and has scored in double-digits 52 times. This includes a streak of 21 consecutive 10-plus point performances and eight games in which she has scored more than 20 points. The last Crimson student-athlete to start every game of her career was four-time All-Ivy League selection Brogan Berry '12, who holds the program record with 115 starts. Captaining the Ship Seniors Emma Golen and Miriam Rutzen have been voted by their teammates as captains for the 2012-13 season. Golen started 29 games for the Crimson last year, averaging 9.2 points and 5.2 rebounds. Rutzen, meanwhile, started all 30 games and put up 5.5 points with 6.3 boards.
