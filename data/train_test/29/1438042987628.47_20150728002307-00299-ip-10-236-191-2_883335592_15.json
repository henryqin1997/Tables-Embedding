            "Campus Police is has a strong presence on campus and I have never been concerned for my safety. However, although a dry campus alcohol is very prevalent on campus and in campus housing.",
            "Greek life is not the same as at an average university. There is no greek housing. I personally don't care for most of the people in the greek community but, there are some great people. The adviser for Greek life is amazing and he is a great person to talk to for more info his name is Steve Sassamen and he is located in the Student Activities Office.",
            "PAC is an excellent club and sponsors almost all events on campus. there are many clubs on campus and a student can find one that best fits his or her interests.",
            "Each year there is the foam dance party at the end of Welcome Week sponsored by PAC.",
            "Cameron is highly rated for its affordability and quality of education.",
            "PAC along with other organizations usually have events weekly. There is something to do every night. Make sure to get involved early.",
            "The food in the cafeteria is not gross however it is tasteless. The food at the student union is great and I like it alot.",
            "Dorm life is interesting because of the large number of international students along with the large commuter base at the school the dorms at Cameron are very different than those at other schools. If you can afford it I recommend living in the village with people you know and trust.",
            "The difficulty of the academic work varies from professor to professor but overall general education classes have been easy.",
            "Make sure to apply for scholarships specifically the PLUS this scholarship has a firm deadline usually sometime in February.",
            "This university has given me great opportunities through the small class sizes because I have been able to talk to my professors about the subject and asked any questions I may have. I also enjoy the ability to know the faculty at the school. This school has done an excellent job with both their students and professors."

The Aggie RecCenter has an indoor heated swimming pool and facilities for weightlifting, cardiovascular workouts, racquetball, basketball, and other physical activity. As for off-campus attractions, depending on your tastes there's more to do in the Lawton area than there is than in the rest of the land between Dallas and OKC. Nearby Lawton is the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge, which hosts a number of activities throughout the year and is a great place for all sorts of outdoor recreation. Also nearby is Medicine Park, a small resort town-like community that features a variety of shops, restaurants, and come spring 2014 will also host an aquarium and natural sciences center. Lawton (and Medicine Park) are adjacent to Lake Lawtonka, which provides opportunities for fishing, boating, swimming and the like. If museums are more your thing, there's a few in the area; the Museum of the Great Plains, the Ft. Sill Museum, and the Comanche National Museum and Cultural Center., 130737=I live at home. My friends live in the dorms and they say it is very convenient for them. Their class is 8:00 A.M, they get up at 7:50. Pretty quick traveling, if you ask me. Get the most rest that way, I would think! But, they do mention that sometimes, there are parties on the same floor, or floor above them who do make the sleeping process hard., 69489=Make sure to apply for scholarships specifically the PLUS this scholarship has a firm deadline usually sometime in February., 157437=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 20473=Be sure to look into financial aid like a federal Pell Grant or Cameron University's General Scholarship. You can cut your fees almost in half this way. Be sure to apply for the general scholarship early! The initial deadline tends to be in the spring, around February. They only consider applicants after this point if they still have money left to award.}",

It is also a good school for those who want to teach, any grade, and it is also good for those seeking a job in the criminal justice field. Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to contact the advisers and ask all the questions you want because they won't make you feel stupid. The advisers are very willing to make an appointment with you so that you can get your questions one on one. Bang for the buck Almost all classes are updated every few semesters so all the information is pretty current. A few of the professors are on the state licensing boards so that if you continue your education, you will be well versed",
