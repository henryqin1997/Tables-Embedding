    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in terms of the presently preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the disclosure is not to be interpreted as limiting. Various alterations and modifications will no doubt become apparent to those skilled in the art after having read the above disclosure. Accordingly, it is intended that the appended claims be interpreted as covering all alterations and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Carrier phase errors from correlator 20 are observed during the time the receiver dwells on the master antenna, to determine if an aliasing condition exists. In a step 70 (check for aliasing) such a determination is made on the basis of measurements averaged over several antenna switch periods, rather than just a few, to compensate for receiver noise. If aliasing is detected, the signal tracking is corrected before resuming normal operation. In a step 72 (collect data) the antenna switching in step 54 is scheduled such that the master antenna 12 always catches at least some part of each data bit received from all the GPS satellites being tracked. These parts are integrated and each received data bit is stored in a buffer. The data modulation on the GPS signals corresponds to a sign reversal or 180\ufffd phase shift (half-cycle) of the GPS carrier. Therefore, each carrier tracking loop step 58 and differential phase loop step 60 or 62",
