These embodiments, however, are merely for example and the invention is not restricted thereto or limited thereby. Thus, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that other variations and modifications can easily be made within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims, thus it is only intended that the present invention be limited by the following claims. Thereafter, rotation of the vertical drive mechanism 275 will cause the shaft 277 of the vertical drive mechanism 275 to threadedly engage the threaded region 114 of the holder assembly 100. Resulting in vertical movement of the supporting structure 260 with respect to the holder assembly 100, and thus, vertically move the spinal rod 15, which is indirectly connected to the supporting structure 260, into the U-shaped channel 22 formed in the bone fastener 10. The spinal rod 15 may thereafter be fixed in the U-shaped channel 22 by a closure cap. In one method of use, once the bone fastener 10 has been securely engaged to a patient's vertebra, the longitudinal spinal rod 15 may be aligned with and introduced into the U-shaped channel 22 formed in the head 24 of the bone fastener 10 by use of the spinal rod insertion instrument 50 as follows. The holder assembly 100 may be first attached to the",
