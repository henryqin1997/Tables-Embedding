    "textBeforeTable": "About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Pro colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Pro plastic in general - it starts out being slightly less overstable. Pro discs are more durable than DX. They provide more grip than Champion. They provide more glide than DX, Champion and Star. They retain flight characteristics longer than DX. They range from firm to extremely soft and flexible. Speed 13, Glide 5, Turn -3, Fade 3 Champion Katanas have slightly different flight characteristics at 13, 5 ,-3, 3. It is great for fast, long, easy distance off the tee and for huge turnover shots. The Innova Pro Katana is a distance driver that is straight. It was built with the finesse thrower in mind. It's a recommended downwind driver. If you hit the angle right, watch it bolt out of sight. The physical characteristics resemble a Boss with flight characteristics of a Sidewinder on steroids. Makes a good roller.

    "textAfterTable": "\"Possibly my favorite out-of-the-box high-speed driver. It takes a while to turn over and glides really well. Recently, this 52 year old 3'd a 780' hole from 45' behind the pin with 2 Pro Katana drives. I'd say the disc works pretty well.\" - Gregg Hosfeld Write a review Rating: Bad \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Good Your Name: Your Review: Note: HTML is not translated!
