    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{94807=In 1940, Billboard began publishing its modern pop charts, which included the Best Selling Retail Records chart, the precursor to the Hot 100. None of Holiday's songs placed on the modern pop charts, partly because Billboard only published the first ten slots of the charts in some issues. Minor hits and independent releases had no way of being spotlighted., 31552=By March 1938, Shaw and Holiday had been broadcast on New York City's powerful radio station WABC (the original WABC, now WCBS). Because of their success, they were given an extra time slot to broadcast in April, which increased their exposure. The New York Amsterdam News reported an improvement in Holiday's performance ability while reviewing the broadcasts. Metronome reported that the addition of Holiday to Shaw's band put it in the \"top brackets\". Holiday could not sing as often during Artie Shaw's shows as she could Basie's. The songs were more instrumental with fewer vocals. Shaw was also pressured to hire a white singer, Nita Bradley, with whom Holiday did not get along but had to share a bandstand. In May 1938, Shaw won band battles against Tommy Dorsey and Red Norvo with the audience favoring Holiday. Although Shaw admired Holiday's singing in his band, saying she had a \"remarkable ear\" and an \"remarkable sense of time\", her time in the band was nearing an end.[32], 71620=To accompany her autobiography, Holiday released an LP in June 1956 entitled Lady Sings the Blues. The album featured four new tracks, \"Lady Sings the Blues\" (title track), \"Too Marvelous for Words\", \"Willow Weep for Me\", and \"I Thought About You\", as well as eight new recordings of Holiday's biggest hits to date. The re-recordings included \"Trav'lin' Light\" \"Strange Fruit\" and \"God Bless the Child\".[82] On December 22, 1956, Billboard magazine reviewed Lady Sings the Blues, calling it a worthy musical complement to her autobiography. \"Holiday is in good voice now,\" said the reviewer, \"and these new readings will be much appreciated by her following.\" \"Strange Fruit\" and \"God Bless the Child\" were called classics, and \"Good Morning Heartache\", another reissued track in the LP, was also noted positively.[83], 52848=By the late 1940s, Holiday had begun recording a number of slow, sentimental ballads. Metronome expressed its concerns in 1946 about \"Good Morning Heartache,\" saying \"there's a danger that Billie's present formula will wear thin, but up to now it's wearing well.\"[39] The New York Herald Tribune reported of a concert in 1946 that her performance had little variation in melody and no change in tempo.[62], 46241=Holiday asked Gabler for strings on the recording. They were associated with Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. \"I went on my knees to him,\" Holiday said. \"I didn't want to do it with the ordinary six pieces. I begged Milt and told him I had to have strings behind me.\"[55] On October 4, 1944, Holiday entered the studio to record \"Lover Man\" and saw the string ensemble and walked out. The musical director, Toots Camarata said she was overwhelmed with joy.[55] She may also have wanted strings to avoid comparisons between her commercially successful early work with Teddy Wilson and everything produced afterwards. Her 1930s recordings with Wilson used a small jazz combo; recordings with Decca often involved strings.[55], 65564=In 1948, Holiday played at the Ebony Club, which, because she lost her cabaret card, was against the law. Her manager, John Levy, was convinced he could get her card back and allowed her to open without one. \"I opened scared,\" Holiday said, \"[I was] expecting the cops to come in any chorus and carry me off. But nothing happened. I was a huge success.\"[77], 95659=On October 24, 1942, Billboard began issuing its R&B charts. Two of Holiday's songs placed on the chart, \"Trav'lin' Light\" with Paul Whiteman, which topped the chart, and \"Lover Man\", which reached number 5., 47459=A month later, in November, Holiday returned to Decca to record \"That Ole Devil Called Love\", \"Big Stuff\", and \"Don't Explain\". She wrote \"Don't Explain\" after she caught her husband, Jimmy Monroe, with lipstick on his collar.[56], 92628=In July 1936, Holiday began releasing sides under her own name. These songs were released under the band name \"Billie Holiday & Her Orchestra.\"[100] Most noteworthy, the popular jazz standard \"Summertime,\" sold well and was listed on the available pop charts at the time at number 12, the first time the jazz standard charted under any artist. Only Billy Stewart's R&B version of \"Summertime\" reached a higher chart placement than Holiday's, charting at number 10 thirty years later in 1966.[101], 25315=Hammond spoke about the commercial impact of the Teddy Wilson-Billie Holiday sides from 1935 to 1938, calling them a great asset to Brunswick. The record label, according to Hammond, was broke and unable to record many jazz tunes. Because Wilson, Holiday, Lester Young, and other musicians came into the studio without any arrangements, which cost money, and improvised the material as they went along, the records they produced were very cheap. Holiday was never given any royalties for her work, instead being paid a flat fee, which saved the record label money. Some of the records produced were largely successful, such as the single \"I Cried for You\" which sold 15,000 copies. Hammond said of the record, \"15,000 ... was a giant hit for Brunswick in those days. I mean a giant hit. Most records that made money sold around three to four thousand.\" [24], 32915=In November 1938 Holiday was asked to use the service elevator at the Lincoln Hotel, instead of the passenger elevator, because white patrons of the hotels complained. This may have been the last straw for her. She left the band shortly after. Holiday spoke about the incident weeks later, saying \"I was never allowed to visit the bar or the dining room as did other members of the band ... [and] I was made to leave and enter through the kitchen.\", 42245=\"God Bless the Child\" became Holiday's most popular and covered record. It reached number 25 on the charts in 1941 and was third in Billboard's songs of the year, selling over a million records.[44][45] In 1976, the song was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame.[46] Herzog claimed Holiday contributed only a few lines to the lyrics. He said Holiday came up with the line \"God Bless the Child\" from a dinner conversation the two had had.[47], 29636=By February of that year, Holiday was no longer singing for Basie. The reason given for her firing varies from person to person. Jimmy Rushing, Basie's male vocalist, called her unprofessional. According to All Music Guide, Holiday was officially fired for being \"temperamental and unreliable\". Holiday complained of low pay and working conditions and may have refused to sing the tunes requested of her or change her style.[29], 60353=On March 27, 1948, Holiday played Carnegie Hall to a sold-out crowd. There were 2,700 tickets sold in advance, a record at the time for the venue. Her popularity was unusual because she didn't have a current hit record.[69] Her last hit was \"Lover Man\" in 1945, her last on the record charts. Holiday sang 32 songs at the Carnegie concert by her count, including Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\" and her 30s hit, \"Strange Fruit\". During the show, someone sent Holiday a box of gardenias. \"My old trademark,\" Holiday said. \"I took them out of box and fastened them smack to the side of my head without even looking twice.\" There was a hatpin in the gardenias and Holiday, unknowingly, stuck it into the side of her head. \"I didn't feel anything until the blood started rushing down in my eyes and ears,\" she said. After the third curtain call, she passed out.[70], 66200=In 1950, Holiday appeared in the Universal-International short film Sugar Chile Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet, singing \"God Bless the Child\" and \"Now, Baby or Never\".[78], 77119=The critic Nat Hentoff of Down Beat magazine, who attended the Carnegie Hall concert, wrote the remainder of the sleeve notes on the 1961 album. He wrote of Holiday's performance:, 93499=Holiday had 16 best selling songs in 1937, making the year her most commercially successful. It was in this year that Holiday scored her sole number one hit as a featured vocalist on the available pop charts of the 1930s, \"Carelessly\". The hit \"I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm\", was also recorded by Ray Noble, Glen Gray and Fred Astaire whose rendering was a best seller for weeks.[102] Holiday's version ranked 6 on the year-end single chart available for 1937.[44], 62059=Holiday was arrested again on January 22, 1949, in her room at San Francisco's Hotel Mark Twain., 95256=\"God Bless the Child\", which went on to sell over a million copies, ranked number 3 on Billboard's year-end top songs of 1941.[45], 101142=Billie Holiday was posthumously inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\", 18398=In Harlem she started singing in various night clubs. Holiday took her professional pseudonym from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father.[3] At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \"Halliday\", the birth surname of her father, but eventually changed it to \"Holiday\", his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, tenor sax player Kenneth Hollan. From 1929 to 1931, they were a team, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, Pod's and Jerry's on 133rd Street, and the Brooklyn Elks' Club.[15][16] Benny Goodman recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at The Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, Holiday played at many clubs, including Mexico's and The Alhambra Bar and Grill where Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with Chick Webb, first met her. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing with Fletcher Henderson's band.[17], 84285=Gilbert Millstein of The New York Times, who had been the narrator at Billie Holiday's 1956 Carnegie Hall concerts and had partly written the sleeve notes for the album The Essential Billie Holiday (see above), described her death in these same 1961-dated sleeve notes:, 81583=By early 1959 Holiday had cirrhosis of the liver. She stopped drinking on doctor's orders, but soon relapsed.[87] By May she had lost 20 pounds (9\u00a0kg). Friends, jazz critic Leonard Feather, her manager Joe Glaser, and photojournalist and editor Allan Morrison unsuccessfully tried to get her to a hospital.[88], 24558=Another frequent accompanist was the tenor saxophonist Lester Young, who had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and with whom Holiday had a special rapport. He said: \"Well, I think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know. Some time I'd sit down and listen to 'em myself, and it sound like two of the same voices, if you don't be careful, you know, or the same mind, or something like that.\"[23] Young nicknamed her \"Lady Day\", and she, in turn, dubbed him \"Prez\"., 73448=On November 10, 1956, Holiday performed two concerts before packed audiences at Carnegie Hall, a major accomplishment for any artist, especially a black artist of the segregated period of American history. Live recordings of the second Carnegie Hall concert were released on a Verve/HMV album in the UK in late 1961 called The Essential Billie Holiday. The thirteen tracks included on this album featured her own songs, \"I Love My Man\", \"Don't Explain\" and \"Fine and Mellow\", together with other songs closely associated with her, including \"Body and Soul\", \"My Man\", and \"Lady Sings the Blues\" (her lyrics accompanied a tune by pianist Herbie Nichols).[84], 35344=Holiday was recording for Columbia in the late 1930s when she was introduced to \"Strange Fruit\", a song based on a poem about lynching written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx. Meeropol used the pseudonym \"Lewis Allan\" for the poem, which was set to music and performed at teachers' union meetings.[35] It was eventually heard by Barney Josephson, proprietor of Caf\u00e9 Society, an integrated nightclub in Greenwich Village, who introduced it to Holiday. She performed it at the club in 1939, with some trepidation, fearing possible retaliation. Holiday later said that the imagery in \"Strange Fruit\" reminded her of her father's death and that this played a role in her resistance to performing it.[36], 82219=On May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York with liver and heart disease. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics, under the order of Harry J. Anslinger, had been targeting Holiday since at least 1939.[89] She was arrested and handcuffed for drug possession as she lay dying, and her hospital room was raided.[89] Police guarded her room. Holiday continued staying under police guard. On July 15, she received the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church,[90] before dying two days later from pulmonary edema and heart failure caused by cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959, at 3:10 am.[91][92] In her final years, she had been progressively swindled out of her earnings, and she died with $0.70 in the bank and $750 (a tabloid fee) on her person. Her funeral mass was at Church of St. Paul the Apostle in New York City on July 21, 1959. She was buried at Saint Raymond's Cemetery., 17301=By early 1929, Holiday joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. Holiday's mother became a prostitute and, within a matter of days of arriving in New York, Holiday, who had not yet turned fourteen, also became a prostitute at $5 a client.[14] On May 2, 1929, the house was raided, and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending some time in a workhouse, her mother was released in July, followed by Holiday in October, at the age of 14., 64230=The Cabaret system started in 1940 and was to prevent people of \"bad character\" from working on licensed premises. A performer had to renew the license every two years. This lasted until 1967.[73] Clubs that sold alcohol in New York were among the highest paying in the country. Club owners knew blacklisted performers had limited work and could offer a smaller salary. This reduced Holiday's earnings. She had not received proper royalties until she joined Decca, so her main revenue was club concerts. The problem worsened when Holiday's records went out of print in the 1950s. She seldom received royalties in her later years. For instance, in 1958 she received a royalty of only 11 dollars.[74][75] Her lawyer in the late 1950s, Earle Warren Zaidins, did not register with BMI on all but two songs she had written or co-written, costing her revenue.[76], 14815=Sadie Harris, then known as Sadie Fagan, married Philip Gough, but the marriage was over in two years. Holiday was left with Martha Miller again while her mother took more transportation jobs.[9] Holiday frequently skipped school and her truancy resulted in her being brought before the juvenile court on January 5, 1925, when she was nine years old. She was sent to The House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic reform school. She was baptized there on March 19, 1925. After nine months in care, she was \"paroled\" on October 3, 1925, to her mother, who had opened a restaurant called the East Side Grill, where she and Holiday worked long hours. By the age of 11, Holiday had dropped out of school.[10], 66054=Holiday recorded Gershwin's \"I Loves You, Porgy\" in 1948., 47996=Holiday did not return to the studio until August 1945. She recorded \"Don't Explain\" for a second time, changing the lyrics \"I know you raise Cain\" to \"Just say you'll remain\" and \"You mixed with some dame\" to \"What is there to gain?\" Other songs recorded were \"Big Stuff\", \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\", and \"You Better Go Now\". Ella Fitzgerald named \"You Better Go Now\" as her favorite Holiday recording.[57] \"Big Stuff\" and \"Don't Explain\" were recorded again but with additional strings and a viola., 13582=Holiday had a difficult childhood. Her mother often took what were then known as \"transportation jobs\", serving on passenger railroads. Holiday was left to be raised largely by Eva Miller's mother-in-law, Martha Miller, and suffered from her mother's absences and being left in others' care for much of the first ten years of her life.[7] Holiday's autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, first published in 1956, was sketchy on details of her early life, but much was confirmed by Stuart Nicholson in his 1995 biography of the singer. Some historians have disputed Holiday's paternity, as a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives lists the father as a man named Frank DeViese. Other historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker.[8] DeViese lived in Philadelphia and Sadie Harris may have known him through her work., 50656=In September 1946, Holiday began her only major film New Orleans. She starred opposite Louis Armstrong and Woody Herman. Plagued by racism and McCarthyism, producer Jules Levey and script writer Herbert Biberman were pressed to lessen Holiday's and Armstrong's roles to avoid the impression that black people created jazz. The attempts failed because in 1947 Biberman was listed as one of the Hollywood Ten and sent to jail.[59], 63965=Holiday's New York City Cabaret Card was revoked because of her 1947 conviction, preventing her working anywhere that sold alcohol for the remaining 12 years of her life., 61663=On April 27, 1948, Bob Sylvester and her promoter Al Wilde arranged a Broadway show for her. Titled Holiday on Broadway, it sold out. \"The regular music critics and drama critics came and treated us like we were legit,\" she said. But it closed after three weeks.[71], 33386=There are no surviving live recordings of Holiday with Artie Shaw's band. Because she was under a separate recording label and possibly because of her race, Holiday was only able to record one record with Shaw, \"Any Old Time\". However, Artie Shaw played clarinet in four songs recorded in New York the 10th of July 1936: \"Did I Remember?\", \"No Regrets\", \"Summertime\" and \"Billie's Blues.\", 39637=Holiday soon returned to Commodore in 1944, recording songs she made with Teddy Wilson in the 1930s like \"I Cover The Waterfront\", \"I'll Get By\", and \"He's Funny That Way\". She also recorded new songs that were popular at the time, including, \"My Old Flame\", \"How Am I To Know?\", \"I'm Yours\", and \"I'll Be Seeing You\", a Bing Crosby number one hit. She also recorded her version of \"Embraceable You\", which would later be inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2005., 67786=Holiday first toured Europe in 1954 as part of a Leonard Feather package. The Swedish impresario, Nils Hellstrom, initiated the \"Jazz Club U.S.A.\" (after the Leonard Feather radio show) tour starting in Stockholm in January 1954 and then Germany, Netherlands, Paris and Switzerland. The tour party was Holiday, Buddy DeFranco, Red Norvo, Carl Drinkard, Elaine Leighton, Sonny Clark, Berryl Booker, Jimmy Raney, and Red Mitchell. A recording of a live set in Germany was released as Lady Love - Billie Holiday.[79], 63324=In October 1949, Holiday recorded \"Crazy He Calls Me\", which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2010. Gabler said the hit was her most successful recording for Decca after \"Lover Man\". The charts of the 1940s did not list songs outside the top 30, making it impossible to recognize minor hits. By the late 1940s, despite her popularity and concert power, her singles were little played on radio, perhaps because of her reputation.[72], 63053=Holiday said she began using hard drugs in the early 1940s. She married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. While still married, she became involved with trumpeter Joe Guy, who was her drug dealer. She divorced Monroe in 1947 and also split with Guy., 44244=Milt Gabler became an A&R man for Decca Records as well as owning Commodore Records, and he signed Holiday to the label on August 7, 1944, when she was 29.[51] Her first recording for Decca was \"Lover Man\" (#16 Pop, No.\u00a05 R&B), one of her biggest hits. The success and distribution of the song made Holiday a staple in the pop community, leading to solo concerts, rare for jazz singers in the late 40s. Gabler said: \"I made Billie a real pop singer. That was right in her. Billie loved those songs.\"[52] Jimmy Davis and Roger \"Ram\" Ramirez, \"Lover Man\"'s songwriters, had tried to interest Holiday in the song in .[53] In 1943, a flamboyant male torch singer, Willie Dukes, began singing \"Lover Man\" on 52nd Street.[54] Because of his success, Holiday added it to her shows. The record's other side was \"No More\", one of her favorites.[51], 89258=Frank Sinatra was influenced by her performances on 52nd Street as a young man. He told Ebony in 1958 about her impact:, 50304=In 1946, Holiday recorded \"Good Morning Heartache\". Although the song failed to chart, it remained in her live shows, with three known live recordings.[58], 86733=Holiday's delivery made her performances recognizable throughout her career. Her improvisation compensated for lack of musical education. Her voice lacked range and was thin, and years of drug use altered its texture and gave it a fragile, raspy sound. Holiday said that she always wanted her voice to sound like an instrument and some of her influences were Louis Armstrong and singer Bessie Smith.[94][full citation needed] Her last major recording, a 1958 album entitled Lady in Satin, features the backing of a 40-piece orchestra conducted and arranged by Ray Ellis, who said of the album in 1997:, 79554=When Holiday returned to Europe almost five years later in 1959, she made one of her last television appearances for Granada's Chelsea at Nine in London. Her final studio recordings were made for MGM in 1959, with lush backing from Ray Ellis and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on Columbia's Lady in Satin album the previous year\u2014see below. The MGM sessions were released posthumously on a self-titled album, later re-titled and re-released as Last Recordings., 96680=Billie Holiday recorded extensively for four labels: Columbia Records, issued on its subsidiary labels Brunswick Records, Vocalion Records, and OKeh Records, from 1933 through 1942; Commodore Records in 1939 and 1944; Decca Records from 1944 through 1950; briefly for Aladdin Records in 1951; Verve Records and on its earlier imprint Clef Records; from 1952 through 1957, then again for Columbia Records from 1957 to 1958 and finally for MGM Records in 1959. Many of Holiday's recordings appeared on 78 rpm records prior to the long-playing vinyl record era, and only Clef, Verve, and Columbia issued Holiday albums during her lifetime that were not compilations of previously released material. Many compilations have been issued since her death; as well as comprehensive box sets and live recordings.[104][105], 112596=Over the years, there have been many tributes to Billie Holiday, including \"The Day Lady Died\", a 1959 poem by Frank O'Hara, and Langston Hughes' poem \"Song for Billie Holiday\"., 69736=Holiday's autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, was ghostwritten by William Dufty and published in 1956. Dufty, a New York Post writer and editor then married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty, wrote the book quickly from a series of conversations with the singer in the Duftys' 93rd Street apartment. He drew on the work of earlier interviewers as well and intended to let Holiday tell her story in her own way.[80], 36667=When Holiday's producers at Columbia found the subject matter too sensitive, Milt Gabler agreed to record it for his Commodore Records. That was done on April 20, 1939, and \"Strange Fruit\" remained in her repertoire for twenty years. She later recorded it again for Verve. While the Commodore release did not get any airplay, the controversial song sold well, though Gabler attributed that mostly to the record's other side, \"Fine and Mellow\", which was a jukebox hit.[37] \"The version I recorded for Commodore,\" Holiday said of \"Strange Fruit,\" \"became my biggest-selling record.[38] \"Strange Fruit\" was the equivalent of a top twenty hit in the 1930s., 16214=Holiday's mother returned to their home on December 24, 1926, to discover a neighbor, Wilbur Rich, attempting to rape Billie, but failing. She fought back. Rich was arrested. Officials placed Billie in the House of the Good Shepherd under protective custody as a state witness in the rape case.[11] Holiday was released in February 1927, nearly twelve. She found a job running errands in a brothel.[12] During this time, Holiday first heard the records of Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. By the end of 1928, Holiday's mother decided to try her luck in Harlem, New York, and left Holiday again with Martha Miller.[13], 21552=In 1935, Billie Holiday had a small role as a woman being abused by her lover in Duke Ellington's short Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life. In her scene, she sang the song \"Saddest Tale.\"[20], 80292=On March 28, 1957, Holiday married Louis McKay, a Mafia enforcer. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive,[86] but he did try to get her off drugs. They were separated at the time of her death, but McKay had plans to start a chain of Billie Holiday vocal studios, \u00e0 la Arthur Murray dance schools., 26752=In late 1937, Holiday had a brief stint as a big band vocalist with Count Basie.[25] The traveling conditions of the band were often poor and included one-nighters in clubs, moving from city to city with little stability. Holiday chose the songs she sang and had a hand in the arrangements, choosing to portray her then developing persona of a woman unlucky in love. Her tunes included \"I Must Have That Man\", \"Travelin' All Alone\", \"I Can't Get Started\", and \"Summertime\", a hit for Holiday in 1936, originating in the opera Porgy and Bess a few years earlier. Count Basie had gotten used to Holiday's heavy involvement in the band. He said, \"When she rehearsed with the band, it was really just a matter of getting her tunes like she wanted them, because she knew how she wanted to sound and you couldn't tell her what to do.\"[26], 70500=In his 2015 study, Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth, John Szwed argues that Lady Sings the Blues is a generally accurate account of her life, and that co-writer Dufty was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. \"In particular, Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book\u2014with Charles Laughton, in the nineteen-thirties, and with Tallulah Bankhead, in the late nineteen-forties\u2014and of one relationship that\u2019s sharply diminished in the book, her affair with Orson Welles around the time of Citizen Kane,\" according to reviewer Richard Brody.[81], 59083=Holiday was released early (March 16, 1948) because of good behavior. When she arrived at Newark, her pianist Bobby Tucker and her dog Mister were waiting. The dog leaped at Holiday, knocking off her hat, and tackled her to the ground. \"He began lapping me and loving me like crazy,\" she said. A woman thought the dog was attacking Holiday. She screamed, a crowd gathered, and reporters arrived. \"I might just as well have wheeled into Penn Station and had a quiet little get-together with the Associated Press, United Press, and International News Service,\" she said.[68], 20225=By the end of 1932 at the age of 17, Billie Holiday replaced the singer Monette Moore at a club called Covan's on West 132nd Street. The producer John Hammond, who loved Monette Moore's singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday in early 1933.[18] Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut, at age 18, in November 1933 with Benny Goodman, singing two songs: \"Your Mother's Son-In-Law\" and \"Riffin' the Scotch,\" the latter being her first hit. \"Son-in-Law\" sold 300 copies, but \"Riffin' the Scotch,\" released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was quite impressed by Holiday's singing style. He said of her, \"Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I'd come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius.\" Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at her young age.[19], 94472=In 1939, Holiday recorded her biggest selling record, \"Strange Fruit\" for Commodore, charting at number 16 on the available pop charts for the 1930s.[103], 33837=By the late 1930s, Billie Holiday had toured with Count Basie and Artie Shaw, scored a string of radio and retail hits with Teddy Wilson, and became an established artist in the recording industry. Her songs \"What A Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Easy Living\" were being imitated by singers across America and were quickly becoming jazz standards.[33] In 1938, Holiday's single \"I'm Gonna Lock My Heart\" ranked 6th as the most-played song for September of that year. Her record label Vocalion listed the single as its fourth best seller for the same month. \"I'm Gonna Lock My Heart\" peaked at number 2 on the pop charts according to Joel Whitburn's \"Pop Memories: 1890\u20131954\" book.[34], 43926=In September 1943, Life wrote: \"She has the most distinct style of any popular vocalist and is imitated by other vocalists.\"[50], 5149=Billie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagan;[2][3] April 7, 1915\u00a0\u2013 July 17, 1959)[4] was an American jazz singer and songwriter., 55078=By 1947, Holiday was at her commercial peak, having made 250,000 dollars in the three previous years.[63] Holiday came 2nd in the Down Beat poll for 1946 and 1947, her highest ranking in the poll.[64] She came 5th on July 6, 1947 in Billboard's annual college poll of \"girl singers\". Jo Stafford came first.[65] In 1946, Holiday won the Metronome Magazine popularity poll.[66], 104242=The Grammy Award for Best Historical Album has been presented since 1979., 28028=Holiday found herself in direct competition with popular singer Ella Fitzgerald, with whom Holiday would later become friends.[27] Fitzgerald was the vocalist for the Chick Webb Band, who were in competition with Count Basie. On January 16, 1938, the same day that Benny Goodman performed his legendary Carnegie Hall jazz concert, the Count Basie and Chick Webb bands had a battle at the Savoy Ballroom. Chick Webb and Fitzgerald were declared winners by Metronome magazine. Down Beat magazine declared Holiday and Basie the winners. A straw poll of the audience saw Fitzgerald win by a three-to-one margin., 43177=On June 24, 1942, Holiday recorded \"Trav'lin Light\" with Paul Whiteman for a new label, Capitol Records. Because she was under contract with Columbia, she used the pseudonym \"Lady Day.\"[48] The song reached 23 on the pop charts and number one on the R&B charts, then called the Harlem Hit Parade.[49], 91025=In 1986, Joel Whitburn's Record Research, Inc. company compiled information on the popularity of record releases from the pre-rock and roll era and created pop charts dating all the way back to the beginning of the commercial recording industry. The company's findings were published in the book Pop Memories 1890\u20131954. Several of Holiday's records are listed on the pop charts Whitburn created.[97], 57872=On May 16, 1947, she was arrested for possessing narcotics in her New York apartment. On May 27, 1947, she was in court. \"It was called 'The United States of America versus Billie Holiday'. And that's just the way it felt,\" she recalled.[67] During the trial, Holiday heard that her lawyer would not come to the trial to represent her. \"In plain English that meant no one in the world was interested in looking out for me,\" she said. Dehydrated and unable to hold down food, she pleaded guilty and asked to be sent to the hospital. The district attorney spoke in her defense, saying, \"If your honor please, this is a case of a drug addict, but more serious, however, than most of our cases, Miss Holiday is a professional entertainer and among the higher rank as far as income was concerned.\" At the end of the trial, Holiday was sentenced to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia, popularly known as \"Camp Cupcake\".}",
