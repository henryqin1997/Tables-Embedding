Recently a new parking lot was added, and though it has less parking spaces, there are plans for many more, as well as new/nicer buildings, finished by approx. 2016. There is a four-story library that has a bagel shop, so students and faculty may munch and read. There is ample seating area with some of the most comfortable chairs on campus. There are many places to eat, including healthy choices such as Subway and Chik-Fil-A. As well as these amazing things, however, are the excellent academic programs. There are qualified teachers in every department, and the undergraduate catalog includes a vast variety of majors, minors, and concentrations.
