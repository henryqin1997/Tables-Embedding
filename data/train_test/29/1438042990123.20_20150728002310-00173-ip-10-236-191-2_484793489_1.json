If I were to rat So, in recognition of the movie version of this novel being out currently, I decided to finally read my second-ever John Green novel. If I were to rate it solely on its quality and comparison to other YA novels available, it would definitely be a 4-star read. If I rate it based on my enjoyment of it, however, it would be a 3-star read. Combined, you get my 3.5 rating. For me, it's just too difficult to read anything from John Green and separate it from the author and his persona and the fandom that surrounds him (most of which I like and appreciate, btw). Because of this, though, I couldn't stop thinking things like, \"Oh, this is like his other novels because...\" or \"Gee, that sounds like John Green rhapsodizing on something philosophical instead of a teen.\" And due to those factors, it was hard to step back, read it for what it was, and enjoy the book by itself. ...more",
