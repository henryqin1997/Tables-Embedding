    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{86532=Next the two handle halves 920 and 922 are joined together, either by mechanically snapping the two members together or by gluing or welding the two members together, so that their peripheral walls come together to form a single handle with a hollow interior, access being had to the interior via front opening 996 and bottom through-holes 958A, 958B. More specifically, when the two halves 920 and 922 come together, rods 978 seat in hollow posts 1006, posts 1002 are positioned so that they reside adjacent the generally arcuately-shaped rises 978A, 978B, needle-retaining fingers 1008A, 1008B extend through the through-holes 950A, 950B, respectively, so that the upper portions of fingers 1008A, 1008B extend into the needle-receiving, generally arcuate recesses 940A, 940B, and strut 980 engages flange 1016. It is to be appreciated that when the two halves 920 and 922 are brought together in the foregoing manner so as to form the complete handle member 906, strut 980 will engage and releasably hold the suture to flexible flange 1016. It is also to be appreciated that when the two halves 920 and 922 are brought together in the foregoing manner so as to form the complete handle member 906, rear openings 962 and 982 are aligned with one another so as to form a single opening extending completely through the handle member. As noted previously, due to the reduced perimeter wall height at 994A (FIG. 23), a slot 997 (FIG. 19) is created (when the two handle members are joined together) which permits access to the interior of the complete handle member. Slot 997 is sized so as to be capable of passing a suture therethrough, and extends between front opening 996 and bottom openings 958A and 958B (FIG. 19)., 83140=Looking next at FIGS. 20, 23 and 23B, member 922 also includes a plurality of openings 1010 which extend completely through member 922 and a plurality of suture-retaining flanges 1012 which extend from peripheral wall 994 or center wall 1004 and substantially overlie openings 1010. Flanges 1012 are spaced slightly above the floor 992 of member 922 such that suture can be slipped beneath flanges 1012 and will remain there until subjected to a pulling action, whereupon the sutures can be pulled free of the flanges., 91843=When the surgeon is ready to use the surgical needles 225A, 225B to suture tissue to the bone, needled cover 1018 is forced backwards along handle member 906, causing the cover's stop member 1028 to slip out of the handle's surface recess 986 and out of through-hole 988. Needle cover 1018 slips backwards along handle 906 until the cover's stop member 1028 slips into the handle's rear surface recess 990 (FIG. 20), whereupon further rearward movement of the needle cover is impeded. It is to be appreciated that when the needle cover's stop member 1028 is in engagement with the handle's rear surface recess 990 (FIG. 25), the needles 225A, 225B in needle recesses 940A, 940B will be exposed., 89522=Finally, needle cover 1018 is slipped over the rear end of the assembled handle. Needle cover 1018 is forced forward along the handle until the needle cover's left wall 1020 engages the handle's surface stop 964, whereupon forward movement of the needle cover is impeded. At this point the needle cover completely covers the needles 225A, 225B which are contained within needle recesses 940A, 940B. It is to be appreciated that when needle cover 1018 is in engagement with handle stop 964, the needle cover's inclined stop member 1028 will rest in the handle member's surface recess 986, centered in through-hole 988, whereby needle cover 1018 will be releasably captured in the foregoing position., 85698=Next, an intermediate portion 210 of the suture is passed into the interior of member 922 via front opening 996 so that it passes over flange 1016, to the outside of suture guide wall 1000, under a pair of flanges 1012 and across elongated slot 984 before doubling back adjacent center wall 1004 and under another flange 1012, around the front of center wall 1004, and under another flange 1012. At the rear of member 922 the suture is doubled back again toward the front of the member, back under another pair of flanges 1012. Due to the spacing between flanges 1012 and handle floor 992, suture 205 will be releasably held to handle member 922., 83834=Looking next at FIGS. 18-21, suture anchor installation tool 902 also includes a needle cover 1018 which includes a left wall 1020, a right wall 1022, a top wall 1024 and a bottom wall 1026. Needle cover 1018 is sized so that it will make a close sliding fit over the outside surfaces of the complete handle 906. An inclined stop member 1028 is positioned on the inside rear portion of right wall 1022. Stop member 1028 is adapted to engage recesses 986 and 990 of the handle's right member 922 when needle cover 1018 is slidably fitted over the combined handle member 906, as will hereinafter be described in further detail., 96240=Furthermore, the installation tool 902 might be modified to use a different form of needle cover. By way of example, member 920 might be modified to include a snap cover 1030 joined to member 920 by a flexible hinge 1032. Snap cover 1030 covers needle recesses 940A, 940B and pivots on its hinge 1032 to alternatively cover up or expose needles 225A, 225B contained in needle recesses 940A, 940B., 81474=A center wall 1004 also rises from floor 992 of member 922, becoming bifurcated about its rear end so as to surround the large through-hole 982 formed in the rear of member 922. It is to be appreciated that the position of through-hole 982 in member 922 is coordinated with the position of through-hole 962 in member 920 so that the two holes 962 and 982 align with one another when halves 920 and 922 are joined, thereby forming a single hole extending completely through the complete handle member 906., 90634=During surgery, the apparatus is used as follows. First, a hole is formed in the bone which is to receive the suture. Then the bone anchor is deployed inside the bone by pressing the distal end of the suture anchor installation tool down into the hole in the bone. Next, the installation tool is withdrawn, leaving the bone anchor in place within the bone. As the installation tool is withdrawn, the intermediate portion of the suture contained within the interior of the installation tool's handle plays out of the handle, via the handle's front opening 996 and/or the handle's elongated slot 997. As this occurs, flange 1016 and flanges 1012 allow the suture to slip beneath them., 83678=Still looking now at FIGS. 20 and 23, member 922 also includes a U-shaped opening 1014 which defines a flexible finger-like flange 1016., 90240=Preferably, handle member 922 and needle cover 1018 are formed out of transparent plastic materials so that the suture contained inside the housing and the needles captured in recesses 940A, 940B can be clearly observed during assembly and subsequent use., 81998=A pair of hollow posts 1006 (one of which is formed integral with center wall 1004) are also formed about the interior of member 922, with hollow posts 1006 being positioned such that they can receive posts 978 when the two halves 920 and 922 are joined together., 81087=Also rising from floor 992 of member 922 is a suture guide wall 1000 which includes a pair of posts 1002 extending therefrom. It is to be appreciated that posts 1002 are positioned so that they reside adjacent the generally arcuately-shaped rises 978A, 978B of handle member 920 when handle members 920 and 922 are joined together in the manner hereinafter described.}",
