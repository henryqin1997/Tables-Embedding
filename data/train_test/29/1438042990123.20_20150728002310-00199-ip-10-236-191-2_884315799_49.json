            "There is excellent safety precautions. There is a shuttle service that is available until 10 o'clock. There is a tunnel underneath the main highway so you do not have to walk across it. Emergency lights everywhere, always feel safe.",
            "I am not in a sorority but I know plenty of people who are. Not as expensive as many universities and they seem to have a blast!",
            "Plenty of clubs to join, something for everyone!",
            "Red Square- always people with their guitars or things like that. Never boring.",
            "I love Salisbury. It's worth the $25,000 a year for out of state. Although, in state is a lot cheaper. I am hoping to get in-state tuition because I am changing my residency. They do award scholarships for things. Academic scholarships helped out a little and loans they offered.",
            "There is a mall about 15 minutes up on Route 13. There are restaurants everywhere, a bowling alley down the road, and a movie theater at the mall. There is a gym on campus and a nicer gym right across the street run through the school as well. Plenty to do. There are always parties on the weekends but be careful because the cops have really cracked down.",
            "Excellent dining hall and the hours are pretty convenient. Salisbury is known for their food.",
            "Dorm life was okay. The bathrooms were cleaned every day. Although they did have a bug problem. They are renovated the oldest dorms this year which were the ones I was in so they will be getting better.",
            "The classes are challenging but not terrible. As long as you do your work and put forth a substantial amount of effort, you are rewarded,",
            "If you are an out of state student and your SAT's were under 1600, try applying test optional. I did and I got in just fine. Also check out the Fall Fusion program; I know multiple people who did that and it's also a good program that Salisbury offers.",
            "I have had a fantastic time here so far and I am in the middle of my Fall semester of my Sophomore year. The academics are challenging but not impossible. Although the area around the school is not the best, like most colleges areas aren't, the campus and security on and around campus is fantastic."

Also check out the Fall Fusion program; I know multiple people who did that and it's also a good program that Salisbury offers., 2609=I will be entering my sophomore year this fall 2009. As a freshman I was nervous to finally be in college, I wasn't sure how it would be. The thought of just graduating high school and now having to grow up and be a college student was a big step. I entered my first class which was biology and it was a class of 90 students. Although it was a huge class, the teacher took the time to explain in depth every topic. If a student had a question, the teacher stopped and made sure everyone understood before he moved on. I ended up with a B in the class as well as a much broader knowledge for biology., 68111=The university sends out their acceptance/decline letters REALLY late. I don't think I received mine till late May. If you don't hear anything, don't fret. Even if you're worried about your SAT scores or GPA, if you have a genuine and passionate essay on your application, You should be fine., 316645=Jack Daniels wings and the chicken noodle soup are some of the best things here. We even had lobster night once. The only problem is on the weekends when breakfast is served until 3:15 and half of the dining hall is closed. Food is noticeably better on open house days, but is all around pretty decent., 33969=SU has a good selection of clubs, and always has a great array of programs and activities. Many activities are sponsored and organized by various clubs. For example, SU's annual Oktoberfest, organized by the German club, is the highlight of October., 336239=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Salisbury classes are a decent size usually. My anatomy and physiology class was the biggest with over 120 students. It is a lot of students, but the teachers realize this, and take their time explaining topics, until every student understands the material. Teachers are always available during office hours to help tutor students, or review the days lecture if needed.

It is also good for strong athletes who don't want the hype of a D1 school- we're D3, but very competitive. If you love the beach its great for that too because we're only 25 miles from Ocean City :) Tips",
