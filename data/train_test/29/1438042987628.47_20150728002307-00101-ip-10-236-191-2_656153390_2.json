If we adjust his stats to the modern era, he averaged the equivalent of 246 YPG with a 21-6 ratio and 9.6 YPA over the 8 games leading up to Super Bowl XI., 166852=For instance, no one would deny that Manning was playing well vs. Denver and KC in the 2003 playoffs... So I don't think it's unfair to describe that run as a \"hot streak\". You just have to recognize at the same time that the hot streak has little to no predictive ability., 85291=Amazing how Jim Kelly enjoyed one of the best hot streaks ever to enter a Super Bowl in 1990, then had maybe the most dismal SB run-up in history the following season (including 2 mediocre playoff games, a weak game vs. the Jets in Week 14, and an awful outing against a bad New England pass D in Week 13)., 28063=Prior to Super Bowl X, Staubach ripped the Vikings and Rams for a combined unadjusted 33-55-466-5-1 line (plus 78 rushing yds) that is pretty impressive when seen in the light of the era and opposition. Likewise, Kelly torched Miami and L.A. for 320 YPG in the 1990 playoffs, and Manning was nearly flawless against one of the best pass defenses ever in last year's AFC Championship Game. (All three of those QBs went on to lose the Super Bowl, though.), 56774=Dan Marino was riding a major hot streak going into the 1984 title game, capping off one of the greatest QB seasons ever with 744 yards in his final 2 regular-season games, plus 683 more in the playoffs against Seattle and Pittsburgh., 159768=This entry was posted on Tuesday, January 25th, 2011 at 12:17 pm and is filed under Best/Worst Ever, Quarterbacks, Statgeekery.

To make a long explanation short, eYAR is an estimate of the QB's Yards Above Replacement against an average opponent in the modern era. We can use it to rank games, seasons, careers, etc., and we can also use it to gauge how well a QB was playing in the games leading up to a Super Bowl start. While the Conference Championships put a damper on any hot streaks Aaron Rodgers and Ben Roethlisberger may have had going into the Super Bowl, where does their recent play stand relative to all SB signal-callers prior to the game? And does a string of successful games before the Super Bowl actually correlate with playing well on Super Sunday?
