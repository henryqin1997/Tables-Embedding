            "The student activity fees which is included with tuition helps to cover the cost of outdoor recreation events such as skydiving, rock climbing, hiking, and whitewater rafting trips. The Convocation center has concerts and other programs thought the year.",
            "There is a dining hall and two addition places on campus to get meals. The library also has a coffee shop.",
            "I have no personal knowledge about dorm life as I was a computer student who drive 50 miles each way to school ( 100 miles round trip).",
            "Depending upon your field of study, you can expect to spend at least 1-3 hours studying or doing homework per day. The expectations to succeed are entirely up to you. this is no longer high school and most classes do not have multiple choice generic tests. You are expected to ask questions if you do not understand something and if you get behind or need help tutoring is offered.",
            "It is best to have an idea of what your area of interest is before you start taking classes. Try to take your general education classes first to free up your schedule for your degree requirements. If you find a teacher in your field of study that you like their teaching style, try to take as many of their classes as you need.",
            "The college offers a variety of degree choices at a reasonable rate compared to other colleges. The class sizes allow for a more one-on-one relationship with your professors and the people are very friendly. The overall atmosphere of the campus is very welcoming and peaceful."

This happens at all colleges, so don't let it fool you. Also, we are getting a six story library! It is in progress right now and will be finished in 2017, at least that is what I'm hearing., 37695=The dining hall is very nice, but the food can be spotty. Ron, the chef who works Mon- Thurs at the grill, is a really cool guy who makes some delicious food when you just don't want pasta. If you decide to go here, I suggest getting to the caf before the 5:15 rush. Also, Papa Joe's, Coyote Jacks, and Mondo's subs are great alternatives if you have the desire for pizza, burgers or chicken, or subs., 56670=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Dorm Life i didn't live in a dorm so i do not have much to offer in this section. many of my friends, however, moved as little as 15 minutes away from home just to live in the dorms. everyone who lives in the dorms and campus housing absolutely love it! Academic Rigor the science and english departments are top notch! that doesn't mean that the others are bad, by noooo means. the spanish section of the language department is excellent but the other languages lack a little but if you want to take it they will find a way for it to happen! the math and teaching departments are very hands-on and fun! the nursing department is one of the best in the area! if you don't see a major or minor that you like, you can literally make your own! (with guidance and approval anyways) Tips for prospective students enjoy the moment! but not too much! you don't want to procrastinate too much or to fall behind in classes! schoolwork does come first!! get involved! there are so many things to do here! the sororities and fraternities involve people who will love you for you and don't want you to conform in any way! the sports here are fantastic, too!
