            "There is the blue light system, and campus police are around on campus during the day and night. There is always a security guard at the main gate, and security guards at each dorm building. Also, there is a police escort service where you can call and talk to someone until you arrive where you are going, or have someone come get you if you are going from one Howard building to another.",
            "There are 9 historically black fraternities and sororities (called the divine 9) and several professional ones too like for law, education, and medical schools.",
            "There are alot of clubs and activities, both official and unofficial. It's easy to find out about activities/clubs through friends and events that they hold. there's a club for just about anything: from stepping, mining, bible studies, writing, dancing, etc.",
            "People who are hard working but also want a chance to take it easy now and then, and have a lot of choices!",
            "First Fridays on the Yard for sororities and fraternities where they come out and sing, step, etc. Howard homecoming is always legendary. We usually have at least one celebrity at each event and family and friends come from out of town, as well as just residences from the DMV area to experience Howard homecoming.",
            "If you are complacent and just accept what the university hands you, you're missing out. Howard has great opportunities that a lot of students miss out on because they don't have the initiative to go after it. If you don't go out of your way to get the whole value of education, you will not get what you're paying for.",
            "The university has a bunch of events that occur throughout the semester that are available to students. There are athletic games, special weeks like ResFest, SpringFest, and Homecoming that include a variety of events, and also conferences and visiting speakers that come to campus to give lectures. All other on campus activities are held by organizations- there are parties, concerts, awareness days, showcases, performances, etc. held by all sorts of student organizations.",
            "The food in the dining hall is mediocre- sometimes its really good, and occasionally there is food that is inedible, just as you would expect from any college cafeteria. The punchout is always good, and all the rest of the places we can get food on campus are great.",
            "The dorms could use some work structurally and just the way it's run, but everyone is so friendly that it makes up for it. You immediately bond with people in your dorm and it's the easiest way to make good friends. One thing about Howard that is kind of special is the dorm vs. dorm competition. We have a week called ResFest where each dorm has their own teams- dance, step, etc. and it's a great opportunity for bonding and showing your spirit!",
            "Most of the professor are very knowledgeable and helpful. All of them will try to help you if you go to them for help. Overall, if you try hard, your professors will definitely try to help you get an A and understand what you are learning about.",
            "If are uncomfortable with doing things for yourself, then Howard will be a very difficult position. This being said, there are plenty of chances to learn more about yourself and grow. If you are unwilling to step out of your comfort zone, Howard may not be for you because it is so diverse.",
            "The programs are great; each offers opportunities to grow substantially. As long as you look out for the great opportunities that are offered, you will be able to get ahead and be on a solid track by the time you graduate. Overall, the experience is what you make it."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{279349=Howard University is know for its epic Homecoming Celebrations. The biggest celebrities, music artist, stylist and experts from around the world travel to DC to help us celebrate our Homecoming festivities in style with a week filled with traditional events such as the Gospel Show, Comedy Show, Fashion Show and ultimately the Greek Step Show and most importantly Football Game. Homecoming is in mid to late October every year! Resfest, a competition between all the dormitories is the next biggest event and tradition at Howard, after Homecoming. Teams are formed from each dormitory to compete in Debate, Sports, Strolling, Dancing and most importantly Stepping for the Resfest Champion Title., 637148=This only got two stars because of the social aspect (and there is supposed to be more dorms built within the next 10 years). Our dorms need major reparations. In order to get the best experience I advise freshman girls to live in the Quad or the Annex, freshman boys should live in Drew Hall. DO NOT live in Meridian Hill Hall, it is a sophomore dorm and will deprive you from your freshman experience because it is a sophomore dorm and it is off campus. If you get placed there, have your parents call and complain. In around February, you'll have to pay $200 if you want to live on campus the following year. There is also a dorm that is way off campus (about 30 minutes total from campus) called University Town Center in Hyattsville, MD. It is metro- accessible and if you are used to a full kitchen and living room, this is the place for you (I recommend sophomores and up)., 715738=Stay on financial information. Register for classes in April., 459026=The dorm bathrooms and hallways are cleaned everyday and all the dorms are in great shape! In Fall 2014 there will be two new dorms housing Freshman girls and Sophomores., 864142=Check your teachers on ratemyprofessor.com and if your not an early morning person stay away from 8:10 classes. It will only lead to missing class., 930308=From recent reports, the tuition has increased by a significant amount since 2012, and that is unfortunate. From my experience, Howard has not always appropriated its funds in the best way, with the majority of the money not being sewn back into the university. With that being said, although you will have at least one score to settle or obstacle created by administration in need of a major reconstruction, you will have the memories of Homecoming and your own personal Howard experience to look forward to. So, depends on how you look at it, it may be worth it., 183290=Be yourself, the rest will follow! Get involved, whatever you can get your hands on that you are good at, do it! Volunteer, join a team or club, anything. Just get involved. GO TO CLASS! Howard has a lot of distractions, you can not let the glamour and fun take you way from your main focus! Do not get caught up in the graduating on time, there is no such thing. If an opportunity presents itself for you to study abroad or do a co-op, DO IT! Even if it means adding a semester or 2. (however make sure you have the funds to cover all of your time) Go to everything 10-30 minutes early. No matter the event or class you will benefit greatly from being early (including the cafe line) Get all of your financial aid/registration started as early as possible. If FASA opens on January 1st @ 12:00am, be there to fill it out by January 1st 12:01am. Do NOT wait until the week something is due because issues always arise and you will want time to attend to it. Stay on top of financial aid office, they are not very organized at times, and they have a lot of students to handle. Unfortunately its not all about you. Go to teachers office hours, and go often!! It benefits greatly if the teacher knows who you are and sees that you are making an effort, plus its added learning time. Don't spend you whole time planing your life, that you for get to live You miss 100% of the shoots you don't take. Take risks!, 854135=Homecoming at Howard draws over 6,000 people every September. It is a two week long tradition that spawns multiple events with iconic people., 929403=Howard University is the founding home to the majority of the Divine Nine, so be prepared to see, hear, and experience tons of Black Fraternities and Sororities participating in various events like auctions and pageants in the Fall, and probates in the Spring. The biggest event on campus is Howard Homecoming, which happens typically every October. It is one of the biggest college homecoming weeks in the country. Be prepared for lots of celebrity sightings, parades, and shows. Past guests included: Chaka Khan, Tyrese, Pooch Hall, P. Diddy, Boris Kojoe,Taraji P. Henson, Wendy Raquel Robinson, and much more., 1115936=Student organizations often host parties during the school year.Dancing and socializing are definitely big, and most students do frequent a lot of hip-hop and dance clubs in the area, namely Love and Fur. Homecoming, which occurs every year in the third week of October, is a can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?t-miss event and has been known to draw hundreds of alumni and students from schools all over the country, especially other HBCUs. Even if you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?re not yet 21, you can still enjoy DC\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?s nightlife., 633747=We are the Alpha chapter for most of the black greeks. There is First Fridays in The Punchout where we get to watch them stroll/ step. Also, in April there are the Probates. We have other greeks as well that focus on your major/ minor. They are all great for networking. *Discretion is key*}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Since I'm in the School of Business the curriculum proved to be challenging. I took 15 credit hours for my first semester freshman year and I could handle it. There are hundreds of classes to take and what's better is that you can choose what classes you want and which teacher which is a choice that I didn't have in high school. I've learned the most in my Business Orientation class about credit and how to invest money at an earlier age. During the first semester, the School of B students are put into teams where we are given different projects and presentations that we have to present to the class. These groups helped me learn how to work with others and how to formulate certain business ideas and how to market new products. Now that my first semester is over, I'm excited to see how much Howard will teach me in the coming years.
