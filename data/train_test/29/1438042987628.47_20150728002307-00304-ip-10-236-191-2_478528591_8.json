As used herein, \u201cindicia\u201d is considered to mean any symbol, letter, group of letters, design, or the like, that can be added to the dimpled surface of a golf ball. While the golf ball discussed above has been described as having a primer coat, there are also several means for preparing golf ball surfaces. In addition to buffing, other methods such as sand blasting or plasma treating are often used to prepare the ball surface for printing. In such instances, the surface of the ball may be sprayed with the lubricant. It is also to be appreciated that the application of a clear topcoat is not limited to any particular finishing coat or to only one coat. The use of oleic acid for lubricating golf balls has greatly reduced rejection rates of golf balls, both at the indicia stamping stage and at the finishing or topcoat stage. The use of oleic acid eliminates the need to clean the golf balls of lubrication prior to the application of the topcoat. Prior to the use of oleic acid, it was necessary to clean the golf balls after they were stamped with indicia. This",
