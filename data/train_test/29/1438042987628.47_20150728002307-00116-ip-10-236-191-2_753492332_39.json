In 1994, he began doing stand up and quickly became a regular at all the major comedy clubs. After a short three years, Ian had made three appearances on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Conan O\u2019Brien Show\u201d. He hosted Ripe TV\u2019s \u201cThe Hollywood Burn\u201d and had his own talk show \u201cThe Ian Bagg Show\u201d. He\u2019s since added credits like NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno\u201d, CBS\u2019s \u201cLate Late Show with Craig Kilborn\u201d and CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Craig Ferguson Show\u201d. He was able to be a part of a half hour comedy special, \u201cA Comic\u2019s Climb\u201d from HBO and \u201cComedy Central Presents Ian Bagg\u201d (leading him to dating Britney Spears for three days). In love with the art of stand up, he was thrilled when The History Channel asked him to be a part of their special, \u201cThe History of the Joke\u201d. Al Gore described his comedy as \u201ccontrolled chaos\u201d, President Reagan on his death bed described it as an \u201cinteractive delight\u201d. Nancy agreed.
