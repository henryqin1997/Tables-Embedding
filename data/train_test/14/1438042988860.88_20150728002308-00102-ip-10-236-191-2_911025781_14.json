The grill station, known for its philly cheesesteaks, curly fries, and quesadillas is the best option when other stations are closed/other stations don't look appetizing. It's your best option. There is also a miniature Starbucks/deli if you don't have time for a sit-down lunch. The Starbucks/deli stand closes around 6:30 pm, but the cafeteria has coffee, too. The entrees are hit-and-miss, but the dessert counter, multi-flavor ice cream cooler, and salad bar are always there. You can get omelets and waffles at breakfast and weekend brunch. They have vegan and vegetarian options at each meal.}",
