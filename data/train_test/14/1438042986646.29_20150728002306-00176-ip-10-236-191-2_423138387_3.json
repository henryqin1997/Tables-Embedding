    "textBeforeTable": "This event was Chris Wood\u2019s 116th start on the European Tour. He finished in fantastic style, hitting the final green in two shots (his 4th sub-regulation hit of the week), then holing the 12 foot putt for eagle. Looking at his Genworth Statistics, Chris actually struggled a little on the Par 3 holes (specifically the 3rd hole), but he ranked 1st for Par 4 Scoring and 2nd for Par 5 Scoring. Overall his driving was excellent and he achieved 81.9% Greens in Regulation (ranking 6th). He also putted very well, converting 2 eagles and 22 birdies for the week. Chris WOOD -18 In a dramatic finish to the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters, Chris Wood eagled the final hole to leapfrog George Coetzee and Sergio Garcia for the victory.
