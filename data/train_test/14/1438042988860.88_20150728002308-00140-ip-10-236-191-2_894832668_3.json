The band's tour in support of the album \"Babel\" commenced at the end of 2012 and has continued through 2013., 6402=Stops among the \"Gentlemen of the Road\" tour included two shows on June 8 & 9, 2013 at the Austin 360 Amphitheater in Austin, Texas. Those shows went off without a hitch, but the very next day bassist Ted Dwane checked himself into a hospital, where doctors found a blood clot on the surface of his brain. He underwent surgery, and Mumford & Sons canceled the rest of its \"Summer Stampede,\" including a performance at the 2013 Bonnaroo Music Festival and returned to the UK. Dwane's surgery was a success, and his recovery went smoothly enough that the band managed to headline the Glastonbury Festival., 5267=Of all the press to come out of the summer for the band, there are a few things that may surprise you. One was actor Jake Gyllenhaal's tale of traveling with Mumford & Sons before they were famous, living a hobo-lifestyle and even playing in the band. The other was the band's abrupt exit from Atlanta's Clermont Lounge in late September, though media reports vary on whether they were kicked out or simply asked to leave for violating one of the club's policies., 5753=One of the great parts of Mumford & Sons' summer was the 2013 Stopover towns. Back in February they were announced as Lewes (UK), Simcoe (ON), Troy (OH), Guthrie (OK) and St. Augustine (FL). That last stop, especially, had a major financial impact, filling bed and breakfasts, motels and hotels in an area known for its September slow period. Even more, it has changed the discussion in St. Augustine about bringing major cultural events to town for years to come., 8045=Mumford & Sons worked on at least a handful of new songs at Eastcote Studios in Kensal Town, west London, the same studio where they recorded their debut album \"Sigh No More.\" It was rumored that the band was also working with James Ford, the producer for Arctic Monkeys and HAIM. Ultimately, they confirmed they were aiming for a release date in early 2015, but so far have not yet announced a date., 4694=When Mumford & Sons caused a stir at the end of 2012, it wasn't for their folk, or for their rock. Instead, the English quartet, which has featured everything from acoustic guitars to accordions and mandolins, raised eyebrows for telling Style magazine it would begin to explore the electronic side of music on their next album., 7229=More than 80,000 people are expected at this year's Bonnaroo, which will also feature well-known contemporary acts like Florence + the Machine, Robert Plant, Kendrick Lamar, My Morning Jacket and many more., 4344=A 12-time Grammy nominated outfit, the band has battled through the explosion of electronic dance music \u2013 especially in the United States. Still, a use of synthesizers would mark a dramatic shift in style for the band, which exploded with its debut album \"Sigh No More\" in 2009, and saw its sophomore effort, \"Babel,\" become the fastest selling album of 2012 in the UK, and the biggest selling debut in 2012 in the U.S., 2632=Update 4/13 In addition to the \"Gentlemen of the Road Stopover\" dates, Mumford & Sons have announced additional shows for the summer months. They'll begin on June 2 at Coney Island in Brooklyn, followed by gigs\u00a0in Boston, Chicago and Calgary. You can also catch them on the festival circuit with a slot at this year's\u2026, 7613=Also on the calendar for this year is a penciled-in date at the 2015 Bonnaroo Music Festival, which will take place in Manchester, Tennessee between June 11-14th. The alt-rockers will be joined by iconic piano man Billy Joel and EDM superstar Deadmau5. Overall, the festival will feature 125 musical acts and nearly two dozen comedians on 12 different stages., 8386=It looks like 2015 will be a pretty busy year for Mumford & Sons., 8298=All the way back on December 2013, the band's bassist Ted Dwane, said that the band would be meeting to write new music in the winter of 2014. By July, Ben Lovett confirmed that the band was recording its third studio album in London., 3321=Mumford & Sons continue to grow in popularity and has done well with \"Babel,\" which was the second biggest bow of 2012 behind Taylor Swift's \"Red.\" It scored six more Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and Best Americana Album. Still, the band is already back to work on new music. Their 2013 East Coast tour includes stops in Boston, New York and Fairfax, Virginia.}",
