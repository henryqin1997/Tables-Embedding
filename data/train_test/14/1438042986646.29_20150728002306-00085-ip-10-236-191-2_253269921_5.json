Project statistics graphs Note that when the span is wide enough, activity gets summed to the start of the month (first picture). I made PNG images of two graphs. Click on them to enlarge, or click on the links to get to the statistics pages. It is fun to watch the activity stats on the SourceForge project\u00a0RAD Studio Demo Code\u00a0and correlate them to the Delphi release and update dates. Now that the there are RadStudio XE3 demos available at\u00a0SourceForge.net Repository \u2013 [radstudiodemos] Index of /branches/RadStudio_XE3, and a post on a Delphi Event in New Zeeland rumours of an eminent Delphi/RAD Studio XE3 version start to raise.
