Hope you heard my show yesterday morning (October 27). It, too, was filled with a wide variety of, uh, good stuff. I'm on again on Monday, November 24th. I do hope you'll tune in. I'll play a randy tune, just for you., 39641=Annual Gales of November Show:\u00a0Songs about shipwrecks, lighthouses, mermaids, and general nautical mayhem- inspired by Gordon Lightfoots' classic \"Wreck of the Edmund Fitgerald\", 23082=I'm back on Monday, December 20, and man-oh-man what a show I have planned for that morning!\u00a0 You'll be smilin' ear-to-ear during that magnificently upbeat and cheery hour-and-a-half.\u00a0 Put it on your calendar!, 59549=It's a thrill this morning to be joined in the studio by John Standefer, the 2002 National Fingerstyle Guitar Champion. \u00a0He's helping out this morning with the Fall Membership Drive. \u00a0Can we count on you to chip in? \u00a0Please support this great music and this very worthy radio station!, 87710=Yikes! Only today did I see your kind email from September 22 that you left on the KBOO website. I wasn't expecting any \"fan mail\" here at kboo.fm so I didn't thing to check...until a friend told me about the hundreds, nay, thousands of emails piling up at this website all about my show. Oddly enough, only one (yours) was positive. All the others said something to the effect of \"what the *&^!%&# is SHE doing on this venerable radio station!\"}",
