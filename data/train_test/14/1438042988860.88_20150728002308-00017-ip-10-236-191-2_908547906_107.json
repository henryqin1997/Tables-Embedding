I have a GPA over 3.5 and I consider my education and courses taken at Hunter College to be very influential and inspiring., 256134=Come on, the cafeteria was actually closed in the 2012-2013 school year for rodent infestation., 276438=The professors are great and seem to thoroughly enjoy there work. The facilities are in a constant state of despair and the building itself is under major construction. Still the school has been standing since 1870 so a little mess here and there wont effect a student form enjoying their time., 228769=The club fair was Oct 24. The end of the semester is Dec 14. Get a clue. I spent my first two months lonely and with nothing to do., 464169=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 77094=This school is in the CUNY system so for students who live within NYC, tuition is only about $2700. This is a steal compared to other colleges and especially when Hunter is one of the top public schools in the country. Theres quality in getting a degree from Hunter at that price., 237605=Good for people who like the City life. Easy to get to, best for commuters though the nearest train is ALWAYS packed with people. Not to shabby for 2500 a semester.}",

Tips for prospective students Great location, subway is connected to Hunter. Bang for the buck $2,500 for one semester. Enough said. =) Am enjoying being here Before I came to Hunter, I heard many stories such as CUNY students don't make as much friends as people who dorm. This is false. I made many friends here at Hunter. As long someone wants to be active and make friends, college, dorming or not dorming, will turn out fine for him/her. Am learning a lot Even though I've only been at Hunter College for a semester, I feel that that most of the professors making learning about a subject interesting. However,",
