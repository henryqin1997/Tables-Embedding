Although this was a season of breaking new English domestic records for the Gunners,[nb 1] and leading at all fronts come the halfway stage, they threw away a priceless lead against Bolton Wanderers and finally surrendered the title with a 3\u20132 home defeat to Leeds United, in their antepenultimate game of the season. This result all but saved Leeds from relegation. Newcastle United and Chelsea were the remaining two teams, who qualified for the UEFA Champions League at the expense of Liverpool who had to settle for the UEFA Cup; they would be joined in Europe by Blackburn Rovers for their second successive season., 8065=Michael Ricketts had the honour of scoring the first goal of the new season for Bolton against Fulham, inside five minutes. The first hat-trick of the season was scored by Michael Owen in the match between Liverpool and Manchester City, at Maine Road in late September.[2] Wayne Rooney, at the young age of 16, made his breakthrough at Everton, scoring an impressive goal against Arsenal, helping the Toffees to a 2\u20131 win.[3] However, Rooney also got his first Premiership straight red card two months later on Boxing Day, for a reckless foul on Birmingham City's Steve Vickers at St. Andrew's.[4], 147120=The PFA Players' Player of the Year award for 2003 was won by Thierry Henry of Arsenal.[34] This was the Frenchman's first award of the season and he beat off competition from the previous winner Ruud van Nistelrooy., 63339=Updated to games played on 11 May 2003.

He also equalled his record of eight goals in eight successive matches at the beginning of the season, a milestone he had reached the previous season. Van Nistelrooy finished one goal ahead of Arsenal's Thierry Henry while James Beattie managed 23 league goals for Southampton. Since the reduction of the number of games from 42 to 38 in 1996, only Kevin Phillips had scored more Premiership goals in one season \u2013 30 for Sunderland in the 1999\u20132000 season., 5920=The 2002\u201303 FA Premier League (known as the FA Barclaycard Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the eleventh season of the Premier League, the top division in English football.
