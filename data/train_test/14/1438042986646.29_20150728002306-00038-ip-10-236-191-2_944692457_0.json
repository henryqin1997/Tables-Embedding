My name's Ciana,\u00a0and I am currently twenty years of age.\u00a0There are many things that catch my interest and enjoyment, but animals have a soft spot in my heart. From fish, hamster, lizard, cat, dog, to an exotic green wing macaw, I've had the pleasure and experience in caring for animals. When it comes to pet care, I don't see it as a chore because I love being able to interact with the critter(s)! My goals in attending to a pet are to make sure their needs are fulfilled, they get great care, and they're having a ball, sometimes quite literally! If any of what you've read appeals to you, I'm only a phone call or e-mail away!
