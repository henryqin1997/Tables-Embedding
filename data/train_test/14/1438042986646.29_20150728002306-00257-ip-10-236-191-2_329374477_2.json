The nominations are still be taken for other Awards, but the Vital Blackburn Awards for 2006-2007 continue to be dished out with a Special Award suggested by BomBom for the Vital Blackburn Newcomer of the Season When asked to simply leave the name of the Vital Blackburn member you see as being the NEWCOMER of the Season most felt\u0085 BomBom & MikeyGamst should be the joint Award Winners! So congratulations to BomBom and MikeyGamst! For their constant comments, so many of which have been absolutely hilarious, the large number of articles written and submitted for publishing and the fact that both joined during the season (to become eligible for the \"Newcomer\" Award) after tying with mentions these guys share, and rightly so, this honour. As I said on the Member of the Season Award, we have ALL more than played our part this season though and have all been newcomers at some point, so we all deserve MASSIVE credit.
