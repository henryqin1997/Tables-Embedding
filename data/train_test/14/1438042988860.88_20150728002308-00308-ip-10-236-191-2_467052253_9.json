    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6359=FIG. 11 shows yet a further embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 11 a method and system is provided for buyer-driven targeting comprising the steps of: in block 1100 sending to a buyer entity an electronic offer to participate in an incentive program in return for unverified purchase information pertaining to the buyer entity and access to verification information held by merchants for that purchase information; and in block 1110 receiving from the buyer entity an electronic response with the unverified purchase information and a digital identity verification granting access to the buyer entity verification information held by the merchants from whom the purchases were made. The method further includes the step in block 1120 of making a comparison of the unverified purchase information for the buyer entity and the verification information from the merchants to verify that the unverified information is accurate purchase information. The method further includes the step in block 1130 of electronically searching the accurate purchase information to obtain at least one attribute about the buyer entity. The method further includes the step in block 1140 of correlating that attribute to an incentive from a plurality of incentives based on the correlated attribute. Finally, the method includes the step in block 1150 of presenting the selected incentive to the buyer entity.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{682776=The next step, represented by block 322, is the selection of an incentive to be offered to the group of buyer entities. This step could comprise determining different incentive levels for different buyer entities in the group and could be performed automatically or manually. Individual incentive levels and specific incentives within levels would be determined and automatically calculated on the basis of a buyer entity's estimated probability of becoming a valuable customer for the advertiser. This probability is inferred from various scores that are calculated for the purpose of summarizing the information of that buyer entity in the database. Thus, an incentive may be determined in block 322 by selecting a type and/or amount of the incentive for the buyer entity by applying the score of the buyer entity to an incentive function. Any suitable function may be used. By way of example but not by way of limitation, the promotions manager at a hotel chain might want to offer a special rebate to buyer entities that spend significant monies at hotels. She believes that all hotel customers are good targets for it's promotions, but buyer entities that are particularly likely to become valuable new customers are those that spend money at first class hotels. Therefore, the hotel chain is offering a rebate ranging between $25 and $100 on a three night stay, with the exact amount of the rebate to be determined according to the following formulas: {X=10%(score1)plus5%(score2) {maximum reward $100 {minimum reward $25 where X is the reward with a maximum of $100 and a minimum of $25; score 2 is the total amount of money that the buyer entity spent in 2000 at first class hotels (the names of these first class hotels would presumably have been supplied by the advertiser); and score 1 is the total amount of money spent by the buyer entity during the year 2000 at all other hotels. Therefore, buyer entity A who is shown by it's purchasing records to have spent $700 on first class hotels and $500 on other hotels during the year 2000, will be offered a rebate of (10%*700) plus (5%*500), which is $95 for a three night hotel stay while buyer entity B who is shown by it's purchasing records to have spent $300 on first class hotels and $600 on other hotels during the year 2000 will be offered a rebate of $60 (10% of 300 plus 5% of 600)., 725610=In block 1230, responses are recorded for processing of the incentive offers and for the purpose of updating the scores. Then the account of the viewer is credited with the reward for viewing advertisements and/or a debit against a program charge, if the program watched had a separate pay TV or other video channel charge associated with it. Additionally, some of the viewed advertisements may be discarded and replaced with new ones, for certain of the video channels. In a preferred embodiment in the pay per view context, the incentive is provided as a reduction or elimination of a pay for view charge for the program that is being watched at the same time as the advertisement., 659284=A score could be calculated for one or more of such categories based on the level of purchases of goods or services in that category over some predetermined time period. As noted above, each buyer entity could have a separate score for each company from which it purchased products in a given time period, and which summarizes the total purchases made from that company. By way of example, a buyer entity, which submits purchase records for the year 2001 at the beginning of the year 2002, could have a score of 320 from Macy's for the year 2001, indicating that it purchased products in the value of $320 from Macy's during the year 2001 on the basis of its submitted purchase records, and a score of 155 from Walgreen's, indicating that it has proof of purchase records indicating it to have purchased products worth total of $155 from Walgreen's during the year 2001, or a score of 1450 in the discount purchase category, indicating that the buyer entity has shown to have purchased $1450 from various discount stores in 2001. It should be noted that the system has the option of selecting and entering only purchases within selected categories and discarding or separating the purchase information in other categories., 703500=For the purpose of our example, we assume that the owner of the restaurant wants to distribute his promotional offers thru any channel thru which participating members have agreed to receive offers, and has agreed to pay for it at previously established rates. With respect to Email, Bella Italia's offer could therefore be listed as the first of 3 offers in the bi-weekly Email that Frederick receives in the second half of April. Furthermore, due to the overall strength of his purchase record, the company could be willing to pay Frederick 50 cents just for clicking on one of the embedded links in any of the Emails that he receives. This payment rate is an increase from the 25 cents which Frederick had previously received on the basis of his earlier submission of fewer or less substantial purchase records. This rate of payment was determined by comparing Frederick's expenditure levels in one or more categories to a set of thresholds., 724874=In block 1220, the advertisements are shown. In a preferred embodiment, an indication that the advertisement was displayed on the receiver of the buyer entity and was not zapped is obtained. Such an indication may be obtained in a variety of manners from a set top box or other equipment at the buyer entity's receiver. Note that some minimal level of detectable response via remote control might also be required as a condition for crediting the viewer with the reward for watching the advertisement. This is to make sure that the advertisements are indeed being watched and that the television or other video channel is not left on unattended and for the sole purpose of collecting the rewards., 722751=Additionally, the incentive rate at which viewer is compensated for viewing interactive television advertisements may be set in block 1210, by way of example, using a score in an appropriate category or a number of scores as one or more factors and by comparing these buyer entity scores to predetermined thresholds. A wide variety of other factors may be used in combination with the buyer entity scores, as noted above, including, by way of example only, the demographics of the buyer entity, the time of day, the day in the week, the time of season, the program being watched. The rational for the luxury goods example, is that a merchant would find it to be advantageous to reward/pay selected buyer entities that have a past history of buyer luxury goods and services, to watch/interact with their advertisements., 705203=Additionally, Bella Italia's offer features prominently in an annual catalogue that includes promotional offers specially printed for Frederick based on his category scores, and is listed in a \u201ctop offer\u201d section in the front of the catalogue. The promotional offer for the restaurant could be advertised in the monthly flyer printed for and sent to Frederick's mailing address. When Frederick is at or in the vicinity of downtown San Francisco as determined by his signal, and indicates through his PDA device that he is willing to receive promotional offers in his immediate vicinity, a message with the promotional offer for the restaurant is among those that are sent to him that pertain to businesses near his physical location. Finally, when watching Interactive Television, Frederick is compensated with $1 per minute instead of the previous $0.30 per minute for watching interactive ads on the basis of his purchase records, and an advertisement for Bella Italia could be among the first shown to him when he watches such advertisements in April of 2003., 720591=In block 1210, a data base of advertisements is accessed which advertisements are to be played, as well as any score thresholds associated with the individual advertisements or sets of advertisements and any rules associated with particular advertisements or sets of advertisements such as playing certain advertisements only with selected programs, or only at certain times of day, or only on certain days, or only for buyer entities with certain demographic characteristics. The advertisements are then selected and may also optionally be sequenced based on these rules, including rules for sequencing based on the buyer entity scores. For example, information that a buyer entity is a regular viewer of Masterpiece Theater could be used in conjunction with a relatively high score in the category of luxury items, as determined for example by comparison of the buyer entity's luxury item score to a threshold set for a particular advertisement, to thereby select an advertisement for expensive jewelry, which advertisement will then be placed first in a sequence of advertisements. The demographic information that this buyer entity is in a high income zip code could also be used in conjunction with a high buyer entity score in the category of automobiles to then place an advertisement for automobiles second in the sequence of advertisements. This selection and sequence would be determined solely or in combination with other information such as viewing habits and demographic information. The particular sequence rules would be determined as desired., 698499=An example of the operation of the system of the present invention illustrating the flexibility and some of the many variables that come into play is discussed below. Assume a member, Frederick Miller, with the membership No. 123,456, who resides in San Francisco uploads his annual credit card statements for the year 2002 in March of 2003. These statements show that he has spent a comparatively large amount of money at expensive Italian restaurants during the year 2002 in and around San Francisco. Assume further that his level of spending at expensive Italian restaurants is significant enough to place him among the top spenders in this category within the membership and that his spending at expensive Italian restaurants is more significant than his spending in many other spending categories, giving him a high score for the category of Italian restaurants., 702054=Continuing with this hypothetical example, when Frederick uploads his purchase records in March of 2003, a fully-automated system could do the following: (1) For each of all currently active forward-looking advertising programs, determine whether or not Frederick qualifies for receipt of a promotion. In our example, Frederick would qualify to receive the promotional offer from Bella Italia because of his significant total expenditures at Italian restaurants, which total has been compared to a threshold and been found to exceed that threshold; (2) Calculate the proper reward levels for Frederick for these promotions., 595425=This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd119(e) of provisional application Ser. No. 60/243,960 entitled \u201cBuyer-Driven Targeting of Purchasing Entities,\u201d filed on Oct. 30, 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.
