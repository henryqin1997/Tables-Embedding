    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{7329=1/21/15: OK, national media, it is time to start giving the New York Islanders the respect they deserve this season. The 2014-15 campaign is more than half over and the Islanders are on top of the Metropolitan Division, though they are battling it out with the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals. But they are not a fluke. In the Battle of New York, they blanked the New York Rangers, who were coming off of a very successful West Coast trip, 3-0. The Islanders will get a great test on Thursday night when they host the Boston Bruins and their new star, rookie David Pasternak., 5451=2/11/15: For the uninitiated, here is something important to know about hockey players. They are tough. Very, very tough. Take the Islanders Kyle Okposo, for example. He is one of the better players on the team and a big goal scorer. He is going to miss about two month after undergoing surgery to reattach his retina in his eye. Amazingly, he played several games with the injury before ceding to medical attention. One of those games was on January 16th, when he lit up the Pittsburgh Penguins for four goals. He scored another goal and assist the next day. Losing him for two months may haunt the Isles, but they are still well within the comfort zone of making the playoffs., 8545=1/7/15: The NHL season is almost at its midway point and the New York Islanders are pushing for the Metropolitan Division title. Through the end of the 2014 calendar year, the Isles were tied with the mighty Pittsburgh Penguins for the best record in the division, and they have some breathing room over the third and fourth place teams (Washington and New York Rangers). It is their final season in Nassau Coliseum and the Islanders are giving the fans a show with a terrific 14-4 home record. But they are way from the friendly comforts of home and are midway through a long road trip. At least they are getting closer to home with games at New Jersey on Friday and Columbus on Saturday.}",
