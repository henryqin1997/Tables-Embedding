Even better, the single-core processor seems largely up to the task. Because of the power differences there have been some sacrifices -- and these have mostly come in the form of a watered-down Sense 4 skin. You'll find that while it looks similar, certain visual flourishes such as the full-screen weather animations and globe view within the weather widget have been cast out. Pinching to view all your home screens at once doesn't have any effect and the 3D transitions between screens are gone too. The keyboard has also been tweaked, losing the navigational arrows found on HTC's larger 2012 phones -- a sensible choice, we say, given the reduced screen size. We've already done an in-depth take on HTC's latest Android skin, but the differences between the One V and the rest of the One series are worth noting. Minor touches, like the ability to \"zoom\" on text within SMS messages, are still here, while menu and settings navigation is also indistinguishable from other phones running Sense 4. However, the One V isn't compatible with the HTC's Media Link HD dongle and -- like the One S -- misses out on the NFC train, both hardware- and software-wise. Something we didn't catch while poring over the One V's spec sheet when it was first announced is that there's also no digital compass, meaning Google Maps' orientation won't change as you turn to face a different direction. %Gallery-153079%, 85741=\u00a9 2015 AOL Inc.

As we've already said, the phone is generally capable, but struggles with moderately to intensely challenging challenges, like graphics-heavy games and visually dense websites. Swiping around Engadget, the browser often stuttered, attempting to parse the next picture as we scrolled. There were occasionally greater hurdles, like when we used Google's autocomplete search box, and the One V really had to think about what it was doing. One area where the One V does excel -- and something that surprised us, given HTC's past record on this -- is the device's boot-up time. Seconds after turning on the phone, we were able to boot up apps and make calls. We suspect this is thanks to HTC's FastBoot option, found in the battery settings. The One V offers admirable runtime, lasting just over nine hours during our standard battery run-down test, which entails playing a video at 50 percent brightness, with WiFi and mobile data on. In more typical use, with plenty of music playback, Twitter, email and Facebook all synced and several browser missions, we got closer to two days of use on a single charge. Given the battery's relatively frugal 1,500mAh capacity, it's a pretty respectable showing. Alongside WiFi (802.11b/g/n) and Bluetooth 4.0, the One V juggles tri-band HSPA (850/900/2100), capable of 14.4Mbps down and 5.6Mbps up and quad-band GPRS (850/900/1800/1900) radios. On the HSPA connection, we saw speeds around 2Mbps down and 1.2Mbps up, which is comparable to other HSPA devices we've tested. We also enjoyed clear calls, even on the busy streets of London., 12693=by Mat Smith | @thatmatsmith | April 13th 2012 at 2:00pm April 13th 2012 2:00 pm}",
