Each set of tracks 20 includes opposed rail members 22 and 24 which are connected together by means of front and rear inverted U-shaped hangers 26 and 28, respectively, which are carried by the hook brackets 16. In the embodiment shown, the track members 22 and 24 and the hangers 26 and 28 are formed from heavy wire such as \ufffd\u2033 diameter steel rods welded or otherwise attached to each other. Also, the rods are provided with a low friction coating and the 1:8 inclination is sufficient that the bottles mounted to the track slide easily at this inclination., 40920=The rack assembly 10 is installed within the merchandiser 100 by hanging each track 20 between the rear support channel 14 and the front support channel 12, the front support 12 being at an elevation about 2 inches lower than the rear support 14 and the support channels being about sixteen inches apart to provide the necessary inclination of about 1:8.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Also although the improved dispensing system has been described by making particular reference to a preferred construction, the details of description are not to be understood a restrictive, numerous variants being possible within the scope of the claims hereunto appended. When the track 20 is fully loaded, the last bottle is retained at the front end of the gate. When the gate is engaged by the foremost bottle, the bottle prevents the gate from moving clockwise and the rear end of the gate is maintained in a position in which it blocks downward movement of the group of bottles rearward of the gate. In this way, while succeeding bottles are urged against each other, the foremost bottle engaging the stop is free of the weight of succeeding bottles. When the foremost bottle is removed by a customer, the gate is allowed to move in a clockwise direction by the pressure of first bottle of the group against the relatively light resistance of the torsion spring 60, thereby releasing the first held bottle of the rear group which slides down the track to take the place of the removed bottle and pushes the front end of the gate counterclockwise into the path of the next bottle which is held in place by the rear end of the gate. When the tracks 20 are mounted to the supports 12 and 14 is a simple matter to emplace",
