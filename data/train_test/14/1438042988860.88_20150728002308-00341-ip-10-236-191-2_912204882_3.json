            "Basically everyone. UVM has a really laid back atmosphere that is very accepting of all different types of people. There are groups for everyone! There are a lot of different types of people on campus and since the student body is so large, you'll definitely find people with similar interests.",
            "Be aware that public transportation home or elsewhere can be a nightmare. Amtrak is actually located in a nearby town (in Essex Jct.) and only one line goes through (The Vermonter). It's also really expensive and time consuming. The airport is about a 40 minute walk from campus or you can take the 1 bus (not a good plan the day before break because the buses are too full and some drivers are picky about your luggage size). If you buy your tickets way ahead of time, they aren't too expensive. Get a good winter coat too.",
            "It's a lot of money for out of state students. For me, the financial aid was great the first year and hasn't been as good since forcing me to take out private loans in the five figure range. The campus is beautiful though.",
            "Burlington is a great town, and there are a lot of things to do (music, movies, clubs). It's also near great mountains (Jay, Stowe, Mad River, Sugarbush). The bus system that runs through the county is pretty extensive (though rarely on time) which makes life without a car do-able.",
            "The science classes are pretty good if you get a good professor. I thought a lot of the introductory classes were comparable to the AP level in high school. You learn a lot of good skills in the lab."

The dorms in general are nicer than many schools I've visited. Living in the dorms is a great way to meet new people and make friends. The RAs do a good job in building community in each floor. As to the niceness of the residence hall, the Honors College has the nicest dorms, and then after that, the halls on the Redstone Campus are pretty nice.}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 13 out of 16 people found this review useful. 2 of 94 Categories Comments Great for these types of students UVM is great for someone who wants to be active. By active, I mean active in anything- if you are serious about LGBT rights, they have many groups which fight for rights. If you want to learn about recycling, there is so much to do there to learn how you can help. And if there's something you want to do that hasn't been started yet it's so easy to start your own movement. Tips for prospective students You will never be able to understand the full potential of this school unless you come up to visit, so definitely do so. Bang for the buck Personally UVM has been very generous with scholarships and loans. I had been fearful",
