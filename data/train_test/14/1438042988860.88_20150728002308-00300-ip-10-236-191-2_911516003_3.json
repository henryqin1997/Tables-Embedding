Narog Project Proposal Abstract: Fire is an important natural disturbance on the four southern California national forests (Los Padres, Angeles, San Bernardino, and Cleveland). Therefore, forest management plans include prescribed burning as a tool to reduce fire hazard and modify habitat in chaparral, woodland and conifet ecosystems. With burgeoning population pressure at the wildland-urban interface, fire and fuels management concerns have intensified. Anthropogenic ignitions and wildland fires that threaten urban areas complicate national forest fire programs. Lack of knowledge about how threatened, endangered, sensitive or proposed (TESP) species respond to fire slows or restricts development of fire and fuels management plans. Furthermore, prescribed fire may differ from natural fire regimes in intensity, severity, and season of burn. Few of the 64 threatened or endangered plant and animal species on southern California national forests (or the many forest-listed sensitive species) are included in the national Fire Effects Information System (FEIS) or the California updates to the FEIS now in progress. Research is needed to develop an infonnation base describing fire effects on southern California TESP species. We propose to compile information on potential fire responses of TESP species and their close relatives from scientific literature and unpublished reports; via field surveys of previously burned known or suitable TESP species habitat; and by implementing collaborative studies with the national forests (involving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, where appropriate) in conjunction with their prescribed",
