In general, it is to be noted that the separate components can have different sizes, except for those elements which serve for interconnecting the components. Thus, for instance, the screws 26 and 41 can have different lengths and cross sections, the bearing element 43 can have different heights, the ulna plate 17 can be flat or curved, and its laterally protruding section 22 can protrude to different extents. Moreover, the anchor 5 can have different sizes. FIG. 15 shows a second embodiment of bearing element 43, this having an axially protruding lug 52 on its concave surface forming the second part 51 of the bearing 4. This lug 52 extends into the groove 16 (FIG. 5) of anchor head 9 and interferes with movement of bearing 4 in the longitudinal direction (arrow 14) (pronation-supination). In contrast, inclination in the transverse direction (arrow 15) remains possible afterwards as before. In this manner, the wrist prosthesis is stabilized in one direction. In addition, the bearing element 43 has a hollowed-out area 50 (FIGS. 3, 13 and 14) on a narrow side, in order to assure that the bearing element 43 does not collide with the head 25 of the ulna screw 26 during pivoting in the longitudinal direction (supination). The side lying opposite to",
