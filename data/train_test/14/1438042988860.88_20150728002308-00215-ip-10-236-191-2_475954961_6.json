    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{42126=The drawings include several embodiments. FIGS. 1a-1c schematically illustrate a cryogenic probe for mapping and ablation of cardiac arrhythmias which may include a Peltier effect thermoelectric heat pump but which preferably operates using a cryogenic fluid such as liquid nitrogen. The probe, shown generally at 10 and 11 in FIG. 1a or 1b, respectively, includes an outer tubular member or sheath 12 which may be of a predetermined curvature or shape as shown at 11 in FIG. 1b or have a controllable flexible deflection section as shown at 13 in FIG. 1a. Outer tubular member or sheath 12 has a handle member 14 attached thereto and integral therewith and the deflection section 13 cooperates with a deflection control mechanism 15 attached to control handle 14. The handle 15 typically controls the tension in associated pull wires attached to the sheath 12 to control fluxure in a well-known manner. Such a control is illustrated and described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,483 dated Aug. 15, 1995 to Boaz Avitall, the inventor in this application, which disclosure is hereby incorporated by reference herein for any necessary purpose. The probe head section may be any of several configurations or sizes as shown at 16 and 17 in the FIGS. 1a and 1b, respectively.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations This invention has been described herein in considerable detail in order to comply with the Patent Statutes and to provide those skilled in the art with the information needed to apply the novel principles and to construct and use embodiments of the example as required. However, it is to be understood that the invention can be carried out by specifically different devices and that various modifications can be accomplished without departing from the scope of the invention itself. After ablation, the tissue is allowed to rewarm and endocardial stimulation is used to attempt to retrigger the VT. If no VT is observed, the mapping/ablation device and sheath may be withdrawn in a well-known manner. When using the subxiphoid accessed epicardial ablation approach, care must be taken to avoid damage or even occlusion of major coronary arteries which traverse the surface of the heart which might occur by applying either cryogenic or RF energy directly over a coronary artery or vein. Once the location of VT circuit is noted, the coronary bed can be injected with contrast medium and biplane fluoroscopy can be used to confirm whether the mapping/ablation electrode or cryogenic devices lies over a major coronary artery. As an alternative, ultrasound crystals can be mounted on the mapping/ablation head to allow detection of flow in a coronary vessel under the head using a Doppler system. Once the area of interest is located, it is then",
