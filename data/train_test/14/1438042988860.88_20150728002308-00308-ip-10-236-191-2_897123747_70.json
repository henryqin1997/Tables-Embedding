            "There is a great greek system here on campus, and a good variety of Fraternities and Sororities .",
            "There are many ways to get involved. Every week, Campus Activities Board sends out an email about upcoming events and club opportunities.",
            "Graduation is held on the Cistern, which is in the center of campus and the girls wear white dresses, and the guys wear white tea coats. If you walk across the Cistern before you graduate, you add another year before you actually graduate.",
            "The whole city of Charleston is around you. You can walk down King Street for a day of shopping, or take the CARTA to the mall. You can also hang out in the three starbucks within a mile of campus.",
            "The food is ok. Its good for cafeteria food, but not top of the line. There are however many restaurants a block away on King street",
            "The dorms are spacious and fun to be in. They are all suite style rooms, so you do not have to worry about hall bathrooms.",
            "The professors are very easy to approach and reach when you are in need of help. The classes can challenge you but can be easy if you work.",
            "Apply right away. Get to know the department heads because they will be able to tell you what do chose for your classes.",
            "The college offers many opportunities when you graduate the college. It is a well rounded school with exceptional and personable professors. The College of Charleston offers more than the college itself due to the location within the city."

The campus is beautiful, the shopping is great, and can you say beach?, 394318=It is amazing, the teachers generally care and are willing to help you learn and understand and enjoy the class. The work load is difficult, but manageable. I have met amazing people here from all over the world and will be sad to graduate in May., 275087=Food is great you can never get tired of it. May need a little old people food but it is not ever bad. Always has different options for food., 34422=Great school, beautiful girls, and awesome weather. its a great college experience. oh and does the ratio 70:30 girls to guys sound good?, 33163=people who like history, partying, or interested in business, hospitality, or Marine BIO. It's primarily a girls school with the 70:30 ratio, works for me :), 625918=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 584270=Living off campus in a house with some friends is ideal for the most fun but they have on campus dorms that are nice as well but get ready to spends 1000 dollars a month or more, 561543=I live is Berry Dorm, which is currently all female. However, in 2014-2015, it will become the Honors Dorm. The rooms are quite long and L shaped. The dorms are nice, the only complaints people have are dependent on their roommate issues. Make sure to fill out the questionnaire and email people, even though it is awkward and like online dating! My room mate and I did it and we are best friends and have never had a single problem or fight! The dorm also has a joining bathroom. The mirror is huge, that is the bonus! The windows do not open in Berry. The walls are drywall, you are not allowed to hammer in or hang things, however, there are holes and everyone hangs pictures anyway. Also the drywall makes it feel homier. Bring plenty of lamps and extension cords because there are no ceiling lights and there are only two 4plug outlets in the corners by the beds. Also bring a shelf for your desk because there is no shelving or drawers connected to the desk. The common room comes with a mini fridge and unless all 4 or 6 people are going to use it, there is really no need to bring another fridge. Other than that, Berry is nice!!, 63928=The graduation ceremony at CofC is quite unusual. Caps and gowns are not worn. Instead, spring graduates wear white dresses / dinner jackets. December graduates wear black dresses / tuxedos.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck College of Charleston is definitely a great buy. It provides excellent housing, dining, professors, and many modern buildings that are all comfortable and conveinent. There are many great organizations and clubs to be a part of as well as sports. CofC has a fantastic location in the heart of Charleston that provides its students with endless entertainment when they are not studying. Am enjoying being here I could not have found a better school for me. I love being fifteen minutes from the beach, and I enjoy the mild winters. I love the historic sceneray and aritechture of the city as well as its true southern history and flair. Am learning a lot The professors at CofC are willing to work with their students in any way possible to make sure they are learning the material and understand how to apply it to everyday life. Small class sizes of about 20 students per class are really helpful in providing one on one time with professors if desired. It's also helful that the professors learn every student by name. Professors are readily available via email and set office hours. Also, most of the professors are willing to meet with students outside of office hours if the student",
