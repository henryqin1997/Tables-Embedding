            "Pitt Police are REAL police officers, they are certified and carry guns, They are not your usual campus police, they have every right to arrest you, not put you in some sort of campus holding cell but really arrest you or anyone else who chooses to break campus rules and state laws. There are emergency phones at each hall and that can be clearly identified with blue lights that call Pitt Police to you.",
            "Pitt has over 35 frats and sororities that include black Greek life, and several multicultural frats and sororities. Freshman are usually withheld from pledging first semester just so they can get into the swing of college. Greek life always has some sort of event, and can definitely be depended on to throw a party every weekend, but manage your time well and don't go to every party!",
            "There are too many clubs to even begin to name them, but before school starts all the clubs are set up throughout the Pete (our basketball arena) and students can walk all around the Pete and sign up for any club that interests them. Of course if your club is not there you can make your own club, you just need at least three members and then you can request for your club to be official.",
            "I can honestly say any type of student, you will find your crowd and you will be able to study almost anything you want. With the school being in the heart of such a busy city internships, and apprentice opportunities are endless.",
            "At every major Pitt event and all football games students sing Sweet Caroline, and after every win for the football team the Cathedral of learning is lit up.",
            "If you need financial aid you must go see the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid at alumni hall, your persistence will definitely get you somewhere. The dean of students, dean Humphries is an amazing woman and she never fails to keep in contact with her students and help them in any way they need.",
            "There are always events being held on campus by some organization; ballet club, African Student Organization, Pitt Program council, the list goes on. There are also tons of sporting event both for the school and for the city's sports teams like the Steelers, the Penguins, and the Pirates. And of course Greek life never fails to entertain whether it be parties of fundraising events, but one thing is for sure you can always find something to do.",
            "When I visited Pitt the food was amazing, but after starting the school year I learned that management had changed and that was the reason for the food's lack of luster but that just goes for market central. you can find other dining services on campus and a part of your meal plan such as Taco Bell, Chic-Fil-A, Burger King, Fresh Sushi, Pizza Hut, and tons more. But with those places you must use your dining dollars, so when you get your meal plan make sure you choose a plan with more dining dollars than dining swipes, it gives you more variety for food.",
            "With all the hustle and bustle you will rarely be in your dorm room, but dorm life is comfortable. Panther Central helps you with all things related to your dorm hall. Your RA will also be very helpful and plan events for you throughout the school year in order to help you get to know the Pitt campus a little better as well as meet new people. As a freshman if you live in Towers, cleaning services will be provided to you once a day as the bathrooms are shared by the floor-which are based on sex.",
            "You must be very focused, especially if you are in any science based courses. The University of Pittsburgh is ranked #58 by U.S. news as a public research school in the nation, and professors have no problem telling you that certain courses are weed out courses that are meant to distinguish the determined from the unwilling.",
            "Please make sure to really explore your academic resources. So many students, including myself, have had a poor first semester due to lack of knowledge and use of all the academic resources available for them. Honestly you can always make up for missed social events, but your grades keep you in school so please do not be afraid to use every resource you can to ensure your enrollment.",
            "Academically the university is rigorous and the degree you receive will weigh nicely. socially it is an up and coming city that is filled with events and other colleges that also offer events. School has great spirit; sports events, concerts, art productions, just overall pride in being a panther."

It might not be New York or L.A., but it's pretty close and has just about everything you'd expect from a city., 751244=Put yourself out there as much as you can in your first week. It's a big school and is easy to get lost in, so being involved can really make your experience 1000 times better., 415963=I feel very safe. Especially after the bomb threats during the Spring of 2012 semester., 270404=There's a lot of review in most below-1000-level classes if you've taken a course on it before (in high school, for example) but it's worth it and the teachers do build on it. Once you get to the upper levels it's mostly new knowledge., 170674=At the University of Pittsburgh, there is a large Arena called the Peterson Events Center, otherwise known as the Pete. There is a large field outside right outside there and every year, Univ. of Pittsburgh plans an event for Freshman students to break a world record of some sort. This past year of 2012, Univ. of Pittsburgh Class of 2016 broke the world record of the largest uniformed dance with umbrellas dancing to the Cupid Shuffle for 6 minutes. This field is also known by students to play Ultimate Frisbee, Croquet, Football, Volleyball, Tanning, etc., 526885=Definitely study, study, study. Join as many clubs as you can handle in high school. Keep your GPA above a 3.5, and aim for at least a 1200 on the math and reading section of the SAT, and you will be guaranteed entrance to the University., 1013494=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 601016=The Cathedral of Learning (42 stories, 535 feet tall, 2529 windows) is the largest academic building in the United States. The building is Pitt's landmark and provides wonderful views of campus from the Unversity Honors College on the 35th and 36th floors., 220278=If you're in-state, you're definitely getting a good deal. Pitt is just as good as private schools that charge twice as much. Obviously the out of state tuition is one of the highest in the country, but I still think it's a pretty decent deal. You get so many opportunities that small schools don't offer. The free bus pass alone retails for over $1600.}",

If you want to do anything in the medical field, Pitt offers a great Pre-Med curriculum, in addition to having 2 hospitals close by, which are affiliated with Pitt. Pitt also boasts strong social work and teaching programs. Tips for prospective students Apply early, and check out the guaranteed grad school section of the application page. You can get guaranteed admission to the medical, law, and pharmacy schools, if you qualify. Bang for the buck Pitt, though expensive, offers an incredible experience to those who make the most of it. The professors at Pitt are top notch, incredible researchers who can enrich typical classes with cutting edge findings from their own research. The dorms are of above average quality, and the food is",
