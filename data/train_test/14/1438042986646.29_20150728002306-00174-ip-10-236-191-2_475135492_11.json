    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29084=The usual route for making a manufacturable laser diode system is to use electrical injection rather than optical pumping to create the necessary population inversion in the active region of the device. This is the case for inorganic systems since their optically pumped thresholds (P. L. Gourley et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 54, 1209 [1989]) for broad-area devices are on the order of 104 W/cm2. Such high power densities can only be achieved by using other lasers as the pump sources, precluding that route for inorganic laser cavities. Unpumped organic laser systems have greatly reduced combined scattering and absorption losses (\u02dc0.5 cm\u22121) at the lasing wavelength, especially when one employs a host-dopant combination as the active media. As a result, optically pumped power density thresholds below 1 W/cm2 should be attainable, especially when a VCSEL-based microcavity design is used in order to minimize the active volume (which results in lower thresholds). The importance of power density thresholds below 1 W/cm2 is that it becomes possible to optically pump the laser cavities with inexpensive, off-the-shelf, incoherent LED's., 26246=Reference is made to commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 6,687,274 filed Feb. 4, 2002 entitled \u201cOrganic Vertical Cavity Phase-Locked Laser Array Device\u201d by Keith B. Kahen., 27269=Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) based on inorganic semiconductors (e.g. AlGaAs) have been developed since the mid-80's (K. Kinoshita et al., IEEE J. Quant. Electron. QE-23, 882 [1987]). They have reached the point where AlGaAs-based VCSELs emitting at 850 nm are manufactured by a number of companies and have lifetimes beyond 100 years (K. D. Choquette et al., Proc. IEEE 85, 1730 [1997]). With the success of these near-infrared lasers in recent years, attention has turned to other inorganic material systems to produce VCSELs emitting in the visible wavelength range (C. Wilmsen et al., Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2001). There are many fruitful applications for visible lasers, such as, display, optical storage reading/writing, laser printing, and short-haul telecommunications employing plastic optical fibers (T. Ishigure et al., Electron. Lett. 31, 467 [1995]). In spite of the worldwide efforts of many industrial and academic laboratories, much work remains to be done to create viable laser diodes (either edge emitters or VCSELs) which span the visible spectrum., 40763=The active region 130 could be deposited directly over the etched surface of the bottom dielectric stack 120; however, this would result in the active region 130 and top dielectric stack 140 being deposited on a non-planar (corrugated) surface. For certain multilayer stack combinations, such as, TiO2\u2014SiO2, deposition on a corrugated surface can lead to columnar growth of the stacks. As a result, there is enhanced scattering losses in the top dielectric stack 140 and possibly also in the active region 130. To overcome this problem, the etched surface of the bottom dielectric stack 120 is planarized by a planarization layer 155 prior to depositing the active region 130. One embodiment of the planarization layer 155 is polyimide for the Ta2O5\u2014SiO2 or TiO2\u2014SiO2 multilayer stack systems. Following the creation of the etched regions 150, 2 to 3 microns of polyimide are deposited on the surface of the bottom dielectric stack 120 by spin casting and then hardened by a bake at temperatures ranging from 180 to 250\ufffd C. Next using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques which are well-known in the art, the polyimide is polished until it is flush (or within a couple tens of nanometers) with the top surface of the bottom dielectric stack 120 at the positions of the laser pixels 200. Because of the large difference in the polish rates of polyimide and oxides in standard CMP slurries, it is straightforward to have the polishing stop just as it begins to polish the oxide layers at the positions of the laser pixels 200. A second embodiment of the planarization layer 155 is SiO2 for the Ta2O5\u2014SiO2 multilayer dielectric stack system. In this case, the final layer of the bottom dielectric stack 120 is a thin layer of Si3N4. The silicon nitride can be deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at a temperature range of 300\u2013400\ufffd C. and in a thickness range of 10 to 200 nm. Following the formation of the etched region 150 (where the etch goes through the nitride layer and 1 to 2 periods of the bottom dielectric stack 120), the planarization layer 155 of SiO2 is deposited at a thickness of 0.75 to 2.0 \u03bcm by either CVD or thermal evaporation. As for the polyimide embodiment, CMP is used with another common slurry to polish the SiO2 until it is flush (or within a couple tens of nanometers) with the top of the silicon nitride layer. As result of a polish selectivity of greater than 3.5:1, it is again straightforward to stop the polishing as it begins to polish the top of the silicon nitride layer. A third embodiment of the planarization layer 155 is polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) for any multilayer dielectric stack system. In this case PMMA is spun cast over the etched surface of the bottom dielectric stack 120 to a thickness range of 0.5 to 3.0 \u03bcm, followed by a conventional bake at 150 to 220\ufffd C. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images reveal that a 3:1 or 4:1 PMMA thickness to etch depth ratio typically results in the planarization of the PMMA surface. Besides these three embodiments for planarization, other methodologies are possible as practiced by those skilled in the art. In summary, the addition of the planarization layer 155 following the creation of the etched regions 150 and prior to the deposition of the active region 130, leads to less scattering loss in the active region 130 and top dielectric stack 140 and results in higher power conversion efficiencies., 78671=The dopant is selected to provide emission between 300\u20131700 nm. The dopant can be selected from fluorescent or phosphorescent dyes. Useful fluorescent dopants include materials as described as host materials above.

Derivatives of these classes of materials can also serve as useful host materials or combinations thereof. Host materials will often be compounds containing at least three phenylene moieties.}",
