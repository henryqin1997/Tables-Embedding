This school gives you the knowledge to be successful in whichever area you're interested in. And the have quite a lot of engineering departments. Nerds. Hard workers. Team players. Hands-on learners. Boy to Girl ration - 5:1 - Ladies, must I say anymore?, 112568=There are a lot more guys than girls at this university. Freshmen and Sophomores are ~3:2, after that age group, the ratio drops to ~4:1., 202016=I have visted S&T during one of there miner days and plan to attend Fall of 2013. I'm so excited about going to this school. I love the student body size and the courses offered., 31155=I enjoy MS&T for the most part, but there are a few things that aren't so great about it. The work load seems to really build up sometimes and the Male to Female ratio is 3:1 to name a few. Things like the annual St. Pat's celebration always make up for stuff like that though.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot In the math class I took, I learned an interesting learning style; the math I'd had before in High School (like in a summary) but I learned how to make things stick very well in MS&T's math class. My focus is in Computer Science. While I've had programming experience before, the pace of the class is incredible and by the end of Semester One we are now pretty much at the extent of my knowledge. So, given the pace we were at, I expect to learn a lot Semester Two.
