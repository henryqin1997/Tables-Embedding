The pools were great, especially for kids. We stayed a week 8/13-8/20/11 and had a total of 9 people with us and it was very comfortable. Having it on the first floor is great also, easy access to the pools and beach. My 2 year old daughter loved the pools there. We are definitely going back next year.",
