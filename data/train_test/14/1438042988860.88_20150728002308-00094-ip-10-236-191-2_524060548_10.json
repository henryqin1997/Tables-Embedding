This allows the BIOS to read the SPD data and program the chipset to accurately configure memory settings for optimum performance. 1.5 V is the recommended and default setting for DDR3 memory voltage. The other memory voltage settings in the BIOS Setup program are provided for performance tuning purposes only. Altering the memory voltage may (i) reduce system stability and the useful life of the system, memory, and processor; (ii) cause the processor and other system components to fail; (iii) cause reductions in system performance; (iv) cause additional heat or other damage; and (v) affect system data integrity. Intel has not tested and does not warranty the operation of the processor beyond its specifications. For information on the processor warranty, see the Processor Warranty Information. Intel assumes no responsibility that the memory installed on the desktop board, if used with altered clock frequencies and/or voltages, will be fit for any particular purpose. Check with the memory manufacturer for warranty terms and additional details. Supported memory configurations DIMM slots are numbered in installation order XMP performance profile support for memory speeds above 1600 MHz DDR3 2400 MHz, 2133 MHz, 1866 MHz, 1600 MHz, 1333 MHz, and 1066 MHz SDRAM DIMMs Serial Presence Detect Non-ECC and ECC DIMMs Minimum total system memory:",
