The lows at night during these months are on average 80 to 85 degrees, so that means in the daytime expect temps to be around 105 and 115. If you survive the first summer, your a champ, the second summer you sweat through, you are acclimated. Meaning, if temps fall below say, 75 degrees, like in the spring or early winter, you will be freezing and wearing your hoodie. After the 3rd summer you are a professional., 225878=The college is affordable my costs are about 1500 a semester., 619372=I will give this school a 5 out of 5. There are 5 locations plus online courses that can be taken at College of Southern Nevada. I have taken weekend classes, online, and as late as 10:30 pm classes. The instructor's and professors are very thorough and hands on. They usually will go far and beyond to make certain that the information is being received clearly., 466581=Hey I live in Las Vegas, what can I say......there is ALWAYS something to do! The strip is about 20 minutes away from the CHY and CHRL campus. But again, that's not the only place to have fun! Las Vegas is like any other city in the US. Beware of the months between June and October ..... the is the desert. Temps range from 90 to 120 degrees. Some weeks are above 105 daily. The evenings are fantastic though!, 26893=I met some of my best friends for life at CSN! Not to mention the opportunities there are in the school. I was able to intern with Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign through the school as well as find my first ever job., 236570=Try to arrange your schedule in the best way possible; so many new students decide to enroll in a class at 10:00 am and not have another class until noon, the time in between is wasted (unless you do your homework from your first class). Also, there are more than one CSN campus so pay close attention when signing up for classes (you don't want the stress of driving back and forth, campus to campus.) Also, always make extra copies of documents when going to meet with an advisor (they have a habit of losing papers)., 49880=I began attending CSN in Fall 2008 and so far it has been a great school to attend too. Especially a far as community colleges go. I have learned so much with just the few classes I have taken to this point and I'm truly excited to continue on. Teaching methods to differ between teachers, so if you can, talk to the professor and fellow students about the class., 624881=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Food and Dining The three campuses only offer a couple choices for food, but the food is not too bad for cafeteria food. There is a small cafe on every campus so you can get your coffee fix in the morning, and Russel's restaurant at the Cheyenne campus is very good. Dorm Life There are no dorms at this school, it's a community college. Academic Rigor This is only a two year college, so you only have basic general education, plus a few specified degrees like nursing or hospitality management. Tips for prospective students It is easy to choose which instructor you get, so look them up first. Also get to class a little early, parking is horrible here. Try to take on campus classes instead of online, the instructors are more dependable. In three sentences CSN has a good amount of classes, good teachers, and a pretty helpful counseling center. It is very easy to get into classes, no crashing required ever. As far as community colleges go, College of Southern Nevada is a good school. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
