After cooling to 20-25\ufffd C., the organic layer is discarded and the aqueous layer is again extracted with MTBE (37 kg). The organic layer is discarded and the aqueous solution of the sodium salt is heated to 70-80\ufffd C. and the residual MTBE is removed by distillation. The solution is then cooled to 60-70\ufffd C. To this solution is added a solution of calcium acetate hemihydrate (1.91 kg) dissolved in water/methanol (72 L water+16 L methanol). The mixture is seeded with crystalline Form I atorvastatin (180 g) shortly after addition of the calcium acetate solution. The mixture is heated at 65-75\ufffd C. for at least 5 minutes and then cooled to 50-55\ufffd C. The mixture is filtered and slurried in methanol (about 200 L) at 55-65\ufffd C. and then cooled to 25-30\ufffd C. and filtered.
