Augmented Reality Project, here's an idea that I think we can do on the Beagle. Rather than using augmented reality glasses, I'd suggest we use a TI DLP pico projector. Here's AR running on the Beagle. Official list of Beagle Projects, there are many Beagle specific projects listed here. Many are inactive. List your project here once it running. ETechDays Community Lightning Talks, this is a one-day web-based conference where many project ideas are presented. One of our 2009-2010 senior design projects was found here. Here are some links where you'll find ideas for your project.
