            "UAA campus is very safe for me because there are students walking to class every where. I might not know them but walking with a lot of students is better than alone by yourself.",
            "Greek Life? I am not sure what it is?",
            "Students at UAA are always involving in their clubs or activities. I am not in one of the clubs at all but I hope to join one sooner or later. Every where I walk on campus you will see flyers or students sitting and posting their poster about clubs events that you can join. Also doing a fundraiser, UAA students will sell cookies, muffins, or doughnuts to get a little money to go on a trip.",
            "UAA is great for anyone who wants to learn and ready to search for their career.",
            "There's no unusual traditions on locations on campus but if you are trying to find for a certain location on campus then you won't be able to get lost at all. Like I said, UAA is big for me but you will find you way around because most of the building connect to each other. I know there is a native organization on campus, very interesting and programs like How to succeed in College. Cool stuff that you can attend and learn more about it.",
            "Books and sometimes food/ beverages are expensive. But UAA has the cheapest tuition that I know of.",
            "Usually while I'm on my break waiting for next class to start; I will go eat with my friends and we will just talk and talk about life, school or work. I know it sounds boring but its really interesting when you hear about it. But sometimes I will be either reading my book for a class or doing my homework too.",
            "Since I don't live on campus, I don't know the difference of on campus dining and food and not on campus dining and food. But I do know that I purchase my lunch at UAA their Cuddy Hall and I love all the food over there.",
            "I don't know about the dorm's life because I don't live in campus but out campus because my house is very close to UAA, so I rather save the money and just stay in my house.",
            "Academic Classes are awesome, popular class like Human Anatomy and Physiology are always puts in big rooms, so basically when you walk in it's like you are walking to a dance ball or something. But I still love the big room and its not hard to hear the professor at all because they talk with a microphone, very cool.",
            "Take a visit to RateMyProfessor.com and you will know which professor is good at teaching. I had use that website for my current class and trust me I am totally loving the class and I all A's in all of my classes. Very good tips to check it out before registering for your classes.",
            "University of Alaska Anchorage is a big college for me. I love the fact where all UAA students work well together, they are always positive, and friendly. The professors always know what they are doing, when there is no class they will make sure that you know there is no class, and the professors are great at lecture and try not to make it boring at all."

The entire campus is very focused on student success, student engagement, and student enjoyment. Tips for prospective students 1. Involve yourself. When you get involved, you feel more comfortable with your campus, and are more willing to ask questions, get assistance, and realize all of the many ways that UAA can help you. 2. Talk to your advisor. Your advisor can help not only with your current problems, but can also prevent future ones. Bang for the buck UAA has always been really inexpensive, compared to other universities. Even though the price is being raised, it is still a great price, and very affordable. UAA is also great at helping students find scholarships to help make the costs even more practical. Am enjoying being here UAA has so many opportunities",
