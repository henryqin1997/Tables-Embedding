It's great for those who would like the feel of a small city with the option of easily traveling to the Big City at any given moment. There are a lot of employment opportunities in the area so if you are a student looking to work during your college years, Berkeley is a good choice. Tips for prospective students Visit the school first and see how you feel. It is not a typical college campus because the city of White Plains IS the campus. Be prepared to make a few trips to the school prior to the start of term because there are a lot of things that get left to the last minute or come up after you",
