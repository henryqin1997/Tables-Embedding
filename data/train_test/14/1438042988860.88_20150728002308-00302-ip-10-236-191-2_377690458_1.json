Stoke defender Carl Hoefkens knows that Micky Adams' side are a different proposition from when the Potters won 2-1 at the Ricoh Arena in November and told his club's website: 'Since we have played them they have changed their team a lot so we have to be aware of them.' That meeting in November was overshadowed by a row between Stoke boss Johan Boskamp and his assistant Jan de Koning, who reportedly discussed tactics with director of football John Rudge without Boskamp's knowledge. The row has yet to be fully resolved. De Koning left the club recently but there is still uncertainty over whether Boskamp will still be there next season.}",
