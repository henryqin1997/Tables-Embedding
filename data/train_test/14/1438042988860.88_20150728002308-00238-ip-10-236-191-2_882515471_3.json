    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6934=After weeks of speculation the announcement was finally made official, sealing the deal that will let Aerosmith tear up the road with Slash (aka former lead guitarist of Guns N' Roses) later this year. This after Aerosmith's Joe Perry tweeted in late March, \"It's official \u2013 we just talked, AEROSMITH/SLASH USA tour confirmed!! Tickets on sale next few wks Soon as dates confirmed. LET ROCK RULE !\", 5993=Aerosmith and Slash have a storied history together. Guns N' Roses opened for Aerosmith on their U.S. tour all the way back in the summer of 1988. It was during that tour that the bands played New Jersey's Giants Stadium, where part of the famed \"Paradise City\" video was filmed. Four years later, Steven Tyler joined Guns N' Roses onstage during a concert in Paris for \"Mama Kin,\" a song Guns covered on their debut EP, \"Live Like a Suicide.\" And most recently, Slash joined Tyler onstage for a private concert in New York City., 4709=Indeed, Aerosmith had a wicked kickoff to the turn of the century by playing the Super Bowl halftime show and releasing scores of new projects tagged with the band's name (including live album/DVDs and a greatest hits collection). But they hit a speed bump following a world tour in 2009, with work on a new studio album consistently delayed. Tyler suffered a leg injury after falling off a stage that August, starting a string of incidents for the band that would eventually lead to members pursuing solo work instead of focusing on the band., 4148=It was amidst a series of concerts in 2010 that Tyler announced he would be a new judge on FOX's \"American Idol.\" It was a short-lived gig, but helped to further raise the band's profile in time for the release of the album \"Music from Another Dimension!\" on November 6, 2012. Two days later, the band began the 2nd leg of their Global Warming Tour that extended into 2013., 2575=After nearly 50 years together, Aerosmith is still going strong. The rock Gods from Boston have just announced the \"Blue Army\" tour, which will begin in June and take place throughout the summer. The first show kicks off on June 13 at the Gila River Arena in Glendale, AZ, and currently the last stop is\u2026, 7582=The band's 2015 itinerary now includes at least seven summer dates, kicking off June 27 in Oklahoma and ending July 22 in Wyoming. (The most recently announced concerts are scheduled to take place on July 3 in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and July 19 in Fort McMurray, Canada). Fans can also catch the band's new concert film, \"Aerosmith Rocks Donington 2014,\" which will have a limited engagement in theaters through Feb. 26., 3737=The legendary rockers are slated to play shows in Dunedin, New Zealand and Sydney, Brisband and Melbourne, Australia in April and May. It marks their first visit to the 'Land Down Under' in 24 years., 3484=Since 1972 this American Rock band has been delivering the Rock-n-Roll goods and increasinging their popularity throughout the world. These \"Bad Boys from Boston\" have come a long way, winning countless Grammys, American Music and MTV Awards. Aerosmith has grown but never strayed far from their signature style of propulsive Rock welded to soulful American Rock-n-Roll and powered by the pumping beats of Joey Kramer to match the intensity of their guitar driven core of Whitford and Joe Perry all capped off with legendary rocker Steven Tyler on vocals. Get Aerosmith tickets to watch this legendary band live in concert., 6294=The official announcement finally came April 7 as part of a press gathering to promote Aerosmith's world tour, which will begin May 14th in Istanbul, Turkey (Slash and his band the Conspirators will be the supporting acting on the North American leg beginning July 10th in New York).}",
