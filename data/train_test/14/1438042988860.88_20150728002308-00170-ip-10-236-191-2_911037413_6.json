    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Future interested students should know that URG is in a small town location. There is only a Bob Evans, McDonald's, Subway and a Dollar General Store in Rio Grande, plus a local bar called Jimanetti's. To eat anywhere else you have to travel about 15 minutes into Gallipolis to get to more fast food chains and Walmart or Kmart. Most of the teachers you will have more than once, especially if that teacher is teaching a specific major. The campus isn't very big but there are still enough people to make friends. I didn't live in the dorms but from what I hear it might pay off more to go to a campus with nicer dorms unless you are commuting. URG is ideal for commuter students if they don't mind the drive because of the cheap cost. Also, I had a lot of problems with the advising office. If you declare a major when you apply to URG you will be given an advisor based on your major who you are supposed to confront concerning class scheduling each semester. The advisor will appear on the home page of your student space. But watch out for classes that have prerequisites because some advisers won't realize this and then when you go to schedule classes online you realize you have to rearrange your schedule due to this. I had this problem both semesters I was at URG. Don't purchase books until",
