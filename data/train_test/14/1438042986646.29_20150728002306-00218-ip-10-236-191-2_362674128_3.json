It was revealed in System Defender Level 6 that Herbert had been hiding out at the Toughest Mountain. The EPF attacked his hideout at The Great Snow Race, and put him into hibernation. Klutzy managed to escape however., 21952=On April 5, 2013 Herbert attacked the Pizza Parlor and stole the giant hot sauce bottle, and attempted to repurpose the Solar Laser from Operation: Blackout for an unknown purpose. Operation: Hot Sauce commenced to find the culprit. On November 30th, 2013 during the Operation: Puffle he was found in a new lair behind the Ice Falls. At this lair he had Puffles under mind control bringing him coins. After his defeat the Puffles took him off to an unknown location. Klutzy also escaped. Herbert has not been seen since., 11968=Over time, he soon grew to despise penguins. Klutzy was caught in mission 5, but he got away in the Questions for a crab mission. In the sixth mission, Herbert, along with Klutzy, try to destroy the Ski Lodge in one of his schemes to both keep warm and harm the penguins. However, he still escapes. Also in Mission 6, he tells agents his story about his life. If players click on the letter in G's pocket in the newspaper (April 11, 2008 edition) and you turn all the puffles black then you will see a letter Herbert has written to the players saying that \"time\" is about to run out, resulting in mission 7 in which he makes the clock malfunction by taking out certain parts of it, including the main gear., 18574=Herbert then betrayed the EPF after helping them defeat Protobot by causing the Battle of Doom on the Everyday Phoning Facility rooftop, where he tried to use the Hydra from the Medieval Party 2011 to destroy the EPF as he did with the PSA., 24410=Herbert P. Bear has made machines to arouse chaos in Club Penguin Island. He often rebuilds inventions that are used for parties. He has made a Mechanical Woodchopper, an Earthquake Driller (using Club Penguin's Clock Prime Gear), and he put together the Electromagnet 3000 with Gary's stolen blueprints. He also created the \"Popcorn Time Bomb\" which destroyed the PSA's HQ and rebuilt the Ultimate Proto-Bot 10000. He also rebuilt the Hydra, probably after the Medieval Party in 2011. In Operation Blackout he then created the Solar Laser, which stole sunlight all for himself., 17841=In January 2011, he appeared in level 2 of System Defender, a game in the EPF Command Room. He also re-builds the Ultimate Proto-Bot, which also appears as a level in System Defender. From January 2011 - May 2011, Protobot and Herbert had teamed up to attack the EPF. However, Herbert temporarily helped the EPF severely damage Protobot in Field-Op 44, because Herbert wanted to defeat the EPF, not destroy them (which was Protobot's goal)., 20252=After all of the previous events, Herbert became a little bit smarter and scarier, too. His plans became more serious and he was seen as a little bit more of a threat. In the PSA missions and DS games, his plans were a little bit goofy, and wasn't seen as much of a threat to the PSA. He was more of an annoyance, but still a large enemy. That slowly started to change after The Popcorn Explosion and the EPF was the main agency of Club Penguin. During Operation: Blackout, Herbert showed Club Penguin what he was really capable of. On October 10th, 2012, he finally returned and made a twitter [4] giving warnings that he was back and that he would launch Operation: Blackout soon, which would destroy the EPF once and for all. On November 7, 2012 Herbert broke into Gary's lab and kidnaps Gary and later froze him in a container to pay back for Operation: Hibernation. On November 15, 2012, Herbert destroyed the Everyday Phoning Facility and EPF Command Room, used the Solar Laser to take all the sunlight for his lair. He called himself as Illustrious Leader Supreme of Club Penguin, and began to kidnap several agents throughout the rest of Operation: Blackout. He was eventually defeated on November 24th, 2012, and then he went into hiding after the event ended., 15703=Herbert doesn't know about the Elite Penguin force until the events of Suspect at Large. While the player is in Herbert's Hideout, Herbert is measuring the Ice Rink to make a hole. As soon as Herbert was done, he immanently went back to his hideout. Herbert meets the player thinking they're Klutzy. When Herbert learns the player has stolen his plans to warm up Club Penguin. Although Herbert closes the main exit, the player escapes anyway. When Rookie, Dot, Jet Pack Guy and the Elite Puffles find the hole Herbert made at the Stadium, Herbert captures them and takes them to the Tallest Mountain. After the player rescues all the members that were captured they meet up with Herbert on the top of Tallest Mountain in his Hot Air balloon with a huge magnifying glass. Although the agents stop Herbert, a huge crash is heard. A geyser sprouts from the Mine Shack. While Herbert tries to escape his balloon his hit with the geyser and crashed at the Ski Village. Shortly after Herbert crash lands, Jet Pack Guy finds him tied up in his balloon. The player then helps Klutzy help Herbert get out of the balloon's mess. Herbert claims after that he won't get outwith out proper water gear. After the player gives Herbert the water gear he, will get out and help the agents. When the player repairs Herbert's balloon, he floats to his hideout and takes his Herbert statue to put on the geyser to stop it once and for all. The super helium becomes overpowered and sends Herbert flying away. Nothing is heard from Herbert until June 2010., 19826=At the beginning of May 2012 Herbert steals Cream Soda for his Sticky Cream Soda Bomb of Doom to bomb Club Penguin. Later his plan backfires and Herbert's hideout gets blown up, as shown in the short Puffle Trouble., 23130=In a blog post containing a June 2015 Club Penguin calendar, various bear footprints were seen stamped in the calendar.[5] On June 8, 2015, Tato Maxx reported in a blog post that various Spanish players reported seeing Herbert walking throughout the island.[6] These appearances could lead to Herbert returning during the June 2015 EPF Training.}",

Oddly enough, in the EPF files,[8] there is a photo of Herbert holding up a picture of one of the Frozen Party rooms,[9] instead of a picture of The Director[10], though Herbert did not show up during the Frozen Party. According to his Twitter, he had a neighbor named Dave. He has appeared in the Halloween Party 2013 trailer with plans for Operation: Puffle. If you click on his player card, for a split second it will show him as an aqua penguin with no clothes. Herbert has made appearances in multiple Club Penguin Animated Shorts and Videos, including Rock-a-bye Herbert, Best Seat in the House, Puffle Trouble, The Party Starts Now!, and Ghosts Just Wanna Dance. He used to be on the Club Penguin homepage after the August update in 2011, but has been removed due to the fact he was in hibernation at that time. However, for a short time, Herbert was on the",
