Other tracks like \"Madison Square\" and \"Ziggowatt\" are more futuristic, while \"Bowler\" is said to be well-suited for a live audience. The band toured coast-to-coast in 2011, then conquered the east coast of the U.S. in late 2012.

They cited influences of various other funk bands including Earth, Wind and Fire and Tower of Power, and eventually began playing together in Boston jazz clubs in the fall of 1994. The band's name stems from asking club owners and other musicians if they would \"Let us play?\", spawing the name Lettuce., 1911=Lettuce Tour Dates Concerts Videos Lettuce Tour The funkadelic sounds of powerhouse band Lettuce will be hitting the road this winter.
