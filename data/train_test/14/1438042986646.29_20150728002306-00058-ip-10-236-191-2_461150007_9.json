    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Increasing amounts of business are conducted on mixed channels\u2014with a caller on the line also looking at his browser where a staff member is highlighting terms and conditions on a competitor's web-site. Regulatory bodies have only just began to be aware of potential loop-holes in rules that insist on voice recording only. Where communication involves multiple channels it is vital that all channels are recorded together, archived together and replayable together. More recently, this concept has been increasingly used in call centres to review maybe 1% of calls to see how customer service reps are using the computer system during phone calls. For example, while programmers first introduced \u201clog files\u201d into specific applications as diagnostic aids to help them understand how someone broke their program, and from the concept of being able to note everything that happened on a PC goes back to the venerable tools like \u201cPC Anywhere\u201d it was a fairly small step from there to keeping a log file of everything that happened on the screen during your session. Whilst the concept of the wire-tapping of telephone lines is well known, the use of a PC can also be monitored. The ability to go back through all calls made after the event by identified terrorists can have a significant effect on follow-up operations. This capability could be added to every cellular base station, every central office",
