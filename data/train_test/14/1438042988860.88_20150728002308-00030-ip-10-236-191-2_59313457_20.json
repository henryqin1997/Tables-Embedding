Iloprost consists of a mixture of the 4R and 4S diastereoisomers at a ratio of approximately 53:47. Iloprost is an oily substance, which is soluble in methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, and pH 7 buffer, sparingly soluble in buffer pH 9, and very slightly soluble in distilled water, buffer pH 3, and buffer pH 5. The molecular formula of iloprost is C22H32O4. Its relative molecular weight is 360.49. The structural formula is shown below:, 63014=Most common (\u22653% placebo adjusted) adverse reactions are vasodilation (flushing), cough increased, headache, trismus, insomnia, nausea, hypotension, vomiting, alkaline phosphatase increased, flu syndrome, back pain, tongue pain, palpitations, syncope, GGT increased, muscle cramps, hemoptysis, and pneumonia (6.1). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actelion at 1-866-228-3546 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch., 60346=Revised: 11/2013, 29700=Ventavis has not been evaluated in subjects with impaired hepatic function. However, in an intravenous iloprost study in patients with liver cirrhosis, the mean clearance in Child- Pugh Class B subjects (n=5) was approximately 10 mL/min/kg (half that of healthy subjects). Following oral administration, the mean AUC0-8h in Child-Pugh Class B subjects (n=3) was 1725 pg*h/mL compared to 117 pg*h/mL in normal subjects (n=4) receiving the same oral iloprost dose. In Child-Pugh Class A subjects (n=5), the mean AUC0-8h was 639 pg*h/mL. Although exposure increased with hepatic impairment, there was no effect on half-life.}",
