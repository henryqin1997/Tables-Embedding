Paul I'm happy to say I was initially wrong about them and realise that they may be one of the current bands that can carry 'our' music forward. They also have a lot of great support bands too. I had the chance to see them last year in Manchester with Daughtry. Someone my wife works with had tickets but couldn't go so me and my son went as he loves them. I went with absolutely no expectations and partly just so my son could see them at an arena show. From the first minute, I was absolutely hooked. They had 'the' best live sound I've ever heard and Chad Kroeger is really funny, personable and a great frontman, not the dour Kurt Kobain wanna be that I thought he was. I wasn't what you'd call a Nickelback fan up until Dark Horse. To me, I though they were a miserable down tuned grunge band. Working with Mutt Lange peaked my interest and when I heard Dark Horse, I loved it. Then, I went and discovered their back catalogue, which, from Silver Side Up onwards I love!",
