To create the estimates, a multilevel logistic regression model with both state-and nested country-level random effects for obesity prevalence was developed using data from the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Post-stratification with the US Census 2010 counts of census-block populations was applied to the models to generate census-block level estimates which were then aggregated to a county level. A detailed description of the methodology is described in Zhang et al.1}",
