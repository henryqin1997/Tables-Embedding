Tips for prospective students If you expect to go to a school in the city and party all the time do not come to Alcorn. If you expect to just party do not come to Alcorn because education comes first and the administrators will not mind sending you home because you flunked out. Bang for the buck Alcorn does not have the best dorms, buildings, etc., but it is a great school. Am enjoying being here",
