            "There are many different clubs and activities that one can get involved with. Their are academic clubs and societies that will push one to strive for excellence in your studies, such as Kappa Delta Pi, the International Honors Society for Education Majors. There are also clubs such as Speak That, which is for those who love poetry and spoken word. There is also a Humans Vs. Zombies club. Furthermore, there are many things to do off campus, such as volunteering at different places, going to a drive-in movie theater, or a park. There are many things to do in downtown Lakeland, and Disney and other fun places like that, are a short drive away.",
            "Tuscana has a great selection of food to choose from at each meal. Many people complain that it is the same food every day, but that isn't completely true. Several of the stations have the same food because that is just what their station is. But even in those stations there is a variety of choices. There is also a Chick Fil A Express on campus now which is awesome. One can also buy snacks and such in Mi Casa.",
            "Bethany isn't so bad. It can become noisy which can get annoying, but it is a community-style living space, after all. If you want something more private, definitely look at one of the other residence halls. However, everyone is very kind for the most part and fun to be around. There are limitations on your decorating, but you're still able to show your creativity and express yourself in your room. Your own personal air conditioner is also extremely nice.",
            "SEU offers excellent courses that will challenge you to do your best work, but the courses are not so difficult that passing is unattainable. The professors also present challenging material and discussions, but they are always willing to help a student in need.",
            "Don't feel pressured to get involved. When other students urge you to join a club or help out with some department, don't feel that you have to do it. Take things at your own pace and don't make yourself unnecessarily uncomfortable.",
            "Southeastern has an amazing environment for learning and socializing. The professors are caring and willing to help students be successful. There are also a plethora of activities and clubs to become involved with on campus."

This May we are even being visited by Tim Tebow of the Denver Broncos! Always be on the lookout for exciting events!, 207118=Security watch is 24/7. There is a campus curfew all students under 21 must be back on campus by 1:00 am., 249510=SEU Conference is another amazing part of this great college. Every year Southeastern University holds a conference for all the students, and they invite public speakers as well as the SEU worship band along with many other artists. It is normally at the beginning of the year in the month of February, and is a time for the students to learn more, be in community more, and just have a fun time., 30137=I went on a tour of the school in March and the campus was beautiful. It looked like we were on a resort or a fancy mall in Italy. Everything was gorgeous. Bethany hall is where most freshman reside but after I saw how small the dorms where I knew that I would not be staying there. Don't get me wrong, it was a beautiful building but the dorms where very tiny. You have to share a small closet with your roommate so you won't be able to bring as much stuff as you would like. I felt claustrophobic. Esperanza hall was like a Italian hotel. It was beautiful. It also had more than enough space for me. You get your own closet and the room is big. The closets aren't tiny either., 31107=I have no idea personally since I have just been accepted. I will be attending and moving into dorms August 16. But I do hear that the premed program is topnotch which I am happy about seeing as that will be my major and focus point., 251768=Southeastern University has many different dining options for their on-campus students. They have many different options for different students. One specific on-campus dining area is the Portico Coffeehouse. It was recently opened in 2013, and all of the money goes to support mission trips around the world.}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 17 out of 17 people found this review useful. 2 of 67 Categories Comments Tips for prospective students Definitely visit the college if you can! Bang for the buck It's a little pricey but it seems worth it. Will enjoy being here Southeastern has a Beautiful campus, a cafeteria that looks like a restaurant, and dorms that are new and gorgeous! All rooms have room cleaning service for free. Laundry is also free. Everyone I met was friendly and eager to help. The students were cheerful and nice. It was one of the most welcoming schools I have visited. It had a pleasant Christian Atmosphere and felt safe and home-like. The campus is a beautiful area surrounded by lakes and huge oak trees and fountains. Southeastern is planning to build a new Preforming arts center and Library to math the Mediterranean style of their new buildings.",
