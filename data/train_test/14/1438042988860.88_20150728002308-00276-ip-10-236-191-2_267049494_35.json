Abstract, 67523=This gene knockout strategy uses a random mutagen, trimethylpsoralen (psoralen) to mutagenize a very large number of worms. The worms are divided into many small subcultures and allowed to have progeny. A portion of each subculture is stored alive in the freezer, and genomic DNA is made from the rest of the culture. This DNA is thus made from the siblings of the frozen worms and carries the same mutations as the frozen worms carry. At a very low frequency (~1/200,000 mutagenized genomes) the mutagenesis will produce a small deletion (100-1000 bp) in any gene of interest. If PCR primers flanking an area of the gene of interest are used to amplify from the genomic DNA samples, deletions between the primers can be detected since they will bring the primer sites closer together and thus will generate a PCR amplicon smaller in size than that amplified from wild-type genomic DNA. When the PCR reaction is carried out under appropriate conditions, smaller deletion amplicons are amplified much more efficiently than the larger wild-type amplicon. Thus DNA representing several thousand mutagenized genomes can be amplified in a single reaction and a deletion amplicon generated from just one of those genomes will still be detected on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Once a DNA pool containing a deletion is identified, one can work back to identify the subculture of worms in which the deletion occurred. The frozen worms from that subculture are thawed, and individual live animals carrying the deletion mutation can be identified. It is important to note that deletion mutations are detected and recovered in heterozygous form, so recessive mutations that cause lethality or sterility are not selected against and can easily be obtained., 88100=Wash the worms off the NGM plates with M9 medium, using sterile glass pipettes, and transfer the worms to a sterile 15 ml plastic centrifuge tube. Spin the worms down (1000 rpm in a clinical centrifuge for 30 sec.) and remove the supernatant or add M9 until the total volume of the worm suspension is 7 mls., 198443=Microtiter format polycarbonate V-Bottom microtiter 96-well PCR plates (USA/Scientific, 2796-3330), 101176=Quantitate the amount of bacteria by diluting a small amount of the suspension 1000-fold (using serial dilutions) in S medium and measuring the OD550.

Abstract, 123967=Extract the DNA with 200 \u03bcl phenol/chloroform using pH 6.7 1:1 phenol:chloroform mix from American Bioanalytical. Add the phenol/chloroform, vortex the tube for 30 sec, centrifuge for 4 min., and carefully remove the aqueous layer (top) to a new labeled tube, avoiding the white interface. Note that phenol/chloroform will dissolve labels written on the tubes if any spills onto the outside of the tubes. So, check for this frequently, and keep the tubes in numerical order at all stages of the procedure to minimize the possibility of mixing up the tubes., 104952=An important quality-control check is carried out at the time of harvesting to ensure that culturing has gone well. One of the 25 plates in the batch is used as a \u201ctest plate\u201d. 20 \u03bcl are withdrawn from each of four wells in the test plate (pipette up/down several times first to get a uniform suspension of worms) and combined in a tube containing 320 \u03bcl of S medium. Plate 10 \u03bcl of the diluted sample (again, removed after mixing well) on an unseeded NGM plate. Count the number of F2 larvae under a dissecting scope to calculate the average number of F2 worms per \u03bcl of culture. Repeat this measurement several times in each early batch to feel confident that it is calculated accurately. Try to obtain >1500 per well. Less than 1000 is absolutely unacceptable. Record the number of worms calculated per well for each batch. When piloting and in early batches, also use a P200 pipetteman to withdraw all the liquid and thus measure the volume of liquid in several wells of the test plate. Some evaporation may have occurred, but there should be at least 40 \u03bcl left in each well. If not, increase the moisture added to the wet paper towels in the Tupperware container used for culturing., 83131=Grow N2 worms on three 15 cm NGM plates with thick bacterial lawns. Use a healthy bacterial strain like HB101 rather than the more sickly standard strain OP50 to get a thick lawn. For instructions on standard C. elegans culture and media there are several reference books, such as Wood et al., 1988. The library is constructed in batches of 24 microtiter plates, and the three NGM plates will provide enough animals for several batches. Let the plates grow until there are a large number of gravid adults but the plates have not yet starved., 204562=C. elegans sequencing consortium. (1998). Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for investigating biology. Science 282, 2012\u20132018. Abstract, 106203=It is critical to the success of the overall procedure that the culturing go as well as possible\u2013this is the major factor affecting the reliability of recovering mutant animals. It is best if all cultures have >1500 F2 animals per well. When the number of F2 per well goes much below this, most of the F2 animals do not run out of food and arrest their development until after they are past the L1 stage. Because these older animals do not survive freezing well, the relatively few live animals recovered from thawing a positive culture may not be sufficient to guarantee that a live animal carrying the deletion of interest will be recovered., 96373=The three critical parameters for growth in microtiter wells are 1) amount of bacteria added, 2) adequate aeration, and 3) growth temperature. If too much bacteria is added the worms will die; if too little bacteria is added the worms will produce few progeny before the culture starves. With the proper amount of food, 1000\u20132000 progeny will be obtained from the 20 worms added to each microtiter well, and these progeny will starve as L1, L2, and L3 larvae 4\u20135 days after the culture is started. Inadequate aeration causes the cultures to grow slowly or not at all. Cultures grow slowly at temperatures below 20\u00b0C or above 25\u00b0C., 135385=Culturing: check that there were >1500 F2 animals per well, that the cultures had starved with no bacterial or mold contamination, and that the starved F2 animals arrested predominantly as early (L1 or L2) larvae., 106872=Before scaling up to production level batches of 24 plates, run pilot worm cultures to make sure the target of 1500 starved L1 F2 animals per well is being met or exceeded. During the piloting, ensure that 20 F1 animals are placed in each well. Also, try culturing worms by varying the concentration of bacteria up and down within a two-fold range. It is critical to empirically optimize the culturing step, and also to empirically determine that the target of 1500 F2 per well is met. Please note that psoralen-mutagenized animals grow very differently from non-mutagenized animals. It is thus critical to optimize growth conditions using animals mutagenized with psoralen following the same procedure as will be used for the library. This will also provide an opportunity to optimize the UV dose during psoralen mutagenesis., 83760=Add 10 mls sterile S medium to each of the three plates and use a sterile Pasteur pipette to transfer the worm suspension to three sterile 15 ml centrifuge tubes. (The recipe for S medium is given below in section 7.2.2). Spin the tubes in a clinical centrifuge (30 sec at ~1000 rpm) and remove the supernatant., 197735=pH 6.7 1:1 phenol:chloroform mix (American Bioanalytical, AB11051), 13532=In 1998, Fire and Mello discovered that injection of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) into worms leads to specific degradation of the corresponding mRNA, a process termed RNA interference (RNAi; Fire et al., 1998). Soon afterwards, it was found that either soaking worms in dsRNA solution or feeding worms bacteria engineered to produce dsRNA also could induce a robust RNAi response (Tabara et al., 1998; Timmons and Fire, 1998). The technique of RNAi, coupled with the availability of the complete genomic sequence of C. elegans (Consortium, 1998), has made possible the rapid study of gene function, both on a single gene level and at a global scale. This section discusses general features to consider when using this technique. Sections following this give detailed protocols for RNAi by injection, soaking and feeding., 214388=*Edited by Victor Ambros. Last revised August 20, 2005. Published April 6, 2006.

Double feeding works much better and more reproducibly in an RNAi supersensitive strain (e.g., rrf-3; Simmer et al., 2002; eri-1; Kennedy et al., 2004 or eri-1; lin-15B; Wang et al., 2005; S. Woods, D. Rivers, and J. Ahringer, unpublished; A. Fraser, pers. comm.). In a test of 17 control double feedings, 4 were successful in eri-1, 7 in rrf-3, and 14 in eri-1; lin-15B (S. Woods, D. Rivers, and J. Ahringer, unpublished). Double feeding is less reliable than single feeding, so in some cases, only one gene may be significantly inhibited, or both genes may be only slightly knocked down. Controls should be carried out to test for knockdown of each gene.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Premixes for screening After determining that the primers work and that addition of one or more poison primers results in reduction of wild-type product, make large PCR premixes sufficient for the entire primary screen as well as the subsequent retest reactions that will be used to follow up primary positives. Note that more than $200 worth of material is used here, so make sure the primers work and that the PCR conditions are worked out before making these mixes. Also note that the large premixes are made with the concentrated stocks of dNTPs and primers, not the diluted stocks used to prepare the test reactions. 7.3.3.\u00a0Production level PCR If the products appear as extremely strong bands in the test reactions, reduce the extension time by ~5-10 seconds when screening the library to decrease the amplification efficiency. The reactions should not be too efficient, as this indicates that they may have reached their endpoints in a small number of cycles, and less productive amplification cycles would lead to less enrichment of deletion amplicons. However, do not obsess on this point or spend time running additional test reactions with different extension times. The whole beauty of the poison primer method is that it is relatively robust and thus allows screening to move forward quickly without a long delay for optimizing conditions. Running extra rounds of optimization can actually be",

For ease of aliquoting the premix into the 96-well plates, first distribute the premix equally into a strip of 12 tubes (microtiter spaced PCR tubes), and use a 12-channel multipipettor to distribute 20\u03bcl (first round reactions) or 25\u03bcl (second round reactions) into each well of a microtiter PCR plate. The library DNA templates will be added to the 96-well plate containing the distributed premix.
