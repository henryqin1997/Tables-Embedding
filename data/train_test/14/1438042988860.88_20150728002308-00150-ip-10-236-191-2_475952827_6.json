The present invention thus provides aesthetically pleasing interior lighting by integrating switching with lamp positioning from a dome position to a reading position. The dual function interior lamp of the invention provides a flush or recessed style dome position and a user-controllable reading position to direct lighting as desired. Operation and positioning of the lamp is facilitated by the dimple feature and/or protrusion on the lamp lens with the dimple feature also functioning to focus a portion of the light and increase its intensity on a desired target location. The improved packaging afforded by the present invention may also result in an associated cost reduction. As such, a dual function console lamp with integrated switching according to the present invention includes both a dome lamp function and a reading/map function based on position of the lamp housing and associated lamp, which move in unison. Rotations of the lamp housing assembly about two axes are provided. A vertical plane rotation about an eccentrically positioned axis relative to a central longitudinal axis actuates the integrated switch and allows the lamp housing assembly to pivot toward a user's target reading position. A horizontal plane rotation",
