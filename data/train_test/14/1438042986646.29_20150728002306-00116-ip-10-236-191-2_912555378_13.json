            "Brenau is extremely safe, with security walking all over campus any time of day. We also have Emergency Phone Locations in which you can easily call security if you feel unsafe or witnessed anything. When there is a suspicious person roaming campus, students are sent an email and receive a text from Brenau University which explains the situation and describes the threat's appearance. You don't have to worry about your safety here.",
            "There's lots of Greek life at Brenau. We are home to eight sororities. Each helps different causes, such as the homeless, cancer victims, or neglected animals. Fundraisers are thrown to raise the money needed to give back. Greek life is mainly about friendships, and creating bonds that last forever. If things get tough, your sorority sisters are supposed to be there for you. There's an event to meet and speak with the various sororities, and be sure to do so if these last few sentences sound good to you!",
            "Brenau's site says they have over 50 clubs and organizations. I have not seen very much activity from any of said clubs, though, so I feel like they're pretty dead. There's many sports teams containing many international students brought here specifically to play. There's really cute boys from other schools who come to Brenau to eat lunch or dinner before/after their sports games. Everyone looks forward to that.",
            "Brenau is especially suited for Southern, conservative women who would like to be empowered. Brenau University pushes sisterhood and friendships, so it is also great if you are or aspire to become an extrovert. Brenau women generally are classy and fun.",
            "When a student becomes engaged, it's tradition to toss her into the fountain. Other traditions include annual celebrations such as May Day (which actually occurs in April), an event where the student body wears dresses, and (if you like) fancy hats and revel in Brenau's past and progress. Alumni come to speak and share wisdom with current students. Food and dancing is abundant during this day in the sun. Brenau also has a barbeque competition known as the Brenau BBQ Championship. Many different vendors sell their barbeque and compete for bragging rights (and possibly other prizes, I'm not sure). Everyone may attend both these events, not just students. These are a great opportunity to meet new people or invite your family to spend a day with you. ***Some believe Pearce Auditorium is haunted by a female ghost named Agnes. She's supposedly a friendly ghost, and many stories have been told about her. There is a specific seat in Pearce Auditorium in which you can supposedly feel her presence. Look it up, if you are curious!",
            "The education is good, but everything else is SEVERELY overpriced. The food quickly becomes bland (again, no variety - same entrees and sides every week) and the housing is comparable to student housing that costs $2000 or less but will cost you at least $8,000+. If you must go here, choose the online school option. Even without needing to pay for housing or a meal plan, Brenau has cost me $10,000 for ONE semester of online schooling, not one year. That's extremely pricey.",
            "Brenau University has a handful of annual events to attend, and emails a newsletter which goes over all the activities of the week. Students know what is happening on campus via these emails, Brenau's own radio broadcasts, and word of mouth. Brenau has common rooms to hang out in, a tennis court (although I've never seen anyone use it besides tennis players), sororities and clubs to join, an art gallery (which is usually empty), a garden (always empty), a bookstore/store, and a theater in which virtually all performances happen. If you are looking to party hard, Brenau is not the school for you! Brenau is a dry campus meaning alcohol is prohibited. Whereas I'm sure a percentage of students drink and party anyhow, most of the students are more invested in hanging out with friends and having good, clean fun. College is a place to get an education, not a night club!",
            "I've found mixed reviews on the dining hall's food. After attending oncampus for a semester (and offcampus as an online student for another semester), I've found their food to be okay. It's good when you first arrive, but you will quickly grow tired of it because there is a severe lack of variety. There's about 3 or 4 entree options, and they are the same every week. For dessert lovers, there's a lot of options. Honestly, I think this is why at least half of the student population seems to be overweight.",
            "Brenau's Freshman dorms are average. There is a system of two students per room unless you are a RA. RAs get their own room. Some of the buildings have a common room which all the students of that specific dorm room may use. This room usually has a big TV, sofas, vending machines, and a pool table. West Hall does NOT have an area like this, so be aware of that when choosing your dormitory. Do your research! Upperclassmen can stay in apartment-like buildings on-campus or rent an apartment outside of campus. But, there isn't exactly an abundance of offcampus locations near the school. Items such as mini-fridges, microwaves, dish washers, ovens, etc are not included in the dorms. You can bring some of these items in yourself at your own cost (lame). I have found many colleges in the area offering much cheaper housing with better amenities and a lot more space. To reserve your dorm room (mandatory if staying on campus) is $350 - sorta high.",
            "We offer free tutoring (it's probably paid for using our tuition) in many subjects, and have small class sizes which offer more individualized attention in the classroom. Classes such as Economics were tough. I suggest you take any areas you're weak in online - their online courses seem easier and you can take a combination on-campus and online classes at once. Beware that the library closes unreasonably early (I wanna say 11 or 11:30PM). For late nighters, try the SUB. It's a semi-secret study location.",
            "Turn in your housing application and deposit - if you plan to live on campus - ASAP. This will increase your probability of living in the building you would like. Apply for scholarships and grants until the cows come home, because it will save you so much money if you are awarded any. If accepted, you will be assigned someone to help you through the financial aid process. Stay in touch with this person and always do as they say immediately, do not procrastinate. Many things about college has deadlines, and you dont want to miss out on anything. Learn the ropes, because after you've been around more than a semester, staff isn't as eager to help you anymore.",
            "Brenau University is a private women's college (with a very, very small percentage of male students - like, I've met maybe two males students in an entire semester) founded in the 1800s and filled to brim with traditions. Brenau encourages sisterhood and the power of women. Our mascot is the tiger, and Brenau University's school colors are golden yellow and black. ***The cost is really, really high (in my opinion), so if you do not qualify for scholarships such as the HOPE Scholarship, Zell Miller, etc, and do not come from an upper-middle class or better family, I do NOT recommend you attend. I come from a low income home and paying for school has been VERY stressful. I wish someone would have told me this, so I'm now making an effort to inform others.***"

As long as you know what your major is and immediately start applying for scholarships, the financial aid department is extremely helpful in anyway possible. Will enjoy being here The campus here is old and beautiful and the relationships formed between the professors and students seem genuine and peaceful. Will learn a lot I have gotten a chance to talk to the girls at Brenau. Based on their comments I feel comfortable with placing my future in this program. I feel that Brenau will prepare me for life after college in every aspect and the learning environment is not intimidating. Classes are small and intimate.
