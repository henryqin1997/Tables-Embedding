The method and apparatus advantageously allow the base station 102 and the portable communication unit 104 to adapt automatically to different types of inbound calling procedures in response to an instructional message received by the portable communication unit 104 from the telephone systems 106, 124 through a radio paging system. System variables, such as common resource time-outs and the need for answer supervision for billing, also are accommodated. The message format used is readily adaptable to modifications and additions to accommodate new inbound calling procedures that may be developed in the future. If, on the other hand, in step 626 answer supervision is returned from the telephone system 106 and detected by the telephone interface 308 within the predetermined time, then the microprocessor 310 controls the RF transceiver 302 to send 628 normal ringer alert messages to the portable communication unit 104. The microprocessor 310 then monitors the RF transceiver 302 for a response from the portable communication unit 104. If in step 630 the response is \"Abort\", the microprocessor 310 then accesses the Terminator routine 318 to release 620 the RF link and return to an idle status. If, instead, in step 630",
