    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{33746=In the 2916 application, improved results are achieved by abandoning a preselected order and, instead, constructing an order of views in response to the measured motion occurring as the scan is executed. To achieve artifact reduction, a desired relationship between motion phase and phase encoding amplitude is selected. As the scan data are acquired, signals representative of the position of the object are measured and used to select a view order that satisfies the desired relationship between motion phase and phase encoding amplitude. The detailed map between object position and phase encoding amplitude will depend on the fraction of the time that the object spends at each particular position., 28457=This is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 766,733, filed Aug. 16, 1985, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,591 and it is assigned to the same assignee as that of the present invention., 63835=In order to overcome this deficiency, the 2916 application discloses the selection of a phase-encoding gradient amplitude for each view (in either the low-frequency sort mode or the high-frequency sort mode) just prior to the start of the pulse sequence for that view wherein the selection depends on the phase of the signal variation at that point in time. Thus, the final view order (i.e., the temporal order in which the phase-encoding amplitudes are implemented) depends on the measured phase during the scan. In this manner, immunity from the effects of variation in the motion pattern is obtained., 33068=In the 2673 (Ser. No. 766,842) application, a view order for a scan is selected before the scan begins. Although this method is effective in reducing artifacts, and is in some respects ideal if the variation in the NMR signal caused by subject motion is rather regular and at a known frequency, the method is not very robust if the assumption made about the motion temporal period does not hold (e.g., because the patient's breathing pattern changes or is irregular). If this occurs, the method loses some of its effectiveness because the focusing of the ghost artifacts, either as close to the object or as far from the object as possible, is less complete., 84476=In order to execute the discrete implementation of the invention as expressed in Equation (19) some number, for example, 1000 samples of the respiration waveform (190 in FIGS. 18 and 19) are acquired by the A/D converter 186 and stored in a buffer within the processor 188. From this established base, for every subsequent sample y(t), a phase value \u03c6(t) may be determined. Specifically, a new sample y(t) is acquired, stored in the data buffer and the oldest sample in the buffer is discarded. The value of the new sample y(t) is compared with the previously stored samples, NL and NE are calculated from the comparison, and the value of the phase \u03c6(t) for the new value of y(t) is computed using Equation (19). The probability distribution function is, in effect, continually updated so that changes in the respiration pattern during the scan are accommodated., 63174=In the 2673 application, the known view increment time and the assumed motion pattern are used to calculate the relative motion phase at the time each view of the scan is acquired. Using various sorting schemes, a unique phase-encoding amplitude is assigned to each view in a manner to cause the desired relationship between relative motion phase and phase encoding to be satisfied as well as is possible. This approach is ideal if the signal variations are indeed as assumed. However, if the period of the signal variations differ from the assumed value or varies during the scan the efficiency of the artifact reduction will be diminished., 31289=One method for reducing the undesirable effects due to periodic signal variations is disclosed and claimed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 766, 842, filed Aug. 16, 1985 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,591, issued May 5, 1987. According to the method, the time sequence of views which collectively compose a scan is controlled in such a manner that when the views are reordered for construction of an image using Fourier transforms, the motion as seen in the \"k-space\" of the Fourier transforms is either very slow or very rapid. In the latter approach, the artifacts caused by respiratory motion are moved to the edge of the image where they may be moved out of the displayed field of view. In the former approach, the artifacts are minimally displaced from the moving object portions, thereby virtually eliminating most of the visually appreciable reduction in image quality. In implementing either approach as they are disclosed in the above-mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,591, substantially instantaneous knowledge of the phase of the respiratory motion is required in order to determine the best sequence of views or view order., 62586=From the foregoing it can be appreciated that one key to the successful reduction of motion-induced artifacts is the proper choice of the order in which the phase-encoding gradient amplitudes are used. The method for ordering the sequence of views disclosed in the 2673 application, relies on substantial, almost complete, a-priori knowledge of the motion pattern. This knowledge is used, along with the time between temporally sequential views (the view increment time selected by the operator or pre-set) to select a view order prior to acquisition of the scan data., 34468=For example, the end expiration portion of the respiration cycle is of different relative lengths in different people, and even at different times in the same person. Clearly since data are to be acquired at a regular rate, a larger fraction of the views must be assigned to end expiration in those cases where the end expiration portion of the cycle is longer. In the method of the 2673 application, this is trivial since perfect knowledge of the motion is assumed. In many cases, however, such knowledge cannot be assumed. Also, the motion pattern might vary during the examination.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art of medical imaging that the present method can be used in conjunction with other imaging modalities. For example, the respiration phase signal can be used to control data collection in nuclear medicine scintigraphy or in ultrasonography. The present invention can advantageously be used for respiration gating. For example, the operator can select that data be acquired when the respiratory phase is between 0.0 and 0.3. Then, independent of the details of the shape of the waveform or variations in this shape, data collection will be enabled for approximately 30% of the time. As a result, the examination time can be more accurately predicted. It is clear, however, that from subject to subject the fraction of the time that data collection is enabled will vary. Further, this fraction can also vary as the respiration pattern changes. For example, the present respiration monitor can be used with another magnetic resonance imaging method, commonly referred to as respiratory gating. In this technique, imaging data are acquired only during a portion of the respiration cycle, typically end expiration, in order to reduce the amount of motion contained in the imaging data. For this purpose, one prior art method applies a threshold detector to the signal output of a respiration transducer such as a pneumatic bellows. When the respiration signal is below the threshold, a gate is turned on",
