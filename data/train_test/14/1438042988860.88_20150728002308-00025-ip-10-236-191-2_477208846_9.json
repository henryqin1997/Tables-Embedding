    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that modifications to the foregoing preferred embodiments may be made in various aspects. The present invention is set forth with particularity in the appended claims. It is deemed that the spirit and scope of that invention encompasses such modifications and alterations to the preferred embodiment as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art and familiar with the teachings of the present application. At 1 dia: 0.2786 At 5 mm: 0.3156 The swirl number for this case was calculated by integrating the swirl number along a series of radii 30 degrees apart. It was calculated at 5 mm and one diameter past the fins. The results are given below: This model was run simulating water at 40\ufffd C. and with a flow rate of 20 gpm. The computational velocity was scaled such that one \u201cunit\u201d of velocity in finite element analysis corresponds to 4 mm/s in reality. This was done to aid convergence. Other properties were adjusted to keep the Reynolds number consistent. The model was set for incompressible, steady, turbulent flow, and used the standard k-epsilon formulation as included in finite element analysis. The inlet boundary condition was given by the flow rate and includes a small inlet component of kinetic energy and dissipation to \u201ckick start\u201d the k-epsilon routine. Wall boundary conditions are the no-slip and impermeability conditions, and, additionally,",
