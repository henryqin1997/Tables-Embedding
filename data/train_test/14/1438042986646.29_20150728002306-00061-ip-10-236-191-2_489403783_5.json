The steps 1202\u20131220 of FIG. 12 are the same as steps 1102\u20131120 of FIG. 11. FIG. 12, however, replaces the step 1122 of FIG. 11 which requires an interface with a system to provide function or operation desired with step 1222 which is to store and report the results of the processed information. The goal of this embodiment is not to use the position information to effectuate a control system based on position information determined by impulse radio means, but rather to organize and correlate information about the person or object who is being tracked with the position information which indicates areas within the predetermined area that the person or object has been. Thus, it will be possible to correlate information according to any parameters desired. For example, for marketing purposes it can be determined what the demographic profile of all people that attend a particular animal exhibit or production is and tailor the advertising plan to that particular demographic profile. Mall managers can provide information to their tenants about which ages and which gender of people are soliciting their stores. The stores can then stock merchandise accordingly. It is easy to see the myriad possibilities from an informational perspective that can be achieved.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{100755=Assuming that there is not information about the object or person prior to arrival at the predetermined area, in step 1110 information is gathered about the person or object prior the issuance of a TAG. If the information is gathered by a employee of the pre-designated area, such as an employee at a theme park, the employee will input the TAG identification number and correlate it to the person whose information is being taken in step 1112. Upon completion of data entry and TAG correlation, the TAG is activated and placed with the person or object 1114, prior to their (its) entrance into the predetermined area. Once the TAG is activated and the person or object has entered the predetermined area, in step 1116 impulse radio means are used to locate the position of and track the object or person within the predetermined area. In step 1118, the correlated location and personal information is stored in a memory means., 61321=Impulse radio is resistant to interference because of its large processing gain. For typical spread spectrum systems, the definition of processing gain, which quantifies the decrease in channel interference when wide-band communications are used, is the ratio of the bandwidth of the channel to the bit rate of the information signal. For example, a direct sequence spread spectrum system with a 10 kHz information bandwidth and a 10 MHZ channel bandwidth yields a processing gain of 1000 or 30 dB. However, far greater processing gains are achieved with impulse radio systems, where for the same 10 KHz information bandwidth is spread across a much greater 2 GHz. channel bandwidth, the theoretical processing gain is 200,000 or 53 dB., 101750=In step 1120 this information is processed according to predetermined parameters. These parameters can be a proximity to a given display, or a child under a certain age getting within a certain distance to a pond or other water hazard, or it could be a relative distance between two persons (such as a parent and a child), or a relative distance between an object and a person (such as a person with a valuable object such as a briefcase), or any parameters that could use the utilize the functionality herein described. In step 1122 an action is taken based on the parameters that have been processed. This action occurs via an interface between a controller and a device that is to be controlled. For example, a sight seeing train may be interfaced with said controller. If the parameters are such that if an object or person is positioned on the track and within 100 yards of the train, the controller can communicate with an alerting means to warn the sight seeing train of the danger or it can automatically signal the TAG and alert the person or person associated with an object of the potential danger., 96166=As the entrant enters the predetermined area, their position is monitored using impulse radio means as described in the patents incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, position monitoring can be done on a substantially constant basis if necessary. Alternatively, position monitoring can be done periodically, either automatically by computer control or manually initiated. This position information is passed to computer 1018 via impulse radio transceiver 1008. Computer 1018 is networked with controller 1028. Included with controller 1028 is processor 1026, interface 1030 and impulse radio (IR) transceiver (or transmitter) 1032. Controller 1028 is interfaced via interface 1030 with whatever system that is desired to control within the predetermined area. For example, it may be desired to simply transmit the position information of the entrant to the entrant via impulse radio transceiver 1032. However, it might also be desired to transmit the position of entrant 1036 (located adjacent a particular entertainment attraction area 1038), to entrants parents. Or it may be desired, to contact the entrant via wrist TAG 1001 and tell them, if they are a child (age information will be obtained during the information gathering step) that they are entering an adult area only; or if the position of the child entrant is outside of a given radius from their parent., 28548=The following U.S. Patent Applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety: Ser.

No. 09/511,991, filed on Feb. 24, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,906,625 (issued Jun. 14, 2005), which is herein incorporated by reference., 76970=Important for positioning, impulse systems can measure distances to extremely fine resolution because of the absence of ambiguous cycles in the waveform. Narrow band systems, on the other hand, are limited to the modulation envelope and cannot easily distinguish precisely which RF cycle is associated with each data bit because the cycle-to-cycle amplitude differences are so small they are masked by link or system noise. Since the impulse radio waveform has no multi-cycle ambiguity, this allows positive determination of the waveform position to less than a wavelength\u2014potentially, down to the noise floor of the system. This time position measurement can be used to measure propagation delay to determine link distance, and once link distance is known, to transfer a time reference to an equivalently high degree of precision. The inventors of the present invention have built systems that have shown the potential for centimeter distance resolution, which is equivalent to about 30 ps of time transfer resolution. See, for example, commonly owned, co-pending applications Ser. No. 09/045,929, filed Mar. 23, 1998, titled \u201cUltrawide-Band Position Determination System and Method\u201d, and Ser.

The information center 1050 can be coupled to processor 1026 by impulse radio techniques or conventional communications techniques., 42361=Uses of impulse radio systems are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/332,502, entitled, \u201cSystem and Method for Intrusion Detection Using a Time Domain Radar Array,\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/332,503, entitled, \u201cWide Area Time Domain Radar Array,\u201d both filed on Jun. 14, 1999 and both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention. These patent documents are incorporated herein by reference., 58926=Impulse radio receivers typically integrate from 1 to 1000 or more pulses to yield the demodulated output. The optimal number of pulses over which the receiver integrates is dependent on a number of variables, including pulse rate, bit rate, interference levels, and range., 41502=Recent advances in communications technology have enabled an emerging, revolutionary ultra wideband technology (UWB) called impulse radio communications systems (hereinafter called impulse radio). To better understand the benefits of impulse radio to the present invention, the following review of impulse radio follows Impulse radio was first fully described in a series of patents, including U.S. Pat. No. 4,641,317 (issued Feb. 3, 1987), U.S. Pat. No. 4,813,057 (issued Mar. 14, 1989), U.S. Pat. No. 4,979,186 (issued Dec. 18, 1990) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,363,108 (issued Nov. 8, 1994) to Larry W. Fullerton. A second generation of impulse radio patents include U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,927 (issued Oct. 14, 1997), U.S. Pat. No. 5,687,169 (issued Nov. 11, 1997) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,832,035 (issued Nov. 3, 1998) to Fullerton et al., 30759=With the development of impulse radio, precise positioning capabilities have been enabled. In co-pending and commonly owned application Ser. No. 09/456,410, filed Dec. 8, 1999, titled, \u201cSystem and Method for Monitoring Assets, Objects, People and Animals Utilizing Impulse Radio,\u201d and it's parent Ser. No. 09/407,106, filed Sep. 27, 1999, both of which are incorporated herein by reference, precise positioning was described in a number of scenarios. Although in the aforementioned applications positioning was described in detail, a way to correlate that position information to information relating the object or person whose movement is being tracked can be improved upon. Further, the ability to utilize the position information to accomplish a number of functionalities based on that position information should be realized., 92451=Upon designation of a predetermined coverage area and placement of impulse radios, entrance points 1016, 1014 can be designated. The purpose of the entry points is to enable the gathering of information and dissemination of impulse radio \u201cTAGS\u201d (e.g., see wrist TAG 1001) and to begin tracking. TAGS as used herein and as described in the patents incorporated herein by reference refers to impulse radio transceivers, transmitters or receivers depending on which positioning architecture is being employed. Positioning architectures and the multitude of embodiments using either transceivers, transmitters, receivers or mixed to determine position are fully described in patent application Ser. No. 09/456,409, filed Dec. 8, 1999, entitled, \u201cSystem and Method for Person or Object Position Location Utilizing Impulse Radio.\u201d Also, distance measuring and position location using impulse radio using a plurality of distance architectures is enabled in co-pending and commonly owned application Ser.

No. 09/407,106, filed Sep. 27, 1999, all of which are incorporated herein by reference., 97678=Controller 1028 can also be interfaced via impulse radio (IR) interface 1032 with a display 1040. When entrant comes within a given distance (as determined by processor 1026) of display 1040, a narrative of the display can occur in the language of the entrant in a headphone issued to the entrant. For example, entrant who is a French woman, 1042, can come within five yards of an animated character display 1040 and a French narrative of the display 1040 will be passed via impulse radio transceiver 1032 with an impulse radio receiver in the headset (not shown) used by entrant. The headset will contain the same unique identifier as the TAG, so it can be correlated with the entrants information and the TAG position information. The information concerning the language of the entrant being French can be obtained during the information gathering step and the instruction to play the narrative in French occurs in the processor which is in communication with the interface which is interfaced with the various functionalities (such as the narrative of all displays) that occur in the predetermined area. It is because of the unique properties of impulse radio that allows a large number of simultaneous transmissions (which may be required if a large crowd, 1044, require simultaneous distinct transmissions) in a confined area without interference problems.}",
