Rather, it is contemplated that future modifications in structure, function or result will exist that are not substantial changes and that all such insubstantial changes in what is claimed are intended to be covered by the claims. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the parameters involved in food packages may differ from non-food packages in some respects. Food packages generally require low oxygen and moisture permeation rates, i.e., 1 cc or less of oxygen per 100 sq. inches/24 hours, and 1 gram or less of moisture per 100 sq. inches/24 hours. Hermetically sealed food packages are an obvious preference to maintain low oxygen and moisture quantities within the package throughout its handling and distribution cycle. Hermetic seals provide sanitary advantages for tampon packaging, as well. Direct contact food packaging materials must meet FDA regulations spelled out in Rule 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Finally, the design of food packaging equipment must incorporate features to minimize potential for food contamination, i.e., stainless steel food contact surfaces and disassembling features to assure effective cleaning. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will understand that, typically, packages of the present invention will be made using a horizontal thermoform machine, as well known in the art. However, it",
