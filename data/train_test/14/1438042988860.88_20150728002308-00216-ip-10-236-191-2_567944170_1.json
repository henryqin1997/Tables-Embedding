Over 2,300 such peptides have been isolated and characterized according to the online updated Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD) [7,8]. As of April 2014, there are 233 AMPs from bacteria (i.e., bacteriocins), six from protozoa, 12 from fungi, 306 from plants, and 1,801 host defense peptides from animals. AMPs are usually gene-coded and can be constitutively expressed or induced to fend off invading pathogens. In addition, some bacteria use a second mechanism to assemble peptide antibiotics by using a multiple-enzyme system, leading to distinct chemical modifications not observed in gene-coded cases. Most of the AMPs are cationic and short with less than 50 amino acids. Such features are ideal to target the negatively charged surface of bacteria [1,2,3,4,5,6].}",

In the following, we highlight atomic structures of human AMPs from the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b1\u03b2 families. These structures are annotated in the APD database [ Table 2 ]. Peptides in the \u03b1 family contain \u03b1-helical structure as the major secondary structure. Typical examples are human cathelicidin LL-37, histatins, dermcidin, and granulysin. The \u03b2 family is characterized by at least a pair of two \u03b2-strands in the structure. Human \u03b1-defensins, hepcidins, and SLPI use this type of structure. The \u03b1\u03b2 family contains both \u03b1 and \u03b2 secondary structures, whereas the non-\u03b1\u03b2 family has neither \u03b1 nor \u03b2 structure (also called extended structures). While there are multiple structural examples for the \u03b1\u03b2 family ( 201 ], the structures of natural AMPs fall into four large families (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b1\u03b2, and non-\u03b1\u03b2) [ 200 , 6 , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 Although there are different classification schemes [ ]. 8 ., motions).

Histatins 1, 3, and 5 are active against C. albicans and their candidacidal activities are in the following order: histatin 5 > histatin 3 > histatin 1 [ 203 ]. Rai et al . investigated the relationship between sequence length and activity using histatin 5 as the template. They found that the C-terminal sequence is important [ 204 ]. P-113 with 12 residues corresponding to residues 4\u201315 of histatin 5 retained anti-candida activity [ 205 ]. Using histatin 3 as a model, Zuo et al . found increased activity when the active sequence was expressed in tandem (repeated once) [ 206 ]. However, duplication of the functional domain of histatin 5 did not enhance candidacidal activity [ 207 ]. These results suggest that active domain duplication is not necessary a universal strategy for activity enhancement. Histatin 5 can adopt a helical conformation in the presence of membrane-mimetic agents [ 204 ]. However, this helical structure did not",
