            "Camus security is great and available 24/7. They can help you any thing you may need.",
            "The greek life here is limited. A majority of the fraternities and sororities are related to academics.",
            "Great for any type of student. If you enjoy a small school feel than this is the school for you. With the small class sizes you are able to have the one-on-one help from all of the professors.",
            "There is always something fun to do on and off of campus. You could never go bored.",
            "The food here tastes about like typical cafeteria food, just slightly better. In the main dining hall you have buffet style service with a wide variety of food to chose from every day. Also if you won't have to stop and eat you are able to use a meal exchange to grab a sack lunch for one the go. If you ever feel like mixing things up a bit you can eat at Bucks. Bucks is restaurant that serves hamburgers, pasta, sandwiches, ect.",
            "The dorm life is wonderful! There is always something to do and the RA's are great. If you ever need anything-ANYTHING-they will be there to help. The rooms are a bit small, but with all that goes on around campus, you'll hardly be in them except to sleep at night.",
            "The work is definitely more challenging than high school, however it is always doable. You will never have homework that you can not accomplish. The professors are always more than will to help you with any assignment, sometimes even if you are not currently in their class. The work pushes you to do your best so that you are able to be your best not only in college but after as well.",
            "Make sure to visit the beautiful campus and ask many questions. College may seem scary at first, but that fades away soon. In college, not only do meet tons of new people and make new friendships, you also grow as a person. When you are applying for room and board be sure to be as honest as possible to ensure the best roommate experience. Remember though, you don't HAVE to be best friends with your roommate Most importantly just enjoy your college career. Make memories and have FUN!",

IA is A LOT different from KS, but I love Morningside. It's located in Sioux City which is large enough that it takes no time to get to a certain store, but not so large as to have that good and bad side of town feel., 15350=The biggest drawback of Morningside is the price. I got a great financial aid package as a freshman last year, but as tuition increases each year, the financial aid doesn't increase with it. Being charged over $1000 more than last year, I haven't noticed a $1000 value in my education.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I would suggest really making sure you want to attend the college you are looking at. If Morningside is your number one, then make sure you come on campus visits and stay with a student who will tell you everything you want to know. Do not be afraid to asks questions and make sure you do because Morningside is very helpful in helping you make the best decisions. They care about your well-being here on campus and that was one of the reasons I decided to attend this school. Bang for the buck This is a private institution making it more expensive than state colleges/universities but the benefit of this includes not having to pay out-of-state tuition but having a flat fee. Morningside is a pretty expensive but financial aid and scholarships on campus are great ways to help get you through without having too much debt. Am enjoying being here I love campus and the life of Morningside. I am involved in the on-campus activity group, MAC, to help set up fun things for Morningsiders to do. I love my surroundings and campus is absolutely gorgeous. I couldn't think of being anywhere else! I also sing here at Morningside, and to be completely honest the choir here is amazing. They",
