I read that FZ100 is speedier to manipulate than HX100V. Is the HX100V responding time that bad compared to FZ100? Good Burst mode if possible ( Burst available in video, too? ). good low-light performance or less noise and good detail. IQ in Dual Recording (Simulatneous stills and video shooting ) Quality in Video Some of the main features/functions I'm looking for are : Any pros and cons analysis will be greatly appreciated. I was wondering if there are any good factors in FZ100",
