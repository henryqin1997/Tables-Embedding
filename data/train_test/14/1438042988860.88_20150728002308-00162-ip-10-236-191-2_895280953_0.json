Criswell was a great warrior. He was the author of some 54 books including \u2018The Holy Spirit in today\u2019s World\u2019 in which he gives answers to the ideas and doctrines arising from the Charismatic movement he found confusing.[30] In 1980 Criswell authored the \u2018Criswell\u2019s Guidebook for Pastors in which he offered advice for the everyday matters in association with the pastorate. The guidebook has become a staple reading for many young pastors today. He also co edited a study bible known as the Criswell Study Bible which is now known as the Believers Study Bible., 56440=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [28] Charles Haddon Spurgeon was one of the greatest English Baptist. 1834- 1892, Of Spurgeon Criswell said, \u2018He was the most remarkable preacher who ever lived.\u2019, 41917=1994, 49763=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [16] Timothy Pope, \u201cThe Baptist Pope\u201d (Christianity Today, March 11, 2002). http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/march11/3.54.html\u00a0 (Thursday, May 8, 2008)., 17612=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite his professors suggesting he attend Yale Divinity as well as suggestions from his friends to go to Brown so that he could \u2018widen his horizons\u2019[18]\u00a0 W.A. had decided he would attend Southern Baptist Theological Seminary for his graduate studies. He arrived in Louisville with no job and no money but he knew that God would provide. He was soon offered the pastorate of two churches and accepted both. He preached at Mount Washington Baptist Church three Sundays a month and Oakland Baptist Church on the other Sunday. At Washington Baptist he met the young lady that would soon become his wife. Her name was Betty Harris and she was the daughter or prominent Baptist in their church. Her cousin and she would often play pranks on their new pastor and then scold him for being a victim. He was prim and proper buried in his studies and she was flirtatious and adventurous. Three years after first meeting her he asked for her hand and she accepted. They were married on Valentines Day 1935. That same year W.A. graduated from Southern Seminary with a PhD.[19], 33655=1934, 45717=[5] Ergun Caner, \u201cCriswell trained with pathos, logos, ethos.\u201d Southern Baptist Texan, February 2002, 15., 32720=December 19, 1909, 42245=1998, 41168=1991, 45347=[4] Billy Graham, \u201cBaptist Leaders remember life, legacy of Criswell,\u201d Southern Baptist Texan, February 2002, 8., 34605=1937, 35970=1956, 21087=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While God truly blessed all of his pastorates it is W.A. Criswell\u2019s ministry in Dallas that is most remembered and celebrated. A hard decision for both the Criswell\u2019s and the First Baptist Church of Dallas W.A. accepted the call in 1944.[24] George Truett had passed away leaving almost immeasurably huge shoes to fill. The church had scrutinized over the decision and considered dozens of applicants before coming to the decision to call W.A. Criswell. Dr. Criswell would spend 50 years in the pulpit at First Baptist Dallas. From there his preaching and writings would bring a firestorm of attention., 40313=1986, 36976=1969, 53055=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [22] George Washington Truett was one of the most important and influential Southern Baptist pastors of his time.

Criswell was born December 19th 1909 to Wallie Amos Criswell and Anna Currie Criswell. Although it is commonly thought his initials stand for Wallie Amos, his parents intended to give him initials only and it was long years afterward \u2013 prompted by the instance of government immigration officials \u2013 that W. A. officially took the name Wallie Amos.[10] Early in W.A.\u2019s life his parents were farmers but after the dust bowl drove many American farmers to the cities the Criswell\u2019s moved to Texline, TX where Wallie Amos took to the profession of barbering., 34299=May, 1937, 6236=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn 1987, I drove two thousand miles round trip from Kentucky to Dallas, Texas with two friends. We were all twenty-year-old ministerial students, who had backed in the writings of Dr. W.A. Criswell and wanted to hear him preach on time in our lives. The drive was arduous, but finally on Wednesday morning, we arrived at the crossroads of Ervay and San Jacinto. Checking our ties and suits, we hesitantly entered the second floor office of Dr. Criswell, and gingerly asked if he could meet us for five minutes., 50817=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [18] \u201cPortraits, W A Criswell (1909 \u2013 2002)\u201d (The Baptist Page). http://www.siteone.com/religion/baptist/baptistpage/Portraits/criswell.html (Thursday, May 8, 2008)., 42961=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [1] Rick Warren, \u201cW.A.

A. Criswell received such attention, as did the 1969 work entitled \u2018Why I Preach the Bible is Literally True.\u2019 The book, dedicated \u2018to that man who stands anywhere in the earth with an open Bible and preaches to the people God\u2019s infallible Word\u2019[31] was instantly criticized and brought under scrutiny by many liberals in the Southern Baptist Convention at that time. \u201cIn this 160-page book, published by Broadman Press, Criswell detailed why he believed in such things as a literal fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, literal miracles, a literal creation account in Genesis, and a literal second coming of Christ to earth. Criswell argued that the findings of archaeology only confirmed the historicity of biblical events. He denounced the theory of evolution and stated that the Bible was not only a book of doctrine but that it was accurate in its scientific statements as well. Criswell demanded that reason be subordinated to revelation and faith. Theology students, wrote Criswell, should study the Greek and Hebrew languages because the very words of the Bible are inspired by God; and they should preach literally, grammatically, and historically and not spiritualize biblical texts.\u201d[32] Immediately the Association of Baptist Professors of Religion submitted a resolution at their annual meeting in Atlanta Georgia denouncing the advertising of the book by Broadman Publishers. Under the advisement of a wise church member Criswell let his friends fight this battle for him, and did they. The majority of the Southern Baptist Convention rallied behind Dr. Criswell and the publishing of his book. Many called for the names of those who signed the resolution and demanded the Baptist school boards look into what was being taught in the classrooms. The book articulated the growing concern against liberalism creeping into the Southern Baptist Convention particularly in connection to the inerrancy of Scriptures., 35250=1944, 9817=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who was the man so celebrated in his death as to bring one of the most influential cities in the South to a standstill on one January afternoon? While his death was something of a legend his life was no doubt blessed by God and directed by divine will., 40681=1988, 54180=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [24] \u201cThe Baptist Pope\u201d (Christianity Today, March 11, 2002). http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/march11/3.54.html\u00a0 (Thursday, May 8, 2008)., 36345=1968, 23475=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Criswell preached a number of sermons that became somewhat famous. One such sermon preached December 31, 1961 titled \u2018The Scarlet Thread Through The Bible\u2019 is one such sermon. About this sermon he said \u2018The greatest single preaching experience of my life was right here [FBCD] when I started preaching at 7:30pm and preached till past midnight on the subject of \u2018The Scarlet Thread Through the Bible.\u2019 It is said that he preached that entire 4 hour plus sermon without one note and that the Dallas sanctuary was more packed with listeners when he finished than when he started.[25], 46056=[6] Mark Wingfield, \u201cCriswell hailed as legendary defender of the faith.\u201d The Baptist Standard, January 21, 2001, 55303=\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [26] Sam Hodges, \u2018KCBI to broadcast First Baptist Dallas noon Lenten services\u2019 The Dallas Morning News, April 01, 2007, http://religionblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2007/04/kcbi-to-broadcast-first-baptis.html, May 10, 2008, 38278=1976, 59088=[34] Adopted and modified from the January 14, 2002 Baptist Standard article \u2018A brief timeline of W.A.

He is credited for initiating the Conservative Movement[33], whereby the largest protestant denomination turned back toward conservative theology and practice after taking a liberal slant. He was the architect of one of the first and most well known Southern Baptist mega-churches in the US.
