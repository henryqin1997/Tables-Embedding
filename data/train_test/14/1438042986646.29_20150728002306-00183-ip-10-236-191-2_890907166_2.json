For employees covered by the FERS, INS contributes approximately 13 percent. For employees hired since December 31, 1983, INS also contributes the employer's share for Social Security. All employees are eligible to contribute to the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). For those employees covered by the FERS, a TSP is automatically established, and INS is required to contribute an additional 1\u00a0percent of gross pay to this plan and match employee contributions up to an additional 4 percent of gross pay. No matching contributions are made to the TSPs established by the CSRS employees., 14237=Section 293 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1363, requires that the cash and U.S. Treasury bonds or notes taken as security on an immigration bond be deposited in the U.S. Treasury in trust for the obligor of the bond and bear interest payable at a rate determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. These bonds are held in trust for the obligor until the bond is either cancelled or breached by INS. Therefore, the funds related to these bonds are not available for INS use., 23737=INS does not establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for any intragovernmental accounts receivable because these accounts are considered fully collectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts for governmental receivables is determined by applying varying percentages to all accounts less than 365 days old and reserving 100 percent of all accounts greater than 365 days old.

These statements have been prepared from the books and records of INS in accordance with the form and content for entity financial statements specified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin 94-01, Form and Content of Agency Financial Statements, dated November 16, 1993, and INS accounting policies which are summarized in this note. However, as a component of the Department of Justice (DOJ), INS received a waiver with respect to certain provisions of the OMB Bulletin 94-01 and accordingly did not prepare the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Budgetary Resources and Actual Expenses. These statements are, therefore, different from the financial reports prepared for INS pursuant to OMB directives that are used to monitor and control the use of budgetary resources., 38314=In fiscal year 1995 INS initiated the Fuel in Storage Tanks (FIST)/ 5 program to bring all INS storage tanks into compliance with the updated Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements and to quantify costs that will be required to be expended over the compliance period to clean up contaminated sites.

Management, the Office of General Counsel, the Procurement Office, the Human Resource Office and the Equal Employment Opportunity Office have determined that it is probable that some of these proceedings and actions will result in the incurrence of liabilities, and the amounts are reasonably estimable. These proceedings and actions, including the $65,000,000 in employee overtime pay claims and $17,500,000 in remediation costs discussed below, total $\u00a095,918,145 and were recorded in the financial statements as of September 30, 1996., 3360=Immigration Legalization Fee Account (ILFA), Fed. Acct. Symbol 15X5086 was established in FY 1987 in accordance with P.L. 99-603, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.

Monies collected are deposited into established accounts with the U.S. Treasury to reimburse appropriations for obligations incurred during the year. Revenues also include any billings generated in the current year that have not been collected. On occasion, the $6 immigration user fee (which is deposited into the IUFA) is not remitted in a timely manner and is, therefore, subject to the Debt Collection Act of 1982. Interest, penalty, and handling charges under this Act are not available to the INS and must be transferred to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury., 2902=Immigration Examinations Fee Account (IEFA), Fed.

The future workers' compensation liability has two components, (1) unpaid billings, and (2) an amount of estimated unbilled claims. The unbilled claims are estimated by applying actuarial procedures. The DOL calculates the liability of the Federal Government for future compensation benefits, which includes the expected liability for death, disability, medical, and miscellaneous costs for approved compensation costs. The liability was determined using the paid-losses extrapolation method calculated over the next 23-year period. This method utilizes historical benefit payment patterns related to a specific incurred period to predict the ultimate payments related to that period. The projected annual benefit payments was discounted to present value. The resulting Federal Government liability was then allocated to DOJ. Based on the information provided by DOJ, the INS liability is estimated to approximately $146,858,000 at September 30, 1996. The actuarial liability is recorded for reporting purposes only. This liability constitutes an extended future estimate of cost which will not be obligated against budgetary resources until the FY in which the cost is actually billed to INS., 34920=In FY 1996, $8,000,000 was transferred from the INS Breached Bond/Detention Fund to the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury, Federal Account Symbol 151030.
