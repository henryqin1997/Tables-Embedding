I paid $2600 for this semester and the last 2 semesters were also about the same price., 268577=Most classes were pretty easy. The only really difficult class was physical science 1000 and it was mainly because the professor was really old and confusing., 11354=I ended up having to take a year off to get Utah residency because out of state tuition was so expensive, but after starting school here, I can tell you it was way worth it. I'm a full-time student and my tuition ends up around 2400 after my class and lab fees. And it's worth every dollar. I am learning more than I am paying., 449873=I really like how close this college is to my home. It would be easy access and it offers classes I believe I would enjoy taking. I look forward to attending this school in the fall of 2013., 479389=May be it's just me, but having roommates can be a bit of a hassle. Some roommates are responsible and others may not, but to bad you have to suck it up. Because you can't afford something better for yourself., 47581=A lot of the classes are really great. I would suggest that Music Majors don't seriously look at this school. The music program isn't very good. Beware! The Biology 1010 class is the most flunked class at the school. Taking lab is optional, but I highly recommend that you take this at the same time. It will help significantly., 797581=Probably one of the cheaper universities in the state of Utah. Tuition my last two semesters was around 2500-2700., 3655=First of all, this HAS to be one of the least expensive schools in the US! My tuition is usually around $2500 a semester, but that's for 19 credit hours... For 9, it's more like $1200. But think of it this way: Not only are you paying for an instructor, you're paying for a friend, and possibly a future reference/stepping stool into the career of your choice... It's not half bad.}",

Every class I have had thus far has been taught by highly respected individuals; everyone has at least one Master's and they have all had experience working in their field! The class room sizes are fairly small; the largest I've had contained 25 students. The Professors are easy to talk to and **Remember your name**!!
