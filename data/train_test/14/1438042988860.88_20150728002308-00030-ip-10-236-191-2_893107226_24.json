            "There's a variety of Food and Dining plans, which is nice.",
            "I was impressed with the dorms! Not as large as some dorm rooms I've seen, but not bad.",
            "The academics are fantastic!",
            "I suggest visiting the school. As soon as I stepped foot on campus, I could see myself attending. I've visited 3 times, and the campus is beautiful. A visit is a must!",
            "The University of Mount Union was among several schools that I applied to. It was the first school that I visited, applied to, the first that I was accepted to. It made the college search so much easier, and that's not even mentioning the amazing opportunities that Mount Union has to offer."

They need to change up the selections, they seem to have the same meals alot. It would be nice if the cafeteria was open later. There are many athletes on campus and sometimes I am at practice longer and the cafeteria closes at 7:00 before I get home. I miss out on dinner. And on Sunday they close at 5:00 so we have to eat dinner at 4:00. Way to early., 106129=Sheets is a great place to eat late night and Chipotle is just down the street if you're hungry. Sunday the cafeteria is only open until 5:00 so don't forget to get there in the late afternoon or you have to buy your dinner somewhere else.}",
