I initially went to the library and picked up a number of other books on autism/asperger's and started working my way through them. I was devastated by how hopeless they all seemed. Many of them implied that my son would never even live independently. A few months later, I found a copy of this at Half-price books. I got it home and couldn't put it down. I used many of the techniques in the book to help my own son's language development. This book really helped me understand that he WAS teachable and that he could overcome many of the symptoms of the disease that would hold him back in life. This book gave me a way to be proactive. I would recommend this book to any parent who has a child that was recently diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. ...more",

The authors conducted a study of millionaires, including how they made their money, their habits, etc. He found that most of them were first-generation wealthy, that many were small business owners, and basically that they were people who lived below their means, saved, and used their income to build wealth instead of to acquire luxuries. They typically don't carry debt or have big houses. Some of it was really eye-opening--the authors looked at things like what kind of cars they drove, or watches they wore. The basic conclusion was that these are just everyday people, most of whom you would never suspect were wealthy, and that the average person can do the same. ...more",

I have checked it out from the library numerous times and I always find something new every time I do. It is a compilation of years of newsletters that Dacyczyn published. I love that not only does it have concrete ideas, but she also talks a lot about attitudes and how to look at things differently. She really challenges you to look at everything in your life. I believe that most of the newletters were written in the 90's, but are even more relevant today, with people being more aware of taking care of the planet. ...more",

I thought this was a fascinating look at the food industry. We do not eat a lot of fast food, but what was really eye-opening was that the fast food industry still affects us, since the fast food industry/culture has affected most of the food production in the U.S. We haven't made the switch away from conventional meat products, but I would say we've decreased our consumption substantially, and I know that the ideal thing would be to purchase our foods locally. ...more",
