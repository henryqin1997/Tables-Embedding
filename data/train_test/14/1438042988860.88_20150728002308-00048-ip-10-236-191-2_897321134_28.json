If something is going on or seems suspicious, the school will alert students. Also, campus safety will walk you to your car if you want them to. Great for these types of students Henry Ford has a lot of programs. It's a great school for: -Nursing & Other Health Related Careers -Computer Information Systems & Other Computer Related Careers -Graphic Design & Art Related Careers There are many more, but these are a few I know about.",
