Anyone could have claimed him off waivers (like they did Komatsu) but no one did. Because he cleared waivers, Corey is Nats' property for the rest of this season, even though he is not on the 40-man. They took a big chance on putting him through waivers, apparently believing Corey was not worth protecting last November. But now they have to make room on the 40-man by letting someone else go if they want to bring him up now. Corey is the best LH hitting OF in the organization now, but Rizzo boxed himself in last November by taking him off the 40-man roster. Bet he wishes he could have a do-over on that., 42066=Love Ankiel's professionalism and heart. If only he could have learned to lay off that high hard one out of the zone. He never, ever hit it, but he always tried. Competitive sports is the ultimate meritocracy. The Nats have better options than Rick. It's not personal.He was a willing mentor to the guy who replaced him, and even helped the young pitchers with advice on the mental and physical aspects of their games. Given the options, though, it was the right move.I suspect Davey will use Strasburg as a PH now. Frankly, he is the best hitter on the bench, and, sad to say, much better than Rick. Bernie has been the LH guy off the bench, and has been great in that role. When Tracy returns, Davey will have the left side of the plate covered. I don't see why they would bring Nady back when they've got TyMo, but someone goes when Werth comes back \u2013 probably the extra BP hurler.Forget about Henry being DFA'd. The Mets would pick him up in a heartbeat, and he would haunt the Nats for years to come. When the time comes, they will option either Stammen or Matheus back to Syracuse for a few weeks, until they can bring them back up in September.A trade? Anyone who can read Rizzo's mind is way ahead of me., 72836=Jul 19, 2012, 2:56 PM EDT, 58716=Had to do it, with Harper proving he can play CF and Werth close. But it makes me very sad. I don't think he will get picked up easily by another team, because the contention teams won't have much use for a .228 hitter with low OBP, and the non-contending teams want younger guys. So there's a chance he could go into our minors and re-emerge in September. But if he's hurt, he might just take the rest of the season off and try again next spring.The image of him with Harper's bloody face, and the great throw to third, etc., etc.\u2013lots memories, including that hot streak this spring., 39385=#4 \u2014 \"Wearing out your bullpen can cause longer-lasting damage.\"Exactly. Exhibit A, the 2011 Atlanta Braves.Exactly what Davey is determined to avoid.}",
