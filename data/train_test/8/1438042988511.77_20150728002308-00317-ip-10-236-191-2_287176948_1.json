Vincent Kompany\u2019s 100 per cent success rate in dribbling is evidence of his composure on the ball as the Belgian has brought some calmness to a slightly leaky City defence. Van Persie has tried his luck 40 times this season, with half of them hitting the target and five of them hitting the net.
