    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30838=Known techniques for isolating RNA typically utilize either guanidine salts or phenol extraction, as described for example in Sambrook, J. et al., \"Molecular Cloning\", Vol. 1, pp. 7.3-7.24, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989) and Ausubel, F. M. et al., \"Current Protocols in Molecular Biology\", Vol. 1, pp. 4.0.3-4.4.7, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1994). Phenol-based techniques are multi-step procedures requiring several hours or days to complete. Similarly, the guanidine-based RNA isolation methods require at least several hours and take many steps to complete. In my earlier U.S. Pat. No. 4,843,155, phenol and guanidine procedures were uniquely combined, resulting in a simple method of total RNA isolation which can be completed in 3 hours. The method of the '155 patent was further improved upon in my '994 patent, which allows for completion of the RNA isolation in about 1 hour., 28328=DNA isolation methods utilizing non-corrosive chaotropic agents have also been developed. These methods, which are based on the use of guanidine salts, urea and sodium iodide, involve lysis of a biological sample in a chaotropic aqueous solution and subsequent precipitation of the crude DNA fraction with a lower alcohol. The final purification of the precipitated, crude DNA fraction can be achieved by any one of several methods, including column chromatography as described in \"RapidPrep\u2122 Genomic DNA Isolation Kits For Cells and Tissue: Versatility at Your Fingertips|\", Analects, Vol 22, No. 4, Pharmacia Biotech, 1994, or exposure of the crude DNA to a polyanion-containing protein as described in Koller U.S. Pat. NO. 5,128,247., 27025=There are many known methods for the separate isolation of DNA, RNA and proteins from biological material; i.e., protocols for isolating a single one of these components from a sample. In typical DNA isolation methods, a biological sample is lysed in a lysing solution and then the DNA is isolated from the lysate according to any one of a variety of multi-step protocols, which may take from one hour to several days to complete. Frequently recommended DNA isolation methods involve the use of toxic phenol. See, Sambrook, J. et al., \"Molecular Cloning\", Vol. 2, pp. 9.14-9.23, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989) and Ausubel, Frederick M. et al., \"Current Protocols in Molecular Biology\", Vol. 1, pp. 2.2.1-2.4.5, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1994). Typically, a biological sample is lysed in a detergent solution and the protein component of the lysate is digested with proteinase for 12-18 hours. Next, the lysate is extracted with phenol to remove most of the cellular components, and the remaining aqueous phase is processed further to isolate DNA. In another method, described in Van Ness et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,423, non-corrosive phenol derivatives are used for the isolation of nucleic acids. The resulting preparation is a mix of RNA and DNA., 40677=Overall, and in comparison with other known methodologies, the precipitation of nucleic acids according to the present invention is performed with a substantially reduced amount of organic solvents. For example, in Sambrook, J. et al., \"Molecular Cloning\", Vol. 1, pp. 7.3-7.24, Cold Spring Harbor Press (1989), the precipitation of RNA requires the addition of 0.5-2.5 volumes of a lower alcohol added to one volume of the chaotropic solution. In addition, the RNA precipitation was carried out for several hours at -20-4\ufffd C. In contrast, the precipitation of RNA according to the present method is completed in about 3-5 minutes and is performed at room temperature. With respect to the DNA precipitation, Botwell, D. D. L. \"Rapid Isolation of Eukaryotic DNA\", Anal. Biochem. 162, 463-465 (1987), describes precipitation from chaotropic solutions carried out with 2-2.5 volumes of ethanol. Likewise, high volumes of alcohol have been recommended for the effective DNA precipitation from non-chaotropic solutions, as exemplified in Ausubel, F. M. et al., \"Current Protocols in Molecular Biology\", Vol. 1, pp. 221-245, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1994).}",

Rat spleen (127 mg) was homogenized in a hand held glass-Teflon homogenizer with 5 ml of the lysing solution described in Example 5. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and DNA was precipitated and washed as in Example 5. The isolated DNA exhibited a 260/280 ratio 1.76, and the yield was 1.93 mg DNA. Isolation of DNA from Tissues with One Centrifugation of the Lysate EXAMPLE 6 The protocol for DNA isolation without centrifugation can be completed in less than 10 minutes. This is believed to be the fastest and simplest method of genomic DNA isolation. Importantly, the only equipment required for this method are tubes and pipettes. This allows for performing the DNA isolation on a field trip or elsewhere with a limited access to laboratory equipment. The unexpected and rapid hydrolysis of RNA occurring at pH 8-pH 9 can be attributed to the presence of the chaotropic agent. This new finding allows for isolation of good quality DNA in a simple, one-step method. This embodiment of the invention further shortens the DNA isolation protocol by omitting centrifugation of the lysate. This deletion of centrifugation results in only a",
