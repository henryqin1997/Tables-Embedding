            "Really safe. If you get too drunk somewhere on campus, from midnight till 6 in the moring campus security will pick you up.",
            "Amazing! It's a great way to get involved and meet new people. Slightly time consuming but hanging with your sisters and bonding is enjoyable.",
            "There are plenty of things to do you just have to know where to look for them. small downfall, the school focuses more involvment in the fall term rather than the spring term.",
            "If your a social person UT is for you. The campus is small enough where it's eay to get to know a lot of faces. Yet, there are still a lot of faces that are unknown when you look around.",
            "GO TO YBOR or the POOL. If you just want to relax have a picnic by the river in plant park. If your feeling adventurous take a walk in downtown.",
            "there could be more options. catching the caf at inbetween meals sucks. the food isn't that bad and there are other places near by if you want something different.",
            "if your living with friends it's pretty chill. the older dorms like mckay and smiley are gross and have a hospital like feeling to them and are very small. there are better rooms in some resident hall than others, so it's luck if you get a nice room.",
            "if you have a tough major expect a hevy work load. the library is always there so don't be afraid to use it.",
            "Don't waste your money if you don't have it. UT is a great secong home and i'm proud to call it that. Get involved experience all things.",
            "it's expensive. currently working on expantion. i love it."

May be pricey, but well worth the costs., 442214=UT students always participate in the Gasparilla parade that takes place mid-January. It is a great experience, a lot like mardi gras, and a great way to let loosen up a bit half way through the school year., 36862=This university is great for kids who like a more one on one learning experience and like to get to know a variety of different people from a variety of different places, we have over 1000 international students! If you don't wanna take a twenty minute walk to your classes, get to know a lot of people, and have your teacher know who you are The University of Tampa is right for you!, 500214=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 143323=Gasparilla. Every year in January the city of Tampa shuts down its main roads for what is essentially a pirate-themed Mardi Gras. The residence assistants will cook breakfast for each student in their hall and the students start drinking as early as 7am. Then we walk around the city watching the parade and seeing thousands of people. Best time of my life., 114690=The dorms are pretty good except really for Mckay. But, the school keeps accepting way more students than they have room for so some students are put in a hotel off campus but there is a shuttle to get to and from campus. A new dorm is underway and should be up in 2013., 324775=There is an annual event that happens in late January, right after you come back from winter break called Gasparilla, AKA Gatsby. Everybody wakes up at 9 am, puts on a pirate costume, gets drunk, and walks the streets of Tampa. This event is actually a lot of fun and sponsored by the city, there's a huge pirate parade and the pirates give away beads in the parade. It is complete madness and a nightmare if you decide to drive that day, but its ALWAYS better on foot if you're going to be drinking!! But if you're more of a wallflower, its pretty easy to opt out, there's no pressure to party, but a lot of people do. Tampa is actually on a river that is within a park so you can walk up to the river, lay out a towel and sunbathe, study, or take in the view. Its a really beautiful place to just sit and relax. Another cool thing was that we had the Republican National Debate come to UT this last Fall of 2012! We had the Today Show come and visit the campus as well as Senator John McCain stopped by to speak to our business students., 315565=I have heard great things from this school. I am planning to apply in the Fall of 2013. Is a beautiful campus and I hope to visit the campus soon!}",

We have so much here on campus all withing walking distance, you don't have to ride a bike to get from building to building. It's also a great school if you live in Florida as I do, you can live on campus and have the independence, but still not be that far away in case you need something from home. Another plus, no expenses to travel home during breaks. Tips for prospective students Apply here early. Tour the campus, get the full picture. You will love what you see. Bang for the buck I believe I am getting the best education possible. University of Tampa",
