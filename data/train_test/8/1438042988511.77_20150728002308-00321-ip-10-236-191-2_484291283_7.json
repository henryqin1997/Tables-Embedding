    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Additionally, although only some exemplary tools are discussed, other tools may also be implemented to take advantage of the trackpoint-based architecture of the inventive collaborative project development and communication software as well as of the flexible structure of the trackpoint, briefing book page, or other existing tools. By way of example, a link map tool may be provided which provides the project participant with a map of relationships (established via links or implicitly via functions) between the trackpoints. As another example, a glossary or a taxonomy may be provided to assist the project participant in filling out the attribute values (e.g., the metadata or the typed data within the attribute fields). As a further example, although the invention is discussed in terms of methods and computer networks, it should be understood to also encompass computer-readable medium (such as CDROMs, disks, tapes, or the like) and/or conductive medium and/or networks that contains or carries computer-readable instructions for accomplishing the inventive techniques described and/or suggested. It should also be noted that there are many alternative ways of implementing the methods and apparatuses of the present invention. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims be interpreted as including all such alterations, permutations, and equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention. While this invention has been described in terms of several preferred embodiments, there are alterations, permutations, and equivalents which fall within",
