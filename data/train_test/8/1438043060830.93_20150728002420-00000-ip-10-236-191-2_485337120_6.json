Techniques for associating ATM circuits with IP multicast groups is described in greater detail in Request For Comments (RFC) 2022 (G. Armitage, Support for Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 based ATM Networks, November 1996).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0041] Other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims. [0040] The techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of the two. For example, the techniques may be implemented by programming a network processor or other processing system. The programs may be disposed on computer readable mediums and include instructions for causing processor(s) to execute instructions implementing the techniques described above. [0039] The network processor 200 may implement the techniques described above in a variety of ways. For example, the control data may be stored as an array in DRAM while different packet processor 204 and core 210 threads process received PDUs and implement scheduling logic. [0038] The processor 200 also includes a core processor 210 (e.g., a StrongARM\ufffd XScale\ufffd) that is often programmed to perform \u201ccontrol plane\u201d tasks involved in network operations. The core processor 210, however, may also handle \u201cdata plane\u201d tasks and may provide additional datagram processing threads. [0037] An individual packet processor 204 may offer multiple threads. The multi-threading capability of the packet processors 204 is supported by context hardware that reserves different general purpose registers for different threads and can quickly swap instruction and status data for the different threads between context registers and context storage. [0036] The network processor 200 shown features a collection of packet processors 204. The",
