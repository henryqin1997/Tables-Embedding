Doap Nixon stakes his claim in the rap game with this debut album. All the AOTP rappers featured on this album bring their best too. If there is one CD worth buying this winter, hook yourself up with this one. If you're broke - find a way. Pay the man his dues. Thank you Doap Nixon, Jedi Mind, and AOTP for always bringing real music to my ears. Can't wait for more yo! P.S. Everyone writing reviews on iTunes, you know who I'm talking to, you need to check yourselves and stop acting like hooligans with all that slang. Y'all are not gangbangin' on iTunes so talk with a little more respect. Don't act hard - or get knocked out. Peace. mediocre \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by TeddySalad Doap sounds good, but the beats fall flat. None of them hit hard at all except Everything's Changing...which",
