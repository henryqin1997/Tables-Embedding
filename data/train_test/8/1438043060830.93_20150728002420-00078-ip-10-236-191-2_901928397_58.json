            "There are over 50 organizations that you can join, from psychology club to sororities. You get to meet great people.",
            "Great for any types of students. Especially for music majors and engineer majors. Their department is great.",
            "An unusual tradition is the throwing of the tortillas when our football teams scores a touchdown.",
            "You get what you paid for. Tuition is a little pricey, but this campus is great. Grass is cut, computers work, there are no buildings falling apart. What more could you want?",
            "If you are a party person, there are a few bars. If you are like me, there are organizations on campus with great people. I met some of the greatest friends I've ever had on campus and we usually go to the movies or to dinner for a good time.",
            "I honestly do not like the food on campus. I loved it my freshman year because I was new, but as the years went by, I realized that all they served were pasta, pizza, and burgers. I do, however, LOVE the Thanksgiving dinner at the dining hall! I do not have a meal plan but I will go and pay whatever amount I need to pay to be able to eat the delicious turkey.",
            "I love the dorm life. I currently have a dorm to myself and it is great. It is a little pricey, but it is cheaper than most of the apartments nearby. It is also a lot more convenient because I currently do not have a car, so I can walk to and from class with minutes to spare.",
            "I have learned a lot from these professors. Each professor that I have had so far have taught the students beyond the books. We have learned by hearing personal experiences life lessons.",
            "Do not be late to class. Some professors will pretend like they didn't notice you were late, but at the end of the semester you will realize that they kept track of everyone who was late. Do not miss class because you need to catch up on other homework. You WILL have time to do all of your work on time, this is coming from a fourth-year student with a job and current Psychology club president. Get to know your professors. If an emergency pops up, you can easily talk to professors who know you and try to work something out. Do not procrastinate. I have never been one to go out and party every week, so I have never pulled an all-nighter. I am an A & B student because I know how to prioritize. I am not saying to stay in your dorm all day, just know the difference between relaxing time and time to get to work time",
            "Texas A&M University- Kingsville is a wonderful school. This is currently my fourth year here and I have gotten to know most of the psychology professors and other faculty members. I have learned that they are great people who will work beyond their work hours to help students out."

The dining room seems empty due to the food. There are times were the food is actually food but most of the time it is not. Sad fact is the price is about 1200 for a meal plan which is also over priced for food you cannot stand to eat three times a day seven days a week., 9447=All the professors here know how to teach students very well and keep learning interesting. I have a really awesome professor for History 1302, who I chose again for enjoying his 1301 class last semester, who constantly challenges us and keeps us interested. My English 1301 teacher is also my 1302 teacher because I chose to have him again. These are only two professors out of many and I am looking forward to meeting the rest and learning all that I can from them. Practically every teacher here has written a book on their studies and have earned their doctorates, so they are definitely credible in my opinion., 84292=The dorm life is ridiculous. The prices are too high. paying 3300 for a dorm is just a little too much and that is for the nicest one. Also the fact the the cheapest is about 1800 and honestly should be a lot less for what your living in. The room is not even up to date to be at that price. That is more than taking a full schedule of classes which does not seem right., 4518=I not sure yet I start Aug. 2009, 255971=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

I am sure one looking to apply here will find whatever they are looking for. Tips for prospective students GO TO CLASS! One should never miss out on valuable information. You're paying for a higher education and you can't receive any if you don't even go to class. PAY ATTENTION! Missing something can really jeopardize your grade on",
