The former usually features a light source and liquid crystals, while the latter is based on organic light-emitting diodes. Newer LCD variations like IPS-LCD and Super-LCD allow for very accurate color reproduction and very wide viewing angles, where no significant image quality loss is observed. Current AMOLED screens differ in such a way that they can exhibit much more saturated colors (sometimes too much) and incredibly high contrast levels, which is due to black color being completely black in AMOLED displays. \u00a0 TFT \u00a0 Screen-to-body ratio 57.05 % 52.35 % \u00a0 Colors \u00a0 16 777 216 \u00a0 Touchscreen Multi-touch Multi-touch \u00a0 Features Light sensor, Proximity sensor Light sensor, Proximity sensor, Scratch-resistant glass",
