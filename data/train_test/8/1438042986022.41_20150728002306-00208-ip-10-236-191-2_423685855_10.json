Sony, take note where our eyes are wandering. Of course I'm teasing with the \"they get me, they appreciate me\" bit (And all the other brand justifications). That and their firmware upgrades to discontinued cameras are just cynical ploys on Fuji's part. But I'm falling for it anyway. I voted Fuji too, though",
