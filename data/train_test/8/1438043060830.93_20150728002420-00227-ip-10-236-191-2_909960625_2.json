    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{10443=Sacramento Kings tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of the NBA's oldest franchises. Established as the Rochester Royals in 1945, the Kings made the move west, eventually settling in Sacramento in 1985. The Kings play their games at The Power Balance Pavillion and have called the venue home since it opened in 1988. Watch as the Kings build their legacy and work to bring a world title to Sacramento!, 14793=8/2/12: Not too long ago, the Lakers and Kings had epic postseason battles to determine who was the best in the West. While the Lakers have continued their excellence, Sacramento has fallen on hard times. But the rivalry will be renewed, albeit in preseasson form. Of the Kings seven preseason games, three are against the Lakers. This is actually pretty important, because it will give the young Kings a good test as they prepare for the new season and hope to escape the Lottery Process. Maybe the hardest part for the Sacramento coaching staff will be on October 19th, when they team plays LA in Las Vegas, and all the trouble that comes with such a venue., 16681=10/18/12: The Triangle Offense may have been popularized and perfected by Phil Jackson and his Bulls and Lakers teams, but elements of the system actually goes back at least to the Harlem Globetrotters in 1943. The Triangle promotes movement and ball sharing. And Kieth Smart now will try to incorporate the Triangle into the Kings offense this season. Sacramento has loads of talent, maybe what they are missing is a comprehensive ball control system to get the most out of Tyreke Evans, Marcus Thornton, DeMarcus Cousins, and Thomas Robinson. With a full offseason to work on it, hopefully the team can put it to use successfully this season., 15443=8/16/12: Not often are the words 'optimism' and 'Golden State Warriros' mentioned in the same sentence, but that is exactly the situation in Oakland. Many fans were upset when Golden State let the popular Monte Ellis go in a move to build around Stephen Curry. Curry, of course, missed 41 games with a sprained ankle and is still rehabbing. Howeve, Curry let his ankle heal, rather than again rushing himself. Now he claims that he is finally recovering from the ankle pain that has plagued him for the past two years. He is optimistic that he can play without any restrictions by October 31, which is what the Warriors sorely need., 12302=5/15/12: A new arena for the Sacramento Kings remains elusive, as the team and city officials continue a particular nasty debate which may encourage the Maloof brothers to move the team out of the state capital. As the Kings sit out of the playoffs for the sixth consectutive season, the NBA began handing out its regular season awards. Isaiah Thomas, the 60th pick in the 2011 draft, placed 7th in Rookie of the Year voting. Thomas earned a starting role, averaging 25.5 minutes, 11.5 points, and 4.1 assists per game, as well as Rookie of the Month in February and March.}",
