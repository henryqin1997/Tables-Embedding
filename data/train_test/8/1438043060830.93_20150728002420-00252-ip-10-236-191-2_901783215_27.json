Whether it is going out to shop or eat on the Delmar Loop or going to a Rams or Blues game, there is always something to do in St. Louis if you're looking in the right places. Also, there is a great concert and movie scene right near campus. However, for the majority of the time, most people tend to hang out on or around campus with friends., 148824=Ten minutes down the road is Delmar Boulevard, loving known as The Loop. Here are a multitude of restaurants that easily fit the budget of a college student along with a thrift shop, record store, book store, several clothing stores, and a movie theater. Forest Park is also the campus's front yard and is home to events such as Ballon Glow (a hot air ballon festival) and several free attractions such as the Zoo, Art Museum, and History Museum. Also WashU provides metro passes to the students allowing for fun trips to the Mall, downtown to Busch Stadium for a baseball game, or to Central West End for some exploration., 273755=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 222706=The campus is insanely awesome with sweet dorms. The people are super friendly, and the campus is very safe with a police headquarters right near the dorms. Saint Louis is really great and Delmar Blvd. is only a short distance away from the school., 194416=There are too many options for food on-campus, and the Delmar Loop, a short walk from campus, is replete with dining options and trendy boutiques., 200693=Wash U is located next to Del Mar Loop, one of America's top streets for entertainment and dining., 139660=Within walking distance from school is the Delmar Loop, which has many shops, restaurants, art galleries, and bars in addition to a hotel, a movie theatre, and a 24/7 bowling alley., 252792=Get involved, don't be afraid to jump into things. I know a great hang out place is Del Mar, so there's lots to do around there., 102809=Located fairly close to campus is the Delmar Loop, a street with dozens of restaurants and stores. Most people go looping with their friends at least once every week, and it is very safe and inviting and fun. Other options are all the campus-sponsored events, or going to Forest Park and the free museums and free zoo., 254774=I was dragged against my will to this school by my mother, who thought it would be a good fit. Once I got to campus, I loved the atmosphere, the campus was beautiful, and the community seemed both collaborative and competitive. The wait for their decision is long, but hopefully worth it. (I submitted my application in November and will not hear from them until April)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Wash U is great for the student that wants a good education and is willing to work hard for it. Someone that wants a well rounded education would be great here. If you have other passions than just pure academics, Wash U is a great environment to pursue those alongside a rewarding degree. Tips for prospective students Get involved. You will more likely be accepted if the school sees that you are passionate and active. Also, the more you work on managing your time now, the easier it will be once you get to Wash U. Good grades are also very important. Bang for the buck Being a private school, the expenses are higher than most schools. However, I do think the university does a decent job at handing out scholarships, loans and grants based both on merit and need. And the education you receive is top notch with a lot of great resources and activities around, which somewhat accounts for the higher price you pay. Am enjoying being here It is great to be around other motivated students that work hard and also love helping their peers. There are countless groups, clubs and other",
