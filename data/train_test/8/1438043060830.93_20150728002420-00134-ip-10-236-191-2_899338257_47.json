Compared to the 20-30 thousand my friends are paying at major universities to take the same classes, for now, I feel like I stole my education so far. Trust me you'll love the prices., 312590=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 303926=I'm graduating in May with around 70 credits, so I've taken quite a few classes. I don't think the classes are hard at all. Some of the science classes I have taken were difficult, but really, it depends on your professor and your willingness to study. There are multiple places on campus for tutoring which is really nice, and the tutors are extremely helpful. Almost all of the professors I have had have been amazing. I know that Richland has won some type of award that no other 2-year college in America has won (the faculty doesn't let us forget), so that is a good sign! It's a good school., 264794=As of now, I have not heard of any criminal activities on the campus and I have been attending this school since 2011. I feel very safe there.}",

Tips for prospective students Register early! During Richland's enrollment the campus gets packed with students new and old. Try and register for classes online but its always good to visit the Richland's advising office for any questions. Bang for the buck Classes are cheap, and there are financial aid offices always willing to help. Am enjoying being here The Richland Student community is very helpful and there are many clubs and societies anyone can join or start your own. The college is very diverse and anyone can fit in really well.",
