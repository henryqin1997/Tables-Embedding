    "textAfterTable": "10 Songs Album Review Despite lineup changes, Charlie Hunter's trio has always consisted of a sax player and a drummer in addition to Hunter's seven- or eight-string guitar heroics. After about a decade with that template, John Ellis added a bit of keyboard and melodica to his sax for Copperopolis, almost presciently setting the stage for Mistico. With Ellis moving on to concentrate on a solo career, Hunter decided to form a brand new trio, bringing in Simon Lott on drums and Erik Deutsch on keyboards. That's right: no sax. The varied keyboards vs. sax give the album a sound that's less overtly jazz than previous efforts, but Copperopolis also showcased Hunter and company in more of a rock mood and that trend continues on Mistico. Hunter also brought in Scott Harding (aka Scotty Hard) to co-produce, pushing the envelope a bit and bringing some of the subtle magic studio touches he has used with the likes of Sex Mob, DJ Logic and Medeski, Martin & Wood. Hunter always gets great tone, whether playing with tremolo (\"Estranged\"), wah-wah/fuzz (\"Special Shirt\") or a nice distorted twang (\"Balls\"). His whole playing concept is totally unique and impressive from both a technical and musical standpoint. Deutsch switches freely between piano and Rhodes, sometimes adding some more spaced out sounds via Casio and acting",
