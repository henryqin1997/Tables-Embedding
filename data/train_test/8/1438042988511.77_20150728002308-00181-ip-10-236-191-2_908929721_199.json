            "SDSU has been known to have a semi-dangerous campus. That being said the only types of crime that occur in the campus area are thefts. It's an issue that is being worked on and can be easily avoided by not walking around on your phone at night by yourself. And by just being aware.",
            "Greek Life is big here. It's around 32% of the total population. It's something that if you're unsure about it i recommend just checking it out. You might be surprised. It's not something that is necessary for a social life. But they are a community that is a presence on campus.",
            "There's a lot of options all depending on personal preference. Most kids look at pre-professional type clubs or clubs that have something to do with their major. Along with any extracurriculars you want to continue on with from high school.",
            "SDSU is good for students with a work hard play hard mentality. Kids here are extremely well rounded. They are efficient and studious when they need to be while also being social and extroverted. If you like a relaxed vibe mixed with an academic atmosphere this is your place.",
            "Trujillos and Pita Pit are the go to locations for late night meal time. Our student section The Show is a big tradition as well.",
            "This is one thing that I think was really appealing as an out of state student. The tuition actually has been decreasing over the years. And you're getting a California education for a great price.",
            "Intramurals are always an option if you play sports. The Aquaplex and the ARC are amazing too. The beach is a short 15 minutes away. San Diego is pretty big and has a lot to offer. Obviously there's Sea World and the zoo. There's also Balboa park and Pacific Beach. As far as on campus goes, most kids just relax by the pool, go to sporting events, and hang out.",
            "The food on campus and around campus is all good. There's something for everyone, and it's literally all good food. The only downside is the freshmen meal plans could be set up a little better. Some get a declining balance which makes the most sense and some kids get a daily balance which is hard to manage. Aside from that, there's everything from pizza to pasta, sandwiches and paninis, a salad bar, Olive Oil Cafe, Rubio's, Panda Express, and Starbucks. All of which work on the meal plan system.",
            "Dorm life has great aspects and then it has some not so great aspects. The social component of dorm life is great depending on which hall you're in. Your steps away from kids in all your classes and everyone is pretty much in the same boat as you. The cons are that college kids are messy and loud and sometimes inconsiderate. But that's to be expected when 500 18-year olds all live together.",
            "This is all dependent upon your major. Some majors are quite intensive. Almost all majors are impacted. Therefore only a certain number of students are let into each degree program. It's not unheard of to minor or double major here depending on what you're into.",
            "Southern California lives up to its laidback, breezy vibe here. Don't come into everything as a ball of stress. Everything is very relaxed and very chill most of the time. Of course there's the stress of midterms and finals. But overall, in all aspects of life, people take their time here and don't worry about the little things.",
            "SDSU is one of the most well rounded schools in SoCal. SDSU has a great learning environment, incredible weather, and an even better social environment. Academically, SDSU is geared towards helping you discover what you want to do and get you the job you're looking for."

The average high school GPA for the class of 2017 was a 3.8., 504193=Go to the gym, play bowling at kearny mesa bowl since the aztec center is closed until fall 2013, go to the SDSU men's basketball games at Viejas Arena or concerts, go to the SDSU Football games at Qualcomm Stadium, and watch sports or listen to music/play video games., 360756=not really big here since the drug bust in 2007. many sororities/fraternities were suspended., 245933=There's a lot to do in San Diego! A cultural feast. Get a copy of the local weekly magazine, The Reader, when you arrive. Balboa Park alone has over 20 museums, biking and jogging paths, huge gardens, Spanish Village with an old California feel and artisans' shops, and hospitality houses from many countries. If you're a foreign student, go there for local information and socializing. The Park also hosts the Earth Fair every April. Movie theatres near campus show an eclectic array of films. The beaches are wonderful for surfing, relaxing and playing with your dog., 454032=The school is becoming increasingly difficult to gain acceptance to. For those hoping to transfer, keep in mind that there is a followup application due in January., 399492=food is tasty, but there could be more options. the associated students building which is set to open fall of 2013 will have great dining choices., 313617=I am an incoming freshman, and I will be attending in Fall 2015. I have some friends that go here, and they say that you should be very careful with the party scene here on campus. There are a lot of parties that you can go to, but always make sure to be careful!}",

The college is full of beautiful nature which includes hundreds of different types of plants, flowers, and trees. In the middle of the school is a coy pond full of fish and turtles, this pond is so relaxing to visit during a break or just to lie down on the grass and take a nap. If you want to go outside the college area there are beaches and parks in very close distance. Students that want or are interested in joining a fraternity or sorority, our Greek system is fantastic and has a huge range from the Pan-Hellenic to cultural fraternities and sororities. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find one that is perfect for you; it\u2019s a great way to be social and make new friends! Active students will enjoy the many different sports SDSU has to offer from division to intramural",
