            "All NMSU campuses have many safety features. Lots of great lighting for walking in the dark and plenty of willing staff to walk with you if you feel you need some company after dark. There is minimal theft, if this should happen, the college handles these situation with high priority.",
            "Not much in the way Greek Life.",
            "There is a club for anyone at NMSU. From student government, to honors societies, and gatherings of students who have the same interests. The only set back is that the information about the clubs and activities are not shared openly so students have to ask for it.",
            "As far as Traditions, NMSU has many for high achieving academics. There are ceremonies for Crimson Scholars, PTK, and college ring acceptances. For locations your can find great food almost anytime on campus.",
            "Being as most students are paying for their education, in most classes, you will get what your paying for. The IT and library staff has also been a big help.",
            "All NMSU campuses have lots to do for students, most fairly inexpensive. There are theater production to see, with discounts for NMSU students. There are card games, movie nights, sports games, and academic gathers, if your into that. Lots to do if your not studying.",
            "I am an on-line student and have not eaten on campus.",
            "I am an on-line student so I have not lives on campus.",
            "Most teachers are understanding of emergencies but late work is not accepted. Only a few instructors are relaxed with it comes to academic work. Most teachers expect nothing but the best from their students, so get on your game and stay on it. Extra credit is almost unheard of. In the case of needing extra help, the instructors are more than willing to spend extra time with a student in need and will give the grade a student has earned. Showing that you work hard will pay off in the end.",
            "If you are student taking on-line classes or face classes, get to know the on-line system ASAP and become very independent. All registration is done on-line for every student with little room for questions. Also become very familiar with the FASFA process as all pain grant and loan monies come from this website.",
            "This college has great teachers who care about their students and their students success in each course. The Administration staff on the other hand appears to not be concerned about the students as they can take a long time to answer questions, return phone calls or emails. Financial assistance can also be few and far between while attending this school."

TAOS offers a variety of foods, and one of the best things is they have a special menu for vegans/vegetarians. They also have days where they have food themes from other places. One of the downsides, however, would have to be that they close pretty early, so if you wanted food at around 10:00 p.m. you would have to go to the food court, which doesn't have too much to offer in my opinion., 289598=Be sure to fill out the FAFSA and the Scholar Dollar$ Application before March 1st of the Fall you are going to attend to get any aid you may need., 501631=Apply before September of your senior year. Deadlines for institutional scholarships are Dec 1. Apply for housing as soon as possible. There are only 3 residence halls open to Freshman and they fill up fast. Don't take an excessive amount of classes(15+), your freshman year unless your major requires it for on time graduation. Fill out the Scholar Dollars application as soon as you receive your letter of admission. The sooner you apply the more scholarships you are eligible for., 231272=May be rought staying away from home, but with the great views from the dorms and friendly people in the area there is no need to feel blue., 373868=We have a luminaria walk every year on the first Sunday of December its beautiful. The campus is lined up with luminarias, and you get to see it all in a horse carriage, along with hot cocoa and singing Christmas songs., 679969=All of the professors I've had so far are extremely fun and understanding. Try to schedule classes when you know you will go. Do not register for a 7:30 AM class if you know that will not wake up., 4755=APPLY EARLY! My biggest fault was changing my mind at the last minute. I was only able to get loans because I didn't meet the March 1st deadline for scholarships. So always be on top of your deadlines. And have fun! The first few weeks I just studied. Keep a healthy balance of social activities as well as academics. I now do Zumba, have a part time job, and hang out with friends. Even though I've been studying less, my grades are still going up because I'm happy. I'm balanced and thus better able to stay focused., 688175=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 455147=Greek life at New Mexico State university is one of the strongest and active group of students. Most greek are passionate about their chapter which makes every event a good time. Each chapter offers a different brotherhood/sisterhood where everyone can find their place. The Greek GPA average was higher than the undergradute GPA average for the 2012 Fall Semester.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here NMSU has a beautiful very large campus. It's very green with quite a few trees. It's definately very different from where I came from, so I do get occasionally home sick. The people are great, and the food isn't to bad. The dorms are a bit small, but you're never in your dorm anyway. It's definately an experience sharing your room with someone. Am learning a lot I'm an Animal Science major, and I've learned more in the past few months then I've learned in the past few years. With hands on labs, and discussions in your lectures you get to learn by actually doing! I have a variety of classes, and you will to. If you want to try something, they'll schedule it in. I have a hands on lab, and in this lab I've done everything from herding sheep to checking inside a cows stomach. The experience is unforgetable!
