            "No need to worry if you're ever in danger. There's literally more than 10 police officers circling the campus, checking to see if you're stopping for students to walk across campus when needing too.",
            "I believe we don't have any of those on campus. Clubs are kept to a minimum. Not much.",
            "Glee Club, Flag football, Drill Team, Christian Club, LGBT, ect.",
            "If you're here to learn and pass everything as soon as possible, TSTC is the way to go.",
            "Nothing's really unusual around here. Everything's pretty sane.",
            "Guys Night Out, Girls Night Out, Karaoke Night, Movie Night, Gaming Night ect.",
            "Food is great. Although I think we all are trying to avoid greasy fattening food. Healthy is a better option.",
            "Not really sure how the dorms are like. I live 15 minutes away from home. Although I've heard they're small, very strict on visiting hours. But overall great for the rating price for each semester.",
            "Only challenge would have to be any math class! Math is a tricky difficult class for me. Although it all really depends where your weakness stands. Some are fantastic in math, some are not, some have to study harder, some don't. We all have different strong and low points.",
            "Getting involved in clubs, activities is great! Just try not to get TOO involved that you forget about your classes. Skipping class is not fun. Just do what you need to do the first time, and it'll all pay off at the end.",
            "Very nice, cheap community college to start off for a year. Great start to get your basics out of the way instead of going to another university that offer the same thing. Kind of disappointing that it's just a 'Technical' College."

After taking an orientation to college all day presentation., 123454=If you are planning on taking the Wind Turbine Technician course at the Ingleside campus I would definitely recommend it. George Lister is a perfect teacher for learning all you need to know about the subject. Mrs. Trish is a great reference and teacher for the 1101 course. Everybody else that comes from the Harlingen campus and that you need to talk to on the phone are nice people., 9931=I am currently taking my basics here. I will be finished in May 2012, and from there I plan on transferring to a university that offers a major in business management., 107376=Stay on alert on your admissions process, financial aid and the 1101 course. Ask questions and continue to ask questions. Things function very slow and will not get done, unless you are pressuring lazy employees/staff., 132493=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
