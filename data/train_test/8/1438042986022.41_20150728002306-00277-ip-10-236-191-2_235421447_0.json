Ratcliffe in response to Ratcliffe's own PIR. Ratcliffe wrote an article on his PIR on Dec 13 (\"Judge in death case violated policies: Keller, who shut out appeal, says new written rules reflect unwritten ones on that day\"). He wrote that \"Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Presiding Judge Sharon Keller apparently violated court policies for handling death penalty cases when she closed the court clerk's doors on Michael Richard's efforts to file a last-minute appeal before his execution.\" Ratcliffe's reporting seems to have uncovered the smoking gun admission that Keller broke the CCA's policies in effect on the day of Richard's execution. He should be given a journalism award for his work. We congratulate him on his idea of asking for the policies in effect on Sept 25. His article left us wanting to see the entire text of the policies ourselves, so we submitted our own PIR. Reading the entire text of the policies makes it very clear that Keller violated the rules by not contacting the assigned duty judge about the request by Richard's lawyers to file a late appeal. We sent a copy to the State Commission on Judicial Conduct of Keller's letter to Ratcliffe and of the document \"Execution-day Procedures\". Read the policies and judge for yourselves if she violated them. Here is a link to a pdf of the document we received from the Court. The newly written down text of the unwritten policies in effect on Sept 25, 2007 is below:, 22968=When the Texas Legislature convenes in January, it should take action to remove Sharon Keller from the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. We are still waiting for a report from the State Commission on Judicial Conduct regarding the reprehensible actions of Sharon Keller, presiding judge of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. The last communication we received from the Commission was that their investigation was nearing completion. That was in September. There were several judicial complaints filed against Keller (scroll down for list)., 26967=Every year since 1994, Governing has honored individual state and local government officials for outstanding accomplishment by naming them Public Officials of the Year.

Ronald Gray Stay of Execution Order, 1378=Texas has no more executions scheduled in 2008. Eighteen people were executed in Texas this year. There probably would have been more, but there was a de facto moratorium on executions lasting from Sept 26, 2007 through the first 2008 execution in Texas on June 11. The de facto moratorium, which was caused by the wait for a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court in the Baze case, started one day earlier in the rest of the nation, but Texas was able to execute one more person than it should have in 2007 after Sharon Keller said, \"We close at 5\" and refused to accept an appeal for Michael Richard on Sept 25, 2007. Nine of the eighteen people executed in Texas in 2008 were African-American. Six of the eighteen people executed in Texas in 2008 were white. Three of the eighteen people executed in Texas were Hispanic. 66 percent of the people executed in Texas were Hispanic or black. 33 percent of the people executed in Texas were white. Seven people were executed from Dallas County, the most from any county in 2008. In 2007, Texas executed 26 people.

It is about using online activism to change the world. The author, Tom Watson, also has a blog that is worth a look. He says that Obama's election was \"the product of the most socially-wired campaign in American history. In a victory that holds deep lessons for how nonprofit organizations and cause-driven ventures will organize volunteers and build support in the future, Barack Obama was elected President of the United States Tuesday in a near-landslide victory keyed by state-of-the-art social networking and online organizing.\" The website SocialActions is also a great place to find useful social activism services. It has a guide to 30 website platforms that can be used for online activism. Another source is MobileActive.org, which concentrates on using cell phones for social change. If you run an anti-death penalty website, you might take a look at some of the online services that TMN uses and implement them on your own sites. TMN was an early adopter of online activism from our start back in 2000. Our first website, created using phpWebSite, allowed us to make blog posts long before the word \"blog\" became popular. We have sinced starting using Blogger as our main blog while keeping our main website at texasmoratorium.org. In addition to our own blog, we reach a larger audience by posting occasionally about death penalty issues on other community blog sites, such as DailyKos and Burnt Orange Report. Every anti-death penalty organization can share news and action alerts on each others websites by creating a news feed using a service such as Google Reader. Then you include the RSS feeds from other anti-death penalty organizations. You can see an example on the right of our blog and main website. Capital Defense Weekly is a site that uses RSS feeds very well. We have used Joomla to create websites such as SharonKiller.com and deathpenaltyartshow.org, among others. The TMN PAC website uses WordPress. Our main website still uses phpWebSite, but we want to transition to another content management system soon. You can also find TMN on Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Change.org or read our blog. We feed our blog automatically to Twitter using TwitterFeed. Our Twitter account also is fed action alerts dealing with the death penalty from the SocialActions website, so it should pick up alerts from other anti-death penalty organizations., 86984=Posted by Texas Moratorium Network at 6:55 PM \u00a0, 29532=The AP reports that Texas executed Robert Jean Hudson tonight. The 45-year-old was the 18th Texas inmate put to death this year in the nation's busiest capital punishment state. He was the 423rd person executed in Texas since 1982.

Whitaker was pronounced dead at 6:15 p.m. Denard Manns is set for execution in Texas tomorrow and three more executions are scheduled in Texas next week.

Bush could not resist having one more execution while he is in elected office to add to the more than 150 he signed off on as Governor of Texas, so the news is not surprising that he approved an execution by the U.S. Army for Dec 10. Theoretically, Bush could still commute the sentence to life in prison. See contact information below to urge Bush to stop this execution. Email Bush at comments@whitehouse.gov. We can hope that the incoming Obama Administration will enact a moratorium on federal executions. To tell Obama to stop federal executions after he assumes office, you can sign a petition here. Obama has no authority to stop the execution scheduled before he assumes office on Jan 20.

Hurricane Season is a post-Katrina performance uprising: a multi-media show and movement strategy that draws vital connections between shared struggles and common solutions in a critical moment in national and global history. New Orleans emerged from the floodwaters as a microcosm of the intersecting forces at play across the world: - global warming and environmental injustice - extreme poverty amidst affluence and over-consumption - gentrification and forced relocation of poor people and people of color - the police, prison, and military industrial complex - corporate control over public policy - lack of local ownership and self-determination - gross disparity of access and power along gender, sexuality, class, and color lines Through a tapestry of spoken-word poetry, theater, video projection, dance, shadow art, and a sound collage of personal testimonies, Hurricane Season connects the issues that surfaced in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to the \u201cunnatural disasters\u201d disenfranchised communities are experiencing nationwide on a daily basis. Popular education through cultural activism, the performance brims with stories missing or mangled in mainstream media. The show is both brutal and uplifting, taking the audience on a voyage of unthinkable tragedy and undeniable promise from the eye of a systemic storm. With a set built of bamboo,calabash, and water that surrounds the audience in a circle of shadow and light, Hurricane Season transforms spaces into sanctuaries of healing, witness, and imagination. Every show is followed by a \u201csolutions-cipher,\u201d a forum that addresses the impacts of the issues surfaced in Hurricane Season on a local level, and illuminates solutions already underway. The objective of the post-show \u201csolutions-ciphers\u201d is to cross-pollinate creative strategies for self-determination and to turn the passion generated in the show into action manifested in the community.

Seven bills were filed on the first day. The first bill on the list, HB 111, grew out of the case of Kenneth Foster, Jr., who was tried together with a co-defendant. When Gov Perry commuted Foster's sentence in 1987, he said he was concerned that Foster had not had a separate trial. Chair of the House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee Aaron Pena's HB 111 says, \"the court may not join two or more defendants in the same criminal trial if any defendant to be tried is indicted or complained against for a capital felony, and the court shall order a severance as to any two or more defendants who are jointly indicted or complained against for a capital felony\".

There probably would have been more, but there was a de facto moratorium on executions lasting from Sept 26, 2007 through the first 2008 execution in Texas on June 11. The de facto moratorium, which was caused by the wait for a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court in the Baze case, started one day earlier in the rest of the nation, but Texas was able to execute one more person than it should have in 2007 after Sharon Keller said, \"We close at 5\" and refused to accept an appeal for Michael Richard on Sept 25, 2007. Nine of the eighteen people executed in Texas in 2008 were African-American. Six of the eighteen people executed in Texas in 2008 were white. Three of the eighteen people executed in Texas were Hispanic. 66 percent of the people executed in Texas were Hispanic or black. 33 percent of the people executed in Texas were white.
