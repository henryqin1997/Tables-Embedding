No. 11/498,415 entitled \u201cBroadcasting Venue Data to a Wireless Hand Held Device,\u201d filed on Aug. 2, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,376,388 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/708,776 entitled \u201cProviding Multiple Perspectives for a Venue Activity Through an Electronic Hand Held Device,\u201d which was filed on Nov. 8, 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,149,549 and which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/243,561, which was filed on Oct. 26, 2000. This application therefore traces its priority date to the Oct. 26, 2000 filing date of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/243,561., 113329=Currently, CDMA can support data at speeds up to 14.4 Kbps. Wireless network 152 may also be configured with a form of CDMA technology known as wideband CDMA (W-CDMA). Wideband CDMA may be also referred to as CDMA 2000 in North America. W-CDMA can be utilized to increase transfer rates utilizing multiple 1.25 MHz cellular channels. Current restrictions of CDMA and W-CDMA are not meant to limit the range or implementation of the present invention, but are described herein for illustrative purposes only. It is anticipated that CDMA and W-CDMA will be continually developed and that such new developments can be implemented in accordance with the present invention., 110274=Wireless network 152 may also be configured utilizing teachings/aspects of GSM network 158. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) and PCS (Personal Communications Systems) networks, both well known in the telecommunications arts, generally operate in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz, and 1900 MHz range. PCS initiates narrowband digital communications in the 900 MHz range for paging, and broadband digital communications in the 1900 MHz band for cellular telephone service. In the United States, PCS 1900 is generally equivalent to GSM 1900. GSM operates in the 900 MHz, 1800-1900 MHz frequency bands, while GSM 1800 is widely utilized throughout Europe and many other parts of the world., 109560=The Bluetooth standard permits up to 100 mw of power, which can increase the range to 100 M. In addition, Bluetooth can support several data channels. Utilizing short data packets and frequency hopping of up to 1600 hops per second, Bluetooth is a wireless technology that can be utilized to enable the implementation of the methods and systems described herein. Current restrictions of Bluetooth are not meant to limit the range or implementation of the present invention, but are described herein for illustrative purposes only. It is anticipated Bluetooth will be continually developed, and that such new developments can be implemented in accordance with the present invention., 111006=In the United States, GSM 1900 is generally equivalent to PCS 1900, thereby enabling the compatibility of these two types of networks. Current restrictions of GSM and PCS are not meant to limit the range or implementation of the present invention, but are described herein for illustrative purposes only. It is anticipated that GSM and PCS will be continually developed, and that aspects of such new developments can be implemented in accordance with the present invention.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The embodiments and examples set forth herein are presented in order to best explain the present invention and its practical application and to thereby enable those skilled in the art to make and utilize the invention. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the foregoing description and examples have been presented for the purpose of illustration and example only. The description as set forth is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching without departing from the spirit and scope of the following claims. When image-processing is complete, the pan/zoomed images can be displayed within a display screen or display area of the hand held device, as illustrated thereafter at block 796. The process then terminates, as depicted at block 798. If the user does not request pan/zoom, as indicated at block 790, the process may then terminate, as described at block 791. Image-processing may occur at the server or servers if the hand held device is not capable of directly processing the video data and video images thereof due to low memory or slow CPU allocation. Likewise, some image-processing may take place within the hand held device, while video image-processing requiring faster processing capabilities and increased memory may take place additionally at the server or servers to assist in the",
