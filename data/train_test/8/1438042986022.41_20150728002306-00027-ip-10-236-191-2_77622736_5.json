Other editions do not support these capabilities. For UC on UCS B-series, Cisco UCS 6100 does not currently support Layer 3 to Layer 2 COS markings. Additionally, the UC applications and operating systems cannot set the Layer 2 COS markings. Use of Cisco Nexus\u00ae 1000V is therefore strongly recommended as this is the only way to manage traffic congestion through the current UCS 6100. Please recall that traffic congestion risk will vary and is dependent on many factors such as UC vs. non-UC virtual machine count and their traffic characteristics across all blades, chassis and fabric extenders connected to the same UCS 6100. For UC on UCS C-series, Cisco Nexus\u00ae 1000V is recommended but not mandatory as there is no intermediate UCS 6100 to design around.",
