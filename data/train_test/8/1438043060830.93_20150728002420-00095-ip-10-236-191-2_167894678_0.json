And the 25 guys as have today suiting up are unlikely to accomplish this.Hope for the future comes from Zimmerman and Werth returning to form, LaRoche returning from injury, Strasburg, Peacock, Malone. Incremental improvements from Desmond, Espinosa and Ramos. Harper's performance demanding a 2012 call up. Rizzo finding a legit CF. But you can't count on this. That's what Redskin fans have learned., 45800=NatinBeantown said\u2026 DC Wonk, this is the internet. Reasoned evaluation has no place here. Seriously, I have no idea how people are so surprised by this. This team had every indication in the spring that they would be a 75-80 win team, improved over last year, but not ready to contend. That's exactly who they are.Both your points are spot on Beanie.Look \u2014 to all \u2014 we had a streak of losing 10 of 12 games in May under Riggs, too. Many here were pulling their hair out then, too.That's what happens to .500 teams. Streaks, in both directions, happen., 17913=Steve M. said\u2026 Going back, I am looking at games since Davey took over on June 27 and his 25 games and 25 games back for comparison as far as steals, and I don't even have to look at anybody except Ian Desmond. Are you saying that you can look at a single player, and deduce Davey's strategy for the whole team based on that?Really?Looking at only Ian is cherry picking. Bernadina's steals have gone up, despite getting on base less. That's supposed to be irrelevant? (And NatsLady makes a good point, too, regarding Ian's place in the batting order), 43228=C'mon guys, really?Does everyone forget that this is a 75-78 win team. Just because some people have been unrealistic about this and for some reason thought we would make a wild card run doesn't mean it's true.We all knew in March we would be lucky to hit .500. The ESPN computer model put us in last place in the NL East. Most analysts thought we would end up 4th ahead of the Mets and maybe we could push for 3rd if the Marlins stumbled. So far neither of these things happened and we are right where we were expected to land. We happen to play in the toughest division in baseball, sucks, but true.We knew DJ wasn't going to turn this into a contender this year. Just take a deep breath and enjoy the roller coaster ride. It's half the fun.-Don, 69962=Please forgive me for veering off topic so early in the thread. I'll just toss this in for y'all to consider.A few folks have commented on how the team isn't running since Johnson took over. I was surprised when I looked up the following (from baseball-reference; does not include Weds night's game). For each month, I present the Nats' steals and caughts:April 19-8 (27 attempts in 26 games)May 26-7 (33 attempts in 28 games)June 22-4 (26 attempts in 27 games)July 17-4 (21 attempts in 21 games)I can't recall what date Johnson took over, but that page listed him as having managed 24 games. So July roughly coincides with his tenure.As I said, I was surprised. I thought that the running game had gone away, or at least way down. Maybe it's just a sense that all one-run strategies, in general, are going away. But just eyeballing sac bunts, I wouldn't say those have gone down either. I don't know what's going on here, but I think it may rhyme with \"schmonfirmation bias.\", 12542=A DC Wonk said\u2026 Steve M. said\u2026Going back, I am looking at games since Davey took over on June 27 and his 25 games and 25 games back for comparison as far as steals, and I don't even have to look at anybody except Ian Desmond.

Bernadina's steals have gone up, despite getting on base less. That's supposed to be irrelevant? (And NatsLady makes a good point, too, regarding Ian's place in the batting order) July 28, 2011 11:03 AM Wonk, who's cherrypicking? I looked at the last 4 days and Desmond over the whole season as I stated. Desmond was the team's top base stealer and he has made no attempts under Davey. Those were the only observations that bothered me. I wasn't the one making other comments but proved those were right in the last 4 games. There have been NO steal attempts the last 3 games. Look, I embraced smart ball/small ball as that worked for this team. Bo Porter has looked like a genius at times at 3rd base. Not sure why he sent Zim in the 9th last night but it worked.Smart and aggressive is what is needed and smart and conservative with the bullpen. Why did Davey leave Livan in for the 5th after almost pulling him in the 4th last night?, 9027=Sec3, hmmm, whats interesting is my Desmond point at 10:39 ends up being exactly what Davey Johnson commented on before the game for moving Desmond up to the 7th spot.\"There was a lot of things,\" Johnson said when asked what went into the decision to alter the bottom of his lineup. \"Number one, I get more speed in front of (Ramos). I can run Desmond more often. (Ramos) has been struggling, Ramos, and but the main thing is that I've got some speed in front of him., 79132=Jul 28, 2011, 4:51 AM EDT, 14705=NatsLady, if there are 2 outs when Desmond gets on and is in the 8 hole that is a great point but Desmond was the top base stealer the first half and he has been on base with 1 out and no outs and maybe you steal ahead of a sacrifice. Just saying, it is still a pattern which is why his steals curtailed in June under Riggleman also when he got moved back in the order. I think the bigger observation I have seen the last 4 games is more conservative baseball and a lousy bullpen and faltering starting pitching for a few of the games.I don't see Livo being brought back next year and Rizzo has to be steaming mad as all of the guys he wanted to trade except Marquis have been near awful. Coffey is now worth zero. I said it before that Coffey is basically a ROOGY x 2. Use him against 2 batters and he is done. They burned him out early. He is toast and it is a shame. He was one of the positive surprises for 2 1/2 months. Rizzo is looking worse as the season progresses as almost all of his pickups are just falling apart at this point. LaRoche, Werth, Gorzelanny, Ankiel, Stairs, Henry Rodriguez, Corey Brown, and my favorite Cutter Dykstra. Nix has been his one crowning achievement as being better than advertised which isn't saying much, and to be fair Hairston and Cora are as expected.My biggest issue as I stated over a week ago is the mis-use of the bullpen. I got heat for saying that but I still stand by that as you saw with Coffey yesterday. Storen's hiccup happens as we have seen when he goes in for non-save situations., 78380=Perhaps it was inevitable this rotation would hit a bump in the road at some point. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about the 1971 Orioles staff or the current Phillies unit. This is a rotation that gets by on guile and guts more than physical prowess, and that can only take you so far., 63308=Always critic CBinDC writes:If anybody really expected Davy Johnson to carry this team to greater heights I would think that has been dashed.Right. Because one can certainly evaluate a manager after 24 games (and ignore his other 2000 games).The team hitting is getting worse\u2026Nats hitting during June: .231Nats hitting during July: .243Biased critics should at least their facts straight.Sunderland \u2014 \"confirmation bias\" is the tendency of people to find facts that tend to confirm what they already think. But the above is not such an example \u2014 as it is just \"made up facts.\"I'd previously pointed out that Sac Bunts had not gone done.Thanks for also pointing out that Stolen bases had not gone done.As I've said before, and I'll say again: a team is never as good as it appears during a winning streak, and never as bad as it seems during a losing streak. Since we're in a losing streak it just seems \"everything\" is crummy. But it's not. It's just as MZ says: the pitching is not holding up \u2014 most everything else is the same \u2014 but we were in enough one-run games such that if the pitching doesn't hold up, those wins turn to losses., 47204=CBinDC said\u2026 Ok look I am not always the critic it just seems that way, but can you say a team that did not get a hit over 12 innings spread over 2 games is hitting better ?Why is that _that_ specific two game sample more telling than using a whole month? Two weeks ago they had 20 hits in two games against Atlanta. Why not use that sample? (Because two weeks ago is ancient history, no doubt).Let me turn the question back at you: when a team is hitting .243 in July and .231 in June, how can you possibly say they aren't hitting better?As a team, their hitting WAR is June already higher than June, and they still have a couple games left to play. Their pitching WAR is lower. So I can't understand how one can say that hitting is down. It's the pitching that's down., 53333=Gonat said\u2026 Scooter, the running game has gone away. Now you have Zim stealing and Werth and Nix and your guys that make it happen like Desmond and Bernadina and Espi are the ones who aren't getting the successful steals.C'mon guys \u2014 can we look things up before we make assertions like that.I went and looked up one guy that you mention who I think might be the best stealer on the team \u2014 Roger Bernadina.Stolen bases in June (when he was hitting .278): 4Stolen bases in July (when he's hitting .220): 5=======OK, I looked up another one (also arguably the best base stealer):EspinosaJune (27 games) 5July (22 games) 3==================So \u2014 sorry \u2014 I just don't see a big difference.I'll say again: it all just _looks_ bad because we're losing. I haven't seen any evidence presented here that the \"running game is going away\".And we're losing because of faltering pitching. Sometimes it really is as simple as that., 27648=DC Wonk, being fair, Gonat did not give a timeline. He is exactly right for the last 4 games and on the players mentioned.Going back, I am looking at games since Davey took over on June 27 and his 25 games and 25 games back for comparison as far as steals, and I don't even have to look at anybody except Ian Desmond. He has NO steal attempts while Davey has taken over and he stole 4 in the 25 games before Davey took over.In the last 4 games which is this losing streak, Bernadina hasn't made any steal attempts.Yes, in the very short term, Davey seemed to get nervous after Nix was caught stealing (botched hit and run maybe). Numbers are skewed since Zim and Werth are the ONLY players in the last 4 games to attempt steals. That is 4 losses and 2 steals.Not sure if there is a pattern but Desmond definitely isn't running with Davey.}",
