The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modification as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto and their equivalents. As a result of each of these improvements, data throughput is increased, thereby increasing the speed at which data are transported and processed. The present invention therefore provides a method and apparatus that can increase data throughput, thereby increasing the speed at which data are transported and processed. The present invention also provides a method and apparatus that can reduce the load on processing resources. Furthermore, the present invention provides a method and apparatus that can be used in a data warehouse system. In one embodiment, a single data transport pipeline can be used to populate both the dimension table and a fact table during a session run. Accordingly, in this embodiment, it is only necessary to",
