This application is also a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/788,786, filed Jan. 23, 1997 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,235,043), which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/188,224, filed Jan. 26, 1994 (now abandoned)., 51067=The magnitude of pressure will vary depending upon the wall thickness and other physical characteristics of the elastomer material used. The pressure must be less than the burst strength of the tube material. Typically, air pressure in the range of 5 to 1000 psi can be used., 41677=The shape of the structure 56, when expanded in bone, is selected by the physician, taking into account the morphology and geometry of the site to be treated. The shape of the cancellous bone to be compressed, and the local structures that could be harmed if bone were moved inappropriately, are generally understood by medical professionals using textbooks of human skeletal anatomy along with their knowledge of the site and its disease or injury, and also taking into account the teachings of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/788,786, filed Jan. 23, 1997, and entitled \u201cImproved Inflatable Device for Use in Surgical Protocol Relating to Fixation of Bone,\u201d which is incorporated herein by reference. The physician is also able to select the desired expanded shape inside bone based upon prior analysis of the morphology of the targeted bone using, for example, plain film x-ray, fluoroscopic x-ray, or MRI or CT scanning. The expanded shape inside bone is selected to optimize the formation of a cavity that, when filled with a selected material, provides support across the region of the bone being treated. The selected expanded shape is made by evaluation of the predicted deformation that will occur with increased volume due to the shape and physiology of the targeted bone region.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The features of the invention are set forth in the following claims. The label 106 preferably also instructs the physician as to the use of the expandable structure 56 (or 80 or 130) for compacting cancellous bone in the manners previously described. For example, the label 106 instructs the physician to expand the structure inside bone to compact cancellous bone and form a cavity. The label 106 can also instruct the physician to fill the cavity with a material, e.g., bone cement, allograft material, synthetic bone substitute, a medication, or a flowable material that sets to a hardened condition. The sterile kit 100 also carries a label or insert 106, which includes the statement \u201cFor Single Patient Use Only\u201d (or comparable language) to affirmatively caution against reuse of the contents of the kit 100. The label 106 also preferably affirmatively instructs against resterilization of the tool 48. The label 106 also preferably instructs the physician or user to dispose of the tool 48 and the entire contents of the kit 100 upon use in accordance with applicable biological waste procedures. The presence of the probe 102 packaged in the kit 100 verifies to the physician or user that tool 48 is sterile and has not been subjected to prior use. The physician or user is thereby assured that the expandable structure 56 meets established performance and sterility specifications, and will have the desired",
