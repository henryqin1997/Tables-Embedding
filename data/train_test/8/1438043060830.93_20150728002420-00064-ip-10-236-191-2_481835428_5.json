INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY [0169] This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No.2000-255515 filed on Aug. 25, 2000, entire content of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. [0168] As described above, according to the present invention, by having a base station apparatus transmit a dedicated pilot signal using one of the codes used for data transmission, a communication terminal apparatus can perform a path search using a dedicated pilot signal, and estimate channel fluctuation, making it possible to maintain data-part reception quality even when phase changes are sudden when using HDR. [0167] Also, in the above embodiments, a case has been described in which 16-code multiplexing is used for HDR data, but the present invention is not limited to this. Furthermore, in the above embodiments, a case has been described in which a dedicated pilot signal is transmitted using one of the codes used for data transmission, but the present invention is not limited to this, and a dedicated pilot signal may be transmitted using a plurality of codes.
