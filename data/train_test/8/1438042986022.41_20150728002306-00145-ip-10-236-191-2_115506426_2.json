Links to the documents in the syllabus below will work as soon as each set of notes is updated - usually this will be a day or so before the relevant lecture. In the syllabus I have also noted special lectures (in green) that will take place on campus this semester and that are at least loosely connected to this course. Attendance at these lectures is not required, but the presentations should be of interest to anyone seriously interested in conservation biology. Weekly homework assignments will be posted here on Wednesdays, via links to the syllabus (see Homework column, below). Responses will be due by midnight the following Friday (2 days later) and should be submitted via email to the TA (see above for email address). The symbol ** in the \"Reading\" column means that there is important supplemental reading from the primary literature that we will discuss in class. Reading these papers is important as there will be graded writing assignments, conducted in class, for each one. I will randomly pick people in class to answer questions about them. Links to the relevant papers can be accessed by clicking on the **. These links might not work if you are not using a computer that connects to the UConn network. It is possible to connect your home",
