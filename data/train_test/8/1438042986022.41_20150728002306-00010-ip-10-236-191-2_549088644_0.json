Gemologist will be ridden in the Wood Memorial by regular pilot Javier Castellano., 37044=The Wood Memorial will be just the second race of the year for Gemologist, a son of Tiznow who enters with a four-for-four mark. Unlike most Pletcher trainees, the WinStar Farm-owned colt raced exclusively in Kentucky as a juvenile, breaking his maiden at Turfway Park and then winning twice during the Churchill Downs Fall meet. The latter of those two wins came in the Grade 2 Kentucky Jockey Club, a race won by WinStar's Super Saver in 2009 en route to Kentucky Derby glory., 39566=Tiger Walk, third in the Withers and fourth in the Gotham, will need to quicken in order to turn the tables on Alpha and My Adonis, who have finished ahead of him this term. Street Life, a son of Kentucky Derby winner Street Sense, enters off an overnight stakes win in the March 17 Broad Brush on the inner dirt, while Michael Matz will saddle Teeth of the Dog, a last-out maiden winner at Gulfstream over nine furlongs., 10738=May 7, 4-7PM ET, 26192=If you're visiting Churchill Downs, please visit the Churchill Downs Store, open during the spring, September, and fall race meets from gate opening time to 30 minutes after the last race.
