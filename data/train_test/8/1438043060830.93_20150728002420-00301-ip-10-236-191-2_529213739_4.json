Those that were actively responsible are Jakob Strenitz, Leopold L\u00f6wy, Josef La\u017eansky, Otto Fantl, Siegmund Meller and - since 1931 - Egon Popper. In 1932, the organization of aid to the poor was reorganized and changed to a Welfare Centre. The members of this are: the members of the parish council, all humanitarian societies in Reichenberg, the rabbi, and the chairman of the parish board. It is gratifying that women also participate in this Welfare Centre - where Otto Fantl is chairman and Fritz L\u00f6wy is treasurer. The organization is based on the principles of the most modern welfare aims. The main target is to provide the poorest in Reichenberg with sufficient cash, loans, coal and foodstuff. Activities also include summer vacations for children., 60266=The first Chevra Seude was arranged at the beginning of the 1870s, although on a small scale. This traditional charitable meal was held on two further occasions more than 50 years later: on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, Chevra Kadisha arranged a celebration jointly with the Israelite Women's Association, which also had its 60th anniversary. These jubilee festivities were held on 29 and 30 May 1926. On the Saturday evening there was a ceremonial service with a sermon, on Sunday morning a visit to the cemetery with a commemorative speech, and in the evening a ceremonial meeting with a lecture by the rabbi about the history of Chevra Kadisha in Reichenberg. The festivities were concluded with a dinner in the large hall of the Volksgarten, where 300 ladies and gentlemen participated together with many honorable guests from the neighboring communities., 30011=On 3 November 1929, the 23-year old holder of the general power of attorney, Erwin L\u00f6wy, was killed by shots to the head during a Sunday afternoon walk in the forest. He was buried in Vienna., 61820=There are two religious societies: The Temple Choir Association and the \u0093Achdus Jisroel\u0094. The task of the choir is to look after the liturgical songs. It was formed in connection with the building of the first temple and at that time had 45 members led by Dr. Wilhelm Hersch. Men and women have participated over decades in the weekly rehearsals voluntary, selflessly and eagerly. The leaders of the temple choir have been: Emil Deutsch, Dr Wilhelm Schn\u00fcrmacher, and Josef Fleischer. The new organization of the temple choir was brought before the community administration many times. Mainly on the initiative of Karl Willner, the temple choir was established in 1901 as an independent society with statutes confirmed by the authorities. The first leader was Karl Willner, followed by Ernst Soyka and then, for a quarter of a century, Dr. Alfred Soudek. Siegmund Meller was member honoris causa. For decades, Julius Fischer was the choir leader. For his merits, he was elected member honoris causa. After a long break, during which the choir leaders were Richard Fuchs, Eduard Proksch, Hugo Wagner and Otto Feix, Julius Fischer returned to leading the choir., 30615=The following day, the Reichenberg News wrote in a leading article: \u0093The liberals failed their first test. A town such as Reichenberg is evidently sufficiently reactionary to refuse - without any motive - entrance into the Community Association of the first two Israelites to seek it. There must be some inexplicable urge for na\u00efve prejudice that leads to such a decision in the second half of the 19th century, especially when such an application comes so late in time[58]. The reason is simply that the applicants are Jews.\u0094 Joachim Deutsch renewed his application and shortly afterwards was accorded his civil right. Up to 1874, a further eight Jews received the same civil rights as the gentile citizens of the town., 65681=In 1909, the Reichenberg Lodge of Brotherhood \u0093Hort\u0094 was founded. The first chairman was Salomon Gl\u00fcckauf. Today it is led by Engineer Otto Eisenschiml. In 1920, the lodge \u0093Societ\u00e9\u0094 opened its doors. Its first chairman was Dr. Rudolf K\u00f6nigstein, and since 1930 its chairman has been Fritz L\u00f6wy. The central lodge is in Prague. Both \u0093Hort\u0094 and \u0093Societ\u00e9\u0094 are committed to the provision of charitable assistance. In all three lodges, there are sister societies that support and supplement the work of the lodge brothers., 88231=27 April 1783: Emperor Joseph confirmed the privileges., 57956=Teachers of religion and cantors: Hugo L\u00f6wenthal (1912-1914) and Samuel Ungermann (1920-1923)., 33047=The anti-Semitic daily newspaper in Reichenberg \u0093The Deutsche Volkszeitung\u0094, which appeared from autumn 1885 to November 1919 (i.e. for 34 years) was generally considered to be the mouthpiece of the town council. Even in the early 1890s, exaggerated nationalist sentiments were evident. The fact was that, at that time, those within the Jewish community who had been members of the town council and of the regional school council were not allowed to become members of the Community Trade Council, and Jews were also driven out of other societies, 80954=In 1856, Henrich Beck leased a dairy farm in Wiese (Lu\u010dnice) in Friedland. At the beginning of 1860, the Jewish physician Dr. Straschnov took up residence in Friedland., 3541=The \u0093Reichenberger Zeitung\u0094 (Reichenberg News) reported in a small news item: \u0093In the newly established Jewish prayer house, a service was held for the first time in connection with the coming Jewish New Year.\u0094 The financing of the prayer house was achieved by a loan of 2,760 florins. This was re-paid in the form of 276 debenture bonds each of 10 florins and paid back by yearly draw[50]. As the community grew until it included almost 90 families, this prayer house gradually became too small. On top of that \u0096 and especially on High Holy Days - the temperature inside was very high because of the cloth press located below on the ground floor. So the prayer house was relocated to the house of Eduard Elger, at no. 10 Friedl\u00e4nderstrasse, 241/1. From 1 October 1870, two floors were leased initially for 10 years at an annual rent of 750 florins; the premises were adapted at a cost of more than 4,000 Austrian florins. The community's wealth was not sufficient to cover such an expense, so money had to be borrowed. In order to cover these loans, all the donations received by the community were used. In this prayer house, there was space for 104 men in the lower part and for 104 women in the gallery. The first musical instrument used was a rented harmonium. This was followed by an organ bought by Felgenhauer Scharf, which was later sold, together with a Torah scroll, to M\u00fcnchengr\u00e4tz (Mnichovo Hradi\u0161t\u011b ) for 700 florins. Services were held in this prayer house for almost two decades., 25865=In 1931, the tax legislation and especially the possibilities of appeal were modernized as per current legislation. A maximum of 44 tax classes were foreseen, and the highest yearly tax is not to exceed 5,000 crowns[56]. As well as the increase in the amount, a substantial part of the new statute covers the introduction of another appeal process, namely a special appeals commission. The appeal is no longer handled by the board. The appeals commission consists of 11 members, among whom five are selected by the board for the duration of the period for which the board has been elected. No more than three of the 11 may be members of the board, and members of the tax commission may not also be members of the appeals commission. Five are to be members of the community board for the duration of the election period and six are community members elected during the general election The appellant can be present during the examination of his appeal, and he may also address the commission during the examination. He may also be represented by another tax payer living in Reichenberg., 50504=Community chairmen and vice-chairmen in chronological order were: Leopold L\u00f6wy, Heinrich Langstein, Dr. Wiliam Hersch, Dr, Ignatz Ullmann, Dr. Wilhelm Schn\u00fcrmacher, Ernst Weiseles, Dr. Emil Peres, Alois Soudek, Ernst Soyka, Dr. Rudolf Kraus and - since 1932 - Dr. Leopold Bass., 53119=Treasurers: Wilhelm Winterberg, Daniel J. Pick, Josef Pollak, Ludwig Edelstein, Edmund Deutsch, Emanuel Spitz, Josef Fleischer, and - since 1925 - Hugo Hersch., 88727=In 1808, the lessor of the \u0093Superior Distillery\u0094 is named as Moises Rosenstein; in 1812 the protected Jewess Anna Schiller lived in Liebenau without any obstacles being placed in her way. In 1838, there was an unexpected conclusion concerning the right of settlement which is referred to in \u00a738 of the old Liebenau chronicle: \u0093Memorabilia\u0094. Until then, the road toll had been leased to a gentile. In the year mentioned, however, the toll was auctioned by the magistrate of M\u00fcnchengratz to a Jew, David Kompert. He immediately made an agreement with a citizen and weaver from Liebenau, Antonin Jeranek, that he could live in his house and collect the toll. However, the Liebenau magistrate immediately demanded that the contract be abolished, because Jews are not allowed to live in Liebenau. Kompert complained to the regional administration. Soon afterwards a public meeting was held in connection with elections and, among other documents, the town privileges were read out. When the citizens heard that Jews were not tolerated in the town, they complained about the actions of Jeranek., 42775=The few weddings that occurred were mostly carried out by the regional rabbi. Services were occasionally held by Jacob Haller from Karolinenthal (Karl\u00edn), Adolf Ehrenteil from Ho\u0159ice, Dr. Joel M\u00fcller from B\u00f6hmische Leipa (\u010cesk\u00e1 L\u00edpa) and Eisner from Beubidschof (Nov\u00fd Byd\u017eov). As far as we know, prior to the formation of the Jewish community, weddings were officiated by Abraham Gr\u00fcnfeld, the regional rabbi in Ji\u010d\u00edn, Markus Goldman and Jacob Zeckendorf from Liten (Lite\u0148). The first rabbi of Reichenberg was Salomon Pollak, who was born in Leipnik (Lipn\u00edk nad Be\u010dvou) in 1811. He was director of the Jewish \u2018model school\u2019[61] in Wag-Ujhely. In 1869 he was called to Reichenberg as teacher, took the rabbinate examination and received approval from Regional Rabbi Haller. After this, he was employed as rabbi by the community and as such confirmed by the state administration. He served the community until his retirement in 1889, and died on 5 June 1895 at the age of 84., 88032=30 January 1747: Victoria Freiin von Landau and Head of the Convent confirmed the above., 64242=The lodges have played a large part in boosting interest in Jewishness. They promote human and Jewish ideals. The oldest lodge in Reichenberg - the \u0093Philantropia\u0094 - is a branch of the worldwide Bnai Brith organization and was founded on 12 September 1894. As use of the name \u0093lodge\u0094 was forbidden in \u2018old\u2019 Austria, the \u0093Philantropia\u0094 called itself the \u0093Israelite Humanitarian Society\u0094. Its first president was Imperial Councilor Alfred Deutsch. In 1932, Leo Levitus took over. Engineer Rudolf Teltscher held the post of vice-president. This organization also worked for the benefit of the general public. It was thanks to Philantropia that the Girls School was founded. This was later changed to a High School for Girls and then to the Girls Reform-Technical School[64]. On the initiative of the lodge and of Rabbi E Hoffmann, a home for the feeble-minded was founded in Hloub\u011bt\u00edn-by-Prague. Before the War, Philantropia arranged public lectures to which the wider community was also invited. As well as Rabbi E. Hofmann, lectures were given by Professors Herman Cohen, Ludwig Geiger, Moritz Lazarus, Franz Oppenheimer and the writers Gustav Karpeles, Adolf Kohut and Hugo Salus. In this way Philantrophia gave the public the opportunity to listen to eminent Jewish authorities. These lectures were very beneficial to the spiritual life of the community., 5194=The temple was built in the style of the early Renaissance and crowned with a cupola, and is therefore an adornment to the center of the city. The first initiative for this building was already provided in 1875 in a memorandum written by Wilhelm Winterberg. He was also the first person to contribute a significant sum to the building fund. It took a long time to turn this initiative into active work. As far back as 1833, the general assembly had elected a committee of 15 members under the leadership of Josef La\u017eansky to resolve all the problems and to prepare the work. The committee soon sketched out a plan of action that would gather the necessary funds through subscriptions, the sale of temple seats and a larger loan. The committee was able to hand over to the board 43,928 florins \u0096 of which they had collected 38,873 florins. It is remarkable that one third of the total collection was from citizens of other religions. Their trust in the community was also shown when many of them bought bonds issued later., 45263=The board of the community at first comprised five and then seven members. In 1896 it was increased to 12 members. Until that year, the plenary meeting was the most significant event. This meeting was responsible for the election of the rabbi, cantor, teacher, and of the board. This meeting was also where all the community business was discussed. Every member of the community had the right to speak at the plenary meeting. Even though the discussions were sometimes heated, this kept the interest alive for the community. In 1896, a 14-member community board was established together with a supporting board \u0096 also of 14 intermediate members - as a consultative and deciding body. This supportive body consists of members of the smaller executive board and a further 14 representatives. The religious board today consists of Eduard Soyka, Josef La\u017eansky and Josef Pollak. The latter has been on the community board for more than 35 years., 57443=Cantors: Joachim Pesseles, from 1861 until his death on 28 October 1887 at the age of 49; Heinrich Goldstein (previously teacher in Sch\u00fcttehofen (Su\u0161ice) and Tapolza) from 1889 until 1920. (He died on 19 October 1926 at the age of 80); Adolf Kesteberg (previously in R\u00f3zsahegy and at the Pinkas synagogue in Prague) served in Reichenberg from 1889 for a full 40 years. He died on 12 February 1930 at the age of 78; Leo Wartelski, who was also the teacher of religion from 1923., 72768=This town was made famous by Wallenstein, who founded the dukedom of Friedland. Jews lived in Friedland much earlier than they did in Reichenberg, that is to say from the time of the Bibersteins. In 1505, the Jew Mayer was accused in Friedland of buying stolen goods. In 1535, in Magdeburg, Merten Taupmann from Zwickau accused the Jew Kolmann from Friedland regarding two transports of herrings from Frankfurt an der Oder to Leitmeritz (Litom\u011b\u0159ice). Kolmann had to pay seven shillings for each transport but lied that he did not have to pay. Based on the testimony of two witnesses \u0096 one from Langenau and the other from Alt-Leipa (Star\u00e1 L\u00edpa) - he was sentenced in 1536 to pay 20 scores for the transports, 20 scores in damages and to pay the costs of the trial. (This is from the Magdeburg court records in the archives of the G\u00f6rlitz town council.) In the book of the city records of Friedland, it is written on page 293: \u0093After that, Isaac Juda Goldscheider, thanks to the merciful favor and consent of Squire Christof von Redern, bought the house of old Hans Schindler, together with some land, in the upper town. But he left it un-built and did not pay taxes and inheritance taxes, which have recently been paid to the mayor and judge by the honorable Mr. Friedericus Dallus. As more complaints are to be expected from Prague on 26 January at the latest, the house and plot is duly transferred by the above-mentioned secretary, signed by the Mr. David Heynes, the Steward in Reichenberg, to Mr. Georg Knobloch. It is also noted that on 24 March 1624 the same house was sold to the honorable Kaspar Fuchs from Friedland for 110 scores.\u0094 From this it is obvious that, as early as the beginning of the 17th century, a Jew owned a house in Friedland, even if only for a short time., 16056=However, even with the building of the temple, the community's work and troubles were not finished. The community council had to fight several feuds with the temple's neighbor, but in the end they found an amicable solution. These feuds were about alterations to the buildings on both sides. An exchange of plots of land was negotiated with the town community for several years until a contract of exchange was signed in 1894. Owing to regulations, 150 square fathoms of the Lerchenfeldstrasse were needed from the temple plot. In exchange, the town gave the community a plot of 27.5 square fathoms and paid 12 florins per square fathom. However, a few years earlier the Jewish community had paid the town double this price, and so it offered to sell for 1,400 florins. For this reason, the community contributed to the building of the bridge which goes over Turnerstrasse to Lerchenfelsdstrasse. Both the temple and the bridge are still today nicknamed \u2018The Jewish Bridge\u2019, even though the Jewish contribution was very small, at just 500 florins., 67771=The Jewish renaissance movement in Reichenberg is also involved in physical fitness. In 1922, the \u0093J\u00fcdische Sport und Turn Verein\u0094 (The Jewish Sports and Gymnastic Association) known as the \u0093Maccabi\u0094 was founded. Its first chairman was Dr. Franz Kraus, and since 1930 it has been under the leadership of Robert Wassermann. Each year, the \u0093Maccabi\u0094 presents to the public a well-arranged gymnastic show. Upon its 10th anniversary, the association issued a commemorative publication., 85717=For 200 years, we have no records about Jews in Gabel. One single name which tells us nothing comes to us indirectly via the Reichenberg protocol on the weight of wool. For half-a-century, from 1815 to 1865, the Jewish records of Gabel were held in the Reichenberg deanery. In that period 14 births are noted. These records cannot be used as an historical source. In the middle of the 1830s, the first Jewish doctor, Dr. Wolfgang Hamburger, settled in Gabel. He was also the official government doctor. Born in Jungbunzlau, he was a man of many parts and a powerful personality who wrote several medical, aesthetic and political works. He also wrote the book: \u0093Medizin, Topographie und Geschichte der gr\u00e4fl. Herrschaft L\u00e4mberg und der benachbarten Stadt Gabel\u0094 (Medicine, topography and history of the manor of L\u00e4mberg and the neighboring town of Gabel).#&148;, 14813=According to the Reichenberg News, the speaker explained clearly the purpose of the temple. In the report issued in 1891 concerning the building of the temple, it is written: \u0093The event was brought to its culmination by this wise and well-formulated speech\u0094. The festivities concluded with a motet by Haydn, the Prayer for the Emperor, an anthem heard standing and with uncovered head, and with songs by the choir under the leadership of Julius Fischer. The liturgical part was led by Regional Rabbi Adolf Kestenberg. The closing evening prayer was sung solo by Ignatz Hersch. The festivity remained an unforgettable event for all the participants. At the following meeting of the Board, it was noted that there was total satisfaction with the festivity at all levels of society and throughout the community. The previously mentioned K.V.Liebitzky, as well as Josef Pollak and Josef La\u017eansky, had the satisfaction of seeing the completion of the work to which they had dedicated their lives, while K.V L\u00f6wy, who gave his best years to the project, was no longer among the living. Later, the 25th and 40th anniversaries of the temple were celebrated at a New Year service with sermon and song., 67266=In 1927, a local chapter of the \u0093Land Organisation of Jewish Women\u0094 (\u0093WIZO\u0094) was founded. As a worldwide organization, its target is to promote Jewish cultural and social work and especially to assist with the development of Palestine mainly through homes for infant children, homes for young girls and educational institutions. The local group very quickly became an important part of the social and cultural life in the community. Eugenie Hofmann has been its chairwoman since its foundation., 58066=At the outset, there was a special religious school at house no. 169-II in Reichenberg. This was closed in 1877 and religious education was then carried out in public schools. The parents paid for the education, but the fee was reduced over time and, at the end, the education was free of charge. Until 1868, religion was taught by the private teacher Valentin Fischer, then by Adolf Hlawatsch - who also wrote a brochure \u0093Das Synagogenjahr\u0094 (The Synagogue Year). He was followed by J. L\u00f6witt and N. Steiner., 2493=The state administration had no objections to the formation of a Jewish community, but did not approve it in the light of imminent religious legislation. The state administration was further of the opinion that there should be a Jewish community only in Prague and not in the rest of the country. The guaranteed right to exercise religion did not include the establishment of a community. What was therefore possible in Reichenberg \u0096 from 1 February 1863 - was the foundation of a Jewish association based on association law. The members of the provisional committee were elected to the board, with J. Spitz elected as the first chairman. All that could be permitted was the use of a rented prayer house. The first of these was in a room in the house of Friedrich Knoll at no. 2 R\u00f6chlicherstrasse, 116/IV. It was ceremonially opened on 4 September 1861, which is to say on the evening before the Jewish New Year, and in the presence of invited leaders of the administration, the deacon P. Ignatz Frank and various local dignitaries., 68848=The association \u0093Bund j\u00fcdische Jugend\u0094 (Berit Hanoar)[68] founded in 1931 by Rabbi E. Hofmann has developed a great deal in a short peroid. The association helps boys and girls who are seeking knowledge on all kinds of Jewish issues. The first chairman was Walter Sch\u00fctz, 1506=The new period in the 7th decade of the previous century (ie 1860s) brought three rare gains for the Jews: freedom of movement, freedom to engage in trade, and legal equality. In line with these favorable auspices, some 30 Jewish families settled permanently in Reichenberg. In order to satisfy their religious need, they quickly decided to form a Jewish community and to ensure the two most important attributes: namely a prayer house and a cemetery. The preparations were put in the hands of a committee consisting of five co-religionists: Jacob Spitz, Seligmann Taussig, Siegmund Liebitzky, Josef Kraus and Jakob Strenitz. Jacob Spitz can be thought of as the founder of the community; he was the owner of the hot food stall mentioned earlier and a descendant of Eleasar Fleckeles, as well as the son of Isaac Spitz, the regional rabbi in Jungbunzlau. On 8 April 1862, the statutes of the community were presented to the authorities in order to receive approval., 75062=\u0093Application from the Jew Moyse Jacob of Friedland, 16 June 1627, 1430=The Religious Community (1861-1932), 17128=The summer months of 1899 were dedicated to the decorative painting of the temple. A scheme was presented by Ladevig from Vienna, but the offer by the Reichenberg company \u2018Meininger\u2019 was successful, as it was much closer to the original intentions of the architect, Professor K\u00f6nig from Vienna, and it was also recommended by him. On the basis of this offer, \u2018Meininger\u2019 was appointed to provide the decoration in real gold paint at a maximum cost of 4,250 florins. The work was supervised by Professor Johann Beer from the trade school. The interior decoration, with its fine colors, corresponds very well to the external architecture. On the evening before the New Year feast came the re-lighting of the eternal light and the re-consecration of the temple. In 1913, the Philantropia lodge (see later) donated a beautiful chandelier for the winter prayer hall. The board of the community takes great care and commits great expenditure to the preservation of the temple building, 41647=Until 1880, the Jewish community belonged to the regional rabbinate from Jungbunzlau. A financial contribution was made by the members of the community on the basis of the amount of tax paid to the count. The last regional rabbi was Dr. Isaac Elbogen. He was very active through his selfless cooperation in the establishment of the Reichenberg community. K.V.Liebitzky, together with a deputy as the representatives of the community, participated in the celebrations in Jungbunzlau when the rabbi retired. In 1890, a legislative ruling was made that the position of rabbi should be through a private employment contract. And so it is written in the first community statute at \u00a7 32: \u0093The position of the rabbi is to be determined at any time by a specific ad hoc contract\u0094. These new laws concerning the public status of the rabbi were also recognized within the community's Statute. In the long period when Reichenberg was without a rabbi, sermons were given in the prayer house by various preachers. So, in 1874, Dr. Ehrenteil from Ho\u0159ice delivered a sermon for which he received a payment of five ducats., 29795=Two other crimes are to be remembered. In 1894, Olga, the 6-year old daughter of the merchant Julius Fantl, was the victim of a sexual murder. Every section and level of society participated in her burial., 43948=There were 14 applicants for the vacant position. On the final shortlist were Dr. Siegmund Fessler, rabbi in Landsberg and later in Halle, and Dr. Adolf Posnanski. The latter was elected. He was born in Russia and until his 18th birthday he had studied the Talmud. Then he studied theology and philosophy in Paris and Breslau[62]. He received the rabbinate certificate at the Jewish seminar in Breslau. He is the author of the book of exegesis \u0093Siloh\u0094 and was rabbi in Reichenberg for the three years from 1889 to 1891. He transferred from Reichenberg to Pilsen, and later become a professor in Vienna. There he died at the age of 68 on 8 October 1920 and is buried in a grave of honor. After him, rabbi candidate Dr. Julius Reach was temporary rabbi for half a year. He later became rabbi in Raudnitz (Roudnice), Gaya (Kyjov) and Prague. After his departure, religion was taught in the middle schools by Dr. Moritz Gr\u00fcnwald from Jungbunzlau. No fewer than 25 applications were received for the vacant position as rabbi. Among these was one from Dr. Emil Hoffmann. He gave a test sermon, after which he was elected. He has been rabbi of Reichenberg from 1892 to this day., 81266=Deutsch-Gabel existed more than a thousand years ago and is one of the oldest- if not the oldest - towns in North Bohemia. The name probably derives from the name of a street which Emperor Karl IV already protected in the 14th century and which formed a \u2018fork\u2019[70]. It is therefore understandable that Jews settled at such an important trading center. However, there are no written reports of any Jewish presence in Deutsch-Gabel. Those records which survived the occupation by the Hussites in August 1420 were subsequently destroyed by the fire of May 1788., 27008=Until 1877, election was for a period of 25 years and later of 30 years. In 1931, it was reduced to 21 years. According to state law, the rabbi also had the right to election, as did the officers of the community and those members who had reached the age of 30 and had lived in the territory of the community for a minimum of two years. From 1895 to 1920, there were two groups from which members may be elected: the first consisted of state, country and public servants as well as doctors who had graduated from domestic universities and the rabbi; the second comprised highly taxed community members who paid 50% of the community income between them, as well as cantors and the teacher., 59239=The Jewish societies are thriving. The two oldest are \u0093Chevra Kadisha\u0094 and the \u0093Israelite Women's Association\u0094. Chevra Kadisha was founded in 1864, but statutes were first approved by the authorities in 1871. These were drawn up in cooperation with the religious board. The first chairman was Joachim Deutsch, after him came Moritz Rosenbaum; Josef La\u017eansky was then chairman for some three decades. Chevra Kadisha thanked him for his service by appointing him an honorary member. Otto Fantl has been chairman since 1915. In 1914, Chevra Kadisha celebrated its 50th anniversary by the foundation of a trust of 20,000 crowns taken from the society funds for the building of housing for the poor in Reichenberg. This project was subsequently cancelled but then more recently re-launched. The next and most important target of the society is the building of a planned old people's home. Members honoris causa[63] were Emanuel Deutsch and, today, Otto Epstein., 18218=The next important task for the community was the foundation of its own cemetery. The nearest cemetery was four miles away in Turnau, and the bodies of the deceased had to be transported there. The first choice was a plot of land at N. Top. 1643[53]; however, this was not permitted by the town administration owing to the planned expansion of the city. In March 1864, the community succeeded in buying another plot of 500 square fathoms from Anton Sch\u00f6pfer. This plot is on Ruppersdorferstrasse unter N.Top.1696. The town administration gave its permission two months later. The related costs were covered by donations and a loan. After alignment of the site along the street was regularized and 50 fathoms had been set aside for the grave digger, a chamber for washing the bodies, and a hut for the funeral wagon, there remained 400 square fathoms for burials. A further restriction came later when the ceremonial hall was built. The cemetery was taken into use on 20 April 1865. The first person to be buried was Joachim Goldberg, a former soldier, himself a gravedigger and a widower tradesman who died at the age of 77. For this inaugurating event, the cemetery was consecrated by Regional Rabbi Dr. Elbogen. In 1866, it was decided to buy some neighboring plots in order to increase the capacity of the cemetery. This was done in 1894 and the space allowed room for 1,181 graves. The rabbi consecrated the new plot on the occasion of the burial of Marie Fischl on 7 August 1896, who died at the age of 70. In 1894, it was decided unanimously to follow the proposal of Dr. Wilhelm Hersch to construct buildings for humanitarian purposes on the remaining land in case the town administration should ever require the cemetery to be closed down., 30299=On 10 February 1866, there was a vote for the election of K.V.Liebitsky and Joachim Deutsch to the Community Association[57]. Despite the strong recommendation of the state counsel Dr. Sieber, only ten of the 28 councilors present voted for these candidates., 22168=The Statute of the Jewish Community was printed four times: in 1877, 1896, 1924 and 1931. The Statute of 1877 determines that: \u0093Each new member shall pay an admission fee which is to be agreed upon with the board and which must be, as a minimum, half of a half year's payment, but in no case higher than three times half of the highest payment of anyone in the community\u0094. As for the division of costs, the community had an ideal state of affairs in the beginning. There were four tax classes, with contributions of 16, 12, 8 and 4 florins. Six years later, the contributions were increased to 24, 18, 12 and 6 florins. In the Statute of 10 years later, there are six classes of 45, 36, 30, 24, 15 and 6 guilders. Because of the increasing needs of the community, it was inevitable that the costs and the taxes had to be increased. In 1896, the contribution fee was based on the number of contributors in each class. Downwards were the following \u2155, \u20a2, \u2157 and \u2158 of the quotient (though the minimum payment was 1 florin), and upwards were the following 1, 1\u2155, 1\u20a2, 1\u2157, 1\u2158, 2, 2\u20a2, 2\u2158, 3\u2155, 3\u2157 , 4 and so on, up to a maximum of 150 florins[55]. In 1876, the general meeting resolved that any Israelite living in Reichenberg for more than half a year without becoming a member of the community should pay the tax. This was very important for all communities. However, the Imperial and Royal state administration forbade this practice, declaring it to be contrary to the freedom of religion and stating that Israelites should pay only if they participate in the life of the religious community. In their appeal to the Ministry of Religion and Culture, through the town administration, the Jewish community stated that this ruling is a threat to the very existence of the community and that the fee does not endanger freedom of religion. The appeal was successful and it was also used by other communities., 79701=Bassewi was allowed to collect each week from the dukedom a few hundred guilders in taxes. At the end of 1632, the Castle Steward informed him that \u0093his collection each Monday is beyond reason as he cannot possibly know how much each poor subject has in his pocket in this time of unrest.\u0094 Martin P\u00fclz, Bassewi's authorized agent in Friedland, refused one day to receive the money that was due to him and another trustee had to be found. In February 1633, the Regional Steward ordered that the payments to Bassewi should not be made from the Friedland taxes but that the full sum should be delivered to Ji\u010d\u00edn. The Bassewis lived in Friedland for a period of time and also had a wool shop. In 1841, the Pinkas brothers and David Gr\u00fcnwald lived in Friedland; they leased the ruler's distillery. They probably formed a joint operation. Pinkas was a familiant in Valirimitz (Valm\u011b\u0159ice), near Gross Rohosetz (Hrub\u00fd Rohosez) at Jungbunzlau (Mlad\u00e1 Boileslav). In the wedding register of the Jewish community in Turnau (Trutnov) an interesting remark is made about David Gr\u00fcnwald: \u0093Marriage consent to farm the land\u0094[69]., 63657=In 1901, a local group of organizations known as \u0093The Aid Association for the Jewish Inhabitants of Galizia\u0094 was established. This humanitarian organization aimed to provide our co-religionists in that country with income and work through the establishment of small industrial operations. The center of this organization was in Vienna and therefore all local organizations in Czechoslovakia were disbanded after 1918. Rabbi E. Hofmann was the chairman of this organization in Reichenberg - which was one of the largest in old Austria - from its foundation until its closure., 24206=The year 1901 saw the introduction of a significant tax reform. Its spiritual originator was the then-book keeper Alois Soudek. According to this reform, each member had the right, up to November of each year, to present to the community his declaration of state tax, and the community tax was then to be paid accordingly in the relevant income class. When the state tax declaration was shown later at a possible appeal against the community tax prescription, then the state certificate would be ignored by the community. If members did not show the state tax certificate, their income was estimated by the community, and their community tax was prescribed according to this estimate., 31416=The working party of councilors which until this time had been a successfully operating part of society now followed an anti-Semitic tendency. In a meeting on 9 December 1890, Councilor Dr. Jennel pronounced \u0093that the growth of inhabitants in Reichenberg is basically because of the immigration of two foreign elements, and their growth in numbers is not to the benefit of the city. In the one case, they are mainly proletarians who are placing stress upon the employment market and are often of a criminal nature, as the statistics show; and in the other because their growth and prosperity is leading to the impoverishment of the local population\u0094. This statement was a huge insult to both minorities, namely the Czechs and the Jews. The Jews first became aware of this statement through a notice in the Reichenberg News. Councilor Hasen\u00f6hrl pointed at the attack on Israelites in the next meeting and demanded that the mayor distance himself from it in a suitable way., 86783=In former times, individual Jews also lived on the small estate of L\u00e4mberg (Lvov\u00e1),. At the beginning of the 15th century, the Silesian nobility[74] borrowed money from Jews in L\u00e4mberg as Jews were expelled from G\u00f6rlitz in 1395., 81907=From indirect sources we know that individual Jews were resident there at the end of the 16th century. A woman executed in Reichenberg in 1599 admitted under torture that she sometimes sold stolen goods to the Jews in Deutsch-Gabel. In the contract book for the east part of Hennersdorf am Rollberg (Dubnice) there are the following two notices: in spring 1600, Martin Wilde paid 15 Scores and among others also paid the \u0093Jew from Gabel\u0094; then, on 27 December 1610, the Jew Salomon from Gabel receives from Jacob Procop seven Mites 15 Groschen, as owed by Jacob Ohlmann., 77300=The privilege issued in Ji\u010d\u00edn on 17 June 1627 says as follows:, 88131=20 October 1748: Empress Maria Theresa confirmed the privileges of the St. Jacob Convent., 68300=It is fortunate that we in Reichenberg have also been able to organize Jewish youth \u0096 the bearers of our Jewish future. There are two youth organizations. \u0093J\u00fcdisch Wanderbund Blau-Weiss\u0094 (Techeleth Lawan)[67] is significantly older, having been founded in 1912. It has been through various development phases. A majority of those members of the younger generation who are conscious of their Jewishness started here. The young leaders have support from the parent council., 114803=Copyright \u00a91999-2014 by JewishGen, Inc. Updated 22 Feb 2013 by JH, 58597=Ritual slaughterers: Valentin Fischer (1863-1893); Semy Steindler (1893-1931); today, Chaim Laib Wolf - who is also the cantor., 87594=28 February 1690: Maria Kunigunde Hildebrandin, Superior and Head of the Convent of regular Choir Women of St. Jacob bestowed certain privileges. In article 8, it is written: \u0094As in old times Jews have never settled here, so shall they not settle in the future.\u0094, 87867=1 December 1731: Catharina Antonia Binderin, Superior and Head of the Convent of regular Choir Women of St. Jacob confirmed the above mentioned article 8., 58965=It is an honor for the social spirit of the community that, as early as 1875 on the initiative of Wilhelm Winterberg, a retirement trust was created for the employees of the community and their widows., 69388=Members of the community have also participated in public life. Nobody has forced his way into public or honorable posts. However, those who have been called to such positions are only too happy to put their energy and know-how to the service of the public at large. The Jewish community was represented on the school council by Moritz Rosenbaum. When this was dissolved and replaced by the Imperial and Royal district school council, the Jewish community had the right to be represented by a voting member. The Jewish councilors were: Wilhelm Winterberg until 1878, Siegmund Liebitzki from 1878-1889, Heinrich Langstein from 1889-1900, Rabbi Professor E. Hofmann from 1900-1910, Dr Wilhelm Schn\u00fcrmacher from 1910-1916, and Dr. Wilhelm Fleischer from 1916-1920. Since the 1870s, a Jew has been elected as magistrate in almost every election period. In 1919, Guido Knina was elected to the town council for the Social Democratic party and remained there for four years., 66252=The \u0093Zionistische Volksverein Theodor Herzl\u0094 (Zionist Peoples Association of Theodor Herzl) was founded quite late - in 1908. Its first chairman was Dr. Hugo Reichmann. The current chairman is Engineer Erwin Schwarzkopf. Wilhelm Weiss acts as delegate to the national association. With complete satisfaction can the association see its modern-day Master Eckhart[65] in its own Emil Deutsch., 56320=The formation of a matriculation register at the community and the inclusion of the legal circuit areas of Reichenberg, Kratzau (Chr\u00e1stava), Friedland (Fr\u00fddlant), Gablonz a/N (Jablonec nad Nisou) and Tanwald (Tanvald), as well as the separation from the Turnau (Trutnov) matriculation register, was accepted by the state administration on 14 November 1864 on condition that the registrar is domiciled in Reichenberg. The first registrar was Valentin Fischer - from April 1865 until he resigned in 1873. He was followed by Salomon Pollak until the end of 1890. After this, Rabbi Dr. Posnanksi held the post for one year, and until the end of 1892, the lawyer Dr. Wilhelm Hersch. Since 1893, Rabbi Dr. Hofmann has been the registrar. He is the last one to have been sworn in by the government representative and later state governor Count Karl Coudenhove. As per the order of the state administration, the Gablonz-Tannwald registry was separated from the Reichenberg one as from 24 April 1878., 28507=In 1876, a terrible and bloody deed made the headlines far beyond the city walls. During a seizure, Isaac Abeles - a 50-year old hard-working merchant with a poor education - killed the commercial agent Eduard Pellheim with several knife trusts. The trial lasted three days and was led in an exemplary fashion by District Court Judge Hartmann. The trial revealed a very unhappy picture of society. Abeles was sentenced by the jury to death by hanging. He was subsequently pardoned and the sentence was changed to 20 years' penal servitude. On 18 August 1889, the date of the Emperor's birthday, he was pardoned and released from prison. He spent the rest of his life in quiet seclusion and died in 1897 at the age of 70. His defense was led by the lawyer Petak. During the reading of the sentence in the old court house in F\u00e4rbegass, Abeles fainted and suffered stomach cramps. This caused great excitement among the public that were present, not least because at that very moment there came a furious thunderstorm. The people could not understand how it is possible that a Jew could kill another Jew., 87177=This town burned down in 1806. By a miracle a box containing the town privileges was rescued. Some surprisingly well-preserved parchments together with the town seal were first found in 1924. After the death of Wallenstein, the estate of Libenau came into the hands of Isolani, whose daughter joined a monastery as abbess and brought the estate with her as her dowry. Five of these documents refer to Jews., 70372=Jews have also been appointed as lay judges and as councilors in the Chamber of Commerce and Trade. Alfred Deutsch was active for decades as a trade councilor. In 1884, when the city council established a health council to deal with all matters concerning hygiene, they called for assistance from the court, prison, rail and general physician, Dr. Karl Kohn. In 1864, he had also founded a modern public bath in Reichenberg at a time when there was just one public bath in the town: the Wilhelmsbad on Gebirgsstrasse. This was not adequate for a town with 20,000 inhabitants; it was far away and little bit old fashioned. In spite of that, the new bath was not a success and had to close down after four years.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 Now it was necessary to create two committees: a Buildings Committee to handle the planning, order the various works and supervise the construction; and a Finance Committee to raise any capital that was still lacking. The community appointed the following to the Buildings Committee: Josef Pollak (representative), Dr. Wilhelm Hersch, J.L.Knina, chief engineer Moritz Lemberger, factory director Hermann Nettl, and Siegmund Weil. The Finance Committee comprised: Heinrich Langstein (representative), Josef La\u017eansky, Heinrich Pollak, Salomon Pola\u010dek, Max Schnabel, and Dr. Ignatz Ullmann. Two famous Viennese architects, Max Fleischer and Professor Carl K\u00f6nig, accepted invitations to visit Reichenberg; after their return home, they presented their individual proposals. Upon the recommendation of the expert members, the community decided on the proposal by Professor K\u00f6nig, and so he was entrusted with the project. All the detailed plans came from his studio. Supervision of the work was carried out by architect Daud, professor at the state trade school in Reichenau. All carpenters, metal workers, plumbers and other craftsmen were employed from local Reichenberg companies. Only the best materials were used. This was also true for the pews. The cost of stonemasonry was almost half of the total building cost, which was 149,775 florins. The total cost of the temple, which has 250 seats for men and the same number for women, as well as the meeting hall and heating, can be divided as follows: Larks' Field Street). It was a fortunate decision as there was surely no better or more suitable",
