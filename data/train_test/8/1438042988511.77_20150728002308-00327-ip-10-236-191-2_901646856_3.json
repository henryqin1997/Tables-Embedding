I'm a non-traditional student been out of high school since 1984, they are great at accepting me, helping me and welcoming me to their campus. Education program is one of the best in Oregon. If you love small classes, helpful professors, great people here is the place to be., 116617=There's only one fraternity that began last year (2011-2012 school year) called Kappa Sigma. To be honest, they are nothing like the frats you may have heard of at huge universities like Arizona State University and all those well known party schools. Don't get too excited., 73327=One on one help the ratio is 15:1. The teachers get involve and make sure their students are understanding the lesson. Also they will know if you don't show up to class, so go to class everyday., 148897=I suggest you get you FAFSA in no later then January 14th, and don't stress your test scores that much. If you go to this school, make sure to do the homework on time or you will get behind, much more quickly than in high school., 54926=Homecoming is not as important than the first week of December, 236943=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 97256=There is a public safety building right across the street from Heritage. There are campus security officers going around all the time. There are even pawprints on the ground to follow so you will always be on a lighted path. I have never heard of any issue on campus with safety. I think this is a very safe campus. I have walked across campus at 9:00 at night and never thought twice about it.}",

If you want to be a teacher, Western has a great education program. Tips for prospective students I understand if you're nervous for the first week. Just remember, so is everyone else. Bang for the buck It's college. College is expensive. For the level of education, the price is fair. Am enjoying being here I love the people. There is always something going on on campus, and there are always friends to hang out with in the dorms. Am learning a lot My goal is to graduate in three years, and the flexible scheduling at Western allows me to follow through with my plans. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
