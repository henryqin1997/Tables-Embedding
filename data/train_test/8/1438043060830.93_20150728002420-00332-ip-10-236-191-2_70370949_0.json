The site was originally 3 parcels of land, purchased by the congregation, each of which had building on them that were torn down to accommodate the new complex. The Temple Beth Zion site is located approximately 1.5 miles from Buffalo's Niagara Square, a historically relevant location with buildings that include the art deco City Hall and the 1923 Statler Hotel. The Temple Beth Zion's concrete construction sits among some of the oldest and largest brick residences in Buffalo from the early twentieth century.

The building was constructed for the Jewish reform congregation branch, which, established in 1863, was the largest congregation of Jewish people in Western New York and represented one of the oldest reform Jewish congregations in the United States. The design was a Byzantine revival constructed out of Medina brownstones, and showcased a copper dome. This original incarnation of Temple Beth Zion was occupied until 1961, when routine maintenance on the pews resulted in a dangerous combination of fumes that ignited, incinerating the temple. Following Temple Beth Zion's destruction, there was lengthy discussion about where the replacement should be constructed. Four sites were considered: 805 Delaware, Delaware and Nottingham, Main Street between Fairlawn and Getzville, and on the ashes of the original temple site. 805 Delaware, a combination of several parcels, offered a large site, numerous points of access, and excellent street visibility; this was countered by a hefty price tag of $650,000. Delaware and Nottingham, a compilation of seven parcels, was a more suburban site sporting a significantly lower price of $447,000. On January 14, 1962, after little debate among members of the temple board, the site at 805 Delaware was selected as the preliminary choice and proposed to the congregation. The congregation, having no notable objections to the selection, the project moved forward. Following the site selection, an initial project estimate was conducted and it calculated an expected cost of $2,840,000. Insurance settlements from the fire, coupled with the sale of the original property at 599 Delaware Ave, gave the congregation a sum of $1,160,000 towards the construction of the new temple. With $1,680,000 to raise, the property was seen as within an attainable budget, and the project moved onto architect selection. Approximately twenty architects were considered and interviewed by the architect selection committee. Leader of the committee, Paul Cohen, had a strong desire to choose an architect with a national reputation. Of those considered for the position, three architects were from Buffalo, two from Rochester, five were not local, but had extensive temple experience, and the remaining were of repute either nationally or internationally. Specifically considered for the project by Cohen and the committee were Gordon Bunshaft of SOM, Minoru Yamasaki, Marcel Breuer, Edward Durrell Stone, Tietro Belluschi, William Lescaze, and Max Abramovitz. Bunshaft was rejected for his apparent lack of follow through, Yamasaki was considered too busy to take on the project, Breuer was rejected for requesting unacceptable relocation considerations, Stone was found to have insufficient time to complete the project, and Belluschi and Lescaze were not selected for unknown reasons. Abramovitz was interviewed and chose to display his firm's work at the United Nations, Rockefeller Center, and Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center. On April 15, 1962, Max Abramovitz, a partner at the firm Harrison & Abramovitz, was selected by Cohen and the committee to be the architect for the project. What solidified Abramovitz's selection was his reassurance that the Temple would have his full and personal attention. Eight months following Abramovitz's selection, the preliminary design for the new Temple Beth Zion at 805 Delaware Avenue was presented to the board and accepted unquestioningly. However, on April 15, 1962, renderings of the proposed site were published in the news and received significant backlash from the community due to poor public opinion. This response was strong enough to cause Cohen and the board to reconsider the design, which they communicated to Abramovitz following the reaction. In the end, the original design is what was built, without any consideration taken from the public response. On June 24, 1964, just two years after the initial renderings reached the public for the first time, the ground breaking ceremony for Temple Beth Zion was held. According to John Laping, Abramovitz saw an opportunity to, \u201csustain the legacy of the Beth Zion as a vital force in the life of Buffalo and they saw an opportunity to leave something better than they found.\u201d (Laping, 2007) The building is ensconced in symbolism from the ten scallops on its majestic exterior to the material choices both outside and within. The modern design eloquently marries the strength of tradition, found in the massive and rough quality of the exterior walls, with the modern design symbols representing the forward thinking, acceptance, and tolerance of the congregation from its establishment in 1863 to present. The way in which the building embodies the religious intent of the congregation underlines the commitment of the people and their support of one another.}",
