City Media have been on the blower and are after Blue musicians to knock out tunes outside the stadium on match days. Shabba! Busk for City! 'City are on the lookout for buskers and acoustic acts to perform outside the City of Manchester Stadium before City home games this season. In conjunction with the Umbro Playlist we need four acts each matchday to entertain the crowds as they arrive at the ground. Chosen artists will be asked to perform for approximately an hour before kick-off and will also receive a pair of tickets to the match. Any money collected through busking will be given to one of the clubs' associated charities. 'The first game we need buskers for is Arsenal on September 12th. 'So, if you're an acoustic act, guitarist, singer, violinist... anything musical, please get in touch by emailing us an mp3 of you playing or a link to a MySpace page etc to mcfc@mcfc.co.uk with 'MCFC Buskers' as the subject. It's got to be worth the craic to thrash out 'Ace of Spades' by Motorhead outside the club shop on a ukelele... Manchester City.
