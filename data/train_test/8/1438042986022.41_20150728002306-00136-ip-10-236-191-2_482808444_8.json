Consequently, the scope of the invention should not be limited to the foregoing discussion, but should be defined by the appended claims. It can further be appreciated that the exact configuration and composition of the multiple particle beam will be selected on a case by case basis depending upon the type of cells and the position of the cells within the patient's body that are to be targeted. Hence, the actual use of the system will vary depending upon the circumstances surrounding the treatment of the patient. The foregoing description has involved the production of the neutrons by directing the proton beam through a plate of neutron-rich material. It should be appreciated, however, that the exact manner in which the beams are generated, including the configuration of any neutron-rich material, can be varied without departing from the scope of the present invention. Due to the destructive potential of neutrons relative to protons, it is generally desirable to limit the total number of neutrons in the",
