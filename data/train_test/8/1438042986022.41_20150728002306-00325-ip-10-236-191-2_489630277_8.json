Further, SiH4 gas, HCl gas, SiH2 Cl2 gas or the like may be used instead of the NH3 gas, and so the heat treatment may be performed in a gas atmosphere including only SiH4 gas, HCl gas or SiH2 Cl2 gas, and also may be performed in the H2 -gas atmosphere including these gases. Furthermore, the heat treatment may be performed in a gas atmosphere including only H2 gas. FIG. 3 shows another example of the manufacturing method shown in FIG. 2, wherein like parts corresponding to those of FIG. 2 are marked with the same references and therefore need not described. In this embodiment, the manufacturing method is applied to the device of FIG. 1 having the two layers of the silicon nitride film and the silicon dioxide film. Namely, in this embodiment, firstly, processes shown in FIGS. 3A to 3C (corresponding to the processes shown in FIGS. 2A to 2C) are executed, that is, the device is heated at temperature of about 500\ufffd to 800\ufffd C. in H2 gas atmosphere including NH3 gas, and then an Si3 N4 film 71 and a SiO2 film 66 are sequentially deposited by the low",
