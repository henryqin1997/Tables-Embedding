    "textBeforeTable": "A powerful feature of the Aggregator is the ability to create aggregated repos that can be consumed as Maven repos, (i.e. providing the directory/file structure and artifacts required by Maven). An aggregated repository that supports Maven can be consumed both as a p2 and a Maven repo (at the same time). This flexibility is possible thanks to p2's separation of dependency meta-data and the actual location of the referenced artifacts. In order to create a Maven-conformant aggregate repo all that is required is to set the property Maven Result property of the Aggregator to true. The aggregation deployed to the Build Root location will be a Maven repo. The sample buckminster_helios_maven.b3aggr is a variation of the previous aggregations configured to produce a Maven repo. Headless support You will need a headless installation of b3 with the Aggregator feature installed. Running from the command line Just type: b3 aggregate <options> Note: if you install the aggregator into an Eclipse SDK or Platform (rather than a pure headless installation), you can run from the command line, by using eclipse -application org.eclipse.b3.cli.headless aggregate <options> For a detailed listing of the available options consult the next section. Command line options Mirroring all repo artifacts of your aggregated contributions is a very valuable and important feature when performing aggregation, but there are also many cases where this is not necessary.

Aggregation model components and specific actions This section provides an in-depth description and reference of the Aggregation model, listing all model components, properties and available actions.

It specifies a number of global properties including the Build Root (the target location of the aggregated repository) as well as the repo structure (maven-conformant or classic p2 setup).
