Hoping to steel Owen\u2019s glory are Drew Dillman (Bob\u2019s Red Mill), and Zane Godby (Clif Bar Development Team), who took second and third overall in the USGP series. As the highest finishing rider from 2010\u2019s 17-18 nationals, in which he took third, Dillman stands as Owen\u2019s main rival \u2013 the pair also recently placed fifth and sixth, with Owen ahead, at World Cup Heusden-Zolder Juniors race. Will Dillman\u2019s extra year in the 17-18 category be enough to stop Owen\u2019s streak? Also looking to make the podium are Cypress Gorry (Whole Athlete-Specialized) and Sam O\u2019Keefe (Charm City), who last year placed fourth and sixth, respectively. Zack Gould (Clif Bar Development Team), Nate Morse (Cannondale-Cyclocrossworld.com), and Curtis White (Hot Tubes) all made last year\u2019s top five in the 15-16 category, and will be hoping to make fireworks in their freshman attempt.
