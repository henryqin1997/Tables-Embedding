The best results are usually obtained with an alkali metal metasilicate having an alkali metal oxide to silicon dioxide ratio of about 1:]. Hydrated alkali metal silicates dissolve faster and should be used for best results when the alkali metal silicate is added in solid form. In instances where an anhydrous alkali metal silicate is used. it may be desirable to dissolve it in water and then add the solution to the aqueous medium. Sodiui'n metasilicate is preferred and usually a hydrated sodium metasilicate such as the pentahydrate gives the best results., 12203=Related U.S. Application Data [63] Continuation of Ser.
