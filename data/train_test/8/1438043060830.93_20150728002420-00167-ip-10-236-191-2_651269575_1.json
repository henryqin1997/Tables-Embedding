I do love to have a good time, enjoy the hot summer nights and cuddle in the cold winter days. A drink, a walk and a pleasant conversation would be ideal to introduce our personalities. I know what I want and I hope you do too. If we can keep the conversation interesting, its a great start. Only time, our personalities and our interests would determine if we are meant for each other. Until then, we can be friends and enjoy our moments. Chivalry is not dead. First Date We can discuss that later. Add to Favorites!",
