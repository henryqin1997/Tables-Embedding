            "there is not much to do at the college. the only fun things really is to be involved in organizations like ptk or sga. events that occur at the college are usually in the whatley where they have musical, theatre performances, and a few concerts.",
            "the food at the college is great! they have the snack bar which has great food but not only that, they have lunch food and a salad bar! what makes the food and dining even better is that the place is very clean and employees working there are very friendly!",
            "the dorm life at ntcc is very boring. yes, you have roommates and get to hangout with them but there isn't much to do at ntcc unless you're involved in organizations. the town where ntcc is located in, mount pleasant, does not have many things for students to go to and have fun.",
            "the academic rigor of the college is not difficult at all. if students do all the work, study, stay on task, ask questions, and be interested, the student's gpa should be a 4.0. the homework is minimal but when it comes to the test, they are mostly difficult but with a few hours of studying, an a should be on the test.",
            "a few tips i would give to students wanting to go to northeast texas community college is to ask questions and not be shy because the teachers are willing to help you in any way. also, yes the college is small but if you get involved with organizations there, you will enjoy helping and gain leadership skills while doing it. lastly, stay on task! many students cannot stay on task or stay focused but if you do at this college, i assure you that you will get the a you want and need!",
            "northeast texas community college is a great place to get your basics done because of the fact that you have a one to one experience between the teacher and the student. also, if you're interested in saving money, the tuition here is not very costly and they financial aid office is willing to help students in any way if needed. also, the place is small so it is less accurate to get lost and everyone is very friendly."

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students for those that are not sure if ntcc is right for you, here's a few pro's and con's. most importantly, ntcc is one of the cheaper colleges in texas. and if you are a local resident, it is even cheaper! the school provides many scholarship programs and fundraisers for students. also, ntcc offers many clubs and sororities that could benefits those who plan to transfer later. my advice would be to become active in these groups to really enjoy a full college experience. one thing i would like to point out against ntcc is that there are students of all ages on campus, including high school students involved in the dual-credit program. although it is not a large issue, it is sort of an issue when a student wants to be a in a more mature setting in the classroom. although most teachers are great at controlling the classroom, some students still serve as a distraction to others. In three sentences northeast texas community college is great for students of all ages! most students are parents, or older adults, who are also working full time and going to school full time. the teachers and staff are very understanding of this difficulty and are usually willing to work with students.
