Rockies outfielder Carlos Gonzalez was next with 240 points. He appeared second on seven ballots. Reds third baseman Scott Rolen landed in 14th place, garnering 26 points. In balloting that took place at the end of the regular season by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Votto received 31 out of a possible 32 first-place votes and 443 points to earn his first MVP. It prevented Cardinals first baseman Albert Pujols from winning his third consecutive MVP and fourth overall. \"Not to be dramatic or anything -- after I was told, I couldn't help but cry because I know how much something like this meant to me and would have meant to my father,\" said Votto, who lost his father following his sudden death in August 2008. On Monday, Votto learned that he was named the National League's Most Valuable Player for 2010. CINCINNATI -- As the realization took hold, Reds first baseman Joey Votto wasn't afraid to let the tears flow and the delight of the moment wash over him.",
    "textAfterTable": "Complete vote totals Speaking on a conference call from the back porch of his home in Sarasota, Fla., Votto admitted a nervousness started in the past week as the MVP announcement drew closer. As one who rarely reads or watches stories regarding baseball, especially when he is the subject, Votto admitted to reading the comparisons between himself and Pujols and how the two stacked up in the MVP race. When the results were revealed, the 27-year-old Votto was \"shocked\" by how wide the margin was over Pujols. \"I thought I must have snuck it in there. I didn't think it would be so conclusive,\" Votto said. \"I missed out on unanimous by one. I have no other word to use other than surprise.\" It was the 12th time a Reds player won the NL MVP and the first time since Barry Larkin in 1995. The Cardinals have won the most NL MVPs, with 17, second to the Yankees' 20 in the American League. The American League MVP will be revealed by the BBWAA on Tuesday. Clearly, the voters did not penalize Votto for not leading any of the three Triple Crown categories. Gonzalez won the batting title with a .336 average, and Pujols had the most home runs (42) and RBIs (118). Reds NL MVP Winners",
