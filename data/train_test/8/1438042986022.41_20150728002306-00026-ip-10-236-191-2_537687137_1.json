Therefore, it is rather fitting that when Fuji was founded in 1899, it was named after Mount Fuji, a Japanese symbol of strength and endurance, and one of the most iconic and Majestic mountain peaks in the world. With that said, Fuji is a brand that believes in the core characteristics in which cycling represents; strength, endurance, challenge, and triumph. The same can be said about their bikes., 6686=The 2012 Outland 29 1.0 is held together with the A6-SL alloy frame, making it incredibly durable. The hydroformed top and down tube provide a more upright geometry for more comfort and endurance enhancement, whilst shaving off valuable weight. The Shimano Deore XT rear and front derailleur, and SLX Rapid Fire shifters make shifting smooth and effortless. The FSA afterburner 28/40 tooth crankset and FSA Press-Fit bottom bracket provide maximum transfer of power between your pistons (legs) and your drivetrain, giving you attack-like acceleration., 165604=1128}",
