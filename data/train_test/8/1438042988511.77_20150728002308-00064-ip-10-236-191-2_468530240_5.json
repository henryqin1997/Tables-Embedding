By gradually increasing spring pressure during mounting, the locking pins 11 on the outer cap 8 will be guided into locking tracks 12 in the mounting frame 7. By unloading the outer force influence 13, the complete sensor 6 b will now be locked with constant spring pressure towards the pipe 10. Sideways, it is now only the plastic wedges 1 spanning in towards the mounting frame 7. An alternative way of fastening the sensor 6 a in the mounting frame 7 is shown in the Norwegian patent application 2006 1860.}",

FIG. 4 The principle for locking the spring load is submitted to the present invention. For equipment mounted in relation to pipes on the sea floor, several known solutions and many variants of these are known, for instance \u201cJ-slot\u201d, spring loaded locking segments spanning outwards, and so-called \u201cCollect-connector\u201d. The realisation here uses preferably a \u201cJ-slot\u201d type of connection 12 (see A preferred embodiment of the present invention has at least one set of wedges 1 in front and at least one set of wedges 1 in the rear edge of the sensor housing 6, for secure sideways support. Alternative embodiments can comprise fewer sets of wedges 1 (i.e. one or more) and additional support in another shape, for instance by an elastic connection. The additional support can possibly be attended to by the locking mechanism for spring pressure itself. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a flat disk 5 is placed behind the foremost wedge set 1 to secure a defined glide surface in the transition towards the helical spring 2, and an identical flat disk 5 is arranged behind the rear wedge set to secure identical friction conditions, so that the rear and foremost wedges 1 goes equally. The functionality of the invention is not dependent",
