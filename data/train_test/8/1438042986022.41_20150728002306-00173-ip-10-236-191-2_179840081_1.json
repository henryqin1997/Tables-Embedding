Valdespin, didn't know he was that good vs. us. Odd that he's not starting but not complaining. June 05, 2013 6:37 PM, 264345=David\u2026 we should place bets now on the elimination date, I say August 20, 266545=My bet on elimination date is November 1st. That's the day after we win the World Series., 74022=\"So Strasburg is going on the DL. Did he clean out his locker?\"Why does this keep coming up about the locker? Rizzo confirmed in comments that aired on 106.7 yesterday at ~5:15 p.m. that Espi is going to AAA after the DL. Hence the cleaned out locker., 235468=You know, when you have a team this bad, its kind of funny. My pre-2012 Nats are back. Where have you been all this time? Almost didn't recognize you last year. Let's break a record for least runs scored. How about a breaking a record for most games with 2 or less runs? Let's see how many hanging sliders you can miss. Zimmerman, Zimmerman\u2026., 79179=Confrontation is risky, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that the guy was asking for it. Also, I suspect that this could happen at any park, with any fanbase. As my dear departed grandpa-in-law often said, I might have told you this before, but it's worth telling again. I was once at an O's/Nats game at RFK. There were some unruly, over-imbibing Nats fans seated a few rows over and down from us, in the upper deck. They were giving the fish eye to some O's fans (who were doing nothing offensive, just sporting O's gear) for several innings. The O's fans included a young boy, btw. This got no response, so the Nats fans decided to up their game and start throwing stuff, including beverage containers, at the O's fans. I went to the top of our section and told an usher about it (we didn't have texting and Tweetering back then, kiddies, but I digress). After a while, she went over and said something to the Nats fans, and they stopped.I've also saw a similar event at Nats Park, that time involving unruly, over-imbibing Phillies Phans who threw popcorn on a young Nats fan. (Stay classy, Phillies Phans. But I digress.)I don't care who is behaving in such a manner, or where they're doing it. There's no room for it, and no excuse for it. Just another natsfan1a editorial.phil dunton said\u2026 Re: The Yankee fan at the O's game\u2013confronting two likely drunk hecklers is butt stupid and just asking for trouble. I was confronted by a large, very drunk young Phillies fan about 3 years ago in one of the Nats parking lots after a Phillies victory. The animal got in my face and yelled \"Great game, huh.\" It was obvious he was baiting me. I looked him right in the eye and said \"I really like the Phillies team and wish the Nationals played like them\". At first he was shocked, then he slapped me on the back and said \"Thanks buddy\". I could live for another day. Going to any sports game nowdays and wearing a hated team's sports garb is risky business. June 05, 2013 4:53 PM, 319558=The NL East is suddenly the NL Least. The Braves are not that good. This could be a year where 88 wins gets you the division crown. I agree that the wild card seems a long shot.Nevertheless, the dirty little secret of MLB is that regular season records don't matter in the play-offs, particularly if you have pitching. Just ask the 82-79 Mets who came within a whisper of beating the eventual 3 time champs A's back in 1973. I remember the 83-79 Cards winning the World Series, as well as a Twins team that was actually outscored during the regular season in 1987., 290463=The Lerners did not choose to extend Rizzo's contract beyond the 2014 option season. They may eventually offer him a new contract but that's unlikely if the Nationals continue to sink. The minor league cupboard is pretty bare and the current roster certain doesn't offer much hope. If Rizzo departs, I certainly hope he takes his adopted son, Eckstein, with him., 351264=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images.

I knew Wright was going to homer because everyone in the park could see, Haren's pitches are all high tonight. Nobody tries to suck, but players like Haren so not do the extra preparation to be better\u2026I have said this since April..his preparation is terrible, 83989=Boy, that was a long comment, and I didn't even mention the unruly (but apparently not under the influence judging by his breath) O's fan who \"accidentally\" bumped into me, several times, on the ramp after a recent O's game at Nats Park, then apologized in a rather Eddie Haskellian manner. And now I've dated myself, too.Er, on topic, hope that Dan has another good start in him. May the Nats bats hit early and often, and may the Mets bats flail with futility. May our defense not falter. May we score more runs than the opposing team. Oh, and nobody should get hurt. Okay, that should about cover it. I'm good., 289486=Ghost Of Steve M. said\u2026 Sorry, 3-0 where you have the pitcher breathing hard and you have the new callup swing?Bad idea although nice wood on it but unlucky BABIP. June 05, 2013 7:30 PM This is looking larger in the whole picture as the Nats had Gee on a 1st inning pitch count in the 20s and only scored 1 and left 2 on., 27777=Mark posted his game post yesterday at 3:33.

She's not on the air until 6:30 pm, but she tweeted the news at 4:29, just four minutes after Mark and the other beats did. Kristina's doing a great job on MLB Now, but she's not at the park., 165317=MrsB loves the Nats said\u2026 Haren is a bum\u2026. June 05, 2013 8:00 PM Wow, that is nice., 158012=Adam Kilgore \u200f@AdamKilgoreWP 24sWhen Marlon Byrd played for the Nats in 2006, his car got stolen from the RFK Stadium parking lot during a road trip. Great times.That's hilarious., 278017=if Nats do not win with Gio, tomorrow, both the Twins and Rockies will send the Nats back to their 2007 level.. I smell a 7-8 game losing streak coming which will for all intents and purposes will end any post season hope for 2013, 133128=Manassas Nats' Fan said\u2026 Might as well hae Duke or HROD pitch if you are going to keep ball up. June 05, 2013 7:38 PM Uh, no., 107072=NatsJack in Florida said\u2026 Ghost\u2026.he made 2 errors in his 3 games at Syracuse. June 05, 2013 7:17 PM After each error there were some comments made here to try to make some point. I guess Rizzo wasn't too concerned., 196228=Haren's other 2 starts Apr 27 vs Reds Mat vs. dodgers, 195546=Apr 27 Red May 12 Dodgers}",
