            "There are many clubs and organizations on campus, and the Student Life office sponsors several free activities every month for students.",
            "Kirkwood has very low tuition and great teachers and facilities.",
            "There are many things to do for fun. There are several clubs and student organizations on campus. The Student Life office sponsors many free student activities each month, and students can attend any sporting event on campus for free. Also, all students have free access to the rec center on campus.",
            "The food in Sammy's Cafe is pretty good, but its more expensive than food in most cafeterias. This year they have added a sushi bar, however I haven't tried it.",
            "There are no Kirkwood owned dorms. There are about 14 apartment complexes around the campus that are Kirkwood approved for students to lease. Kirkwood has housing options listed on their website where these can be compared. Most (maybe all) of the complexes around the campus offer individual leases and roommate matching.",
            "All of the teachers are very focused on the classes they teach. Most of them have real world experience in the field they are teaching, and will share lessons they have learned. Classes are exciting and many are hands-on. They keep students involved and make the learning process smoother.",
            "Going to summer orientation is very important. You will meet your adviser and they will help you sign up for the right classes in your first semester. Also, keep in touch with your adviser, they can help you get good internships or jobs after graduation as well as making sure you take the right classes each semester and graduating on time. Get involved in a club (or two or three) and go to the free events provided by the Student Life office. There is a lot to do on campus and a lot of fun to be had if you get yourself involved. The most important advise for a student going to any college is you have to go to class. Most teachers will judge you based on how often your miss class, and it will affect your grades.",
            "Kirkwood Community College is very student oriented with faculty that are helpful and put students first. Most teachers have had real world experience in their area of instruction. There are many things to do on campus from clubs and organizations to free student activities provided by the Student Life office."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Kirkwood is a great place for any type of student. Whether you are international, out of state, in state, Kirkwood is the place for you! You will have a fantastic time at Kirkwood, and you get to meet so many different types of people. Tips for prospective students Some good tips for prospective students would be to fill out as many scholarships as you can. College is not free, and you are going to want as much help as you possibly can. If you are going to live on campus, make sure you know how to cook, clean, and do your own laundry. If you do not know how to do any of those; learn now while your mom is still in the same household as you. Bang for the buck Kirkwood is affordable. It has the lowest tuition rate in the state of Iowa, and the faculty members are the best. The class sizes are small; only 24 students per class, and the teacher's know you by first name and want to get to know you personally, to help you succeed in their class. Am enjoying being here I love Kirkwood Community College! It's a great college to go to when",
