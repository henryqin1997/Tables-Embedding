A bit pricey though., 100097=January 1, 2014 - I gifted my daughter and her family with four of these sweatshirts. They called to say they were thrilled with the sweatshirts and a friend has already looked in to order one. They have a farm and will put the warm gifts to good use. My daughter was in the Air Force., 98167=April 9, 2015 - This is my favorite hoodie because people can easily read it. I get MANY comments on it, asking what insignias are; saying they really like this; those who know what insignias are also say they really like it; I'm asked frequently where can they get this, etc. I wear things like this to make others aware of our military, our pride we should have in them & our country. This hoodie gets the point across very well. Very soft, warm, worth the money definitely., 98958=August 23, 2014 - very nice sweat shirt, 99308=July 8, 2014 - Excellent quality....like the weight.
