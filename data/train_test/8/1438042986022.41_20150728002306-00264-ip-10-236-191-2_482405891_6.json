No. 6,521,152., 54401=Several test parts were fabricated using the above method and apparatus, specifically nine (9) stator and six (6) rotor-size parts for 767 aircraft made by the BOEING Corporation. For a stator, 3.976 pounds (1807 g) of 1-inch (2.54 cm) chop length carbon fiber (grade X9755) and 1.454 pounds (661 g) of milled carbon fiber (grade 341, each grade of fibers marketed by FORTAFIL), and 7.176 pounds (3262 g) of AR mesophase pitch resin (pellets ground into powder) marketed by the MITSUBISHI Gas Chemical Corporation were dispensed onto a belt conveyer over approximately a thirteen (13) minute period (a total of 12.606 pounds or 5723 g of \u201cmixed material\u201d was deposited in the mold over the time period to form a preform). The material handling fan was operating at 80% of the maximum motor speed, the return air fan at 37% of maximum motor speed and dust collector fan at 60% of maximum motor speed. The mold was located at a 2.5 inch (6.35 cm) linear position from the centerline of the cyclone dust collector and was turning 6 rpm during deposition.}",

These additives can include materials such as metals, ceramic particles, graphite, cokes, curing agents, mica, carbon oxidation inhibitors, glass or polymer films, or any other agents or materials which improve friction and wear characteristics of a composite part and/or to further strengthen the fibrous/binder materials used to fabricate the composite part. Alternatively, these additives may be mixed in with the resin binder material at feeder 230 to conserve space.
