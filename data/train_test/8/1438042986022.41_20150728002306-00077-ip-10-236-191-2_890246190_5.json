Knowing that and the instrumentation used: we've got a cellist in here, a pianist in here, a trumpeter in here, and percussionist here. That's a whole lot of rock for such a genre! And, truthfully, that was a big part of their appeal. The result was a dreamy concoction of raging bittersweet sounds that invaded hearts and souls and stirred the dead. There's no wonder a label took notice right away. Not Animal. The former was the band's preferred version, released only as a vinyl and digital set; whereas the latter the label preferred and was released as a traditional CD. Animal! and The Dust of Retreat, a phenomenal set of songs that earned the band their major label: Artemis Records. In 2006, the album was re-released under the label and then shortly went through label acquisitions and merges, leaving the band with a chance to sign with Epic Records in 2007 for their second album. The band did so much work that there even was a dispute on which songs to include on the album -- the total track list was 25. There ended up being two different versions of the album released: Margot & the Nuclear So and So's Tickets",
