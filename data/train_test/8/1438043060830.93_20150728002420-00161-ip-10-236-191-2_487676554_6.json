Accordingly, the scope of the above-discussed embodiments and methods is not to be limited by the illustrations or the foregoing descriptions thereof, but rather solely by appended claims. [0228] In operation, a noninvasive monitor, such as the noninvasive system 10 of FIG. 1 and the apparatus taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,198,949, is placed in intimate contact with each of the interface surfaces 503, 503\u2032 such that a window of each noninvasive monitor interfaces with the apertures 504, 504\u2032 and is placed in thermal contact with the subject's skin. If, for some reason, either/or both of the noninvasive monitors must be temporarily removed from the subject's skin, such as to allow the subject mobility, the site selectors 500, 500\u2032 may be left strapped to the forearm 462 and the finger 460 so as to maintain a consistent measurement site on the skin. When the noninvasive monitors are later reattached to the site selectors 500, 500\u2032, the site selectors 500, 500\u2032 will again place the windows of the noninvasive monitor in thermal contact with the same locations of skin as before.
