When it first announced the project in March 2008, XCOR Aerospace hoped to be flying within two years, yet is only now assembling the first Mark I vehicle at its Mojave, Calif., facility. The company's long journey to suborbit is partly reflected in the many detailed design differences between the mockup and the artist's concept of 2008., 33765=Your source for 2015 media kits, editorial planners rates and specs for AW&ST, ATW, B&CA and more!, 13970=XCOR CEO Jeff Greason also continues to exude confidence in the project and the market as a whole. \u201cIt took a while, but we think we're there,\u201d he says, describing the path to Lynx. \u201cWe've been through two generations of rocket-powered vehicles so far. Firstly, there was the EZ-Rocket between 2001 and 2005, which was aimed at pushing down the cost of rocket-powered operations. Then there was the X-Racer, between 2006 and 2008, which was all about operational tempo. We got it down to around nine minutes between flights and up to seven flights per day.\u201d, 14549=Now, with the prospect of long-awaited suborbital flights looming in 2013, Greason says the influence of pioneering operations such as the Lynx will be greater than the sum of its parts. \u201cPeople talk about the tradeoff between robotic operations and humans\u2014but I don't think a robot has been invented that can enjoy the spaceflight for me, or can do experiments and say, 'Mmmm . . . that looks funny to me.' So it's a game-changer in a way that will impact other uses of human spaceflight.\u201d, 15717=The mockup at the show indicated the changes made to improve the stability and control of the final configuration, including the broader nose section and extended chine. Other changes\u2014which were made after subsonic wind-tunnel trials in 2009 at the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, and follow-on tests at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center\u2014included larger-chord wingtip-mounted vertical fins with extended ventral sections. A final set of wind-tunnel campaigns in both facilities is scheduled shortly to confirm minor aerodynamic changes., 17395=XCOR aims to start powered taxi tests later this year with high-speed runs by December, and first flight in 2013.}",

A mockup of the two-person cockpit was also displayed alongside the vehicle. The layout is dominated by two multi-function displays, numerous standby instruments and a camera view of the rocket plume. XCOR says visual checks of the plume from a tail-mounted camera will provide the pilot with instant verification of the stability of the rockets, and will warn of issues before anything is picked up on instruments. The company says avionics provided by L-3 Communications, CMC/Esterline, Aspen, MGL, Avidyne and Garmin \u201care all being considered,\u201d and a final decision on the suite of avionics suppliers will be made over the summer.
