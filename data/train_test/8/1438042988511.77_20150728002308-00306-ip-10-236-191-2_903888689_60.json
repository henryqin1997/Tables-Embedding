            "This campus looks like a very safe one and I believe if you ever experienced a safety issue all you would have to do is tell an advisor and they would take all of the necessary steps to fix it.",
            "I do not know anything about the Greek life I am not involved in it and do not plan to be However it looks like they have a varied and accepting Greek life.",
            "They have a ton of clubs and activities. They have something for everyone and there are so many I don't have enough hours in the day to join all the ones I want to. This is a great addition to any school.",
            "The school is great for students who want to learn from the best while having fun doing it. This school doesn't seem like a party school which I like I take my school work seriously and don't want to waste my money on a party school. I also want to have fun and be involved in the school life which is exactly what SUU does.",
            "The Thunderbird Flight school is an unusual tradition but it seems like so much fun they have motivational speakers and food and all of this just for new and transfer students just to make us feel welcome.",
            "It is a little more than I am used to but it is however an out of state price for a University. Compared to other universities it is very cheap. And the service is outstanding. I cannot wait until I can experience the learning first hand.",
            "Zion National Park is only about a half hour away and that is always fun. Saint George is very close as well and there is bowling alleys and movie theaters close by. Also the school itself has a lot of fun stuff such as a movie night and they have a Thunderbird flight school which is the week before school starts to help everyone get acclimated to the school life and meet each other etc. It seems like the whole experience will be fun and exciting.",
            "Again have not even been to the school but they have a tom of restaurants on campus and they have a program where you can buy a food card and go eat at the school 3 times a day for a set price. That is very cool and convenient.",
            "I have no idea what the dorm life is like here I will not be living in a dorm but I am sure from the other experiences i have had with them that the dorm life would be great, fun, and accepting.",
            "I have not attended any classes as of yet but they seem like they will be challenging as well as fun. I cannot wait to start my learning experience at SUU.",
            "If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask! Some colleges do not care or know the answers however the people at SUU know all the answers and if they don't know an answer they will direct you to someone who does. They are there to help and love helping you so ask away!",
            "I absolutely love the advisors especially Scott Brueck, he has helped me out so much. Even though I have never been to the school I already feel like I belong. The website is very easy to navigate and I can always find what I am looking for."

People are friendly and very open. There are so many opportunities for service including trips to Mexico for only $450-$480. Every first Monday of the month we have Bread and Soup Night (all you can eat for $1 and a can of food). My professors honestly care about me and my learning; the campus is safe; there is no winter inversion; thunderstorms are regular and when it rains, the smell of wet sage and pine is crisp and rejuvenating. Not only do I love the location and my classes, I love the clubs on campus. Some of these clubs include ASL, Ukulele, Soccer, and Swing. SUU also has a fine Honors program with plenty perks. One of these perks is a study room exclusive for its students. Recently we took place in the annual SUU homecoming cardboard-duct-tape boat race in the swimming pool. On the flip side, there are always those professors and fellow students who no one enjoys being around. At the moment I am not enjoying my ENGL 2010 class for this reason. Alas, my thinking is being directed in ways I never thought possible; therefore, I am learning and shall not complain too much., 44719=Keep your grades up, APPLY EARLY, and search your school's website for other scholarships. Apply for every scholarship you can find that you are compatible with. I applied the first week of my Senior Year for SUU and was accepted 3 weeks later, which enabled me to receive a scholarship offer in November when they sent out the first batch of offers. DON'T PROCRASTINATE! Also, save EVERY DOLLAR you make before college! You'll thank yourself when you have to buy groceries and textbooks., 638354=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 335922=Apply for scholarships early in December and be aware that you may have to take out loans to pay for school. Even than all your financial needs may not be covered. Financial Aide will not readily give you scholarships be aggressive and persistant with your tuition costs regarding financial aide. Get a payment plan set up or 35 in late fees will be charged every month to your account until your balance is paid off., 146400=Apply early! I applied by December 1st, and was able to qualify for an academic scholarship. A friend of mine applied December 5th.... and all the scholarships were gone. Even if you're still deciding which school to attend, you can always defer your scholarship later. Also, LIVE ON CAMPUS!! You get to meet people so much easier, there's no problem with trying to find parking 5 minutes before your 11 o'clock class, because its a 2-8 minute walk to pretty much any class on campus (trust me, I've timed it). The whole experience as a freshman totally prepares you for college life, and students that live on campus get better grades and have a smaller drop out rate., 45499=Tuition is less than other universities (a couple $100 less than BYU). It's not bad, especially if you get a scholarship. I have a half-tuition for 2 years and that is DEFINITELY helpful. I only have to worry about $1000 a semester compared to $2000+., 19378=Everyday little nuances I never noticed before are opened up to me. My favorite class this semester is UNIV 1000, a seminar dedicated to first semester students. The title of the textbook is Your Expanding Intelligence. It is different, but the learning tools presented are effective and worth knowing how to use. Students are encouraged to think out of the box. We are given principles, then expected to run with them and return with something creative. Professors are open minded. True, they believe they are correct, but if challenged most will listen to their students if the latter presents enough evidence to support their proposition. Everything is about learning, experimenting, thinking, and I love it! Southern Utah University (SUU) is also beginning a system called Experiential Learning. What this means is students will be offered (Freshman of fall 2011 will be required) the chance to employ what they have learned in their major in multiple different categories: Creative, outdoors, global, etc. So an engineering major could design a water system for children in Africa- engineering, but a global/service focus. Students really are expected to apply what they learn., 364640=Apply by December for you can qualify for all the scholarships SUU offers., 338400=Research Southern Utah early. Apply early for Financial Aide also be aware that if you are an out of state student FAFSA will not cover all your financial needs. Apply for scholarships early in December and be aware that you may have to take out loans to pay for school. Even than all your financial needs may not be covered., 15349=-Know what your scholarships cover and what they are intended to cover. Tuition is typically raised yearly, so be prepared to protest it if it decreases the value of your scholarship. -Most departmental scholarships are awarded to upper class-men and are rarely stacked. -Apply for FAFSA as soon as possible -If you are planning on living off campus, either reserve your housing early (April or May), or wait until the last possible second (the week that school starts). You get better deals either of those ways. Don't worry about it disappearing. Cedar City is overbuilt; that is why housing is inexpensive. -Apply for jobs everywhere and pray someone can hook you up. If you are Work-Study eligible, start applying two weeks before school starts and you'll get something fairly quickly. -Apply early! -Tour the campus. A lot of students don't consider coming to SUU until after the tour. Also, you get a free T-Shirt and a coupon for 20% off at the bookstore. Careful, though- the coupon expires. -If you don't like something, TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT IT! The staff is sympathetic with the students and often will change something just because you talked to them. -Make friends with the faculty. They can give more advice than simply homework help. -Deposit every dollar you make between now and college. You will not regret it., 227247=Every year, during homecoming week, students participate in True T-Bird Night. At this time, any students who want to be true t-birds, go to the statue of Old Sorrel. And then the kissing begins! To be a true t-bird, you must kiss someone at Old Sorrel at midnight during homecoming. The best part is, everyone gets free chap stick! In 2008 a bell tower was built on the SUU campus. During the holiday seasons, it plays music every hour. This bell tower has also served as a building stone for a new tradition on campus. Students are not to walk underneath the bell tower while on campus. When freshman attend their orientation, they are all walked under the bell tower going west to east, to symbolically say that the sun is rising and they are starting a new time in life. They are not to walk under the bell tower again until graduation. Part of the graduation ceremonies consists of the graduates walking through the bell tower from east to west, as if the sun is setting on this phase of life. This is a new tradition but it has been a lot of fun to integrate into the life of SUU., 180936=We have this giant rock named gunther on campus and every student has the right to paint on it if they clear it with the student center first. We use it to raise awareness for whatever cause is highlighted that month, we painted a giant red V on it on the fifth of November, it's fun to walk by and see what crazy pattern is on it.}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 11 out of 12 people found this review useful. 3 of 145 Categories Comments Great for these types of students I think SUU is great fro anyone, unless you get homesick fairly easily you are out in the middle of nowhere almost. But, you are also surrounded by lots of great opportunities for adventure. Check out the local outdoor scene, there are endless possibilities for outdoor fun. Tips for prospective students Get your Financial Aid completed and sent in soon!! There are a lot more papers than I thought that need to be sent in. Also, take advantage of all the help that they are willing to give you. My advisor personally called me to get me registered for my classes. Login to rate or flag the reviews Brianna from",
