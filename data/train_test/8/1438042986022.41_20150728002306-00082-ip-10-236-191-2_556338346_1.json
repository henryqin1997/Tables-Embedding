    "textAfterTable": "The same operators are supported for %IF statements. Putting it all together When a query is applied to a topic, the goal is to reduce to a TRUE or FALSE value that indicates whether the topic matches that query or not. If the query returns TRUE, then the topic is included in the search results. A query matches if the query returns one or more values when it is applied to the topic. So if I have a very simple query, such as \"attachments\", then this will return TRUE for all topics that have one or more attachments. If I write \"attachments[size>1024 AND name ~ '*.gif']\" then it will return TRUE for all topics that have at least one attachment larger than 1024 bytes with a name ending in .gif. Gotcha Remember that in the query language, TWiki topic names are constants. You cannot write Main.UserTopic/UserForm.firstName because Main.UserTopic will be interpreted as a form field name. If you want to refer to topics you must enclose the topic name in quotes i.e. 'Main.UserTopic'/UserForm.firstName Examples Query examples attachments[name='purdey.gif'] - true if there is an attachment call purdey.gif on the topic (fields[name='Firstname'].value='Emma' OR fields[name=Firstname].value='John') AND fields[name='Lastname'].value='Peel' - true for 'Emma Peel' and 'John Peel' but not 'Robert Peel' or 'Emma Thompson' (Firstname='Emma' OR",
