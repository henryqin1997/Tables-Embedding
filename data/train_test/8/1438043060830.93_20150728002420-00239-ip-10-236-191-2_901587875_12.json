There is security on the premises at all times and there are emergency phones located in various locations on the campus. Bang for the buck Ivy Tech offers a great education for a great price. Since this college is a community college, it more affordable in today's economy than many other Universities. What to do for fun Ivy Tech provides many great opportunities for fun on and off campus. They offer various fun learning experiences, volunteering experiences, and chances to meet other students while participating in fun activities. Food and Dining Ivy Tech has a great area called The Commons, where students have the opportunity to utilize their cafe or if they wish they are also offered various vending machines as well to satisfy hungry students. If a student is more apt to bring their own lunch, Ivy Tech provides a microwave that is available for student use. Dorm Life Ivy Tech Community College at this time does not offer dorms.
