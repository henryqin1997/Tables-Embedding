    "textBeforeTable": "Track Listing The Stepkids make the kind of intricate studio pop once created by the likes of Steely Dan, with carefully syncopated beats, jazz chords and unpredictable changes. Singer/guitarist Jeff Gitelman spent years honing his skills, playing with Stevie Wonder and Alicia Keys before starting his own band, and that professionalism shows, as songs like \"The Lottery\" were rehearsed and recorded live\u2014perfectly\u2014without unnatural sounding overdubs. This isn't to say Stepkids aren't any fun; the synths of \"Desert in the Dark\" sound like The Neptunes, if they programmed beats using an NES. And \"Black Cow\" bounce of the title track and manic energy of the hip-hop-flavored \"Bitter Bug\" make for a late-album, back-to-back blast. Gitelman and co. clearly have been around the block and know their stuff. Let's hope making an album as great as Troubador finds them settling down for good with The Stepkids. 09/09/2013 Amoeba Review SHIPS FREE in U.S. $18.98 BUY The Stepkids Troubadour (LP) Tweet Troubadour (LP) Home",
