Albany is an historic black college so it has it's traditonally dorms wiley and gibson that has community bathrooms,but all the other dorms or more modern. The newest dorms was built fall 2011, 119343=At Albany State we call our dinning are The Caf.Our caf is brand new, just opened January of 2012. In the care we have four different line and a salad bar. The food in the caf is usually pretty good., 42974=We have a new student center that was built and opened the fall of 2011 its where a lot people go to talk with friends, many of the events are held in this building or outside in the amphitheatre, 196079=One trademark Albany State University has is the chimney. In 1994, the city of Albany experienced a massive flood. It wiped out the whole campus, except for the chimney that was connected to our first academic hall, Caroline Hall. The chimney has three rings around it, representing the height of the flood each day it got higher. Now, the campus is migrating to the higher part of the land. We have a bridge over the pedestrian mall that has a message written on both sides. If you're walking towards the higher side of campus, the bridge says: A past to cherish. If you're walking to the lower side it says: A future to fulfill., 311872=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 269863=I've been staying on campus since Fall 2010. I love it! I wouldn't trade it for nothing. You learn more and get that college feel on staying in the doors. From the pranks in the wee hours of the mornings to the random fire drills., 13409=Albany is a small city so it can take some time to get used to if your not from a small city yourself. It can get cold during late November and early December so please be prepared. Also, you must have transportation because most places are not walking distance., 110324=spring 2012 is my first semester off campus. when i was on campus the dorm life was i say ok. every now and then you would get students partying late make alot of noise outside, but it is ok., 19442=I advise prospective students to apply around October 1 of their senior year. To set yourself apart from the rest I implore that you submit a resume and a 1 page essay of yourself (be creative).}",

Tips for prospective students The most helpful tip I c an give by experience, is to STAY FOCUSED. Being away from home means no parents telling you when to be in or what to do. It is your responsibility to stay focused and not lose sight of the bigger picture. That is earning your degree. I'm not saying don't party... just know how to balance parties,studies,eating and sleeping. Bang for the buck its worth every penny. The only thing i will say is that the financial aid is a little slow with processing. but they work with you in the financial aid office. Am enjoying being here",
