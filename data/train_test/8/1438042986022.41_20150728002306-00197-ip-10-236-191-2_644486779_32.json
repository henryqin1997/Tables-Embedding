    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{774=The Radeon HD 6990M itself has no problem with demanding graphics benchmarks. In the DirectX 11-based 3DMark 11 (1280x720, performance preset, GPU-score) it pulls off 3227 points, just exceeding Nvidia\u2019s top model, the GeForce GTX 580M (3191 points @ Alienware M17xR3). The optically gorgeous Unigine Heaven 2.1 benchmark (1280x1024, high, tessellation normal) favors the Nvidia GPU as usual. 43.8 vs 36.6 fps represents a 20% lead. Whether the GeForce GTX 580M also takes the lead in games will be examined shortly., 61422=After a short look at the returned display values, our euphoria sunk just that much further. With exception of the good brightness (averaging 196.1 cd/m\u00b2) the LG Philips sourced LP173WF1-TLC1 panel gives a weak showing in our tests. Due to the high black value (0.8 cd/m\u00b2) dark areas in games and movies have the tendency to drift into the grey zone. Or, put another way: a saturated black is simply not accessible to the user. Also quite low is the contrast, at 242:1 these numbers are quite poor (high-quality panels are able to reach values of 1000:1). The picture could definitely be better\u2014colors could have used more saturation., 5020=Crunching the raw data, the graphics card is more than impressive: 1700 million transistors, 1120 unified shaders and 2048 MB of GDDR5 memory (256-bit interface) are just a few of the key points. 715 MHz core and 900 MHz VRAM clock speed round out the AMD package. HD-video conversion is helped along with the aid of UVD3 video decoders and HD-audio is carried over HDMI thanks to the HD-audio controller. Naturally, DirectX 11 is supported. The deciding factor against the Radeon HD 6990M is its hearty energy consumption: a 100 Watt TDP means that a good cooling solution must be at hand. The GPU driver was Catalyst version 11.5 (Clevo 8.850.0.0)., 65815=At the moment the configurations are available with a glossy full-HD model that, less surprisingly, has a 16:9 format and features LED backlighting. 1920x1080 pixels are perfect for a 17-inch panel, as there is enough space for working (two windows at once, etc.), 75644=Schenker outfitted our test model with the most expensive of the wireless radios on offer. Bigfoot\u2019s Killer Wireless-N 1103 network adapter (WLAN a/b/g/n, 2.4 and 5 GHz) doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth but counters with a comprehensive software suite. For the hardwired, the standard RJ-45 Gigabit LAN connection allows one to dive in to the limitless expanse of the internet., 45829=The CPU benchmarks endow the Core i7-2760QM with certain bravura. In the Cinebench R10 64-bit single-core rendering test the aforementioned processor sprints right by the much-loved Core i7-2630QM with 5471 points\u2014a 17% gain (4665 points @ MSI GT780R). When multiple cores are being used, the dual-core siblings seem old in comparison. With 19747 compared to 11936 points, the dual-core reference i7-2640M falls 65% behind (XMG P701 PRO)., 80772=For the rather sparsely equipped basis configuration, Schenker is asking 1199 Euro. Those who long after one upgrade or another are quick to land at a measurably higher price: our well-equipped test model (see the specifications sheet on the right hand side) came in at over 2000 Euros., 71429=Those who order the XMG P701 PRO with the OS included need not worry about superfluous software installations. Apart from the free Microsoft Office 2010 Starter, Schenker only provides the drivers necessary for the chosen hardware. As such, after the initial startup the experience is pleasantly smooth. Other manufacturers who take enjoyment in filling up their devices with useless programs should take a page from Schenker\u2019s book.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{160140=The slick racing gaming Dirt 3 was played back-to-back with Crysis 2 with maximum details. 1920 x 1080 resolution, 4xAA and the \"ultra\" preset turned on yielded 40.4 fps. The Radeon HD 6970M had a little more difficulty at these settings with a non-optimal 33.2 fps (Alienware M18x). With a GeForce GTX 580M users are smoothly underway with 44.2 fps, 9% above the Radeon HD 6990M., 331114=The energy requirements lie far above the levels of a typical middle-class notebook. 129 Watts in 3DMark 06 (average) and 204 Watts under load (maximum) deliver the message with maximum clarity. Really surprising to us was the idle-consumption: 53.8-63.5 Watts are, even for a gaming notebook, unnatural at the least. For comparison: the similarly equipped XMG P501 PRO (Core i7-2720QM, GeForce GTX 580M) only uses half as much electricity at idle. As the Radeon HD 6990M doesn\u2019t downclock itself under light load, it could be responsible for the excessive consumption., 364554=Of everything, we were most disappointed by the display. The picture quality remains behind that of our expectations of a 2000 Euro desktop replacement; most of all in the areas of black value, color and contrast. Barebones producer Clevo should follow a clear upgrade path and not upgrade the panels when the whim strikes them. Those who are lucky might find themselves with a better panel post-purchase., 134125=We begin with Crysis 2, one of the current heavyweights when it comes to breaking down hardware. The Ego-shooter includes high-resolution textures and DirectX 11 activated\u2014even high-end graphics cards are sure to break a sweat. When playing at 1920x1080 pixels on the \"ultra\" preset, we arrive at an fps of 29.4\u2014not the most playable experience. Without high-resolution textures, deactivated DirectX 11 and the \"extreme\" preset turned on, the action title runs a bit more fluid\u2014the FRAPS tool returns a result of 33 fps. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GTX 580M managed to be about 10% faster at 36 fps (Alienware M17x R3). The Radeon HD 6970M must contend with circa 30 fps (XMG U700 ULTRA). We therefore recommend the \"very high\" preset., 246480=Hardly a game out there is currently so eagerly awaited as Battlefield 3. Whether a Radeon HD 6990M is best suitable from an optical point of view will have to be shown, though the (indirect) predecessor Bad Company 2 presents the AMD-GPU with a solvable task. High details (incl. HBAO), 4x anti-aliasing, 8x texture filtering and 1920x1080 pixels returns 56.1 fps. Both the GeForce GTX 580M (50.9 fps) and the Radeon HD 6970M (49.7 fps) get the nod here., 224549=The realtime strategy game StarCraft2 is pushed along effortlessly by the Radeon HD 6990M. In the intro to the \u201cFor the Swarm\u201d challenge the AMD graphics card managed 63.5 fps\u2014with 1920x1080 resolution and \u201cultra\u201d preset checked off. The GeForce 580M and the Radeon HD 6970M steam along at a slight weaker 59 fps. One must not worry\u2014a smooth experience is still entirely possible, as each high-end graphics card is well-equipped to handle the intensity of multiplayer skirmishes., 279429=For a notebook GPU the gaming performance of the Radeon HD 6990M is simply phenomenal. Apart from highly demanding titles like Crysis 2 or Metro 2033, modern games with all the bells and whistles are a cakewalk. High resolutions and quality improvements hardly force the graphics card to break step\u2014many gaming PCs will be surpassed by the performance of the XMG P701 PRO., 183936=The most current iteration of the Call of Duty franchise runs very well thanks to lower hardware requirements. With very high details, 4x anti-aliasing, 8x anisotropic filtering and 1920x1080 we arrived at an excellent 90.2 fps. Nivida\u2019s flagship was slightly behind, at 87.3 fps\u2014the difference grows even larger with respect to the Radeon HD 6970M, achieving \u201eonly\u201c74.5 fps.}",
