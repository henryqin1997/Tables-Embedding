The mobile accident recording system 40 includes a GPS receiver-pole 41 including a six-foot pole 2 having GPS unit 3 including a GPS receiver 8A and tilt correction circuitry 20 included in an \u201celectronics box\u201d 8 that can be attached to the upper end of pole 2, an assembly 12 including a computer 14 having a screen 14A attached by a bracket 13 to a mid-portion of pole 2, and either a pointed lower end 2A or a removable wheel assembly 11 including a wheel 11A on the lower end of pole 2. The pointed lower end 2A of pole 2 can be slid into and be secured to wheel assembly 11, if needed. A software calibration routine prompts investigator to attach wheel assembly 11 whenever this is necessary, and also prompts the investigator to take an additional GPS measurement with wheel assembly 11 attached and wheel 11A on the ground, and then uses the results of that measurement to recalibrate GPS receiver-pole 41 for use with wheel 11A rolling on the feature(s) to be measured next.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{61201=This application claims the benefit of prior filed U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/317,713 filed Sep. 6, 2001, now abandoned entitled \u201cACCIDENT EVIDENCE RECORDING METHOD\u201d by Robert E. Smith., 71499=The closest prior art is believed to be indicated in the publication \u201cDevelopment of a Low Cost System for the Automated Documentation of Crash Scenes Using GPS (autoDOCS-GPS)\u201d by Charles Rogers and Darrell Greenlee of Optimus Corporation, presented Jan. 25-27, 1999 at the at The Institute of Navigation (ION) National Technical Meeting conference, Session C1, located at the Catamaran Resort Hotel, San Diego, Calif. The publication describes a system that utilizes a GPS antenna mounted on a survey stake tripod. The antenna is coupled to a GPS receiver, which in turn is coupled to a laptop computer containing software that performs functions of accident scene data collection, post processing of the acquired data into a commercially available CAD package MS Visio\u2122, and report generation using MS WORD., 64872=1. The known on-site \u201cDistance/Angle Measuring Method\u201d is described in \u201cTechnische Analyse von Verkehrsunf{dot over (a)}llen\u201d; Danner/Halm; Eurotax AG 1994, ISBN 3-9520040-5-7 (title engl. transl.: Technical Analysis of Motor Vehicle Accidents) which also includes the sub-variations \u201cTriangular Measuring Method\u201d, \u201cRight Angle\u2014Coordinates Method\u201d and the \u201cChord\u2014Height Measurement\u201d. According to this reference, distances are measured from a centered, fixed point to the various items on the site. There are different applications in use, but all of them go back to the basic idea, wherein distance is measured from a certain point to another and the angle is determined. Later these measurements are transferred and recalculated into real two-dimensional drawings. The angle is measured using a special apparatus to determine the angle by taking aim at the item with a notch. The described method is very insecure, and failures are not detected until the end of the day. Furthermore, it is impossible to add measurements later to the original sketch., 67226=3. The \u201cPhotographic Method\u201d, also described in \u201cTechnische Analyse von Verkehrsunf{dot over (a)}llen\u201d; Danner/Halm; Eurotax AG 1994, ISBN 3-9520040-5-7 (title engl. transl.: Technical Analysis of Motor Vehicle Accidents), differs from the above methods (1) and (2) in that it does not call for on-site measurements. This method derives its measurements from the analysis of photographs taken with a stereo camera (3-D method). The known Video-assisted Accident and Traffic Documentation System from DE 199 52 832 A1 also is in the group of \u201cPhotographic Methods\u201d. This method disclosed in this reference uses reference objects placed on the road to measure distances and angles based on pictures or videos of accident scene. A disadvantage of this technique is that a large amount of time and a large amount of power is needed to analyze these pictures. The user needs to find a way of taking a photograph from a high elevation, with all relevant items at the accident scene appearing in the photograph. Usually, there is no opportunity to perform any analysis or obtain any result thereof while the user is still at the accident site, so all analysis is performed off site. This will cause a situation wherein the analysis shows that important marks cannot be measured when items at the site are gone.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets While the invention has been described with reference to several particular embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will be able to make the various modifications to the described embodiments of the invention without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all elements or steps which are insubstantially different or perform substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same result as what is claimed are within the scope of the invention. For example, a speech producing module and/or a speech recording device can be included in computer 14, and using the speech recording device, the investigator can enter direct voice comments pertaining to a measured point into the same file in which the corresponding GPS data is stored. A speech producing module can supplement and/or replace the prompting by the display associated with computer 14. This is may be important, for example, if the investigator does not wish to carry separate paper on which to make handwritten notes. Although it is necessary that GPS antenna 4 and at least part of the tilt correction circuitry 20 be mounted in fixed relation to pole 2, it is not necessary that the GPS receiver 8A or computer 14 be mounted in fixed relation to pole 2; GPS receiver 8A and/or computer 17 could be carried directly by the investigator or by another person.
