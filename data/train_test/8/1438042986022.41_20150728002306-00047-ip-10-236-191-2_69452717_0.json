The government has also long contemplated how to cut electricity subsidies, which surpass the fiscal burdens imposed by the petroleum subsidies. ...\u00a0See More + This paper estimates the impacts of the 2012 petroleum subsidies reform on household welfare and government revenues. It also simulates the distributional and fiscal impacts from ending subsidies in the electricity sector, where the pricing structure is more complex than petroleum prices. The paper looks at the direct and indirect impacts of reform. Moreover, the paper discusses the political economy considerations of reform. While the full removal of petroleum subsidies would have increased poverty, the compensatory cash transfer program the government instituted is estimated to have fully offset the negative impact for the poorer population. The impact of reforms in the electricity sector will depend significantly on the implementation method chosen. A flat increase of tariffs toward cost recovery will put a huge burden on the poorest households. However, a progressive increase in tariffs will generate substantial savings for the government, even with compensatory mechanisms to mitigate the strong negative impact on the vulnerable population. The immediate compensation of the losers from reform appears to be a crucial factor in the successful implementation of reforms in Jordan.\u00a0 See Less -, 36711=Document Type: Working Paper Report No.: ACS14378 Document Date: JUN 29, 2015, 23064=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7318 Document Date: JUN 22, 2015, 7599=Document Type: Procurement Plan Report No.: 96944 Document Date: JUN 02, 2015, 40454=Document Type: Implementation Status and Results Report Report No.: ISR20002 Document Date: JUL 02, 2015, 39621=The highlights of this Turkey regular economic note for July 2015 are: public spending offset weaker private demand to keep growth solid in the first quarter; despite declining food prices, lira depreciation and increases in oil prices pushed inflation higher; political uncertainty continues after the parliamentary election, creating downside risks to our 2015 growth forecast of 3 percent. ...\u00a0See More + \u00a0 See Less -, 8591=Document Type: Publication Report No.: 97478 Document Date: JUN 03, 2015, 25812=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7334 Document Date: JUN 23, 2015, 11131=Since the 2011 uprising that toppled the former regime, Libya has been mired in deep political strife. An economy in which agriculture once flourished was converted wholesale to an oil-based rentier state of the most extreme kind. ...\u00a0See More + Following the immediate post-revolution oil-consumption boom, in 2014 Libyas economy is in recession. Security is the greatest challenge to stability. Today, limited opportunities exist for reintegrating youth and ex-combatants into the labor market. This policy note provides an initial assessment of Libyas labor market and discusses policy options for promoting employability as part of a broader jobs strategy. It is intended as a contribution to evidence on Libyas labor market for the benefit of policy makers, civil society and the broader international community. The report finds that the overall unemployment rate in Libya increased from 13.5 percent in 2010 prior to the uprising to 19 percent as of 2012, having changed little since then. Youth unemployment stands at approximately 48 percent and female unemployment 25 percent. The vast majority (85 percent) of Libyas active labor force is employed in the public sector, a high rate even by regional standards. The rate for women is even higher (93 percent). Employment in industry (largely the oil sector) and agriculture accounts for only 10 percent of the labor force. While nearly all public sector workers are covered by some form of social insurance, only 46 percent of private sector workers are enrolled - a striking difference. The report further discusses the implications of Libyan jobseeker profiles. Thirty percent of firms have reported difficulty in recruiting qualified Libyan nationals. Only 15-30 percent of Libyas labor force is relatively skilled and likely could be hired readily if given access to basic job training and job search assistance. For the remainder of the unemployed work force, targeted interventions would need to be designed for advanced skills development, vocational training, reconversion, and apprenticeship and entrepreneurship programs. The report discusses options for shifting Libya from a rentier state to a diversified, productive economy through economic and technical partnerships to help accelerate creating economic opportunities and jobs.\u00a0 See Less -, 2451=Document Type: Publication Report No.: 96997 Document Date: JUN 01, 2015, 4759=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7286 Document Date: JUN 02, 2015, 28465=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7336 Document Date: JUN 24, 2015, 15046=Author: Atamanov,Aziz; Jellema,Jon Robbert; Serajuddin,Umar, 6786=Like many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Senegal has struggled to develop its industrial sector in the face of import competition. For basic food products, there is an implicit trade-off between the objectives of maintaining employment and lowering the cost of living, both of which figure prominently in current government policy. ...\u00a0See More + Conflicting pressures have led to a rather inconsistent policy mix of high levels of protection with price ceilings. The products of the three industries examined here\u2014sugar, vegetable oil, and flour\u2014account for roughly 14 percent of the consumption basket of the poor, so distortions in their prices can have a significant effect on poverty reduction. This paper compares domestic prices in Senegal with world prices since 2000, and then explains the difference by examining the protection enjoyed by these industries, along with their market structure. The analysis finds that high protection and market power have resulted in domestic prices which were often two or three times the equivalent world price. Tightening of price ceilings and some liberalization have taken place recently, but consumers have continued to pay above world prices for sugar and edible oil in 2014. The paper estimates that if this differential were eliminated, the purchasing power of households around the poverty line would increase by 3 percent, 227,000 people would move above the poverty line, and the national poverty rate would drop by 1.9 percentage points. The cost to consumers far exceeds the total wage bill paid by these industries. Further liberalization of these industries is recommended, along with phasing out price controls and shifting government policy from protecting traditional enterprises to the promotion of new export-oriented ones.\u00a0 See Less -, 41522=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7376 Document Date: JUL 24, 2015, 20846=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7315 Document Date: JUN 18, 2015, 30521=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7336 Document Date: JUN 25, 2015, 38090=India has a relatively low carbon footprint. A steadily declining carbon intensity over the last decade will further contribute to reduce climate change through voluntary actions. ...\u00a0See More + By 2020, 1,452 to 1,620 million tons of CO2e are projected to emit only from the power sector due to the increase of power demand. Further efforts on the introduction of renewable energies or reduction of the demand have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions against business as usual scenario. Energy efficiency measures must be also promoted and brought up to a scale that permits significant reductions in energy intensity of India\u2019s GDP growth. India intends to propose the following market readiness components: (i) market based instruments beyond a renewable energy certificate mechanism for off-grid renewable and net-metering; (ii) expansion of the Perform Achieve and Trade; and (iii) a mitigation plan to clean up the Ganga river basin. This paper includes components of the technical building blocks of market readiness and role of market instrument(s), and a summary of market readiness priority areas for partnership support.\u00a0 See Less -, 34644=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7343 Document Date: JUN 26, 2015, 12904=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7303 Document Date: JUN 11, 2015, 3909=The Africa Competitiveness Report 2015 comes out at a promising time for the continent: for 15 years growth rates have averaged over 5 percent, and rapid population growth holds the promise of a large emerging consumer market as well as an unprecedented labor force that - if leveraged - can provide significant growth opportunities. ...\u00a0See More + Moreover, the expansion of innovative business models, such as mobile technology services, is indicative of the continents growth potential. However, Africa continues to be largely agrarian, with an economy that is underpinned by resource-driven growth and a large and expanding informal sector. Indeed, more than a decade of consistently high growth rates have not yet trickled down to significant parts of the population: nearly one out of two Africans continue to live in extreme poverty, and income inequality in the region remains among the highest in the world. What is more, across sectors - from agriculture to manufacturing and services - productivity levels remain low. It will be necessary to raise productivity across all sectors of the economy to achieve higher growth and create quality employment, and turn this progress into sustainable inclusive growth.\u00a0 See Less -, 534=Document Type: Viewpoint Report No.: 97914 Document Date: JUN 01, 2015, 32816=Document Type: Policy Research Working Paper Report No.: WPS7338 Document Date: JUN 26, 2015, 38978=Document Type: Newsletter Report No.: 98250 Document Date: JUL 01, 2015}",
