This is the frequency of light the laser cutter uses to cut materials, so it is very ineffective at cutting polycarbonate. Polycarbonate is a poor choice for laser cutting.",

Make has a How-To for identifying unknown plastics with a simple process. Things you should not put in the laser cutter \"Speedy-cut\" rubber Linoleum Chocolate Anodized/coated metal Glass Leather Laptops (check for chlorine in the plastic) Cell phones (check for chlorine in the plastic) Many other fabrics (not moleskin books because they can have high chlorine content) Cotton Wood (careful of fire, treated wood could have additives) Acrylic and several other plastics Paper (cardstock could have additives that should not go in the cutter, test a sample) Things you can put in the laser cutter Turn off the machine when not in use. The air pump gets hot if left on for long periods. It is not quite hot enough to cause a problem, but it will last longer if it is not always on, and turning it off will keep dust from accumulating inside the laser unnecessarily. You don't need to watch the laser every single second, but you should at least stay in the little room while it's on and keep a general eye on it. Why? Because if",
    "textAfterTable": "Tips Before putting your material into the laser cutter, test your image on paper. If you don't test on paper first you will ruin a lot of the material you are cutting. Once it looks good on paper you can place your material on the paper so you know it is positioned properly, and refocus if the material is thick. When engraving raster images, they go much faster if you use a lower DPI. The lowest setting is 250 DPI and that is enough for most things. Use higher DPI only with high resolution images and with materials that show the difference. To Do Build a table and shelves for the laser and laser materials Collect images that are good to use with the laser cutter Cutting power / speeds NYCR's Laser Power table Typing paper - 100% speed, 3 milliamps 2mm acrylic - 25% speed, 8 milliamps 5/8ths inch acrylic - 1% speed, 12 milliamps, 2 passes Plastic with metalic coating - 5 - 7 milliamps rastor, 3 ma vector Linen - 70% speed, 4 milliamps, 1 pass 1/8\u2033 plywood: Regulate the current to just a pinch under 15mA and use 3 Passes / 18.75% Speed / 100% power.
