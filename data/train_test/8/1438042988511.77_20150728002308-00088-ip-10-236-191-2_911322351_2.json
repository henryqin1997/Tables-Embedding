His iconic imagery is found around the world in the form of stickers, posters, and stencils on everything from electrical boxes to billboards. Fairey found his style for art at an early age. His major influences were skateboarding, the images associated with the underground skate scene, his passion for music and the inspiring graphics found in rock, punk, and hip hop album covers. In college his influences broadened further and his art started to reflect world events and their leaders, as well as his own take on pop culture. OBEY Clothing was launched in 2001 when Shepard saw clothing as an opportunity to be creative on many levels and t-shirts as a canvas for his graphics. Because of the diversity of influences, OBEY Clothing addresses many different styles, hitting on looks that are both classic and fashion driven. OBEY Clothing is sold in over 20 countries worldwide., 61378=ESTIMATED DELIVERY (US): Aug 5 to Aug 10 (via standard shipping). Why? Shipping Details}",
