            "Edgewood is tucked back in a very safe corner of Madison and security is on duty 24/7. There is an Edgewood College Sade Shuttle that provides students whom seek a good time a safe and efficient way to return to their rooms on weekend nights. It is a dry campus and the Eagle Alert System allows students to be aware of security threats or even weather alerts.",
            "NONE. Frats are not allowed at Edgewood College.",
            "Creating clubs and activities is easy at Edgewood because of the smaller campus size. There are WAY too many clubs and activities that happen at school to list in this application.",
            "Students who are independent but don't enjoy the HUGE campus setting.",
            "The COR system at Edgewood College is a very important and unique system for their Dominican values. The COR system provides students with a class that assists in advising in education, money, and more importantly, life in the community.",
            "Being a private college, Edgewood College is a little bit on the expensive side. However, it's also one of the cheaper of the private schools in Wisconsin. They love to give out grants and scholarships and allow their students to have numerous options for payment during the semester. It's manageable but you still need quite a bit of money to stay secure.",
            "There are always things to do at Edgewood! There are events put on by RLAB and other student organizations that allow the academic week to be a little less stressful. The very first couple of weeks, you have to be VERY antisocial to not have fun at Edgewood College!",
            "For a college, dining services Phil's Dining and Wingra Caf\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a9, are amazing! Their service is efficient and of top quality. For the most part, there is a healthy array of food options, but that's up to the student if they want the healthy life style. The eating spaces are comfortable and give a very friendly environment.",
            "Dorm life is amazing if you take advantage of your social life. Too often there are students who don't like to go out of their comfort zone and decide to lock themselves in their dorm rooms. At Edgewood, there are so many nice people that encourage people to get out and have fun. I gave it a 4 star ranking because a lot of students like to go home during the weekends making the weekends slow and sometimes boring. However, this will make it easier for studying!",
            "Edgewood is manageable but challenges their students to work as hard as they can. There are so many resources for students to take advantage of! If students fail, they had to try really hard to do so.",
            "Listen, college is about time management and time management alone! Sure there are tough courses, but they're manageable. If you learn how to use your time wisely- especially since Edgewood loves emphasizing writing- you will be a successful college student!",
            "Edgewood College is a very good school for students who are looking for an opportunity that involves a well-rounded education. Edgewood College provides and excellent array or sources for their students in order to assure them that they can be successful! If you want a small, family like community, then Edgewood College would be an excellent choice!"
