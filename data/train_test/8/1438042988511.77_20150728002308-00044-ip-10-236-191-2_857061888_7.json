Thank you for your support. We appreciate everything you've said and done for us during this trying time. Because of this, we have requested that during this trying time, in lieu of flowers, that donations be made here, to NAMI. We don't know if a better mental health care system would have saved our son/brother, but it might help someone else. This is a very personal issue for us, but one which we now understand, through this process, affects so many individuals and families; there are no words for the frustration we all feel when trying to get help for a loved one with a mental illness. Our family has created this donation page in honor of our son and brother, Cameron Collins. As some of you may know,",
