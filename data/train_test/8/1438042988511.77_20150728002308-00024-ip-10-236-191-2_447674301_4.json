The North American star won three events and established a new World Record in the women\u2019s 200m backstroke, in a time of 2:00.03 (the previous world best mark had been set in November 2009 also in Berlin by Japan\u2019s Shiho Sakai \u2013 2:00.18). With this superb result (she also won the 100m free and 100m back), Franklin got the best performance of the meet, with 1003 points. She is the new leader of the women\u2019s overall ranking of this World Cup. Her compatriot Allison Schmitt was also in great shape, earning the gold in the 200m and 400m free \u2013 in the shorter distance, she established a new World Cup record in 1:52.08 (faster than the 1:52.42 set last year by Dutch Femke Heemskerk). Still on the women\u2019s side, Therese Alshammar (SWE) left Berlin with three victories, in the 50m free, 50m and 100m butterfly. The 34-year-old Swede is the runner-up of Franklin in the World Cup classification. On the men\u2019s field, Michael Phelps (USA) was in evidence by winning four races: 200m backstroke, and the three individual medley events. Paul Biedermann (GER) was the fastest in his pet events (200m and 400m free), while Glenn Snyders (NZL) triumphed in the 50m and 100m breaststroke. The best male performer of the meet was Chad Le Clos (RSA), with his 200m butterfly victory in 1:50.15 (971 points). Thanks to this result, he could reinforce his lead of the men\u2019s general ranking.}",
