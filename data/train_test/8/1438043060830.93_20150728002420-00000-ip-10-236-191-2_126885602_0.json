However internally in the manager are a set of directory rules (currently NOT configurable) that determine how a MP3 track is added to the database. Based on that rule the manager will decide which track belongs to what album of which artist. Because the JukeboxMgr cannot automatically figure out which tracks belong to a particular album, you MUST put tracks that belong to oneanother in a subdirectory with the name of the album. If tracks belonging to one album are not put in a special subdirectory, the JukeboxMgr cannot create an album entry. Managing Albums and artists The lowest level are tracks themselves Under artists we find the albums. For those tracks that are not belonging to an album the special album \"Collection\" is created. This also applies for the artist category 'Various'. Also this 'Collection' name can be configured. Volumes contain artist. Artist are entries that correspond to real artists. However often you have also a loose set of tracks that really belong to no album. Therefore a special Artist entry \"Various\" is used. This special entry combines all odd tracks. Actually that name \"Various\" is configurable (but currently not through the UI) Finally, as almost descibed above you have the devices themselves. Devices are scanned automatically from the system configuration. This implies that each devices (even a remotely accessible CDROM) should be",
