Also unexpectedly low down the order was Nico Hulkenberg in the Sauber with the 17th best time, while teammate Esteban Gutierrez was 13th and best of the rookies on the day. Williams, who last year were the surprise package of the season, are on the opposite end of the spectrum as their FW35 is proving to be a dog of a car, hence both Pastor Maldonado (18th) and Valtteri Bottas (16th) struggled at the wrong end of the timing screens. Up next were the Force India pair of Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta, eighth and ninth respectively. Lewis Hamilton, who a day earlier was unwell with an allergy of sorts, was seventh at the end of the day in the Mercedes. Jenson Button was sixth fastest, suggesting that the Woking based squad have uncovered some pace in the McLaren MP4-28. Sergio Perez, who had a minor excursion in the morning, was 11th. Mark Webber was fastest of the Red Bull duo, ending the session fifth, with Sebastian Vettel down in tenth over half second down on his teammate. The Shanghai track rubbered-up in between sessions and as a result Massa\u2019s best time was about 1.5 seconds up on the morning session best set by Nico Rosberg. The Mercedes",
