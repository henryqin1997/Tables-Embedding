            "The parking lots are well lit, and the campus is right across from the police station, and I always feel extremely safe on campus. Students are really well behaved and the college is in a nice location.",
            "There isn't any greek life, really. There is a Phi Theta Kappa organization that focus on scholastics but I don't think there are very many people involved with it.",
            "Students take the clubs and activities very seriously, and those who are involved, are really dedicated. ASG and the Native American Club are the most popular organizations at our campus, and they work hard to make this campus a more fun, enjoyable place to study and learn.",
            "At our campus there is such a vast variety of age groups, races, and religions, that our campus is really ideal for any type of students. Acceptance is a really big part of NMSU-Grants. But academically, there are some really nice programs for nursing and educators, specifically.",
            "There is a cute gazebo where you can eat lunch or study, and the native american club actually rents a house right next to campus to hold their meetings, and students are welcome to make themselves lunch there and study.",
            "The tuition is extremely affordable and the classes are of great quality. The small class sizes allow a lot of help during class, and there are always a few tutors available to help for free in the Student Success Center. And the Snack Shack can be spendy, but I'm telling you, it's worth every cent.",
            "Honestly, there isn't a whole lot to do for fun in Grants in the winter. There is a bowling ally and some restraunts, but that's about it. In the summer, if you're the out-doorsie type, there are some really nice places to camp and hike, and there is even a little lake near by. But Albuquerque is an hour away, and there are countless things to do there.",
            "JJ's Snack Shack is located as you walk in the main entrance, and their Honey-Peanut Butter-Banana Sandwich is out of this world. They sell a variety of really nice foods and they're having more and more healthy foods available each semester.",
            "At this campus there aren't any dorms, and most of the apartment complexes wont accept full time college students.",
            "The classes are challenging, but there are a lot of opportunities to get help from the teachers during class, and there are tutors in the Student Success Center everyday at various hours. And the teachers are always willing to work with you as long as you'll put in some effort to show them that it's worth their time.",
            "If you have questions, try to get to the administration office before noon. After that the faculty have different lunches and it's hard to catch them in the afternoons. Between 3 and 5 are good hours to go, also.",
            "This campus is a really nice, small community, college. The classes promote discussion between students and professors due to the small sizes and you have a great chance of asking questions and getting one on one help each class. The campus has a really nice environment for socializing, studying, and learning."
