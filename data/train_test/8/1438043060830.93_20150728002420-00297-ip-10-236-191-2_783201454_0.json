    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{199311=Although the IRS had an account balance of over $1.6\u00a0million at the end of FY 2004, the HR Connect Program Office billed the IRS for an additional $250,000 for FY 2005 Employee Express System costs.\u00a0 Based on the FY\u00a02004 actual costs, the IRS had sufficient funding in its Employee Express System account to pay for the next 4 years of service.\u00a0 The HR Connect Program Office also billed the other bureaus for FY 2005 Employee Express System costs, even though these bureaus had excess account balances from previous years.\u00a0 The HR Connect Program Office did not consider the amounts the bureaus already had on account with the OPM before requesting additional funding in each of the past 4 years., 216383=The HR Connect Program Office made this error in each year for every bureau it supported.\u00a0 The HR Connect Program Office did not consider that the funds it requested were disproportionately higher than the amounts that had been expended in the prior year. \u00a0In FY 2005, the OPM began charging customers a flat fee of $0.24 per employee per month for all maintenance expenditures including the Help Desk, so the HR Connect Program Office did not make the same mistake in FY 2005., 48493=The Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) and its bureaus are members of the Employee Express User Board. \u00a0Treasury employees use the Employee Express System to make changes to their pay information.\u00a0 Table 1 shows the numbers and types of transactions that Treasury employees initiated through the system during FY 2004., 81476=In January 2005, at the same time we announced this review, the Treasury CIO began a study to determine the feasibility of discontinuing use of the Employee Express System and offering its employees the NFC Employee Self-Service Option as an alternative.\u00a0 Both the CIO study and this audit identified problems that would result if the Treasury converted to the Employee Self-Service Option at this time.\u00a0 Specifically, the NFC Employee Self-Service Option does not allow employees to make changes by telephone, which affects approximately 34,000 IRS employees that do not have access to a computer.\u00a0 In addition, the NFC must complete upgrades to provide Help Desk assistance and document retention, which are already available via the Employee Express System., 230774=In FY 2005, the Treasury decided to consolidate management of the Employee Express System for all Treasury bureaus under the HR Connect Program Office.\u00a0 This decision was made to \u201cimprove service for [the] Treasury as a whole, rather than small [b]ureaus independently trying to address issues.\u201d \u00a0In light of the problems with budgeting and billing for the Employee Express System, we believe the HR Connect Program Office should clearly define its role and responsibilities as manager of the Employee Express System and inform each bureau of its responsibilities., 217030=In addition, in FYs 2002 through 2004, the HR Connect Program Office billed the IRS a total of $842,359 for future system development costs for the Employee Express System.\u00a0 However, approximately $178,400 was actually spent during that time. \u00a0The HR Connect Program Office could not provide documentation supporting the charges to the IRS.\u00a0 A Financial Specialist for the HR Connect Program Office claimed an IRS employee verbally requested that the funds be included for FYs 2002 and 2003.\u00a0 We could not verify this with the IRS because the employee died in 2003.\u00a0 The HR\u00a0Connect Program Office Financial Specialist could not remember who requested additional developmental funding for FY 2004.\u00a0 Table 8 shows the effect of the future development funding on the funding request to the IRS for the Employee Express System., 254270=At the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2004, the Treasury bureaus managed by the HR Connect Program Office had fund balances of $1,763,308.\u00a0 In FY 2005, the Treasury collected an additional $323,300 for a total fund balance of $2,086,608.\u00a0 We compared the beginning-of-year fund balance to the actual FY 2004 cost of the Employee Express System of $397,837 to arrive at $1,688,771 in surplus funds that should be refunded and put to better use., 77927=In February 2003, the NFC added a new feature to its Employee Personal Page called the Employee Self-Service Option, which offered many of the same capabilities as the Employee Express System. \u00a0During our audit of the Treasury\u2019s implementation of the HR Connect System, officials at one Federal Government agency advised us the agency had switched from the Employee Express System to the NFC Employee Self-Service Option. \u00a0The agency switched because, unlike the Employee Express System, the Employee Self-Service Option was offered to NFC payroll customers at no additional charge.\u00a0 In FY 2004, 43 of the 50 agencies serviced by the NFC were allowing their employees to use the Employee Self-Service Option to process pay transactions.\u00a0 This audit assessed whether such a conversion at the Internal\u00a0Revenue Service (IRS) would be cost effective., 82572=As of June 2005, over 34,000 IRS employees did not have email and/or Internet access.\u00a0 In FY\u00a02004, 36,689 (15\u00a0percent) of the 238,236 IRS Employee Express System transactions were completed using the telephone.\u00a0 The NFC Employee Self-Service Option is accessible only via the Internet. \u00a0The lack of email/Internet capability is the primary problem with converting from the Employee Express System to the NFC Employee Self-Service Option. \u00a0Table 2 shows the number of telephone and Internet transactions for Treasury bureaus during FY 2004., 47542=The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Employee Express System was developed in 1994 as a means for Federal Government employees to make changes to their payroll information such as pay allotments and deductions.\u00a0 The Employee Express System interfaces with payroll systems and allows employees to make changes electronically via computer or touchtone telephone, thus avoiding the need for paper forms and involvement of human resources personnel.\u00a0 The Employee Express System was developed and funded by a group of Federal Government agencies (referred to as the Employee Express User Board) with the goal of sharing resources and technology to produce a uniform system for all employees.\u00a0 In Fiscal Year (FY) 2005, 25 agencies used the Employee Express System to service 826,700 employees., 186119=To determine why the fund balances kept on account at the OPM were so much greater than the annual expenditures, we further analyzed the IRS funds on account with the OPM, the Treasury billings for each year, and the actual costs for the Employee Express System for FYs 2002 through 2004.\u00a0 During this time period, the IRS funds on account with the OPM for the Employee Express System increased by approximately $688,300 (75 percent).\u00a0 It appears that, even though the funds on account at the beginning of each of these years were enough to pay for the next year\u2019s costs, the Treasury HR\u00a0Connect Program Office continued to bill the IRS and collect additional funds.\u00a0 Table 6 shows the beginning balances, the amounts billed, and the actual costs for these years., 230361=In January 2005, IRS officials realized the IRS had a large credit balance and requested that the HR\u00a0Connect Program Office advise the OPM to deobligate and return surplus funds.\u00a0 Nonetheless, the HR Connect Program Office did not submit the request to the OPM until May\u00a02005., 145112=In FY 2005, the NFC included the cost of the Employee Self-Service Option as part of its overall payroll services cost, regardless of whether the Option was used by the customer. \u00a0The NFC has a study underway to separately charge for certain applications, such as the Employee Personal Page and the Employee Self-Service Option, to more accurately bill its customers.\u00a0 The NFC anticipates having this capability in FY 2006.\u00a0 Depending upon the services selected, the new price structure could change Treasury payroll service costs. \u00a0The NFC does not expect the costs offered under this structure to be available until September 2005 and could not provide any preliminary cost data for the Employee Self-Service Option., 144172=The Treasury also has concerns regarding other limitations of the Employee Self-Service Option, including its inability to provide proof of health insurance coverage if a health insurance card is not received before the effective date and lack of the option to make contributions and/or change contributions to the Combined Federal Campaign during its open season. \u00a0The NFC advised us that the Employee Self-Service Option will be able to provide proof of health insurance coverage by January 2006.\u00a0 The NFC does not have any plans to develop an option to make or change contributions to the Combined Federal Campaign, but it may consider this option in the future., 201824=The OPM worksheet advised agencies to estimate the cost for Help Desk calls by assuming an average of 5 minutes for each call, at a cost of $0.50 per minute.\u00a0 Agencies could then estimate the annual charges by using the number of calls made in the prior year.\u00a0 However, instead of using the number of calls made, the HR Connect Program Office estimated the bureaus\u2019 Help Desk costs by using the number of minutes from the prior year and then multiplied that by 5 minutes.\u00a0 This resulted in an overestimate of charges by approximately 500 percent.\u00a0 Table 7 shows the effect of this mathematical error on the amount the HR Connect Program Office billed the IRS for Employee Express System costs for FYs 2002 through 2004., 201224=Each year, the OPM provides its Employee Express System customers with a worksheet for estimating costs for the next fiscal year.\u00a0 Prior to FY 2005, Employee Express System costs were itemized into specific services, such as maintenance charges, telephone access, PIN changes, and Help Desk calls.\u00a0 The HR Connect Program Office completed the worksheet for each bureau and prepared a billing document based on the estimated costs.}",
