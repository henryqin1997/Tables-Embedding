The value of this variable specifies the number of pages in page pool and is used to optimize access to the disk. The default value of this variable is 1024 and this means that up to 4Mb of the operating memory will be used for caching the database file data. Increasing this value will improve the performance unless the size of the used virtual memory exceeds the size of the available physical memory and then swapping starts.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "JDBCbench (TPC-B) This test was taken from the MM MySQL JDBC Drivers site: http://mmmysql.sourceforge.net/dist/JDBCBench.java. It was slightly changed to adopt it for Consus (which has no fixed length strings). JDBCBench uses a simple update-intensive transaction to load the system to be benchmarked. This workload reflects the database aspects of applications such as servlets and intranet applications, but does not reflect the entire range of transaction processing requirements characterized by multiple transaction types of varying complexities encountered in OLTP and data-mining applications. It is derived from the TPC-B benchmark available from the TPC (www.tpc.org). The single transaction type provides a simple, repeatable unit of work, and is designed to exercise the basic components of a database system. Performance results are listed in the table below.
