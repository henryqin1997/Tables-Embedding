Even though it's early days for him yet, it's safe to say there won't be many more occasions when he walks in at 23 for 7 as he did against Pakistan in the final. He made only 16 but survived more balls, 34, than the top six put together. He's a gutsy competitor and a tidy wicketkeeper who, on early evidence, is impressive standing back to the quicks and also nimble keeping to the spinners.
