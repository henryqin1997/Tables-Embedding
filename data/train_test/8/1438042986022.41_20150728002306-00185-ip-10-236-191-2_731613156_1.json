In 1986 she took the 100 and 200 metre breaststroke titles at the Commonwealth Games, in addition to a silver medal in the 4x100 metre medley relay (alongside Jane Kerr, Donna McGinnis, and the non-Olympian Barbara McBain), and then went on to win bronze in the 200 m breaststroke at the World Championships, behind Silke H\u00f6rner of East Germany and Tanya Bogomilova-Dangalakova of Bulgaria. In both tournaments she earned the distinction of being the youngest medalist ever and, in the latter, she was the only Canadian woman to reach the podium. She followed up these accomplishments by winning four medals at the 1987 Pan Pacific Championships: gold in the 100 m breaststroke, silver in the 200 metre individual medley and the 4x100 m medley relay, and bronze in the 4x200 m freestyle relay.
