The gases flow probed according to one embodiment of the present invention enables accurate flow rate measurements to be made without condensation affecting the sensor. In part this increased accuracy is also due to the locating system which ensures correct alignment of the flow and/or temperature probe in the gases flow. Due to the ability to accurately sense flow rate with this flow sensor, the control systems according to the present invention are able to provide a gases flow to the patient which is controlled to a required humidity. The flow rate sensor also enables \u201cautomatic\u201d control to be achieved whereby the user is not required to constantly monitor the output of the humidifier and to alter inputs to achieve desired changes, the user is merely required to inform the humidifier of the patient's gases delivery situation and the humidifier is able to provide the required gases temperature and humidity without further user input The humidifier also displays a gases temperature value which is clinically relevant to the gases reaching the patient. In addition, the respiratory humidification according to other preferred embodiments of the present invention encompasses various safety improvements over the prior art. If it is found that",
