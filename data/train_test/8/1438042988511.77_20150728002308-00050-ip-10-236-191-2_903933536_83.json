            "The campus has it's own police department and state troopers are located nearby.",
            "Mostly all greeks are represented on campus. some with be returnig soon once clearance is approved.",
            "Fraternities, Sororities, and the Band are the most popular. Student government association and Spit knowledge host special events and motivational speakers",
            "Students that are truly focused on studying only. People interested in joining a Frat or Sorority or even the band. And those persons interested in athletic events",
            "The barber shop/Church/night club aka the Newman Center has special events for the college crowds. I'm not kidding this hall hosts everything when they are not cutting hair.",
            "As far as education, this will be one of the best universities for the price. City life around the camups is a big negative.",
            "Attending Hump Day is usually a welcomed event. That's when the Greek Fraternities stomp the yard for the large crowd of students. The athletic games are usually a plus. And watching the band practice is always fun.",
            "Food options are limited on campus even if your have a meal plan. Special diets must be pre-arranged. The restuarants near the campus are extreemely scarce. There are no real choices off campus for those on special diets; vegeterians, religious purposes etc.",
            "I stayed off campus but was able visit friends from time to time. The rooms are on the smaller scale but large enough provide a comfortable study environment.",
            "Classes are not difficult however, you must maintain a system of time management and study groups. One can easily become distracted with campus extra curricular events.",
            "Paricipate in campus life by getting involved in course related interest groups in order to broaden your knowledge in your field of study. If you are an out of state student or if you don't qualify for financial aid look for on campus jobs immediately. Unfortunately, employment is limited in the City of Prairie View.",
            "The Mayor, Frank D. Jackson, the University President, George C. Wright and the Administrative Staff all have been truly trust worthy and highly respected. The professors are very supportive. They encourage the students to do their best, inspiring them to acheive their goals."

On a scale from 1-10, 10 being the highest, I would rate the school a 10. I can't wait until the fall of 2012 to go to school at PVAMU., 630617=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 229437=They can be a little unorganized. When I applied in 2011, they lost all of my paperwork and I had to pay money to everything sent again. The staff can be a little rude., 114481=For me it is safe. I'm an architect major and at times I'm in the architecture building at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning and I've walked back to my dorm room across campus worry free. Just lookout for the skunks because they will spray you. Also during the events they do have security outside the gates of the dorm rooms to make sure that the people that are trying to get into the dorm areas actually live there., 19039=I have visited this campus several times because I was interested in attending it in the Fall of 2009. This faculty that I have spoken with pretended like they wanted to assist me with enrolling but each time that I have attended I leave not knowing much more than when I visited. I'm very frustrated and feel that they do not want me as a student. You have to jump through hoops to get any info and they really act like they don't care. I am now looking at going to another college because of this., 607517=With the new recreational center being put up this January I plan to be in there lifting often, But as of now basketball and some on campus activities such as salsa night are fun things to do.}",

It's location is also another reason that Prairie View A&M University is so family oriented. However, when choosing this University, you're in for a journey, a wonderful journey at that.
