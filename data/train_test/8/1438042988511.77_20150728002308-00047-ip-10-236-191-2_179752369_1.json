Compete full-extension, all-out dive to snag a sinking liner and preserve the Nats' 3-2 lead. Is this guy really not going to make the team? I know he's got options, but there's a lot of stuff he can do to help the Nats on a nightly basis, even if he's coming off the bench. Is this guy really not going to make the team?Well said Mark. Stairs and Nix over Bernadina? Rizzo said more athletic and you can put Bernadina at the top of that list!}",
