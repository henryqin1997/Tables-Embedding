(Friday July 24 2015), 14940=Nothing Short About Long Deal (Tuesday July 28 2015), 26786=Work has started on re-locating the players` tunnel at Turf Moor. It is about time too considering the disadvantage over the years of the home side coming out from the current tunnel in the middle of the David Fishwick stand to a hostile reception. The David Fishwick stand of course houses the away contingent. Turf Moor is the only ground where this situation occurs either in the Premier League or Football League! There were ambitious plans the last time Burnley were promoted to the top flight back in May 2009 and it was proposed at one stage to rebuild the changing rooms in the corner of the Jimmy Mac and James Hargreaves but those plans died a death along with the general ambitious redevelopment plans at Turf Moor put forward by then Chief Executive, Paul Fletcher. The new tunnel will now be built in the corner of the stadium, between the David Fishwick away end and the James Hargreaves Stand. Co-chairman John Banaszkiewicz talking about the new tunnel said: \"We`re working on a lot of infrastructure projects. There`s a few cosmetic changes going on which will be really good for when the fans come back.\"}",
