Jean Pukacz, the son of the rich Karol Pukacz had an eye on Liesl but she wouldn't \u0093bite,\u0094 since he was a Pollak. Karol Pukacz, the richest \u0093chasiernik\u0094 (pig dealer) knew of his son's \u0093quirk\u0094 and visited Frosie to see if it wasn't time to get serious. When Frosie told him to \u0093get lost,\u0094 came the row and Jeamik [Jean?] told everyone who wanted to know that Frosie roasted the seeds with pig schmaltz and so vertarfit [made unclean, unkosher?] the entire city. But now that the Pukaczes wouldn't sell her any more pig schmaltz, she was no longer queen of the pumpkin seeds. Frosie laughed like always and on the next Friday, the Appricosen (freethinking Jews) came to her stand and purchased her entire supply. When Pukaczes snooped around to find out where she obtained her pig schmaltz, they were annoyed to find out that Frosie herself had started to keep pigs and therefore no longer had to depend on the good will of the Pukaczes. Neither the rabbinate or the Pukaczes could trip up Frosie and with time she even got Jewish \u0093retailers\u0094 who would buy entire sacks from her and resell them as kosher goods. Frosie was and remained the queen of the pumpkins seeds and so remained until the outbreak of the war in 1914., 51024=Copyright \u00a91999-2014 by JewishGen, Inc. Updated 01 Apr 2006 by OR, 16735=For this reason General Gartenberg built his own mint and had his own money minted and pressed local mercenaries into his army. In this way, he extended his position of power to the Pruth River where he pressed the Turks hard and later drove them out (1768-74 see Brockhaus). The mercenaries as well as the local farmers and the Jewish merchants who had come with him had difficulty pronouncing the name of the general and so the name was translated into Russian. Sad (garden), Gora (mountain) and this name stuck for the general as well as the town. And Sada Gora[3] became with time a pulsating center of life., 19048=Through the constitution of March 4, 1849, the Jews were granted full equality with the confessors of the Christian religion. And the federal law of December 21, 1867 granted full political rights both on a state and a local level for the Jews. In the light of these circumstances improvements were made to the Rabbi's palace in Sadagora, several magnificent structures being added. The palace built in half-timbered style with richly flower filled gardens and the elegant carriages gave the court the stamp of a little Vatican. Across from the palace was built the splendid klaus [prayer house] with its refined richly furnished interior which left nothing to wish for., 20915=At celebrations, the Schalasch (a special space for Chassidic festivals) was in demand. A unique structure with a sliding roof mounted on wheels which provided a radical means of providing ventilation in the hall and then could be \u0093wheeled\u0094 back to its normal position. The inner room which seated about 1000 people was built like an amphitheater with the seating rising to the back of the space \u0096 and the table at which the Tzaddikim and their Chassidim ate filled the entire length of the hall. One could write a book about the seating order, ritual ceremonies, order of precedence, scherajim (leftovers from Rabbi's meal) and the games the Chassidim played., 32535=Until the outbreak of war in 1914, Sadagora existed so to speak in the shadow of Czernowitz. This unholy war caused the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire, destroyed our Vatican and scattered the Tzaddikim dynasty. The ruins of the palace remind us that once happiness and wellbeing reigned here.}",

Now listen, brother to the new song \u0096 I strum the strings. But the guilds from Harom-Am to the smallest pirates. Not only the men of weapons, not the aristocrats. Which only Sadagora and otherwise no other city was in a position to recognize. Otherwise he would be able to name the ancient names. Proves that the cradle of the singer was never in Sadagora. And in that, one recognizes the horse's foot and makes the song a shame. Only Jews and Jews \u0096 and Jewish culture, which feels on reading, somehow not right The songs tell the wonderful tale that there was no Christian there. The strong orthodox dynasty of the servants dedicated to God. The songs echo so wonderfully from the palace of the famous rabbis. About the little Jewish city \u0096 there on the Pruth. They wanted to part the fog. Setting Things Right Poets and writers sang about the rubble that once was Sadagora.",
