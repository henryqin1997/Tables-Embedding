    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{24467=Mark Hughes has completed his third signing of the summer so far, as England goalkeeper Rob Green has agreed a two year deal at Loftus Road. The 32-year-old will officially join QPR on July 1st when his current contract at West Ham expires. Numerous keepers have been linked with a move to QPR since the end of last season; however Green`s reluctance to sign a new contract at Upton Park prompted Hughes to swoop for the experienced shot-stopper. Green, who is currently with the England squad at the European Championships in Poland and Ukraine, has made nearly 500 club appearances throughout his illustrious career and brings with him a wealth of experience both on and off the field. The Rs gaffer told www.qpr.co.uk: 'It was important we brought another quality keeper into this group. Rob is obviously someone with vast experience at international and Premier League level and his pedigree speaks for itself.` 'He`s got all the characteristics of a top keeper and he`ll be a huge addition to the squad`. Green, who was previously at Norwich before moving to West Ham, spoke of his delight at joining the Rs: 'I`m delighted to be here. I`m excited about the challenge ahead and hugely encouraged by the direction in which the owners and Mark Hughes are looking to take the club.` 'It`s an exciting period for everybody connected to QPR and I can`t wait to get started`. The arrival of Green could finally see the departure of current number 1 Paddy Kenny, who has been linked with a move to Leeds United, where he would reunite with former gaffer Neil Warnock, who he played under at Sheffield United, Bury and of course QPR.
