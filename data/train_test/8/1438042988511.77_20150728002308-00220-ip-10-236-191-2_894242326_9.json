            "Safety is wonderful. They are always around and show up in minutes if anyone is in danger. A small campus so they make the students feel safe.",
            "A few greek fraternities on campus. There is no pressure to join them and they are not obnoxious. A very good balance of them between school life and greek life.",
            "There are plenty of different clubs on campus but only for those kids who are really into theater. The theater runs the school while kicking all the other activities under the bus. The theater program is quite impressive though, very together.",
            "Theater students and pre-med students is what its best for. Kids who are very individualistic. Creative minds.",
            "The school is over priced in my opinion. The quality of the teachers is worth it but for the price of facilities and food options its not worth it. They do put all of the money towards education which is most important but still over priced.",
            "Many bands come to Muhlenberg from off campus so seeing the show is excellent. Also seeing the bands, chorus groups and theater plays is fun too.",
            "Pretty good food. Only one dining hall so the food could get a little bland but it is pretty high quality for a college campus.",
            "I rated this a 3 because you never know who you are gonna room with and who is gonna be on your hall. It could be higher for you or lower for depending on the people around you. I personally would give mine a 5 because I got lucky with a great roommate and hall mates.",
            "It all depends on what classes you take. All the teachers are very highly skilled, thats why it is so expensive. Also I rated it 4 stars because it has a 43% acceptance rate so you should expect the course rigor to be somewhat difficult.",
            "Ask about scholarship opportunities. Figure out if you like a small school that is more interested in the arts than sports.",
            "Small sized, easy to get around school. Good academic support if you ask for it. Friendly student body."

A great portion of each incoming class does apply early decision which is wonderful because that means most everybody at Muhlenberg is at their first choice school and is truly passionate about being there. Don't panic though! Muhlenberg's early decision deadline isn't until February 1st, only two weeks before regular decision. This gives you plenty of time to truly decide if Muhlenberg is the place for you. Also, visit the campus and make contact with professors, students, coaches, etc. as often as you can. The Admissions Office takes note of every time you make an effort to show interest in the school and it reflects very well on your application!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I am so lucky that I know I have most certainly picked the best place for me to spend my college career! In my opinion, Muhlenberg College could not be more perfect. They have an extensive arts program and a heavy emphasis on strong academics. There are so many opportunities like ways to get involved on campus and in the community, places to go abroad, research projects in conjunction with professors, independent studies, and more. The campus is small enough that you feel very 'at home', yet without feeling suffocated. There are several other colleges right in the same area, plus Philadelphia is only an hour away. I have already made friends that I know will last a lifetime and built relationships with many professors. My classes are interesting, engaging and will aid my greatly in 'the real world' after graduation. Housing is guaranteed all four years, yet the college helps you take steps to adjust to eventually being on your own. I really could not ask for more from Muhlenberg. Am learning a lot I am definitely learning a lot at Muhlenberg College. The academics here are very strong, but not in a competitive way. The professors are kind and personable; they demand the best of you, but, with the average class size being just nineteen students, you are",
