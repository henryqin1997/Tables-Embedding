Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 31146=Anyone that rips into Maya is crazy. You can see some good things about him and in his fourth game what happens, he has one bad stretch. Other than the one bad stretch not bad for a guy who was in prison a year ago and has pitched a total of (I think) 5 minor league and 4 major league games.Honestly if this is May and he has had 6 to 10 starts and still having the problem I would agree. But just like anything else, he needs to get adjusted with everything and have a full spring training.I will be anyone that come April we will be very happy to have him on the team., 32347=This is the business we've chosen (cue music and fade to black)\u2026Despite the game results, was nice to meet Mark and Mrs. Z. as well as JaneB, LoveTheNats, and a couple of Anonymi before the game. Sorry to have missed those of you who arrived later. My hubby and I were sitting with friends in the swanky club seats today \u2013 niiice. Tomorrow it's back to the Veeckian Upper Deck for us. Hope that the Nats can get back to their winning ways then. Oh, and I would tend to agree with NatsJack, JaneB, and Golfersal re. Maya.In closing I will say to Mark and Mrs. Z., in the words of a baseball immortal, thank you for making this day necessary. :-)\u2014Don Hammack said\u2026 Why do I picture something like the scene from Don Corleone's office during the wedding happening in the upper deck at Nats Park? Lots of ring kissing, envelopes of money. September 25, 2010 4:56 PM, 40082=um, what are the Marlins? ;-)\u2014BinM said\u2026 @Don Hammack: Agreed, but who played Luca Brasi in today's passion play? September 25, 2010 7:56 PM, 22020=Anon, Kennedy needed to cover 2nd on that play I thought.With that odd shift? Nope, Desmond blew it again.Which is why Espinosa everyday looks more and more like your starring shortstop come the end of ST 2011., 26769=Worth repeating \u2026NatsJack in Florida said\u2026Anonymous 3:35\u2026.. Yunesky Maya is pitching the equivalent of the last days of Spring Training after a 16 month layoff\u2026.Hold off on your opinion until April of 2011., 22866=Looks like Harper ROY_2014, MAYBE. Not 2012 \u2026, 52320=A.J. \"Morris, who became the first Wildcat since Craig Wilson in 1992 to earn first team All-American status, is the first [K. State] Wildcat to be named a finalist for the Golden Spikes Award.\"Dustin Ackley (North Carolina), Mike Leake (Arizona State), Kent Matthes (Alabama) and Stephen Strasburg (San Diego State) joined\"Morris as Gold Spikes finalists. Strasburg won it., 40855=Tough game to watch today. Maya was OK till he was clearly out of gas in the 6th and Riggs didn't get him after 4 straight balls, then a couple more that the hitter helped by swinging and then a wild pitch to the wall. I don't understand why it took Riggs till after the HR to pull him. We might have had a chance till then. We really must wait till spring for both Maya and Marquis. It would be nice to have some good surprises come April!!Harper is still a high school player. He has much to learn about pro baseball and hitting the curve. He will be outstanding but rushing him and putting too much on his shoulders will be tragic. I hope to see Flores make the trip North in March and Harper head to AA Potomac. AAA in 2012. I hope to see Stras work back slowly, maybe a September call-up maybe not. I think Zimmermann came back to soon. Don't get on Rizzo, he has done a great job so far with what he has to work with. The Nats must sign Dunn and look for a front of the rotation guy even if they have to trade some young guys away. Without that we will only improve slightly next season. It is not as if all of the free agents are jumping at the chance to play here!, 17626=Anonymous 3:35\u2026..

My wife and I will be watching from Section 409 in the upper deck. Many of you have already said you'll be stopping by to say hello. Hope many more of you can make it as well. We're hoping to be in our seats by 12:15 p.m. in case people want to come by pregame and then head back to their regular seats in time for first pitch. Of course, everyone's welcome to stay up in 409 and watch the game with us (provided you're not taking up someone else's paid seat).}",
