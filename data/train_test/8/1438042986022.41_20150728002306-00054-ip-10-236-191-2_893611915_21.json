            "The food is good, they have 4 separate dining areas and are building a new one as well. They have lots of variety.",
            "I don't live on campus but my friends who do seem to like it.",
            "Bio majors are expected to take 2 sciences, calculus, english, and two science labs their first year, it just gets harder. But then again, communication majors and business majors have an easier load so it depends on what your major is.",
            "Make sure you visit the school before deciding to go there and see if its a right fit for you, ask the admissions counselor a lot of questions regarding the classes you'll be taking, the workload, etc. so you won't be surprised when you take your first classes.",
            "Manhattan is a very small school which means you get individual attention in all your classes since they're less than 30 students each. They expect highly of you so you can't really mess up because they expect you to be on top of your work as well. Overall, its been a bittersweet journey so far but I really like it here."

Cafe 1853 is a good place to study and order food which is brought out to your table., 132547=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 5865=3 1/2 The price is high, in my opinion, and though you are in an excellent area (in a great neighborhood, so conveniently close to the city), the price isn't quite worth it. I feel I'm getting a very good education and I love being able to visit the city. I also have a nice room and my building is well-maintained. However, I am forced to pay for a mandatory dining plan, which I barely ever use. They also have a spring consolidation process in which students who are currently without a roommate have to find someone else without a roommate to consolidate with (ie. one of you has to move in with the other). The only other two options are to be forced to move out of your room into someone else's who doesn't have a roommate or pay over $1500 to remain as a single. I really can't understand the point of this other than to make more money., 90341=There is a quad , where people would sprawl out and take in sun. There was mass at 7:30 every Sunday., 44480=hey my name is daba and i want to study abroad but my family have not money for register me as the result i want and hope to get scholarships from you in the fall 2012 and spring 2013 thank you to accept me}",

Tips for prospective students I suggest that if you are extremely eager to get to New York city, but don't know how and don't live in a place with good access to it, you should look into this school. However, that desire has to be very, very high on your list of priorities, or it really just isn't worth it. Also, in order to be happy here, you have to be very outgoing and make friends easily, as people are very extroverted but not very eager to go out and make new friends. Most people on campus are athletic, so that will help you fit in more. Again, if location isn't one of the very top priorities in you college decision-making processes, don't come here. I know quite a few people who have transfered or want to, so you should be willing to",
