The dining room seems empty due to the food. There are times were the food is actually food but most of the time it is not. Sad fact is the price is about 1200 for a meal plan which is also over priced for food you cannot stand to eat three times a day seven days a week., 9447=All the professors here know how to teach students very well and keep learning interesting. I have a really awesome professor for History 1302, who I chose again for enjoying his 1301 class last semester, who constantly challenges us and keeps us interested. My English 1301 teacher is also my 1302 teacher because I chose to have him again. These are only two professors out of many and I am looking forward to meeting the rest and learning all that I can from them. Practically every teacher here has written a book on their studies and have earned their doctorates, so they are definitely credible in my opinion., 84292=The dorm life is ridiculous. The prices are too high. paying 3300 for a dorm is just a little too much and that is for the nicest one. Also the fact the the cheapest is about 1800 and honestly should be a lot less for what your living in. The room is not even up to date to be at that price. That is more than taking a full schedule of classes which does not seem right., 4518=I not sure yet I start Aug. 2009, 255971=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 13 out of 20 people found this review useful. 2 people found this inaccurate. 2 of 61 Categories Comments Great for these types of students I not sure yet I start Aug. 2009 Tips for prospective students Yes, since this campus must be the cheapest because it is associated with the community colleges. Will enjoy being here The only downfall is that it is not much internet based. I really need more internet classes. Will learn a lot This is a small based campus. I do expect to learn since there are going to be small classes. Login to rate or flag the reviews Preston from Portland, TX 03/15/2011",
