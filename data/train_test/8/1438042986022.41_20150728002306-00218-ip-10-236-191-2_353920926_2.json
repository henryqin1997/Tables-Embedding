(Friday July 24 2015), 31193=It`s the third round of the Carling Cup on Tuesday night with the Clarets facing a juicy test against Premier League opposition. Fulham, currently 10th in the top flight are the visitors. Burnley will be hoping to emulate their rivals Blackburn Rovers who managed to defeat the Cottagers 1-0 in their league game on Saturday at Ewood Park and indeed will also be keen to keep their excellent record against Fulham at the Turf intact. The Clarets have played Fulham 43 times at Turf Moor recording 31 wins, 7 draws and just 5 defeats. You have to go back to the 1981/82 season for the last time Fulham got anything from Turf Moor and that was only a draw 2-2. We played Fulham the last time in the FA Cup in the 2002/3 Season. Stan Ternent`s men got a well earned 1-1 draw away to Fulham on the 16th February 2003 and followed this up ten days later with a thumping 3-0 victory against the Premiership side at Turf Moor. There are three big questions ahead of this game as far as the Clarets are concerned: 1.Will Chris Eagles be selected in the starting eleven for this game? There is no question that the team have done better since Eagles was out of the team, suspended for three matches following his red-card against Plymouth at Turf Moor although Burnley are now on a run of six league games without defeat. However the Clarets do seem to have a settled eleven and for that matter sixteen so will Eagles struggle to regain his place? Owen Coyle may well be tempted to select the 'name` purely to give Fulham something to think about in view of Eagles Premier League experience with Manchester United. On the other hand would that be fair and who would we drop? Wade Elliott in particular seemed to struggle in the team with Eagles selected but now seems to be back of form. I suspect Coyle could be tempted to name Eagles on the bench and see how things go. 2.What formation will we play? Will we be more defence minded against Premier League opposition, maybe playing 4-5-1 or more likely 4-1-4-1 with Alexander keeping his holding role in front of the back four or will Coyle look to be more attack minded and play more 4-3-3 or 4-4-2? I suspect we could see many formations in the same game depending how play unfolds but I hope we take the game to Fulham and show some attacking flair. 3.Argueably Steven Jordan cost us the two points in our last game against Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday after their last minute equaliser in injury time. Could Christian Kalvenes previously injured but now understood to have recovered reclaim his spot in the starting eleven or will Coyle keep his faith in Jordan? Some headaches therefore for Coyle in terms of team selection but let`s hope he gets it right and we can cause an upset and progress to the fourth round.
