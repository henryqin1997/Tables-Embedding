The CAG trinucleotide encodes glutamine and polyglutamine expansions cause cell death in selective areas of the brain. Huntington polyglutamine repeats have the tendency to form aggregates which are observable in later stages of the disease. The exact nature of the aggregates, whether toxic, protective, or insignificant, is unclear. A stable PC12 cell line containing a gene fusion of Exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene linked to GFP under the control of the inducible ecdysone promoter were used as the cell-based model of Huntington Disease for high throughput screening. Exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene contained an expansion of 103 polyglutamines (Q103) which, when expressed, caused cell death and distinct, bright GFP aggregates. The amount of cell death and the size and intensity of GFP aggregates increased over time and induction level. The cell death were quantified with a measurement of ATP content in the cells. A maximal 40-50% of cell death was",
