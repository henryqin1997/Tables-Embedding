The lock strategy used by this cache is the 'no-lock' strategy, which does not perform any locking. The defaultTTL used is of 1s, meaning that by default dynamic revision result will be stored and used for one second. TTL rules then define that all 'latest.integration' revisions will be stored and used for 200ms, while other dynamic revisions from org1 org2 and org3 modules will be stored respectively for 10 minutes 20 seconds; 5 hours; and 2 days and 12 hours. :: Home :: Download :: Documentation :: Get Involved :: Search :: Copyright \u00a9 2011 The Apache Software Foundation, Licensed under the Apache",
