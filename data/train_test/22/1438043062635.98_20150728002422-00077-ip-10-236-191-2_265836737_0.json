Densely populated and found within cosmopolitan inner cities and areas on the outskirts of major towns, these are mainly young neighbourhoods comprising couples and singles. Many are students or those on the lower rungs of the career ladder, employed in a mix of professional, white collar and manual occupations. They are credit hungry and we start to see evidence of poor payment histories increasing their credit risk. Area Profile Data",
