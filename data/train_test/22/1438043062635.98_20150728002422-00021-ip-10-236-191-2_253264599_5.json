The dict is still loaded, but after restart you can work without corrective mode, because the the corrective mode is dependend on the dictionary.

    "textAfterTable": "Icons are created by hand in a 25x25 PNG with the GIMP according to color picker values of flags in Wikipedia. The reason for this is, that no rescaling or ant-alias artifacts will emerge in this small raster. Subsequently, import this in Inkscape and type the characters. Note that for keyboard layout that are not connected to a single particular country, like Persian, no flag backgrouns is needed. Each character is typed twice in Arial Black or bold Arial. For alphanumeric, use the ABC of that language, for 'QWERTY' use the 6 first characters on the top row, note that for languages that read from richt to left is to use 'first'/last 6 characters on the right side. One characters is white with a black border of 0.5 and one is black without border but with a blur of 15 (see CTRL+SHIFT+F slider at the bottom). Reposition the whole lot and put everything in the correct layer. Export a 25x25 PNG with the background bitmap, which is also the selected export area, and you are done. Here is a video of this procedure. TODO: Rasterman, can you verify this and improve this procedure where needed? Especially improve details on which font to use and which Gaussian blur to use.
