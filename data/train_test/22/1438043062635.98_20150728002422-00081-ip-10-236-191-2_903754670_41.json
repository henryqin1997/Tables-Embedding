            "Campus safety? It is so high! Campus cops are always out roaming, there's a 'Saferide' system for when people are too intoxicated to drive, or just need a safe ride home on a creepy night. The campus cops are so helpful, they will let you into your car if you locked your keys in it, they'll jump your vehicle if you have a dead battery, they will even air up your tires if they're a little low! Almost no one is ever out alone, and there are enough well lit places to get around on campus safely in someone's sight. It is an extremely comfortable campus.",
            "Music students really succeed here, the faculty are excellent, and superbly talented. The nursing program is quite successful, and graphic design, I've heard, is a really good major to go into here. There is no culinary way of going about things here, which really sucks, but honestly Fort Hays offers so many other things. The study environment is great, if you enjoy small class sizes, this school is for you, my biggest class is marching band, with 140 participants. (That's inevitable). My biggest actual class only has 23 students in it. The teacher to student ration is fantastic here. You can always meet up with your instructor, advisor, anyone, they almost always have a way of making time for you. It's really easy to contact and talk to people too.",
            "New traditions are being made all the time, but at the moment there's a thing that everyone on campus participates in. It's called Fancy Fridays or TGOF. Everyone either dresses up really fancy, or wears school colors :). The community also gives discounts to students wearing gold on Fridays as well. There are some really cool places on campus too, like we have a bridge crossing campus, and there's this little place underneath it that's really foresty, and there are some half-hidden stairs to get down there, and it's just really awesome, and a cool place to hang out. My dorm has a game room, with pool tables, air hockey, foosball, frisbees, etc. There is also a LOT of artwork around campus. Outside almost every building is some sort of statue or art. There's also this big grassy area called the Quad in the middle of campus with lots of trees and sidewalks, and for activities on campus? They advertise with sidewalk chalk! That's pretty cool.",
            "There are SO many organizations on campus, and if you find something lacking, you could start your own organization. With how busy I am, usually just spending a little time with friends is how I have fun. I also go to concerts and brought in entertainment on campus. And the partying? I know that it does go on, but the people I hang out with and myself do not party. Movies are also a great source of entertainment, when you have time for them.",
            "There is a cafeteria in the bottom of McMindes hall that has smart and healthy food choices available every day. The food sometimes isn't that great, but honestly what cafeteria food is? There is also the student union on campus, which has a Starbucks, Pizza Hut/Wing Street, a Tiger Market (which provides two different food options every weekday), then a hamburger and chicken grill, and a huge salad bar. The cool thing is, all the food places on campus you use your TigerCard for, with a meal plan that is already purchased, the students don't have to worry about having a lot of money to spend on food. There are also several different meal plan options on campus.",
            "The dorms are really clean, with newly renovated areas like the cafeteria, the bathrooms and windows. The people you live with usually respect each other, and there are quiet hours at night, so you can sleep. There are always posters on how to get involved on campus as well.",
            "Students are pushed to their limits, I myself feel especially pushed. I am only taking 12 credit hours, but I am participating in two different bands on campus, as well as in art classes. Lets just say I don't see my dorm room very often, and sleep is non-existent some nights. The effort you must put in to be successful is a tremendous amount, but it really pays off in the end.",
            "Do not think that this is high school, you CANNOT get by with not studying like you might have in high school. Never leave the dorm without your keys, honestly people do not like being woken up to let you in. Get your books and laptop before classes start, it will really help you. If in any sort of art class make sure you have some extra spending money, a studio fee will be needed at the beginning of the semester. If you are a music related student, be prepared to spend a lot of extra time in that building, the same goes for art.",
            "Fort Hays is the most helpful, fun, and close-knitted school that I've ever seen. All the teachers are willing to provide insight on any question you might ask, and they actually have time for you. They have all sorts of options for almost any career choice you could want."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students FHSU is great for just about any kind of person they have all sorts of activities and groups to join. Yes it is a party school but on the other hand what College isn't? It really depends on who you hang out with. Tips for prospective students Make sure which ever school you go to is prefect for you and only you! If you choose a school for some other reason like thats where your parents want you to go or where your friends are going to go, the best advice I can give is DON'T DO IT! I've been in those shoes currently I live 14 hours from my home town but I love it at FHSU, yes I miss my family and friends but if I wouldn't have left to come here I wouldn't have ever met some of the amazing people that I have in my life today. Yes my parents were heart broken when I told them I was going so far away instead of the school an hour and 30 minutes away, but they really did support me and eventually got over it. I suggest you visit the campus of where ever you are thinking about going because if you don't and just look at it online you don't get to see the people and have face to face",
