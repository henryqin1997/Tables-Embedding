It is a great choice for a beginner's first distance driver, tailwind drives, downhill distance, long turnover drives, and rollers. The Innova Champion Dyed Valkyrie is a distance driver that is straight and has great glide. It is an easy to learn disc, and in lighter weights will give newer players extra distance. Lighter weights also give players extreme range when thrown downwind, while maximum weights can give excellent upwind distance. The Valkyrie\u2019s high speed turn and flight characteristics make it great choice for long range turnover shots and rollers. 21.2 cm diameter.

    "textAfterTable": "\"This is my favorite driver. It is an incredibly versatile disc for me. It works very well with my throwing style. I tend to throw low and the Valkyrie gets great distance with low thrown shots. I typically carry three Valkyries with me during a round. One is beat and used for long turnover shots. The others can be used for hyzers and subtle helix shots.\" - Juliana Korver If you are looking for a disc with more Fade, try the Firebird more Turn, try the Sidewinder more Glide, try the Thunderbird Other Speed 9 discs include the Firebird, FL, Roadrunner, Sidewinder, Thunderbird and Viking.
