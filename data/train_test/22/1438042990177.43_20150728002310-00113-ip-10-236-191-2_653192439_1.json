People like that until they ask me something and don't like my answer. If you're mature enough to understand that my feelings and opinions are my own and that I don't expect you to have the exact same ones, then we'll get along just fine. I'm a ride or die chick. I love to have fun and make memories. I need a very intelligen,t nerdy friend who is down for whatever and isn't insecure or flaky. It's hard making friends as an adult. First Date We're individuals and so shall be our fun! Though let's be clear that this is a bromance ;) Mail Settings To send a message to YESMistress29 you MUST meet the following criteria: Female Live in United States Live within 75 miles.",
