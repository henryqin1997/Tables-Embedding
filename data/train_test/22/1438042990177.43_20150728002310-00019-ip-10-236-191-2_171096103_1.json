Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 70852=Faraz, Here is how I see it: It's a long season; there are games almost every day, you don't eat or sleep properly, you travel all the time, you sit through rain delays, you play through excessive heat and your body aches just from pitching and warming up. We all know that you don't always feel great and in sports competition this can translate into less than great results once in a while. Baseball players have always tried some form of 'pick me ups' to get through the season. Todays PEDS are simply a replacement for yesterday's greenies. and btw; Gio did have his best season ever in 2012. I am not saying that this proves he used PEDS; I am saying that it doesn't prove that he didn't., 138126=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern. You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 63894=Dave I'm not saying that all. I'm saying Gio know if he did or didn't do it. If he did it, I rather he admit it now and get his 50 games out of the way at during the first third of the season. The hope he learned his lesson and have him for the rest of the year and playoffs. And hope he learn his lesson and be truely sorry and never due it again. And then route for him again.I much rather than (again if he did it), it be a distraction all year [more so each time on national TV], than in August MLB results of their investagtion decides a 50 game ding then and than it hurts the team down the strech and in the postseason.We will forgive those who are truely sorry and I just much rather move on to this stage, sooner rather than later, if he did indeed get PED's., 126053=I prefer wrenches, but not for weddings. :-)Scooter said\u2026 Sometimes I think all you guys have lead pipes in your libraries. February 08, 2013 11:58 PM Sec. 3, My Sofa said\u2026 Candlesticks are always good \u2026 February 09, 2013 12:02 AM, 1263=As cohesive as they appeared to be on the field, the 2012 Nationals were equally cohesive in the clubhouse. You can argue whether good chemistry breeds winning or whether winning breeds good chemistry, but either way the Nats were a close-knit, jovial group last season en route to the franchise's first-ever division title., 10334=Really nice article on Span in the Post \u2026 he sounds like a great guy \u2026http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/denard-span-comes-to-washington-nationals-ready-to-take-step-up-in-his-career/2013/02/08/26ab82fc-65b0-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html, 23861=Positively Half St. said\u2026 Tcostant- I am going to gladly put myself in the category of devoted fan hypocrites. I am all for PED users to get get caught, except when it is one of my favorite guys. If Gio used testosterone, here's hoping he gets away with it and is smart enough never to be anywhere near the stuff again.February 08, 2013 11:30 AM Well said. I fall into that same group of hypocrisy and I'm not proud of it as my yearning for a Nats World Series trumps my disdain for possible cheaters.Whatever the outcome, I definitely lost some respect for Gio based on just his relationship with Goins. The whole guilt by association thing resonates loudly as most players go through their entire career with not a shred of dirt flung on them.Hopefully Gio comes out legally unscathed and this is just big WAKE-UP CALL for him!, 31262=1a: Thanks for that heads up \u2013 just went in and read your suggestions and Muir Woods was already the #1 thing we plan to do after landing in SF. I will definitely bring the parka and try to get tickets on Saturday. I am also thinking of calling my agent for the Nationals and see if he can help.Right now I am leaning toward the 12:45 game but the night game would give us two full days to be tourons., 27210=Additionally, and as previously noted, I'm fine with waiting for the investigation to play out. On a related note, I love Gio and want to see him do well. That said, and in theory at this point, I can't agree with PHS re. wanting to see any of \"my\" guys get away with it if they did cheat. I'm not saying he did. I'm just saying that if that happened with any of \"my\" guys, I'd want him to own up to it.Positively Half St. said\u2026 Tcostant- I am going to gladly put myself in the category of devoted fan hypocrites. I am all for PED users to get get caught, except when it is one of my favorite guys. If Gio used testosterone, here's hoping he gets away with it and is smart enough never to be anywhere near the stuff again. I just want him to pitch well and be entertaining when he is not pitching. If this turns out to be a close call and a cheap lesson, I will be glad of it. February 08, 2013 11:30 AM, 96140=sjm, I wish John nothing but the best, but I'd have taken that bet, too. As the fifth starter, he might not get 30 starts even if he does stay healthy, on a team that won't be much better than the 2011 Nationals, if they are even that good, and that's the only time he's won 10., 22098=http://atmlb.com/Xt0g5VThis bothers me. Brings back memories of 2011 off-season when everyone was ready to hand over WS tickets to Red Sox and Phillies fans. I know it should not since we seem to have a better and younger team than those two but it does., 51764=I guess I different from the group here, I'm a baseball purest. If Gio did PED's, I rather he admit it now and get his 50 games out of the way at during the first 3rd of the season. The hope he learned his lesson and have him for the rest of the year and playoffs. And hope he learn his lesson and be truely sorry and never due it again. And then route for him again.Much more selfish, is to say no, no, no. Let investagation and distraction carry on all year and then get possibly dinked late in the year and loss him for September and the playoffs.If he did it (and I think he did), I'd much rather he come clean now.Does anyone agree with this??? [again assume he did it, who you agree with this]?, 18032=DaveB/MicheleS, I think so with Span. Can't wait to see Harp/Span/Werth patrolling the outfield. That area where the visitor's bullpen meets the Red Porch will no longer be the \"no man's land\" that its been since 2008.I have to believe that the flyball pitchers on this staff will get a nice drop in ERA from this outfield that will be catching fly-balls that before were XBH's.}",
