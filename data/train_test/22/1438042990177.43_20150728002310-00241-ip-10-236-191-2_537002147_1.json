            "Jan. 03, 2011 Only stopped because I got bored with all the badges. Amazing game - deep and thoughtful yet simple. 5/5 \u200b",
            "Jan. 03, 2011 Awful sync. \u200b",
            "Feb. 26, 2010 Terrible. Not challenging in any way, no save function, no point in medals because there is no way to go back over early levels to improve on them. Mind numbingly dull, and it feels like there has been no effort in the music. This simply does not compare to other top down shooters such as Frantic. 2/5. \u200b",
            "Feb. 26, 2010 The message it puts across is confusing, but, this game can be percieved in so many ways, by so many people. I wouldn't really call it a game, more some kind of art. \u200b",
            "Feb. 20, 2010 Not at bad game at all, but not something I would buy for that amount of money. The actual concept of it is genius, and I like the ideas, but I simply do not think it is worth that amount of money. \u200b",
            "Feb. 09, 2010 I keep forgetting my PC got formatted recently and I have lost my progress on every single game. I come back to this and my account is gone because cookies have been eaten. fml? \u200b",
            "Feb. 09, 2010 Too slow, physics are way off, no life system, if you die it just takes you back to the menu. Not even a moving background. Not original either. I don't even mean to sound harsh, but, it's just not very good. Maybe with some work you might be able to make this decent, but I've played much better games within this concept executed much more cleanly and efficiently. \u200b",
            "Feb. 09, 2010 Pretty nice story. Not too hard, not too easy. Took me a while to get through it, and had to use the walkthrough at some parts where I missed items. 4/5. \u200b",
            "Feb. 05, 2010 Win. \u200b",
            "Feb. 05, 2010 I clicked this for the love of coffee. This game is AWESOME. Rather humourous. 4/5. \u200b",
            "Feb. 03, 2010 Rating has to be over a certain amount, and API must be in use for badges. Petitioning will do NOTHING. Thanks. \u200b",
            "Dec. 22, 2009 Rate five for amazing amazingness. \u200b",
            "Dec. 19, 2009 Glitch: Clicking in the green zone with no dragging for power makes the black balls float. Other balls bounce off of them. It doesn't interfere with the game whatsoever, but, it could probably be fixed. \u200b",
            "Dec. 16, 2009 Not as good as English Pub Pool imo, but still alright. \u200b",
            "Dec. 11, 2009 Wow. Pretty damn good. \u200b",
            "Dec. 07, 2009 Howcome so many comments get removed by admins? \u200b",
            "Dec. 04, 2009 Could be pretty good if you work on it. \u200b",
            "Dec. 01, 2009 Kinda glitchy, and yet, somewhat addictive. For example, mission eight states, \"We need someone to distract the guard as we sneak in\", but, I didn't have the Decoy, and wasn't asked for it either. Also, collision detection is slightly off. 3/5 for concept and replayability though. \u200b",
            "Nov. 23, 2009 Alright, four maces to trade with everything except maces. \u200b",
            "Nov. 20, 2009 Gets far too easy after a while, but yeah, good concept. \u200b"
