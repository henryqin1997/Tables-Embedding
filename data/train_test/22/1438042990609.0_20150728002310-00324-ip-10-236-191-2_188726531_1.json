Many observatories provide data to the Center; such as the NOAA National Ocean Service, the U. of Hawaii Sea Level Center, the Chilean Navy, the Japan Meteorological Agency and the National Tidal Facility in Australia among others. Click on the site name to see a graph of the tsunami, when available. Listed wave heights are maximum amplitude in cm (above sea level). Observed Arrival time is the actual tsunami arrival time in UTC on gages where it could be determined. The Computed Arrival time is the estimated time of wave arrival computed at the NTWC based on the earthquake origin time and location. The Sample Interval column shows the time between data samples. For additional information about this tsunami event see the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center's homepage. A major earthquake with a moment magnitude of 7.7",
