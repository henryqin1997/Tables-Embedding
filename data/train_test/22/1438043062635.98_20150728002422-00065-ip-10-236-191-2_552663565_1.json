There was just one difference: rather than supporting the likes of Arsenal or Manchester United, Dave`s team of choice was the ever so slightly less glamorous Bromley Football Club (who currently play in the Blue Square Conference South) - one of the last genuinely amateur football teams left, fighting for survival in the lowest non-league division. The Bromley Boys is the story of Bromley`s worst ever season. It is a funny and heart-warming tale of football at the very bottom: Dave turns up to each match with his football boots in his bag, just in case the team are a player short; the crowd is always announced as 400 as no-one can be bothered to count; the team ship so many goals that in one match, the taunting opposition fans actually lose count of the score. When Saturday Comes called The Bromley Boys 'genuinely funny - throughly recommended'. The Bromley Boys is published by Portico priced \u00a310.99. For more information go to www.anovabooks.com.
