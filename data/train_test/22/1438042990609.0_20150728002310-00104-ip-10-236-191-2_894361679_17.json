    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck We all know college is expensive however, for the education you receive at Husson and the financial aid packages that are available, you won't be disappointed. Am enjoying being here Husson is a wonderful place. Considering its small size, campus feels like a mini community. Also, you never have to worry about finding something to do. The student activities coordinator at Husson works very hard to put on fun and exciting events, you always have the option of joining a fraternity or sorority, sports teams, a variety of clubs, intramurals, etc. Am learning a lot Husson University, regardless of one's major, strives to graduate holistic individuals. The team of faculty, staff, and adjuncts work together to prepare competent individuals in all aspects of their life, not just their academics. This University also provides outstanding hands-on learning experiences. Having participated in such opportunities, it is my belief that I am receiving an education that far surpasses that of a college graduate from another University. When I have entered my field to gain experience I do not feel overwhelmed, rather, I feel confident that I am right where I need to be with my education. Login to",
