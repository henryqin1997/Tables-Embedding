    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17271=By the late 1960s, Goldberg was already a well-known architect in Chicago, having completed the iconic Marina City development on the north bank of the Chicago River. He had also shown proficiency with medical architecture at the Elgin State Hospital, northwest of the city. According to a June 2011 interview with Golbderg\u2019s son, Geoffrey Goldberg, he had known Dr. Beatrice Tucker, the Chicago Maternity Center\u2019s senior obstetrician, since at least 1960, when she asked him to design a prototype for a neighborhood birthing center that could be replicated in impoverished areas around the city. He provided those designs in 1962, although apparently nothing was ever built as a result. Dr. Tucker was not invited to participate in the planning of Prentice, but her forward-thinking ideas about women\u2019s health, family life, and childbirth made a deep impression on Goldberg and guided many of his ideas for the project, including the basic premise that patients should be grouped in communities around a nursing center. His involvement with Dr. Tucker and his experience at Elgin likely played a role in NMH\u2019s selection of BGA to design this new women\u2019s health center in downtown Chicago., 24848=It was only with the help of brand-new computer technology that Goldberg was able to achieve a satisfactory structure at Prentice. The floor plates of the bed tower had to be so large, and the cantilever from the core so extensive, that the task of figuring out how to engineer the concrete shell and supporting intersecting arches became staggeringly complex. In the 1950s, designers (primarily in military and aeronautical fields) began using a method known as finite element analysis to engineer the increasingly complicated machines being developed in the mid-century industrial boom. This new approach allowed engineers to isolate individual structural elements and evaluate their behavior \u2013 a necessary tactic for Prentice\u2019s complicated and untested new shape. Although Goldberg did not invent finite element analysis, it had probably never before been used on a structure as large or complex as Prentice. This was in part due to the fact that the high-speed digital technology necessary to analyze that many structural elements was not available. By the time Goldberg began work on Prentice, digital computers were still in their infancy, but BGA were the American architects at the vanguard of this technology. Goldberg and his chief structural engineer, Ludwig Stainer, worked with a sister company called Computer Service Incorporated and two engineers there, Mike Eiben and Mickey Gerardi, to retrofit finite element analysis software made by the Control Data company in Minneapolis. Although the program was normally used to design airplane wings, BGA and Computer Service Inc. managed to transform it into one of the world\u2019s first three-dimensional modeling programs with an architectural application. (3-D diagram of bedtower stress analysis, c. 1971) This was an important achievement at a time when primitive technology made any kind of computer drawing, even in two dimensions, difficult. (Historical information about the design and engineering of Prentice is from an interview conducted with Goldberg\u2019s son, Geoffrey Goldberg, on June 21, 2011.), 43311=Although Prentice\u2019s structure was shockingly new to the 1970s eyes of the architecture and engineering communities, it was a natural development in an architectural career always characterized by ingenuity and creativity. Before Prentice, Goldberg was best known in Chicago for his Marina City towers, one of the city\u2019s best-loved architectural features, and for Raymond Hilliard Homes, an innovative high-rise housing project on the South Side of Chicago that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. At Marina City, Goldberg maximized livable space on a small and misshapen downtown lot by creating two round towers supported by central cores, with apartments extending off of them like petals on a flower, with supplemental supports at their outer edges. The flexibility and efficiency of the core model was clearly appealing in the Prentice project, but the floor space necessary for a hospital as compared to a low-cost apartment tower was such that extra support would be needed to supplement it. The round towers and curving slab high-rises at Hilliard Homes, built while Marina City was still under construction, are supported by their exterior walls, which form a rippling concrete load-bearing shell. Prentice is a revolutionary combination of these two trademark structural innovations: its undulating shell walls gracefully pass loads down to its central concrete core by way of dramatic 48-foot sideways arches, and all three features (core, shell, and arch) work together to support the massive bedtower. In the context of Goldberg\u2019s life-long history of structural achievement, Prentice is a high point. It contributed a completely new building form to the growing world of concrete construction, and further established Goldberg as one of America\u2019s most inventive architects and engineers., 56339=In 2011, a coalition effort called Save Prentice was formed to advocate for the preservation of Goldberg\u2019s building. With support and involvement from preservation organizations including Docomomo US, Landmarks Illinois, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and Preservation Chicago, Save Prentice made huge strides in educating the public about the building\u2019s importance, developing relationships with City of Chicago and NMH decision-makers, and commissioning and distributing re-use studies that support Prentice\u2019s preservation., 46763=With their revolutionary ideas about the future of women\u2019s health care, Goldberg and the Prentice Hospital administrators were a product of their time. Just as many aspects of American life were undergoing seismic changes in the 1970s, so too was American medicine, especially in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology. Changing attitudes towards women\u2019s roles in society, family planning, and doctor-patient relationships were all played out in Prentice\u2019s groundbreaking program, and Goldberg\u2019s building was an important part of bringing these new services to the women and children of Chicago. In their promotional materials, the \u201cconfiguration of the new building\u201d was listed as one of the features that would improve Prentice\u2019s service to patients. For example, the hospital\u2019s introduction of the Family-Centered Maternity Care approach, in which mothers and fathers were able to experience labor and delivery together and afterwards interact freely with their new infants, found architectural expression in Goldberg\u2019s centrally-located nurseries and accommodating recuperation rooms. While the Prentice administrators had the idea to provide a more communal environment in their maternity ward, Goldberg invented the \u201ccampfire\u201d form that made it possible. NMH touted Prentice as \u201ca unique building for unique medical care.\u201d (Dialog, January 1976) Goldberg\u2019s building was functionally necessary in order to host Prentice\u2019s operations, and its dramatic structure was an advertisement for the equally exceptional medical care offered within., 38995=According to NMH\u2019s newsletter, Dialog, the first patient was moved into Prentice Hospital on December 10, 1975. A special January 1976 Dialog supplement produced for the occasion of Prentice\u2019s dedication describes the festivities as a ceremony on January 22, 1976, accompanied by a weeklong celebration attended by notable figures from a variety of fields. The Illinois State Lieutenant Governor Neil Hartigan and City of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley both attended the dedication, and the local CBS, NBC, and ABC news affiliates featured the hospital and its new services on multiple programs. The hospital also scheduled three days of medical symposia for professionals from around the world to gather in Chicago and discuss the current state of gynecological and obstetrical science., 19803=By the time of this talk in the summer of 1973, construction for the building was just getting underway, but BGA had already spent almost four years working on the project, not to mention Goldberg\u2019s decade-long involvement with Dr. Tucker. Goldberg was also simultaneously working on three other hospital projects: Affiliated Hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts; the Health Sciences Center in Stony Brook, New York; and St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Tacoma, Washington. All of these projects, as well as the handful of medical facilities he designed later in the 1970s, use a similar combination of curvaceous towers above rectilinear base structures. But at the beginning of the 1970s Goldberg was so far unsatisfied with his explorations into this concept. He believed that hospitals should have open and flexible space in order to accommodate a variety of different uses and the changes that would inevitably come in medical technology. The large floor plates of the round towers required columns or walls to support them, which penetrated the rectangular base structures below, interfering with their open plans. At Prentice he came up with a structural solution that finally satisfied his goals for medical architecture, and he felt it was the culmination of his investigation of hospitals. (Blum 223), 40107=When it was completed in 1975, Prentice Women\u2019s Hospital concrete shell bedtower was internationally recognized as a breakthrough in architectural engineering. It was celebrated in architecture and building technology publications around the world, including Building Design & Construction (March 1974 cover story), Inland Architect (January 1974 and April 1976), Architecture and Urbanism (Japan, July 1975), Architecture d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui (France, January \u2013 February 1976), Architectural Record (July 1976), Informes de la Construction (Spain, November 1976), Cement (Netherlands, 1977), Concrete Construction (February 1980), L\u2019Industria Italiana Del Cemento (Italy, No. 7-8, 1980), and Concrete Abstracts (cover image, January/February 1986) (see documentation section below for more details). In 1975 the Engineering News-Record granted it an award for \u201cdistinguished architectural and engineering development for innovations in structure.\u201d Four years after its completion, in 1979, Prentice was recognized for its ingenious use of materials and structural engineering in a show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York entitled \u201cTransformations in Modern Architecture,\u201d organized by the museum\u2019s highly influential curator of architecture and design, Arthur Drexler. In its 1976 feature article on Prentice, Architectural Record praised the flexibility and efficiency of the innovative shell construction, punning that Goldberg \u201chit the snail on the head.\u201d, 35978=Between 1968 and 1969 BGA and NMH finalized the terms of their agreement, and design work began. They drafted a project timeline on April 28, 1969 indicating that work should begin on May 15, 1969 and last a projected 42.5 months. Months 15.5 through 39.5 were to be devoted to construction. (Timeline accessed at Goldberg Archive at the Ryerson Library), 23550=At the topping off celebration held at Prentice\u2019s construction site on May 23, 1974, Goldberg said that this hospital was \u201cdesigned from the inside out.\u201d (Lecture notes accessed at the Goldberg Archive at the Ryerson Library) The building was intended to be a shell, protecting and surrounding the hospital activities within, but never interfering. Given NMH\u2019s need for traditional, rectilinear, flexible space for administrative, office, operating, and labor rooms, Goldberg knew he had to provide a spacious rectangular base that could have its interior spaces infinitely reconfigured. The bedtower above would need to be physically connected by stairs and elevators in order to allow circulation between them. In order to avoid interrupting the base structure\u2019s flexibility, the tower\u2019s structural supports had to be consolidated with this connection as well. The entire tower had to somehow cantilever off of a single supporting core. Prentice was certainly not the first time Goldberg had considered monumental cantilevers as a design solution; even at Marina City he felt that the supporting columns of the towers interfered with the commercial spaces on the ground. A cantilever was considered there, but was determined to be too dangerous. (Goldberg interview, June 21, 2011), 15944=At some point after the original commission, but before Goldberg arrived at the final design for the building, NMH requested that facilities be added to accommodate the Northwestern Institute of Psychiatry. In a 1971 cross-section of the building psychiatric uses are indicated for three of the seven floors of the bedtower, although eventually the Institute of Psychiatry was confined to the base portion of the building. (see Cross-section, 1971) The large flexible spaces there accommodated a wide variety of uses relating to the Institute, including offices, group therapy rooms and alcohol abuse clinics. (see Isometric floor plans, c. 1971), 29167=While the complicated engineering calculations necessary to construct Prentice\u2019s revolutionary concrete tower were expedited by new computer technology, the design process was slowed by programmatic changes requested by NMH. Between the original instructions given to BGA in 1969 and the beginning of construction in 1972, the project went from being a hospital devoted entirely to the care, treatment, and study of women and babies to all of that plus a home for the Northwestern Institute of Psychiatry. However, since this and other major changes (including the addition of an eleventh-floor laboratory) were made prior to 1971 they were included in Goldberg\u2019s renderings from that year, which show for the first time the building in its built form. (Cross-section, 1971), 45239=Goldberg was always quick to point out that the technical achievements at Prentice Hospital, and indeed in all of his buildings, were not just meant to show off his prowess as an engineer. He took advantage of the most advanced tools available because he wanted to make buildings that would best serve their ultimate users - in this case the patients and medical staff of Prentice. Goldberg\u2019s drive to provide a more flexible and efficient structure at Prentice was in service of his equally radical desire to change the landscape of modern health care. All of this tied into Goldberg\u2019s life-long quest to develop architecture that made urban life more comfortable and satisfying. The assignment at Prentice Hospital, to design a building for a totally new, more humane approach to women\u2019s health care, was a good match for Goldberg\u2019s ongoing investigation into the ways in which architecture could improve human lives. The result of Goldberg\u2019s commission on this project is a building that is an important milestone in the development of twentieth century medicine. In addition to all of the press the building received in the architectural media, the medical community also recognized its design as an important step forward in hospital design. It was featured on the cover of Modern Healthcare Magazine in March of 1976, and in the entry on the history of hospital design in the 1977 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, a photograph of Prentice was chosen to illustrate the section on modern hospitals., 36347=Due to delays in the design process, BGA did not request bids from contractors until April 1972. The delays and changes continued even after construction began - probably not unusual given the number of people and needs involved in any large hospital building. By July 1974, according to meeting notes found in the Goldberg Archive at the Ryerson Library, Prentice\u2019s board was dissatisfied with the number and cost of change orders, so Goldberg explained that the vast majority was a result of program modifications on the part of the hospital. Given the mechanical complexity of most of the building\u2019s spaces, every change required re-working agreements with various contractors and city building inspectors, and hence multiplied costs and schedules. Furthermore, the constant changes meant that the building program \u201cnever [came] to rest for a fixed architectural design.\u201d Although the 1971 renderings show the exterior of the building as it would be built and many of the interiors essentially as they would be finished, any number of changes had to be made to the details of the building in order to accommodate NMH staff needs., 21118=In his planning for Prentice, Goldberg went through three different designs before arriving at the final design around 1971. Because he was simultaneously working on a number of other hospital projects, elements of these other buildings can be seen in these early designs. The first, from 1969, shows a drum-shaped, curtain-walled tower, raised on pilotis that descend through the middle of a one-story pavilion. (Early rendering showing preliminary design, 1969) The smooth cylindrical shape of the tower mimics that of his Elgin State Hospital in Illinois, from 1967. A second plan for Prentice eliminated the large rectangular base altogether, consolidating the building into a ring of concrete tubes standing on arched supports, connected by glass-enclosed hallways on the upper floors. (Early rendering showing preliminary design, c. 1969) A third design, the most similar to Prentice\u2019s final appearance and dating to around 1970, shows a rectilinear glass-curtain-walled base of about four stories with a plaza on its roof. Sprouting from the middle of this plaza is a mechanical core surrounded by three or four concrete bedtowers. Each tower has a rippling shell punctured by paired columns of oval windows, and is supported by a thin stem of concrete. A rendering of this design ran in the article in the Chicago Daily News on April 23, 1970 that publicly announced the new hospital to Chicago, and BGA went so far as to construct a three-dimensional model of it. (Early model, c. 1970) A version of this design also found its application at St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, completed in 1975. While the smaller towers in this early design for Prentice use similar cantilevers as the ones seen in Prentice\u2019s final form, they are not as dramatic. The four stems and the mechanical core were all separate, and not yet consolidated into the single central support of the finished building., 28465=Although the tower is the most striking feature of Prentice both aesthetically and structurally, Goldberg emphasized that the facility was not one, but two buildings: a tower as well as a base. (Goldberg topping off speech, May 23, 1974) The radical division between the two parts - enabled by the consolidation of the tower\u2019s support structure at its core - allowed Goldberg to address NMH\u2019s complex programmatic needs and his own desire for peaceful, secluded bedrooms for patients. All of the administrative, delivery, and various other support activities could be segregated in the base structure while the bedtower was devoted to rest and recuperation with family and nurses nearby., 48322=Goldberg is well known for his use of round shapes in all kinds of architecture, but he believed the circle had particular usefulness in health care design. He saw traditional rectilinear hospital spaces, which he referred to as \u201clinear yard goods,\u201d as wasteful and inhumane. (Architectural Record 115) Long straight hallways added to travel time for caregivers between their patients and nursing stations, resulting in feelings of isolation and dangerous delays in care. Visitors, doctors, and nurses forced to walk up and down halls were a constant disturbance to patients attempting to rest in the rooms lining their path. Goldberg felt that most hospitals\u2019 architecture worked against the very purpose for which they were built: the care and healing of people in need. He was quoted in Architectural Record in June 1976:, 37495=Despite the pre-construction delays, in 1972 Goldberg was able to field exceptionally low bids that complied with estimates made as far back as 1968. According to his July 1974 notes, most of these savings were thanks to the concrete shell construction of the tower, which cost only $57 per square foot, as opposed to $75 to $85 per square foot for other hospital buildings of curtain-wall construction. Using reinforced concrete for floors, walls, and structure meant that it provided built-in fireproofing, noise dampening, earthquake reinforcement, and insulation for the entire tower., 57238=\u201c10-story maternity hospital, Near North research center,\u201d Chicago Daily News, April 22, 1970. \u201cCantilevering the Shell: A Breakthrough,\u201d Inland Architect, January 1974, 6 \u2013 7.

Chicago Architects Oral History Project: Bertrand Goldberg. Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 1992. Goldberg, Geoffrey. Telephone interview. June 21, 2011., 18475=Design On July 11, 1973, Goldberg delivered a talk about his concept for the women\u2019s hospital at a luncheon attended by major donors to NMH and members of Prentice\u2019s staff. (Lecture notes accessed at the Goldberg Archive at the Ryerson Library) Goldberg described the new facility as a \u201cpoint of entry to all medical care for women,\u201d offering gynecology, birth, fertility treatments, abortions, and all of the medical research needed to develop these procedures. The new hospital was intended to revolutionize medicine for women by providing a less \u201cisolated\u201d environment than the doctor\u2019s office, delivering ambulatory care without hospital stays, and offering surroundings that would improve patient relationships with caregivers. He outlined the architecture that would serve this program: four \u201cvillages\u201d per floor, adjacent to nursing centers, each accommodating 12 to 14 beds each. Each of the floors would have a centralized support area. The base of the building would contain flexible space for other purposes besides patient bedrooms. The hospital would also include research facilities that would be coordinated with nursing areas. At the end of his speech, Goldberg\u2019s notes indicate that he addressed the concrete shell construction of the building, which he described with one word: \u201clandmark.\u201d, 38098=Goldberg\u2019s unique design for the bedtower required matching ingenuity from the project\u2019s contractors in order to pour the complicated concrete forms. There was no margin for error in creating the sweeping X-shaped intersections of the arches at the bottom of the tower. Nothing like them had ever been undertaken before, they were the key to the building\u2019s entire structure, and they could not be fixed if formed incorrectly. (Goldberg interview, June 21, 2011) Furthermore, the arches were one of the key aesthetic features of the building since they were placed prominently over the hospital\u2019s entrance. Although Prentice was in general a highly cost-effective building, the custom forms necessary to achieve the tower\u2019s unique structure added some expense to the early stages of construction. Goldberg tried to mitigate this by re-using them in as many applications as possible.}",
