(albeit, this school's price can be quite staggering without a scholarship.) However, Westminster offers some financial perks: free local transportation, access to hundreds of databases that you would normally pay for, an exciting May Term, a writing lab, discounted ski passes, and other interesting things., 293077=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 158969=Westminster College is a school with a great reputation in the Salt Lake area that is an excellent choice for students that are active and/or those who seek more than lecture style classes from the start. Additionally, the school has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030, which I happen to find amazing and admirable. This is a school with a lot to offer, with a prime location, small class sizes and knowledgable /helpful professors, what more could you want?}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I am in love with Westminster College. It turned out to be the perfect college for me, the size, student to professor ratio was just what I wanted and needed. Also it is a liberal arts school which really expanded my views on learning not only academically but also politically. I am also able to do extracurricular activities I love while still being able to focus on my education. For example I was the lead in the school play but am not a theater major, it really gives everyone the equal opportunity to participate in what ever they love. If you are looking for a small, one on one school, Westminster College is perfect for you.
