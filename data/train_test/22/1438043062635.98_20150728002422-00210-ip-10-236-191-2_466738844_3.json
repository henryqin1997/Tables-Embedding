Points are awarded to the winner of regular-season contests, except for cross country, golf and swimming and diving, which will be determined by Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Championship standings (see chart below), and the results will be posted on each school\u2019s Web site. The Canal Cup will be awarded to the victor each year. The name of the series is in reference to the Grand Island Bridge, which each team crosses when traveling to the other\u2019s campus. The name of the trophy is in reference to the Erie Canal, which intersects Niagara County, where Niagara is located, and Erie County, where Canisius is located. Records indicate the two schools first met on the basketball court in 1904. Currently, Canisius and Niagara compete in baseball, men and women\u2019s basketball, men and women\u2019s cross country, golf, men\u2019s ice hockey, women\u2019s lacrosse, men and women\u2019s soccer, men and women\u2019s swimming and diving, softball and volleyball.

    "textBeforeTable": "2014-15 Schedule and Results If a non-conference contest or series against Niagara is scheduled in any sport, it will not count in the standings. For example, if the softball teams schedule a non-conference doubleheader in addition to their conference doubleheader, only the series that counts in conference will count in the series standings. If there is a tie in total points, the school that currently has the cup will retain it. Softball plays a doubleheader during the season. The winner of the series receives the points. If the teams split then each school receives one point. Volleyball meets twice during the regular season and each match is worth one point. Women\u2019s lacrosse, men\u2019s soccer and women\u2019s soccer each play once. Cross country, women's outdoor track and field, golf and swimming and diving will be determined at the MAAC Championships. The school that finishes higher will be awarded the points. For baseball the winner of the three-game season series will be awarded the two points. For hockey, the winner of each regular-season game earns one point. If the teams tie in a meeting, each school receives half a point. For men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball",
