            "They have campus police inside and outside. Of course there is always that person who wants to mess someone's life by breaking a car's window, but the police officers are efficient and the security cameras are everywhere to record what is happening.",
            "Honors society is the only Greek life since its a community college.",
            "Houston Community College is full of student organization and activities throughout each semester. Freebies, freebies freebies!",
            "Any type of student who lack financial support, who just graduated from High school and does not have $30,000 to pay off their first year of tuition. HCC provides a great amount of grants and scholarships for students who have a good academic achievement. If you are a Texas Resident, HCC is the place for you, international students who need financial aid, HCC is the place for you. Also, if you like good convenient schedules and NO FRIDAY CLASSES, then this is definitely a place for you!",
            "I would say that going to a community college to do all your required classes for your career for an affordable price, is the best thing any high school graduate, returning student, and even a new student can do. Also, while financial aid is a great deal here, paying $800-900 a semester for required classes, rather than $8000-9000 is a huge difference, so be smart about it! If you decide to transfer to any University, its the best thing you can do while obtaining your AA or AAS or AS since you will have credited college classes that will transfer over and you will save a lot of money. All the money you did not use in your first two years, you can now use it for your last two years in classes that focus on your specific BA or BS.",
            "Depends on the campus.",

            "Great classes, very affordable. However, always be wise to choose the right professor and the right time.",
            "-Always keep priorities on top of the list. -It's okay to ask for help, even if you have to ask different people the same question, they are there to help. -Try to get advise by two different people. It is always good to hear a second opinion. If they both agree then go ahead! -Fix your schedule according to your routine. If you are not a morning person do not choose a 8am class or you will for sure fail that class! (they do take attendance there and in some classes its part of your grade).",
            "Future can be complicated, mysterious, and even scary. However, Houston Community College is the place to learn, to find the key to your future, do not be scare of what can be yours!"

HCC is very affordable, the books in the book room are also very cheap. you should not expect to spend over 2000 per semester., 251142=Houston Community College has been very good for me. I started attending part-time from 1980-1983, 1993-1994, and I have returned against in 2012. I am taking online classes now and am very happy with the format and quality of delivery of online classes so far., 708021=Always register for classes on time. Join a learning group to share ideas. Don't forget to get back to your instructors if you have any problem in class. HCC instructors are very supportive in general. It's like a family learning environment. Also try to utilize the mini semester opportunity; it will help you get few of your classes out of the way. The library closes it 10:00 pm; if you are working and you get off at 5:00 pm, using the library till 10:00 pm like I do will help you a lot., 833255=The 2nd story bathroom is haunted (fyi) lol its really just a joke between me and a few girls from my EDU 1300 class but the lights do tend to flicker off and on at weird times, 867362=With its 20:1 student staff ratio each class feels like a small family. The professors are great and flexible. The class are tedious work but if you keep with it then you won't have any problems., 605102=Incredible Greek festival in October here in Houston., 459781=I, as I stated previously, was able to completely pay for my schooling here. Although, the prices were a large amount to anyone that glances, I did find them do-able, if a student were to save hard then the prices would be managable. Online courses are more expensive but towards the end I was taking 5 classes, 2 online and my price for the semester was 2500., 900084=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 13940=Even though, HCC isn't the school I chose to go to, it isn't that bad. The professors will teach you one on one if you need help with something that they're teaching. They have tutoring centers to help students accomplish their work. The classes are about 1:25 student teacher ratio and the professors get personal because they know your name. The professors at HCC are caring and they will try to help you the best that they can., 836020=If you attend the Alief campus, try your best to enroll in Dr.Dino Sandifer's EDU 1300 class. Let me tell you, this class will be such a great icebreaker into the college life...you'll definitely thank me for it!, 135529=They have this tradition for every 5th of May, they have a mini fiesta outside and they provide free food!! and games. They decorate the building according to the month like Black history month, Hispanic Heritage month, and Holidays.}",
