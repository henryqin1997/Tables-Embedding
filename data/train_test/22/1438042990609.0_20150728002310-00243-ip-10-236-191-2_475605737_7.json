In one embodiment, the layer 1206 has a material similar to that of the layer 206. In another embodiment, the photon barrier layer 1000 is formed of SU8 with photobleachable dye, similar to that described with respect to an embodiment of layer 206 above. In one embodiment, the SU8 with photobleachable dye allows greater dimensional control and straighter edges. For example, as shown in FIG. 10F, the corner edges between the chamber and nozzle are substantially square edges., 45980=In this embodiment, the photon barrier layer 1000 is cast from a solution comprising at least one of an epoxy or acrylic resin, a binder, a solvent, a PAG (photosensitive), and an i-line dye (photon barrier). In one embodiment, the thickness of photon barrier layer 1000 is in the range of about \ufffd microns to 2 microns, preferably \ufffd micron. In another embodiment, the photon barrier layer is minimized, while being sufficiently absorbent., 44517=In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 10A-10F, the process of forming the four layer (205, 1206, 1000, 1208) barrier layer 124 is illustrated. The embodiment of FIG. 11 shows the flow chart corresponding to the process illustrated in FIGS. 10A to 10F. In step 1100 and in FIG. 10A, the material 1206 a for forming the chamber layer is coated over the primer layer 205. In step 1110 and in FIG. 10B, the chamber layer 1206 is exposed thereby forming walls about a chamber, and leaving the unexposed material 1206 a within the chamber area. In step 1120 and in FIG. 10C, material 1000 a for forming a photon barrier layer is coated over the chamber layer 1206 and the material 1206 a. In step 1130 and in FIG. 10D, material 1208 a for the nozzle layer is coated over the photon barrier layer material 1000 a. In step 1140 and in FIG. 10E, the nozzle layer 1208 and the photon barrier layer 1000 is exposed. The material 1206 a remains in the chamber 202 and the materials 1000 a and 1208 a remain in the nozzle 105. In step 1150 and in FIG. 10F, the materials 1206 a, 1000 a, and 1208 a are developed and thereby removed from the chamber and nozzle., 47138=In the embodiment shown in FIG. 12, an additional top coat 209 is formed over the nozzle layer 1208. The top coat 209 is similar to the top coat 209 described with respect to FIG. 6., 35018=An example of the physical arrangement of the cover layer, and thin film substructure is illustrated at page 44 of the Hewlett-Packard Journal of February 1994. Further examples of printheads are set forth in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,719,477, 5,317,346, and 6,162,589. Embodiments of the present invention include having any number and type of layers formed or deposited over the substrate, depending upon the application.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It is therefore to be understood that this invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. For example, the present invention is not limited to thermally actuated fluid ejection devices, but may also include, for example, piezoelectric activated fluid ejection devices, and other mechanically actuated printheads, as well as other fluid ejection devices. In an additional embodiment, the cover layer 124 of the present invention includes a plurality of layers, such as 4 layers, 5 layers, 6 layers, etc. Each of these layers may have either the same or a different material composition, depending upon the application. Thus, the present embodiments of the invention should be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention to be indicated by the appended claims rather than the foregoing description. Where the claims recite \u201ca\u201d or \u201ca first\u201d element of the equivalent thereof, such claims should be understood to include incorporation of one or more such elements, neither requiring nor excluding two or more such elements. In one embodiment, ratios of SU8 ingredients, additives, and molecular weights of the SU8 oligomers are adjusted to give a range in the materials properties that are mentioned above. In one embodiment, at least one of the above-described embodiments maximizes trajectory control by reducing orifice-chamber alignment variability. In one embodiment, the materials forming the primer, chamber and/or nozzle layers are photodefined through i-line exposure. The i-line",
