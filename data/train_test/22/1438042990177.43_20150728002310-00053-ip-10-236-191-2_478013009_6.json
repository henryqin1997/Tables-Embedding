    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the two procedures of compression and expansion of the angular values have been described and demonstrated simultaneously in FIGS. 6 and 7, it is quite possible to apply only one of the two procedures. The embodiment described in FIG. 7 shows the realization of a detector which unites the advantages of the angular compression by prism 11 for short-range measurements and those of the angular expansion by prism 26 for long-range measurements. The emitting system and the receiving systems including the two prisms are integrated side by side in a single housing 31, the construction being very compact due to the use of a single spherical mirror 30 which replaces lens 13 or 25 and lens 28 for the purpose of focusing the incident beams on position detectors 12 or 24 for short-range measurements and 27 for long-range measurements. It is possible to replace the single spherical mirror by two spherical mirrors, i.e. one for each prism. It is possible to provide a single detector instead of the two detectors 12 or 24 and 27. Depending on the requirements, the arrangement of FIG. 6 allows for realization detectors for long distance measurements which offer a large measuring range due to the combination of an optical system with angular expansion or a conventional optical system for long distances, and of an optical system with angular compression of the short range.
