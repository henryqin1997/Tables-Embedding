            "MacDrive enables Windows to read and write to Mac-formatted drives from Windows Explorer, including drives attached to the PC with FireWire, USB, eSATA, SATA, and SCSI. It also enables Windows to mount Mac DMG disk images in Windows. MacDrive automatically converts file names, eliminating characters not allowed in Windows. Included is a Windows utility called MacDrive Disk Manager that can format, partition and repair Mac-formatted storage media. In addition to running on Windows on a PC, MacDrive can run on Mac booted with Windows with Boot Camp. The later case enables Windows to read and write files located on the Mac partition. MacDrive 9 will automatically add content from the Mac partition to the Windows 7 libraries. MacDrive also enables Windows installed in a virtual machine in Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion to access external Mac drives. Version 9 added a Windows the Quick Start Launcher window, which provides links to open all of MacDrive\u2019s features, such as opening Mac-format storage, burning CDs and DVDs in Mac format, and repairing Mac storage. MacDrive 9 also improves the ability to repair Mac drives. MacDrive also enables Windows to browse the backed up files on Time Machine backup sets, and copy those files to Windows. MacDrive supports drives bigger than 2 terabytes in size.",
            "MacDrive 9 Pro includes all the features of MacDrive 9 Standard, but adds four new features to Windows: support of Apple RAID sets, Secure Delete, the ability to create Mac ISO image files, and the ability to burn Blu-ray discs. MacDrive 9 Pro\u2019s RAID feature enables Windows Explorer to display and access Mac-formatted RAIDs created with Apple\u2019s Disk Utility in Mac OS X 10.4 and later. MacDrive 9 Pro supports RAIDs that are striped, mirrored, or concatenated. (For mirrored sets, all drives must be connected.) MacDrive 9 Pro cannot mount a RAID of greater than 2TB in Windows XP 32-bit, due to the inherent limitation in Windows XP. Large RAIDs are supported with Windows 7 and Vista.",
