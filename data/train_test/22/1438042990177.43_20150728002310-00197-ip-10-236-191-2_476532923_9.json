    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32469=DNA sequence determination as developed by Sanger et al. ((1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 5463-5467) is usually carried out with a T7 DNA polymerase (Tabor S. and Richardson, C. C. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 4076-4080). This method requires relatively large amounts of a purified, single-stranded DNA template. Recently cycle sequencing has been developed (Murray, V. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 8889). This method does not require a single-stranded template and allows the sequence reaction to be initiated with relatively small amounts of template. However, the template DNA has to be purified to almost complete homogeneity and is usually prepared by means of cloning in plasmids (Bolivar, F. et al., (1977) Gene 2, 95-113) and subsequent plasmid purification (Birnboim, H. C. and Doly, J. (1979) Nucleic Acids Res. 7, 1513-1523) or by means of PCR amplification (Mullis, K. B. and Faloona, F. A. (1987) Methods Enzymol. 155, 335-350). Only one primer is used in both of the methods described above., 33510=In one embodiment of the cycle sequencing which is referred to as \"coupled amplification and sequencing\" or \"CAS\" Ruano and Kidd ((1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 2815-2819; U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,911) have shown that one can use a two-step protocol to generate sequences from DNA templates. In the first step 15 PCR cycles are carried out with Taq DNA polymerase in the absence of dideoxynucleotides in order to prepare an adequate amount of sequencing template. In a second step in which dideoxynucleotides and a labelled primer are added, CAS produces the sequence as well as the additional amplification of the target sequence. Two primers are used in both steps of the method., 43292=In a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention the ratio of the said primers to one another is about 2:1 to about 3:1, most preferably 2:1., 63600=Using a constant amount of template DNA of 500 ng and a total amount of 12 pmol of the two primers, the ratios between the labelled primer and the unlabelled primer were varied in each case between 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3. The reaction in which the primers were present in equimolar amounts yielded poor signals whereas all other ratios, independently of whether the labelled or the unlabelled primer was present in excess, yielded better results. The ratios 2:1 and 1:2 yielded the best results. It was surprising and unexpected that both non-equimolar ratios are advantageous. Using 8 pmol of the primer mtDNA1 and 4 pmol of the primer mtDNA2 we presently routinely determine 450 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region., 67366=It was shown that it is possible to sequence both complementary DNA strands of plasmid DNA in a single reaction using two different fluorescently-labelled primers (Wiemann, S., et al., (1995) Analytical Biochemistry 224, 117-121). The applicability of this approach to DEXAS was analysed using an FITC-labelled primer (mtDNA1), a Cy5-labelled primer (mtDNA2) and 500 ng human DNA as the template. While retaining the above reaction conditions the primer ratios were varied (FITC-mtDNA1:Cy5-mtDNA2) (3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3). After the cycling reaction and denaturation 5 \u03bcl of the reaction was applied to an A.L.F. or an A.L.F. express instrument. As in previous experiments considerably poorer results were obtained if equimolar amounts of primer were used compared to reactions in which non-equimolar amounts were used (FIG. 4). A ratio of 2:1 at a total amount of 12 pmol gave the best signal-to-noise ratio. In such reactions 450 bases were read on both strands without yielding ambiguous positions. The observation that a larger amount of FITC-labelled primer than Cy5-labelled primer is advantageous is probably due to experiments it was possible to show that the two colour approach can also be applied to single-copy the better signal-to-noise ratio of Cy5 compared to FITC. In further genes., 56236=FIG. 4. Two colour DEXAS reaction using different oligonucleotide ratios. Each of the reactions was carried out using 250 ng genomic human DNA and a total amount of 12 pmol primer. MtDNA1 was labelled with FITC (left panel) and MtDNA2 was labelled with Cy5 (right panel). The ratios between FITC-MtDNA1 and Cy5-MtDNA2 were varied between 2:1 (upper panel), 1:1 (middle panel) and 1:2 (lower panel). The largest signal-to-noise ratio for both primers is achieved when a ratio of 2:1 is used. The raw data of the A.L.F. and of the A.L.F. express instruments are shown. The assignment of the base signals from top to bottom is C, A, G, and T respectively., 44138=Furthermore the PNA-DNA hybrid oligonucleotides (see Finn, P. J. et al., N.A.R. 24, 3357-3363 (1996), Koch, T. et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 36, 6933-6936 (1995), Stetsenko, D. A, et al., Tetrahedron Letters 37, 3571-3574 (1996), Bergmann, F. et al., Tetrahedron Letters 36, 6823-6826 (1995) and Will, D. W. et al., Tetrahedron 51, 12069-12082 (1995)) are also regarded as primers for the method according to the invention., 48519=In the method according to the invention the preferred ratio of dNTPs to ddNTPs (dNTPs:ddNTPs) is between 100:1 and 1000:1 preferably between 300:1 and 600:1., 59476=The numbering of the mtDNA primers refers to the 3' end according to Anderson et al. ((1981) Nature 290, 457-465) and L and H refer to the L strand and the H strand respectively. The DEXAS reaction was carried either using ThermoSequenase\u2122 (Tabor, S. and Richardson, C. C. (1995) Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 6339-6343) (Amersham, UK) reagents or using the following 10\ufffdbuffer: 500 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.2), 160 mM (NH4)2 SO4, 35 mM MgCl2 (ScienTech Corp., St. Louis, Mo.). Three different nucleotide mixtures were evaluated for the termination: (i) 1:333, 1 mM dATP, 1 mM dCTP, 1 mM dGTP, 1 mM dTTP, in which the A, C, G and T reaction each contained 3 \u03bcM of the corresponding dideoxy-nucleotide. (ii) 1:666 also containing in each case 1 mM of each deoxynucleotide but 1.5 \u03bcM of the corresponding dideoxynucleotide. (iii) 1:1000 also containing in each case 1 mM of each deoxynucleotide but 1.0 \u03bcM of the corresponding dideoxynucleotide. All termination mixtures were prepared using 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.2), 16 mM (NH4)2 SO4, 5 mM MgCl2., 64352=The ratio of the deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) to dideoxy-nucleotides (ddNTPs) can be varied in the DEXAS reaction. A higher proportion of dNTPs will probably allow an increased template production in each cycle whereas a higher proportion of ddNTPs would lead to an increased termination of the extension products before the priming position of the second unlabelled primer is reached. The latter products will contribute to the sequence reaction but not to the further template amplification. In order to determine to what extent the ratio of ddNTPs to dNTPs influences the reaction, ddNTPs were mixed with dNTPs in ratios of 1:333, 1:666 and 1:1000 and used in a DEXAS reaction containing 8 pmol of an FITC-labelled primer (mtDNA1), 4 pmol of an unlabelled primer (mtDNA2) and 300 ng human DNA. The reaction conditions were as described above. The results showed that the ratio 1:666 (ddNTPs:dNTPs) yielded stronger signals.}",
