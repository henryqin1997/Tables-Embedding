    "textBeforeTable": "Thanks, John! img credit: snip from larger illustration NASA's Eclipse Page managed by Fred Espenak This eclipse is unusual because the Moon itself eclipses, or occults, this bright star during totality. 59 Leonis is magnitude 4.98, a challenge for the urban observer. This occultation will most likely require optics to observe the actual moments of ingress and egress. Perhaps a test for the eagle eye. The following Eclipse time table & illustrations were prepared and distributed by John Pazmino. eclipse as it rises at 5:43pm. I'll be at Carl Schurz Park around the 86th St. entrance. I'm sure they will be many others. Eyes, binoculars, and telescopes should be plentiful. Ideally, the weather will be on its best to let us enjoy the show. On 03 March 2007, Moon will be in 20070303",
    "textAfterTable": "Illustration shows location of 59 Leonis a few minutes prior to ingress of occultation. Illustration shows location of 59 Leonis a few minutes past egress from occultation. Typically this is a challange when stars emerge from the bright limb of Moon but under this circumstance, a chance to see the star \"blink\" on should improve considerably. posted by Tag @ 2/27/2007 07:50:00 AM \u00a0 Sunday, February 25, 2007 20070224 - filled with pleasure",
