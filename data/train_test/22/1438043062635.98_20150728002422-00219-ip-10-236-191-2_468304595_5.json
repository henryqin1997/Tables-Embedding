    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31248=Three emulsions were screened in a waste stream containing waste oil reclamation and recycling as shown in Table No. 2, emulsions 1, 2 and 3. It is apparent that these emulsions are broken only by polymers having a particular DOS. However, more important is the fact that starch/gum polymers having equivalent DOS outperformed the respective starch controls by at least 60%. In emulsion 4, which contained a lubricating oil in water emulsion, a starch of 0.28 DOS had no effect upon the emulsion. A higher charged starch (DOS 1.1) broke the emulsion at 1000 ppm. However, a starch/gum at a DOS of 0.24 broke the emulsion more effectively than either starches at only 500 ppm. Obviously the DOS is not as important upon this emulsion as some other factor such as perhaps molecular weight which is afforded by the natural gum., 26738=The ingredients were mixed in a Waring blender for 10 minutes and 10 g of the concentrate added to a clean blender and diluted (390) ml) with distilled water. The mixture was blended for seven minutes after which it was diluted 9:1 with tap water. This emulsion was mixed for 15 minutes and then allowed to stand for 16 hours prior to using it., 17485=This is a division of application Ser. No. 499,939, filed Mar. 27, 1990, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,169,562., 29636=The starch/gum polymer was also optimized from the perspective of DOS by varying the concentration of starch and cationic quarternary ammonium compound, in this case corn starch and N-(3 chloro-2 hydroxy propyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride to determine the requisite concentrations necessary for emulsion breaking. The concentration of corn starch in the control was 16.3%. This starch concentration was reduced in the test samples to 11.5% and 10% together with 1.6% guar gum. The synthesis of the cationic quarternary ammonium starch-gum was completed and was screened along side a corn starch control (16%) upon emulsion No. 2. The results are illustrated in Graph No. 3 which indicates that it is only necessary to have approximately 11.5% of corn starch and 1.6% of guar gum. This ratio of starch/gum performed as well as 16.3:1.6 percent starch/gum and outperformed the cationic starch control (16.3%:-corn starch)., 27717=A number of cationic quaternary ammonium gums were prepared by reacting guar gums with varying amounts of N-(3-chloro-2-hydroxy propyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride, with sodium hydroxide as catalyst. The degree of substitution (DOS) of these products was calculated theoretically and was found to be in the range of 0.3 to 1.45. The actual DOS values were 0.24-1.18. All of these cationic quarternary ammonium gums samples were completely ineffective as emulsion breakers on all four synthetic emulsions.}",
