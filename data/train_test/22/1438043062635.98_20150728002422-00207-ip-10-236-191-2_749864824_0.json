With Apple's overall market share being 15%, according to research firm IDC, Hargreaves thinks it's \"reasonable to assume that a 4.7\" iPhone could capture 10% of the market for smartphones above 4', which suggests an opportunity for Apple to drive an incremental 10 million units of share from Android following the launch of a larger iPhone.\", 10786=Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500., 16880=Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves boosted Apple, raising it to \"outperform\" with a $635 price target, as he believes the next iPhone, which he calls the iPhone 6, could be priced higher than the iPhone 5s, and return growth to Apple in fiscal 2015. \"We believe Apple can sell a 4.7\" iPhone at a subsidized price of $299, which should generate incremental gross profit on replacement sales and attract new customers that had previously purchased Android phones specifically for a larger screen,\" Hargreaves wrote in a note.}",
