You do not need to be logged into a specific window manager to use an installed file manager. For example, if KDE is installed, you can run its file manager from any window manager by typing dolphin. KDE, GNOME, LXDE, and XFCE install their own file managers while most of the unsupported desktops assume that you will install your favorite file manager. Table 9.3a summarizes the available file managers and indicates which desktop they are installed with. Some file managers can be installed independent of a desktop using AppCafe\u00ae to install the PBI. Once a file manager is installed, type its name if you wish to run it from another desktop.
