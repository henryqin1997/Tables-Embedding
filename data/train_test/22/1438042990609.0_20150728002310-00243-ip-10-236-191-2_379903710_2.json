            "Courageous, Duty, Patriotism. A defending of Western Civilization",
            "Downplays the Resurrection,[7] and strength of Christianity and omits powerful angels; instead exaggerates triumph of evil; film had little lasting effect on public or its producer; portrayed nails as through the hands rather than through the wrists as depicted by the Shroud of Turin and confirmed by modern science.",
            "Falsely teaches that humanism is what makes life worthwhile; marginalizes faith with a cartoonish depiction and demonizes capitalism as sadistic and greedy.",
            "A favorite of both Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton; John Wayne said it was \"the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life\";[8] though susceptible of various interpretations, most of all it seems to scare people into wanting more government.",
            "College students fight back against a campus where the administration promotes official diversity awareness weekends and radical feminism, veganism, and political correctness run amok, but a conservative group on campus is also portrayed just as negatively as the P.C. groups.",
            "A classic starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day in which conservative values triumph over liberal ones. There are no distortions by feminist ideology. Indeed, in one scene a leading man slaps the leading lady, but then is beaten up by dimwitted bystanders for it!",
            "Comedy musical. A story of redemption, \"A mission from God\", raising money to save a Catholic orphanage. R-rated movie for vulgar language, slap stick comedy. Vatican approved. [9]",
            "Unique in the way that it appears liberal to liberals while unintentionally sending a conservative message to young women.",
            "Some conservative messages and no feminism or other political correctness; mocks public school and even television. Followed in 1982 by a much panned sequel, Grease 2.",
            "Pregnant sheriff with traditional American family values solves an elaborate criminal embezzlement, kidnapping and murder scheme.",
            "A pregnant teenage woman rejects abortion and decides for an adoptive birth instead. This movie pushes feminism and marginalizes the essential role of fatherhood.",
            "The famous jousting scene is a powerful display of Christian values and chivalry, but the movie seems lost afterward.",
            "The British biopic of Conservative Party leader and 1979-90 British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, showing the effects of conservative economic policy on Britain, helping to lift the country out of its recession.",
            "Portrays the liberal EPA as a villainous and devious agency, and portrays the Government in general as intrusive and corrupt.",
            "Contains some conservative messages such as the triumph of chivalry as well as the negative effects of deviancy and drug/alcohol addiction, although the film also promotes negative values including premarital sexual activity and disregard for chasity. Included two sequels in 1989 and 1990.",
            "Criticizes the effects of research into genetic cloning, although the film's source material has been credited to inspiring further research into cloning. Included two sequels in 1997 and 2001 and a planned fouth entry in 2013.",
            "Political comedy depicts the Democratic candidate (Will Ferrell) as an obnoxious, drunken womanizer and satire of John Edwards, although the Republican candidate (Zach Galifinakis) is portrayed just as negatively as a corrupt capitalist.",
            "Unemployed, immature and childish 23-year old Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) has a one night stand with serious career woman Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), with the unintended consequence of pregnancy. Alison's mother (Joanna Kerns) says she should get the pregnancy \"taken care of\", while Ben's best friend Jonah (Jonah Hill) suggests that \"I won't say the A-word, but it rhymes with abortion.\" Alison decides to keep the child, while Ben decides to find a real job, grow up, and become a father."
