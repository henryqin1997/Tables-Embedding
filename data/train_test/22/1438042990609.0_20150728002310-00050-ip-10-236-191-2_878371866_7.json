But it was a shock to many when O'Neill turned his back on Leeds, and Graham's former assistant David O'Leary was appointed instead. He quickly worked wonders with a predominantly young, inexperienced side, and they managed to qualify for the UEFA Cup in fourth place - their highest finish since winning the title seven years earlier. The acquisition of brilliant young striker Michael Bridges from Sunderland at the end of the season gave Leeds fans hope of more success - and preferably silverware - next time round.}",
