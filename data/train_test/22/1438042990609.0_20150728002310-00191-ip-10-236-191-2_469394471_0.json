Section 1350 as adopted pursuant to section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley, 262486=During April 2011, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 2,500 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock at an exercise price of $1.38 per share and a five year life to a consultant for services to be rendered over three years. The Company recognized $280 and $557 and $172 and $409 in expense related to this warrant for the three and six months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively., 333580=The above only incorporates those exposures that existed as of September\u00a030, 2012, and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. If we diversify our investment portfolio into securities and other investment alternatives, we may face increased risk and exposures as a result of interest risk and the securities markets in general., 329528=Net cash used in investing activities totaled $46,779 during the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012, and was attributable to the purchase of property and equipment., 330187=As discussed in Note\u00a01 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, there exists substantial doubt regarding the Company\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company completed a private placement in March of 2012. The funds raised are being used for working capital purposes and to continue our sales efforts to advance the Company\u0092s commercialization of the Cryoport Express\u00ae Solution. Management has estimated that cash on hand as of September\u00a030, 2012 and forecasted sales will be sufficient to allow the Company to continue its operations into the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. However, the Company\u0092s management recognizes that the Company will need to obtain additional capital to fund its operations thereafter and until sustained profitable operations are achieved. Management is currently exploring such funding alternatives in order to secure sufficient operating capital. In addition, management will continue to review its operations for further cost reductions to extend the cash runway and utilize third parties for services such as its international recycling and refurbishment centers to provide for greater flexibility in aligning operational expenses with the sales ramp., 208775=Cash flows from the tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options or warrants are classified as financing cash flows. Due to the Company\u0092s loss position, there were no such tax benefits during the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011., 263014=On March\u00a07, 2011, the Company entered into an Advisory Services Agreement with Marc Grossman M.D. to provide strategic business advice for which he was issued a fully-vested warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock at an exercise price of $0.77 per share, in addition to a fee of $125,000. The fair value of this warrant was $302,769 as calculated using Black-Scholes and was recorded as an other current asset. The agreement ended in March 2012. For the three and six months ended September 30, 2011 the Company recognized $75,693 and $151,385 in expense related to this warrant and is included in selling, general and administrative in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations., 297154=As of September\u00a030, 2012, there was $478,172 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average vesting period of 3.21 years., 336418=There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September\u00a030, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting., 335509=As required by Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September\u00a030, 2012 at the reasonable assurance level., 322362=Net revenues. Net revenues were $424,896 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012, as compared to $234,464 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2011. The $190,432 or 81% increase is primarily driven by an increase in the number of customers utilizing our services compared to the same period in the prior year., 302248=The following management discussion and analysis of the Company\u0092s financial condition and results of operations (\u0093MD&A\u0094) should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September\u00a030, 2012 (unaudited) and the consolidated balance sheet as of March\u00a031, 2012 (audited) and the related unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011 and the related notes thereto (see Item\u00a01. Financial Statements) as well as the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of March\u00a031, 2012 and 2011 and for the years then ended included in the Company\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March\u00a031, 2012., 196407=If indicators of impairment exist, we assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated, we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the fair value to the carrying value. We believe the future cash flows to be received from the long-lived assets will exceed the assets\u0092 carrying value, and accordingly, we have not recognized any impairment losses at September\u00a030, 2012 or March\u00a031, 2012., 8284=(949)\u00a0470-2300, 229413=On October\u00a019, 2010, the Company secured a one-year renewal of the line of credit (the \u0093Line\u0094) for a reduced amount of $90,000 which was secured by a $90,000 certificate of deposit with a financial institution. On August\u00a025, 2011, the Company paid the entire balance in full and the line has been terminated. All borrowings under the revolving line of credit bore variable interest based on either the prime rate plus 1.5%\u00a0per annum or 5.0%, whichever was higher. The Company utilized the funds advanced from the Line for capital equipment purchases to support the commercialization of the Company\u0092s Cryoport Express\u00ae Dry Shipper. During the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2011, the Company recorded interest expense of $587 and $1,725, respectively, related to the Line., 316127=We have incurred losses since inception in 2003 and have an accumulated deficit of $63,027,526 through September\u00a030, 2012., 232924=On March\u00a07, 2011, the Company entered into a one-year advisory services agreement with Marc Grossman, M.D. to provide strategic business advisory services including identifying and introducing customers, advising on sales and marketing plans and providing financial advice. Dr.\u00a0Grossman is a former officer of the Company and is one of the four related parties to which Cryoport has an outstanding unsecured debt obligation. For these services, Dr.\u00a0Grossman was paid a fee of $125,000, which was amortized over the term of the agreement, and in addition, Dr.\u00a0Grossman was issued a warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock at an exercise price of $0.77 per share which was fully vested upon issuance (see Note 8)., 260200=On September\u00a022, 2011, the Company\u0092s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company\u0092s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to authorize a class of undesignated or \u0093blank check\u0094 preferred stock, which had previously been approved by the Company\u0092s Board of Directors on July\u00a019, 2011, consisting of 2,500,000 shares at $0.001 par value per share. Shares of preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, with such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as shall be fixed by the Company\u0092s Board of Directors., 195881=Amortization expense for intangible assets for the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011 was $29,197 and $57,385 and $23,906 and $47,627, respectively. All of the Company\u0092s intangible assets are subject to amortization., 325655=Interest expense. Interest expense was $36,359 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012, as compared to $241,068 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2011. Interest expense for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 included accrued interest on our related party notes payable of approximately $22,000, amortization of the debt discount of approximately $9,000 and interest expense on our convertible debentures of approximately $3,000. Interest expense for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2011 included accrued interest on our related party notes payable of approximately $25,000, amortization of the debt discount of approximately $128,000 and interest expense on our convertible debentures of approximately $85,000., 191088=The Company\u0092s inventories consist of accessories that are sold and shipped to customers along with pay-per-use containers that are not returned to the Company along with the containers at the culmination of the customer\u0092s shipping cycle. Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or current estimated market value. Cost is determined using the standard cost method which approximates the first-in, first-to-expire method. At September\u00a030, 2012 and March\u00a031, 2012, the Company\u0092s inventories consisted of $28,340 and $32,559 in raw materials, respectively, and $27,579 and $19,195 in finished goods, respectively., 179641=The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP and have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have sustained operating losses since our inception and have used substantial amounts of working capital in our operations. Further, at September\u00a030, 2012, we had an accumulated deficit of $63,027,526, we had a net loss of $3,098,511 and we used cash in operations of $2,655,869 during the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern., 233988=On July\u00a029, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Ms.\u00a0Catherine\u00a0M. Doll, a consultant, to the offices of Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Corporate Secretary, which became effective on August\u00a020, 2009. Ms.\u00a0Doll resigned the offices of Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Corporate Secretary on June\u00a027, 2011, effective immediately following the Company\u0092s filing of its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March\u00a031, 2011. Ms.\u00a0Doll is the owner and chief executive officer of The Gilson Group, LLC. The Gilson Group, LLC provides financial and accounting consulting services, including SEC and financial reporting, budgeting and forecasting to the Company. Related-party consulting fees for all services provided by The Gilson Group, LLC, were approximately $76,000 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2011., 253768=Total rental expense was approximately $49,000 and $107,000 and $73,000 and $150,000 for the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, respectively., 319919=Interest expense. Interest expense was $11,759 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012, as compared to $107,757 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011. Interest expense for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012 included accrued interest on our related party notes payable of approximately $11,000. Interest expense for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011 included accrued interest on our related party notes payable of approximately $12,000, amortization of the debt discount of approximately $58,000 and interest expense on our convertible debentures of approximately $37,000., 327000=Change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The gain on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities was $33,824 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012, compared to a gain of $48,968 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2011. The gain for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 was the result of a decrease in the value of our warrant derivatives, due primarily to a decrease in our stock price., 35466=Accounts receivable, net of allowances of $12,300 at September\u00a030, 2012 and $5,500 at March\u00a031, 2012, 276249=A summary of employee and director options and warrant activity for the six month period ended September\u00a030, 2012 is presented below:, 176412=On January\u00a024, 2011, the Company announced that, in conjunction with the Company, FedEx had launched its deep frozen shipping solution using our CryoPort Express\u00ae Dry Shipper. From March through September 2012, the Company worked closely with FedEx to further align its sales efforts and accelerate penetration within FedEx\u0092s healthcare customer base through improved processes, sales incentives, joint customer calls and more frequent communication at the sales and executive level. In addition, the Company has developed a FedEx branded portal, powered by the Cryoportal, which will be used by FedEx and its customers giving them access to the full capabilities of our logistics management platform., 297895=On November 5, 2012, we reported that our board of directors had appointed Jerrell W. Shelton to serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer, effective as of November 5, 2012. Mr. Shelton was recently elected as a member of the Board of Directors on October 22, 2012. In connection with Mr. Shelton\u0092s appointment as our President and Chief Executive Officer, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Shelton, which the parties executed on November 5, 2012., 319066=Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $101,656 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012, as compared to $124,705 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011. Our research and development efforts are focused on continually improving the features of the Cryoport Express\u00ae System including the web-based customer service portal and the Cryoport Express\u00ae Dry Shippers., 322828=Gross loss and cost of revenues. Gross loss for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 was 64% of net revenues, or $273,162 as compared to 206% of net revenues, or $483,366, for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2011. The decrease in gross loss in absolute dollars is primarily due to increase in net revenues. Cost of revenues for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 was 164% of net revenues, or $698,058, as compared to 306% of net revenues, or $717,830, for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2011. The cost of revenues exceeded net revenues due to fixed manufacturing costs and plant underutilization., 262010=During July 2011, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 10,000 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock at an exercise price of $1.20 and a five year life to a consultant for services to be rendered within one year. The Company recognized $8,297 in expense related to these warrants for the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2011., 217560=The following table presents the Company\u0092s warrants measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September\u00a030, 2012 and March\u00a031, 2012 classified using the valuation hierarchy:, 189933=The majority of the Company\u0092s customers are in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and life science industries. Consequently, there is a concentration of receivables within these industries, which is subject to normal credit risk. At September\u00a030, 2012, net revenues for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 from one customer accounted for 11%, of our total net revenues. No customers accounted for more than 10% of revenues during the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012. At September\u00a030, 2011, net revenues for the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2011 from two major customers accounted for 31%, of our total net revenues. The Company maintains reserves for bad debt and such losses, in the aggregate, which historically have not exceeded our estimates., 266291=On October\u00a09, 2009, the Company\u0092s stockholders approved and adopted the 2009 Plan, which had previously been approved by the Company\u0092s Board of Directors on August\u00a031, 2009. The 2009 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock rights, restricted stock, performance share units, performance shares, performance cash awards, stock appreciation rights, and stock grant awards (collectively, \u0093Awards\u0094) to employees, officers, non-employee directors, consultants and independent contractors of the Company. The 2009 Plan also permits the grant of awards that qualify for the \u0093performance-based compensation\u0094 exception to the $1,000,000 limitation on the deduction of compensation imposed by Section\u00a0162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. A total of 1,200,000 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock are authorized for the granting of Awards under the 2009 Plan. The number of shares available for future Awards, as well as the terms of outstanding Awards, is subject to adjustment as provided in the 2009 Plan for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and other similar events. Awards may be granted under the 2009 Plan until the sooner of October\u00a09, 2019 or until all shares available for Awards under the 2009 Plan have been purchased or acquired. The Company is authorized to issue up to 1,200,000 shares under this plan and as of September\u00a030, 2012, the Company has 273,491 shares available for future Awards under the 2009 Plan., 59397=Common stock, $0.001 par value; 250,000,000 shares authorized; 37,760,628 shares issued and outstanding at September\u00a030, 2012 and March\u00a031, 2012, 332572=A primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk. Based on our overall cash and cash equivalents interest rate exposure at as of September\u00a030, 2012, a near-term change in interest rates, based on historical movements, would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations., 320681=Interest income. Interest income was $0 for the three month period ended September\u00a030, 2012 as compared to $4,960 for the three month period ended September\u00a030, 2011. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to decrease in average cash balance of interest bearing accounts during the current quarter., 244625=In accordance with current accounting guidance, certain of the Company\u0092s outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock are treated as derivatives because these instruments have reset or ratchet provisions in the event the Company raises additional capital at a lower price, among other adjustments. As such, the fair value of these common stock purchase warrants and embedded conversion features were treated as derivative liabilities since their date of issuance or modification. Changes in fair value are recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense at each reporting date. If the fair value of the derivatives is higher at the subsequent balance sheet date, the Company will record a non-operating, non-cash charge. If the fair value of the derivatives is lower at the subsequent balance sheet date, the Company will record non-operating, non-cash income. As of September\u00a030, 2012 and March\u00a031, 2012 the Company had derivative warrant liabilities of $3,510 and $37,334, respectively., 213440=Basic loss per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average shares outstanding assuming all dilutive potential common shares were issued. In addition, in computing the dilutive effect of convertible securities, the numerator is adjusted to add back the after-tax amount of interest, if any, recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt. For the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, the Company was in a loss position and the basic and diluted loss per share are the same since the effect of stock options, warrants and convertible notes payable on loss per share was anti-dilutive and thus not included in the diluted loss per share calculation. The impact under the treasury stock method of dilutive stock options and warrants and the if-converted method of convertible debt would have resulted in weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately 37,761,000 and 37,779,000, and 36,482,000 and 35,521,000 for the three and six month periods ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, respectively., 328817=For the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012, we used $2,655,869 of cash for operations primarily as a result of the net loss of $3,098,511 including non-cash expenses of $447,358 mainly from the fair value of stock options and warrants, depreciation and change in fair value of derivative instruments. Net operating losses decreased as a result of a decrease in headcount. Offsetting the cash impact of our net operating loss (excluding non-cash items) was an increase in Accounts payable and accrued expenses of $78,300 and a decrease in other current assets of $27,340., 322135=Six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 compared to six months ended September\u00a030, 2011:, 188174=The Company grants credit to customers within the U.S. and to a limited number of international customers and does not require collateral. Revenues from international customers are generally secured by advance payments except for a limited number of established foreign customers. The Company generally requires advance or credit card payments for initial revenues from new customers. The Company\u0092s ability to collect receivables is affected by economic fluctuations in the geographic areas and industries served by the Company. Reserves for uncollectible amounts are provided based on past experience and a specific analysis of the accounts which management believes is sufficient. Accounts receivable at September\u00a030, 2012 and March\u00a031, 2012 are net of reserves for doubtful accounts of approximately $12,300 and $5,500, respectively. Although the Company expects to collect amounts due, actual collections may differ from the estimated amounts., 48872=Convertible debentures payable and accrued interest, net of discount of $0 at September\u00a030, 2012 and $8,843 at March\u00a031, 2012, 317183=Net revenues. Net revenues were $233,597 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012, as compared to $110,713 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011. The $122,884 or 111% increase is primarily driven by an increase in the number of customers utilizing our services compared to the same period in the prior year., 194507=Depreciation expense for property and equipment was $92,705 and $159,546 and $59,254 and $114,424 for the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, respectively., 289138=Exercisable at September\u00a030, 2012, 261482=During December 2011, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 155,844 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock at an exercise price of $0.77 per share and a five year life to a consultant for services to be rendered over two years. The service agreement was terminated in May 2012. The Company recognized $8,084 in expense related to this warrant for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012., 17757=Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended September\u00a0 30, 2012 and 2011, 13478=As of November\u00a02, 2012 the Company had 37,760,628, shares of its $0.001 par value common stock issued and outstanding., 343151=Act of 2002., 328141=As of September\u00a030, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,669,634 and working capital of $1,221,464. As of March\u00a031, 2012, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4,617,535 and working capital of $4,024,120. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our debt and equity securities. From March 2005 through September\u00a030, 2012, we have received net proceeds of approximately $32.8 million from sales of our common stock and the issuance of promissory notes, warrants and debt., 212243=In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u0093FASB\u0094) issued an interpretation which clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with current guidance. The updated guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold. The Company did not record any unrecognized tax benefits upon adoption of the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company\u0092s policy is to recognize interest and penalties that would be assessed in relation to the settlement value of unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense., 193126=Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Cryogenic shippers, which comprise 86% of the Company\u0092s net property and equipment balance at September\u00a030, 2012, are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three years. Equipment and furniture are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives (generally three to seven years) and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is shorter. Equipment acquired under capital leases is amortized over the estimated useful life of the assets or term of the lease, whichever is shorter and included in depreciation and amortization expense., 326543=Interest income. Interest income was $0 for the six month period ended September\u00a030, 2012 as compared to $11,815 for the six month period ended September\u00a030, 2011. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to decrease in average cash balance of interest bearing accounts during the current quarter., 189265=The Company has foreign net revenues primarily in Europe, Japan, and India. During the three month periods ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, the Company had foreign sales of approximately $98,000 and $61,000, respectively, which constituted approximately 42% and 55%, respectively, of net revenues. During the six month periods ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, the Company had foreign sales of approximately $179,000 and $121,000, respectively, which constituted approximately 42% and 51%, respectively, of net revenues., 185141=The Company\u0092s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, related-party notes payable and accrued interest, convertible notes payable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The carrying value for all such instruments approximates fair value at September\u00a030, 2012 and March\u00a031, 2012, due to their short term nature. The difference between the fair value and recorded values of the related party notes payable and accrued interest is not significant. The Company\u0092s restricted cash is carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value at March\u00a031, 2012., 321141=Change in fair value of derivative liabilities. The gain on the change in fair value of derivative liabilities was $14,489 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012, compared to a gain of $14,685 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011. The gain for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012 was the result of a decrease in the value of our warrant derivatives, due primarily to a decrease in our stock price., 243100=The October 2007 Debentures was convertible into shares of the Company\u0092s common stock at a price of $3.00 per share. The debentures bore interest at 8%\u00a0per annum. The Company had been obligated to make principal or additional interest payments since March\u00a01, 2011 with respect to the outstanding balances of the debentures. The Company made the monthly principal payments of $200,000 and quarterly interest payments. The debentures were repaid during the quarter ended June 2012., 252303=We currently lease two facilities, with approximately 11,900 square feet of corporate, research and development, and warehouse facilities, located in Lake Forest, California (\u0093Lake Forest Facility\u0094) and approximately 4,100 square feet of corporate facilities located in San Diego, California (\u0093San Diego Facility\u0094). In June 2010, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Lake Forest Facility lease and extended the lease for sixty months commencing July\u00a01, 2010 with a right to cancel the lease with a minimum of 120 day written notice at any time after December\u00a031, 2012 and adjusted the base lease payments to a range over the life of the agreement of $7,010 per month to $8,911 per month, plus operating expenses. On April\u00a011, 2011, the Company entered into an office service agreement with Regis Management Group, LLC (Lessor) for six (6)\u00a0executive offices in San Diego which the Company terminated effective December\u00a031, 2011. Aggregate base lease payments for these offices were approximately $9,250 per month. On November\u00a028, 2011, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the San Diego Facility for a thirty six month period ending December\u00a031, 2014. Base lease payments range over the life of the agreement of $8,621 per month to $9,442 per month, plus operating expenses., 286141=Outstanding at September\u00a030, 2012, 316953=Three months ended September\u00a030, 2012 compared to three months ended September\u00a030, 2011:, 180509=We expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses from costs related to the commercialization of our Cryoport Express\u00ae shipping solution and do not expect that revenues from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our funding requirements in the near term. We believe that our working capital at September\u00a030, 2012 of approximately $1.2 million, together with the revenues generated from our services and the continued focus on cost reductions of non-sales generating costs will be sufficient to sustain our planned operations into the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013; however, we must obtain additional capital to fund operations thereafter and for the achievement of sustained profitable operations. We are currently exploring funding alternatives in order to secure sufficient operating capital to allow us to continue to operate as a going concern., 295138=September\u00a030, 2011, 318435=Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,341,333 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012, as compared to $1,564,456 for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011.

Gross loss for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012 was 47% of net revenues, or $110,843 as compared to 228% of net revenues, or $252,837, for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011. The decrease in gross loss in absolute dollars is primarily due to increase in net revenues. Cost of revenues for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012 was 147% of net revenues, or $344,440, as compared to 328% of net revenues, or $363,550, for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011. The cost of revenues exceeded net revenues due to fixed manufacturing costs and plant underutilization., 267942=On September\u00a022, 2011, the Company\u0092s stockholders approved and adopted the 2011 Plan, which had previously been approved by the Company\u0092s Board of Directors on July\u00a019, 2011. The 2011 Plan provides for the grant of Awards to employees, officers, non-employee directors and consultants of the Company. The Company\u0092s Compensation Committee has the authority to determine the type of Award as well as the amount, terms and conditions of each Award under the 2011 Plan, subject to the limitations and other provisions of the 2011 Plan. A total of 2,300,000 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock were authorized for the granting of Awards under the 2011 Plan. The number of shares available for Awards, as well as the terms of outstanding Awards, is subject to adjustment as provided in the 2011 Plan for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and other similar events. On September\u00a013, 2012 the stockholders approved an increase to the number of shares of the Company\u0092s common stock available for issuance by 3,000,000 shares. Awards may be granted under the 2011 Plan until September\u00a021, 2021 or until all shares available for Awards under the 2011 Plan have been purchased or acquired unless the stockholders of the Company vote to approve an extension of the 2011 Plan prior to such expiration date. As of September\u00a030, 2012, the Company is authorized to issue up to 5,300,000 shares under this plan and has 3,728,733 shares available for future issuances as of September\u00a030, 2012., 279383=Outstanding at March\u00a031, 2012, 198631=During the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2011, the Company incurred $0 and $36,543, respectively, of offering costs in connection with the private placement that closed in February 2011 which were charged to additional paid-in capital and netted against the proceeds received in the private placements.

As a result of the factors described above, net loss for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2012 decreased by $477,408 to $1,552,702 or $0.04 per share compared to a net loss of $2,030,110 or $0.07 per share for the three months ended September\u00a030, 2011., 18614=Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended September\u00a0 30, 2012 and 2011, 294111=September\u00a030, 2012, 329833=Net cash used in financing activities totaled $245,253 during the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012, and resulted primarily from payment of financing costs of 122,453 and repayment of convertible debt of $82,800., 245774=During the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized aggregate gains of $14,489 and $33,824 and $14,685 and $48,968, respectively, due to the change in fair value of its derivative instruments. (See Note 2)., 163734=For the Six Months Ended September\u00a030, 2012 and 2011, 16923=Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September\u00a030, 2012 (Unaudited) and at March\u00a031, 2012, 324388=Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $210,607 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012, as compared to $225,935 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2011.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,610,607 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2012, as compared to $3,192,778 for the six months ended September\u00a030, 2011. The $582,171 decrease reflects the decrease in headcount, in particular a temporary decrease in the sales in marketing department due to the replacement of certain sales representatives, and resignation of our Chief Executive Officer in April 2012. Offsetting this decrease is a severance payment of approximately $180,000 paid to the former Chief Executive Officer in April 2012., 165074=Operating results for the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending March\u00a031, 2013.

These estimates will be revised, if necessary, in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates. Changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. The estimated forfeiture rates at September 30, 2012 and March\u00a031, 2012 was zero as the Company has not had a significant history of forfeitures and does not expect significant forfeitures in the future., 296163=There were options to purchase 950,000 and 1,564,794 shares of common stock granted to employees and directors during the three and six months ended September\u00a030, 2012, respectively.

The parties entered into the Second Amendment to clarify their mutual intent and understanding that all license rights granted to the Company under the Agreement, as amended, shall survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement. In addition, in recognition that the Company has paid KLATU less than the market rate for comparable services, the Second Amendment provides that if the Company terminates the Agreement without cause, which the Company has no intention of doing, or liquidates, KLATU shall be entitled to receive additional consideration for its services provided from the commencement of the Agreement through such date of termination, which additional compensation shall not be less than $2 million plus two times the \u0093cost of work\u0094 (as defined in the Agreement).
