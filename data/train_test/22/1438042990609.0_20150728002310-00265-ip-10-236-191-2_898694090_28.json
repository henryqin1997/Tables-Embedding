Every Halloween, students can participate in the Nearly Naked Mile and run downtown in their underwear or costumes. St. Patrick\u00e2??s Day is known for parties on The Hill, Boulder\u00e2??s college and Greek neighborhood, with parties in excess of 1000 people and couches burning in the streets. (Don\u00e2??t worry \u00e2?? violence is pretty rare.) 4/20 is one of the most popular yet controversial events, with large gatherings of students on campus to smoke marijuana. However, CU has recently banned smoking on campus and took measures to prevent the tradition last year. Marijuana is now legal to possess in Colorado, although it is still against the Federal Law. It is legal to possess in Boulder, and illegal to smoke in public, although many Boulder police don\u00e2??t seem to mind., 106206=Watch out when applying for the dorms. If you aren't sure you want to, then don't apply too soon. If you do apply and then decide you don't want to live in the dorms, get out quickly and petition for staying somewhere else. Also, watch out for the fees like the health care plan and such. They add up to well over $2000 sometimes., 167326=For students from Colorado, the university is easily the most expensive public choice and it is difficult to see why. The rec center was literally built before my parents graduated from CU and many of the buildings are poorly prepared for academics such as my programming classroom which did not have a projector despite the professor's repeated requests. More, the university creates a facade of monies well spent while essentially throwing student funds down the drain. A new and unneeded dining hall and an athletic center for losing teams were recently given funding over an expansion for the crammed and nationally ranked engineering school and the unchanged-since-the-1970's environmental design building. And the dorms aren't cheap, nearly $1000 a month per person for a 12x12 room with shared bathrooms is hardly a steal even in Boulder and $8 a meal is above eating out. Verdict, unless you have a major you can't do anywhere else, find somewhere else. Coming from out of state? forget it, tuition is more than many private schools., 901246=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 544907=The oldest structure on campus, it was built in 1876, is this gorgeous building called Old Main. Because it is so beautiful, people get married there and it hosts special events. Also every October, CU Boulder hosts the Nearly Naked Mile for homeless shelters. Every runner donates 5 items of clothing and then we run a mile through campus in \u00e2??minimal\u00e2?? clothing. It is so much fun! During football season, Ralphie, our REAL buffalo mascot, leads the football team into Folsom Field at the beginning of games and the \u00e2??Ralphie Runners\u00e2?? run him around the field. This also happens at the end of half-time. Then every Thursday, there is a glow in the dark bike ride through campus. They play music, decorate their bikes in neon strips, and ride everywhere through campus!, 184609=Boulder is a wonderful place to live. The weather is gorgeous, the people are friendly, anything a student needs whether it be a place for school or living supplies, books, food, entertainment, or a great coffee shop to study or just relax at, is within a 1 mile radius of campus. On top of that, there are 5 major ski resorts under 2 hours away and they are very easy to drive to. It's great to be able to get up early on a weekend morning, get to the mountain by 8:30 when the lifts open, ski all day, and be back in time to study at night!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students CU Boulder is definitely great for students who are interested in the environment because Boulder is such an environmentally friendly town. There also a lot of things for people who like the outdoors to do (for example, hiking, skating, mountain climbing, biking, jogging, etc). There is actually a place for everyone because there are different schools and so many different student-fun clubs. You should visit the school if you haven't already, and you'll see that there are all different types of people that attend. Tips for prospective students For your first couple of days, you should carry a campus map around with you. Some of the planners they sell in the book stores come with maps in the back, so that's not a problem. Also, at the end of each semester, make sure that you sell your books back to Shipping On the Hill, because they give you more money than the school book store does. Also make sure that you manage time wisely. It can be easy to get into the habit of partying every weekend, but make sure you study, because when finals come along, so do the consequences. Bang for the buck CU Boulder is pretty expensive, but it's worth it. So much of the tuition money you pay goes toward making the",
