Such moieties include but are not limited to lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86, 6553), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1994, 4, 1053), a thioether, e.g., hexyl-S-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1992, 660, 306; Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3, 2765), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20, 533), an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues (Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J., 1991, 10, 111; Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259, 327; Svinarchuk et al., Biochimie, 1993, 75, 49), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethyl-ammonium 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 3651; Shea et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1990, 18, 3777), a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain (Manoharan et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1995, 14, 969), or adamantane acetic acid (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 3651), a palmityl moiety (Mishra et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1995, 1264, 229), or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety (Crooke et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 277, 923), all references incorporated herein by reference., 40061=CE analysis of PCR amplified DNA has been reported using non-gel sieving buffers and fluorescent intercalating dyes. The identification of DNA molecules by pre-column hybridization followed by capillary electrophoresis with on-line fluorescence detection has been described (Chen et al., Journal of Chromatography, 1991, 559, 295-305)., 40416=CGE has been used to separate peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-oligonucleotide heteroduplexes from free single-strand oligonucleotide and single strand peptide nucleic acid (Rose et al., Anal. Biochem., 1993, 65, 3545-3549). PNAs are capable of hybridization to complementary DNA or RNA sequences to form hybridized moieties which are more stable (i.e., which have higher binding affinities and higher melting temperatures) than corresponding \"natural\" duplexes. See Antisense Research and Applications, Crooke and Lebleu, eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993., 79037=Oligomeric compounds amenable to the present invention can include heterocyclic base (often referred to in the art as \"nucleobase\" or simply as \"base\") modifications or substitutions. As used herein, \"unmodified\" or \"natural\" nucleobases include the purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U). Modified nucleobases include other synthetic and natural nucleobases including but not limited to 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine and 2-thiocytosine, 5-halouracil and cytosine, 5-propynyl uracil and cytosine, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 4-thiouracil, 8-halo, 8-amino, 8-thiol, 8-thioalkyl, 8-hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, 5-halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 7-methylguanine and 7-methyladenine, 8-azaguanine and 8-azaadenine, 7-deazaguanine and 7-deazaadenine and 3-deazaguanine and 3-deazaadenine. Further nucleobases include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,808, those disclosed in the Concise Encyclopedia Of Polymer Science And Engineering, pages 858-859, Kroschwitz, J. I., ed. John Wiley & Sons, 1990, and those disclosed by Englisch et al., Angewandte Chemie, International Edition, 1991, 30, 613. Certain of these nucleobases are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of the oligonucleotide analogs of the invention. These include 5-substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and O-6 substituted purines, including 2-aminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynylcytosine. 5-methylcytosine substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2\ufffd C. (Sanghvi, Y. S., Crooke, S. T. and Lebleu, B., eds., Antisense Research and Applications, CRC Press, Boca Raton,1993, pp. 276-278)., 40997=Central to the development of antisense therapeutics possessing useful pharmacological activity is the issue of nuclease resistance. Nucleases are enzymes which degrade nuclei acids into smaller pieces. For example, endonucleases cleave nucleic acids at internal sites (the phosphodiester bonds) in the nucleotide sequence. Exonucleases, on the other hand, cleave nucleotides sequentially from the free ends of linear nucleic acids. It has been well documented in the literature that short, unmodified oligonucleotides are inherently unstable in biological systems (as first reported by Wickstrom, E. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods, 1986, 13, 97). This was demonstrated by showing that the half life of a short, unmodified oligonucleotide in fetal calf serum was less than half of an hour., 70243=Chemical bonding of fluorescent labels, with or without a linking or tethering group, to oligomeric compounds, is well known in the art (see for example: Hill, J. J. and Royer, C. A., Methods Enzymol., 1997, 278, 390-416; and Amann et al., Microbiol. Rev., 1997, 20, 191-200). Typically, the fluorescent label is attached via a covalent bond using a tethering moiety., 89391=The present methods also overcome limitations inherent in CGE analysis using ultra violet detection. Ultra violet detection is less sensitive than LIF detection and therefore requires the use of larger amounts of samples. The analysis of samples using CGE-UV also requires additional steps including a membrane desalting step (referred to as \"Paulus paper\"). This desalting step has been reported to alter the composition of the metabolites in the sample undergoing quantitation. Therefore, CGE analysis using UV detection supplies qualitative rather than quantitative results (see Bruin et al., J. Chromatogr. A., 1995, 709, 181-195)., 81827=Other oligomeric compounds that are amenable to the present invention include gapped or chimeric oligomeric compounds. Such compounds have been referred to in the art as \"hybrids\" or \"gapmers.\" Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such hybrid structures include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,013,830; 5,149,797; 5,220,007; 5,256,775; 5,366,878; 5,403,711; 5,491,133; 5,565,350; 5,623,065; 5,652,355; 5,652,356; and 5,700,922, certain of which are commonly owned, and each of which is herein incorporated by reference, and commonly owned and allowed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/465,880, filed Jun. 6, 1995, also herein incorporated by reference., 81136=Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of certain of the above noted modified nucleobases as well as other modified nucleobases include, but are not limited to, the above noted U.S. Pat. No. 3,687,808, as well as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,845,205; 5,130,302; 5,134,066; 5,175,273; 5,367,066; 5,432,272; 5,457,187; 5,459,255; 5,484,908; 5,502,177; 5,525,711; 5,552,540; 5,587,469; 5,594,121, 5,596,091; 5,614,617; and 5,681,941, certain of which are commonly owned, and each of which is herein incorporated by reference, and commonly owned and allowed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/762,588, filed Dec. 10, 1996, also herein incorporated by reference., 67607=Many different types of agents having nuclease activity are amenable to the methods of the present invention. These agents include a wide variety of enzymes that are known to the art skilled and, in many cases, are commercially available. Such agents include snake venom phosphodiesterase and the bovine intestinal mucosal phosphodiesterase. Agents having nuclease activity also include chemical nucleases, a number of which have been characterized and studied (see the general review article: Sigman et al., Acc. Chem. Res. 1993, 26, 98-104, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety)., 84269=Additional preferred sugar substituents include those disclosed in U.S. application entitled \"RNA Targeted 2'-modified Oligonucleotides That Are Conformationally Preorganized\" filed Jul. 27, 1998 (Ser. No. 09/123,108); U.S. Application entitled \"Aminooxy-modified Oligonucleotides\" filed Jan. 30, 1998 (Ser. No. 09/016,520); U.S. application entitled \"Aminooxy-modified Oligonucleotides And Methods For Making Same\" filed Aug. 7, 1998 (Ser. No. 09/130,973); and U.S. application entitled \"2'-o-dimethylaminoethyloxyethyl-modified Oligonucleotides\" filed Aug. 7, 1998 (Ser. No. 09/130,566). Each of the foregoing applications is commonly owned by the assignee of the present application. The contents of each of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety., 82561=Representative sugar modifications that are amenable to the present invention include 2' modifications such as OH, F, O--, S--, or N-alkyl, O--, S--, or N-alkenyl, or O, S-- or N-alkynyl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl are substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C10 alkyl or C2 to C10 alkenyl and alkynyl, particularly O[(CH2)n O]m OCH3, O(CH2)n OCH3, O(CH2)n NH2 or O(CH2)n CH3 where n and m are from 1 to about 10. Other 2' modifications include C1 to C10 lower alkyl; substituted lower alkyl, alkaryl, araalkyl, O-alkaryl or O-araalkyl, SH, SCH3, OCN, Cl, Br, CN, CF3, OCF3, SOCH3, SO2 CH3, ONO2, NO2, N3, NH2, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkaryl, aminoalkylamino, polyalkylamino, substituted silyl, an RNA cleaving group, a reporter group, an intercalator, a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an oligonucleotide, or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an oligonucleotide, and other substituents having similar properties. A preferred modification includes 2'-methoxyethoxy, i.e., an alkoxyalkoxy group (2'-O--CH2 CH2 OCH3, also known as 2'-O--(2-methoxyethyl)) (Martin et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1995, 78, 486). Other preferred modifications include 2'-methoxy (2'-O--CH3), 2'-aminopropoxy (2'-OCH2 CH2 CH2 NH2) and 2'-fluoro (2'-F)., 99048=Relative binding affinities were determined for labeled versus non-labeled oligomeric compounds in a competitive binding assay to an enzyme substrate with nuclease activity. The Ki (concentration of non-labeled oligonucleotide at which an enzyme exhibits half-maximal activity) with a fluorescently labeled substrate was also determined. The fluorescently labeled used was T19 diester (SEQ ID NO: 1) with fluorescein attached at the 5' end of the molecule. The competing non-labeled oligomeric compound was TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TT*T* T* (SEQ ID NO: 1) where each * represents a modified T wherein the modification is 2'-O-methoxyethyl, prepared according to the procedure of Martin et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1995 vol. 78 p.486 et seq., incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The enzyme in this example was bovine intestinal mucosal hosphodiesterase., 39700=There have been several reports of the use of CE in the detection of DNA species, such as in the high speed sequencing of DNA. For example, Luckey et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 1990, 18, 4417-4421, describes a CE instrument developed for automated DNA sequencing in which products are detected via the fluorescence of an intercalating dye., 68460=In preferred embodiments of the methods of the invention, fluorescently labeled full length oligomeric compounds, as well as the deletion species that are produced as the result of nuclease degradation, are detected using laser-induced fluorescence (\"LIF\"). LIF detection is well known in the art (see for example: Kleparnik et al., Electrophoresis, 1998, 19, 249-255; Chmelik et al., J. Chromatogr., 1997, 790, 93-100; and Wu et al., Clin. Chem., 1997, 43, 1660-1662). In one particularly preferred embodiment, the laser excitation is effected at 488 nm with the resultant emission at 520 nm. It will be appreciated, however, that the different fluorescent labels will be most advantageously employed with different excitation wavelengths. The selection of appropriate wavelength of excitation for a given fluorescent label will be apparent to those of skill in the art., 72893=As used herein, the term \"oligomeric compound\" refers to oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide analogs. The term \"oligonucleotide\" refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The term \"oligonucleotide analog\" refers to oligonucleotides composed of nucleobases, sugars and covalent intersugar (backbone) linkages that include at least one portion that is non-naturally-occurring. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties including, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target and increased stability in the presence of nucleases. A discussion of antisense oligonucleotides and some desirable modifications can be found, for example, in De Mesmaeker et al., Acc. Chem. Res., 1995, 28, 366, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.}",

Data was analyzed by determining the concentration of cleavage products that occurred. The electropherogram was initially integrated using Caesar software (V.6) to determine the fractional composition of each length of oligonucleotide. The fractional amount of each length was multiplied by the total concentration to determine the concentration of each length of oligonucleotide. Then the concentration of each length of oligonucleotide was multiplied by the number of cleavages required to produce that length oligonucleotide from the parent compound. The total number",
