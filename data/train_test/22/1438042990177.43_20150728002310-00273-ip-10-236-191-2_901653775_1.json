            "Oakwood is great for individuals who are looking to grow closer to Christ. He is definitely blessing this university.",
            "If you didn't have to work hard or study in high school, all of that changes in college. Come in with a bang. If you don't do well your freshman year, you are going to have to spend the following three years pulling your GPA up. That will not be fun.",
            "Every school has room for improvement. Oakwood definitely has its imperfections. I know that it is worth every penny because students would not jump through hoops to come back to school if it wasn't. At Oakwood, you don't just get an education that will get you a job. You are being taught how to live in accordance with God's word. You cannot put a price on your own salvation. In teaching you how to live according to God's words, they are helping you to teach others so His love and His words can continue to be spread.",
            "At first, I did not want to go to Oakwood. That seems to be a lot of students' stories; however, I ended up there and I am loving every minute of it. I have only been at Oakwood for one year, and I can already say it is the best school anyone could attend. It is so amazing to be around so many young individuals who have so much in common with you from the very beginning. Everyone hears that you will meet lifelong friends in college, but no one can imagine not being friends with their high school friends forever so that lifelong friend quote doesn't really phase them. It was not until I came to Oakwood and started making new friends that I began to understand how the people I was meeting could be lifelong friends. God blessed me with a lot of individuals who have the same goals that I do and the work ethic to get there. If you put Him first, He will make sure that you are surrounded by positive individuals. During my first year of college, I grew close to five different girls that I know will be in my life forever. In just one year, we have already gone through so much. We have watched each other grow as people and in Christ. We know that it is not going to stop at one year. People say that there will be no year like your freshman year and, while that may be true, I know that these next years are going to be even better than my freshman year. I would not trade anything in the world for the Oakwood Experience. I cannot wait to continue my college years.",
            "The faculty at Oakwood is wonderful. The teachers don't only teach the information in the textbook, but they also teach from the Bible. This is great because, in the end, the only wisdom that will truly count is what we learn from the Bible and apply to our lives. It doesn't matter what subject they're teaching. They all find some way to tie it into the Bible. I came from public school, so I was not used to this kind of teaching structure because it is not allowed. All of my teachers started class off with a devotional thought and/or prayer. I know that set the tone of how the class went. These teachers are truly a blessing because they are teaching us information that you cannot put a price on."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{110477=Oakwood is great for any christian student who has a passion for music. Oakwood produces many great musicians into the world: Musicians like Brian McKnight, Take 6, Virtue, and Commited. Oakwood University has many choirs that travel the world and many other various places. Also Oakwood University Aeolians Choirs are the reigning 2012 World Choir Olympics Champions., 304876=Oakwood is all about your perception. How you perceive it is what you will get. The friends are also what you make it. In addition, the teachers are, for the most part, supportive and caring. They want to see you succeed, and will do what ever it takes to help you reach your goal. There's also many communittee service opportunities in which you can participate. One day in October, there's something called Agape Day where the whole school shuts down and goes out in the community to help others. This year, the mayor came by to visit and share a few words before we left. You can also go on mission trips to other places to help out. Our choirs also travel to go and sing. Most of them stay in the states, however, our classical music choir (The Aeolians) travel around the world. You also get a good education and have opportunites to join programs that can help out with your future schooling (graduate school)., 231650=If your class starts at 3:30 what time should you leave Carter hall to get there?, 360683=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 236537=I stayed in Carter Hall for my freshman year, which wasn't bad. It needs a lot of work, but luckily it's getting rebuilt this year and will be ready by Spring 2014., 267205=Many may complain about the two major traditions that we have when you live on campus and you have not yet become a senior and they are worships and curfew. We are no longer required to have three worships a week in order to leave for the weekend, (after putting in a weekend leave) which may be a bother at times, but if we miss getting the three worships we do get a $10 fine. There are many opportunities to get three worships in during the week, but frankly sometimes you just forget or you just don't feel like going. When I came in, I didn't like the idea of getting three worships because I don't feel like anyone should be forced to get them, but as a matriculated through I realized it's just not that bad. It's a great way to pause from your work and refocus on God, relieving any stress that may have built up from the day. Chapel is something we have for an hour every Thursday morning at 10 AM to have praise and worship, news for students, and a positive thought for the day. If you don't have class until 2 PM it can be a drag, but it's for the good of the campus and its students. Curfew during the week for freshmen is at 12 AM and 1 AM on Saturday's, for upperclassmen its 1 AM every day of the week (except 11:30 PM for all students on Friday nights) while living on campus. This is a bother to many and on few occasions have been an issue for me, but honestly most of the time you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?re in before curfew any ways because it's a school night. All in all, Oakwood is trying to enforce discipline and values into our lives., 111645=In 2012 Oakwood has won many scholastic events. We are the 2012 National Champions in division 3 basketball. We currently just won the 2012 World Choir Olympics, and we produced the great singing group Committed who won the show The Sing Off., 166518=For those that kept their gpa's up in highschool, they have an opportunity to stay in the honors wing. It is first come first serve among those who fit the criteria so don't waste time applying for the honors wing. Describing the physical condition of Carter Hall is pointless because they are renovating the dorm this summer. So the class of 2013 will be in a new building. However, the RA's and Deans are very nice. They are very reasonable and fair when it comes to issues., 128902=Oakwood University is a decent institution. It is in between. May change lives for those who are religious.}",

When I first attended, I didn't appreciate it until I saw what the school was like. Now, that I'm officially gone, I realize how much I miss the school. The spiritual aspect is a plus! However, there were a couple issues here and there but nothing that one can't overcome and besides every school has his or her own issues. If I had the option again, I would go to Oakwood! Did learn a lot I learned a lot while attending Oakwood, both inside and outside of class. The school brings in wonderful speakers to talk to the students at different times. The motto, Enter to Learn Depart to Serve is definitely a phrase that Oakwood University stands true to.",
