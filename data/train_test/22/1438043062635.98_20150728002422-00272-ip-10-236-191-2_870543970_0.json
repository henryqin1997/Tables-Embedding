Really! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by Ozo_inked When I downloaded \"Complejo de Amor\" as the Cancion de Semana, I gave it a couple of listens anf next thing I know, my head is bobbing, foot is tapping... I'm liking it! A little bit of stuff in English, stuff in Spanish, but ultimately it's that banda tuba over the electro beats that keeps me listening. Give it a lisen, maybe you'll like it too!
