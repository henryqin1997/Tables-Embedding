Tips for prospective students Be open and expressive Bang for the buck Fairly high tuition but very much worth it, professors will answer any questions you have and advisors, teachers, staff, other students always have an open ear. Am enjoying being here Great welcoming atmosphere, friendly people. Professors always welcome questions even if they're not precisely on topic they will do their best to answer and if they cannot figure out an answer (i.e philosophical type question) students are asked and it becomes a discussion usually",
