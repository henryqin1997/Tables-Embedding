Last time out Webster was the man in the middle in the Football League Trophy fixture between Rotherham and Leicester City, which The Millers won 2-0. Four games in The Championship have been refereed by Webster this season, and his last visit to Bloomfield Road was in February this year when The Seasiders overcame Charlton Athletic 5-3 in a thriller, so he is clearly a good luck charm! So much of a good luck charm that the last time Pool lost in a game he refereed at home was all the way back in 2003, in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. Colin started refereeing in 1988 and progressed through the Wearside and Northern Leagues before being appointed to the national list of assistant referees in 1994 and the referees list in 2000. He was an assistant referee at the 2000 FA Trophy final., 16920=Ross County vs Blackpool (Wednesday July 22 2015), 16728=BST Bid Ignored (Wednesday July 22 2015), 18121=Lloyd Jones Extends Loan Deal (Monday August 3 2015), 24084=Date:Thursday November 6 2008, 16544=Squires Gate Undergoing Work (Tuesday July 21 2015), 17927=Thomas & McAlister Arrive At Bloomfield (Thursday July 30 2015)}",
