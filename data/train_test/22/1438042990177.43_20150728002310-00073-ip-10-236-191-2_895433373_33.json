            "There is campus police stationed right in the bottom of the campus center and they are there at all times. You will often see police cars circling the campus and there is always someone to reach very easily. I never felt unsafe on this campus, not even at night! Great area and safe place to go to school!",
            "There is always something going on! If Student Government is not throwing an activity, then the Transfer Center or international office is doing it. There are University transfer days, where many Universities come to the campus and help you with your decision. We have private sessions where you can talk to reps of Colleges and sessions that help you filling out your application. There are over 40+ clubs every quarter and it is almost impossible not to find anything you will like, and if you don't - start a club!",
            "I think this campus is great for every student. It works for someone who just wants to get those last 2 requirements or for students that want to start out as freshmen and then transfer as a junior. The campus is very diverse and has many support programs for financially weak students, minorities or single parents. There is a place for everyone and this is what makes this experience so unique.",
            "We have a japanese tea garden, which is this beautiful little place where you can relax between the bamboo or learn something about japanese culture. We also have the KCI - which is a center where students can use any adobe software on a Apple or PC and do their own design work without paying for the software.",
            "This is the best option you can get for a Community College. There are honors classes, the transfer agreement program with the University of California Campuses and many resources available to you every day. If you want to transfer and you are thinking of a College, this is the place for you!",
            "The campus is just beautiful and invites to outdoor activities. You can take any PE class and use the pool, gym, tennis court, tracks or soccer field at most of the times of the day. There are also a lot of student government activities going on every Wednesday and the clubs on campus are always a great way to meet new people. We have each quarter about 40 clubs on campus and it is very easy to start your own, if there is nothing there for you :)",
            "The cafeteria on campus is very nice and offers a wide selection of food items. There is a salad bar, prepackaged food, but also food station where they freshly prepare your meal. The prices are sometimes a little steep, but there is a wide selection for every kind of wallet. There are 2 cafes on campus that provide coffee, sodas, hot chocolate and other goods things and are open everyday from 8 am to 7 pm.",
            "There are no Dorms for this campus, but there is plenty of apartments located in the neighboring cities. Mountain View is where most of the students are located and the school is easy to reach by bus.",
            "Classes can be difficult, but also very rewarding. Overall the quality of instruction is fabulous and you will be well prepared for a four year institution. The College is on the quarter system, which can be a challenge sometimes, since things just fly right by you.",
            "Be part of Student Government, a club or the entrepreneur center on campus, all of these things will benefit you greatly for your transfer application.",
            "Best Community College in California for transfer students. The College has a Honors program to increase transfer rates with the University of California. It also has a great network to help students succeed."

Everyone here is determine in their work and that kind of environment motives you more to work harder like everyone else. Am learning a lot Foothill is a calm and peaceful school environment. You can sit outside under a tree on a sunny day and study without any distractions. The teachers are serious about their work and will make the course interesting and unique, they will teach whatever they feel is necessary for you to learn in their course. I have learn more then what is needed for each course I have taken from Foothill, some of the skills you can put in use for life and the future.
