This embodiment has been demonstrated using plastomers in the range of 0.865 g/cm3 to 0.900 g/cm3 which before would have been unheard of without blending with other olefins. Also 3-D patterns can be produced at low embossed roll temperatures (80\ufffd F.) versus conventional 120\ufffd-130\ufffd F. process temperatures. For the purposes of this patent specification, the total draw down ratio is defined to be the die gap width divided by the total film thickness. In the invention, the total draw down ratio is in the range of about 2:1 to 100:1, and preferably in the range of about 10:1 to 100:1, preferably in cast films, 4:1 to 20:1 and for blown film preferably 10:1 to 60:1. The films of this invention are embossed at a temperature of about 50\ufffd F. to about 140\ufffd F., preferably, in the range of 60\ufffd F. to 115\ufffd F., more preferably 70\ufffd F. to 110\ufffd F. and most preferably 80\ufffd F. to 100\ufffd F. Film thickness is generally in the range of 0.1 to 15 mils, preferably 0.5 to 10, most preferably less than 5 or 2 mils and most preferably from 0.5 to 4 mils. The films of the invention process at line speeds in the range of 500 ft/min to 2000 ft/min, preferably greater than 500 ft/min, more preferably greater than 600 ft/min, even more preferably at 700 ft/min and most preferably greater than 800 ft/min., 54718=The hysteresis testing procedure used is described as follows. This method is an Exxon variation of a procedures described by DuPont in its brochure on its polyether urethane elastic product, T-722A. In the Exxon variation, 1 inch \ufffd6 inch strips are subjected to a strain rate of 150% or 200% with a jaw gap separation of 2\" and cross head speed of 20\"/min. The hysteresis stress/strain curve is plotted on a chart also traveling a 20\"/minute. Both the extension and retraction crosshead speeds (20\"/min) were the same and performed on an Instron model 1123. The film was held for 60 seconds at maximum extension and then retracted and held for 30 seconds relaxation prior to the next cycle. This was repeated 21/2 times. Key pieces of information that are extracted from these stress/strain plots are the maximum force (modulus) of each cycle, the residual set or permanent set (the degree of deformation as measured by the point of stress divided by total strain/cycle), and the unload force or contractive power as measured from the last retraction cycle at various elongations. Generally, five specimens were tested for each sample, with mean values over these samples developed., 54197=Table 1 shows the description of samples used in these examples. All materials were fabricated on the 3/4\" Haake Rheocord extruder, model E in the cast mode. The screw was a 15/5/5, 24:1 L/D with 15\ufffd Tip. The polymer was extruded through a 4\" tape die and wound through a stacked calendar assembly to the winder. All polymers contained an additives package of: 30,000 ppm antiblock; 3000 ppm slip; and 500 ppm antioxidant. Die gap width=20 mils. All materials were extruded at \u02dc180\ufffd C. melt., 45087=From the weight fraction versus composition distribution curve the CDBI is determined by establishing what weight percent of the sample has comonomer content within 25% each side of the median comonomer content. Further details of determining CDBI of a copolymer are known to those skilled in the art, see, for example, PCT Patent Application WO 93/03093, published Feb. 18, 1993., 35816=For the purposes of this patent specification the term \"metallocene\" is herein defined to contain one or more cyclopentadienyl moiety in combination with a transition metal of the Periodic Table of Elements. The metallocene catalyst component is represented by the general formula (Cp)m MRn R'p wherein Cp is a substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ring; M is a Group IV, V or VI transition metal; R and R' are independently selected halogen, hydrocarbyl group, or hydrocarboxyl groups having 1-20 carbon atoms; m=1-3, n=0-3, p=0-3, and the sum of m+n+p equals the oxidation state of M. Various forms of the catalyst system of the metallocene type may be used in the polymerization process of this invention. Exemplary of the development of these metallocene catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene is found in the disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4,871,705 to Hoel, U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,299 to Ewen, et al. and EP-A-0 129 368 published Jul. 26, 1989, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,017,714 and 5,120,867 to Welborn, Jr. all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. These publications teach the structure of the metallocene catalysts and includes alumoxane as the cocatalyst. There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxane of which one described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,665,208. Other cocatalysts may be used with metallocenes, such as trialkylaluminum compounds; or ionizing ionic activators or compounds such as, tri (n-butyl) ammonium tetra (pentaflurophenyl) boron, which ionize the neutral metallocene compound. Such ionizing compounds may contain an active proton, or some other cation associated with but not coordinated or only loosely coordinated to the remaining ion of the ionizing ionic compound. Such compounds are described in EP-A-0 277 003 and EP-A-0 277 004 both published Aug. 3, 1988 and are both herein fully incorporated by reference. Further, the metallocene catalyst component can be a monocyclopentadienyl heteroatom containing compound. This heteroatom is activated by either an alumoxane or an ionic activator to form an active polymerization catalyst system to produce polymers useful in this present invention. These types of catalyst systems are described in, for example, PCT International Publications WO 92/00333 published Jan. 9, 1992, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,096,867 and 5,055,438, EP-A-0 420 436 and WO 91/04257 all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. In addition, the metallocene catalysts useful in this invention can include non-cyclopentadienyl catalyst components, or ancillary ligands such as boroles or carbollides in combination with a transition metal. Additionally it is not beyond the scope of this invention that the catalysts and catalyst systems may be those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,802 and PCT publications WO 93/08221 and WO 93/08199 published Apr. 29, 1993 all of which are herein incorporated by reference. All the catalyst systems described above may be, optionally, prepolymerized or used in conjunction with an additive or scavenging component to enhance catalytic productivity., 20764=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/068,374, filed May 27, 1993 now abandoned which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/837,769, filed February 19, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,241,031., 38966=The catalyst particles in a gas phase process may be supported on a suitable particulate material such as polymeric supports or inorganic oxide such as silica, alumina or both. Methods of supporting the catalyst of this invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,808,561, 4,897,455, 4,937,301, 4,937,217, 4,912,075, 5,008,228, 5,086,025 and 5,147,949 and U.S. application Ser. Nos. 898,255, filed Jun. 15, 1992 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,238,892 and 885,170, filed May 18, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,240,894 all of which are herein incorporated by reference. The preferred support method in a gas phase process is generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,301 and related U.S. patents which are listed above., 56684=Table 3 shows the description of samples used in these examples. All were fabricated on a commercial 31/2\", 30:1 L/D Black Clawson cast/embossed line. Screw type was a 30:1 L/D sterlex medium work barrier screw with maddock mixing element. The die was a 42\" EDI slot coat hanger die with 15 mil gap setting. Embossing was by a 36\"\ufffd60\" pins up micropattern finish roll set to an 80\ufffd F. embossing temperature using a 30\"\ufffd60\" rubber roll nip. Nip pressure was kept constant at \u02dc25 psi. All polymers contained an additives package of 30,000 ppm antiblock, 1-3000 ppm slip, and 500 ppm antioxidant., 40934=The plastomers of the present invention have a density in the range of about 0.855 g/cm3 to about 0.900 g/cm3. Preferably, the plastomers have a minimum density of about 0.860 g/cm3, more preferably about 0.865 g/cm3, and a maximum density of about 0.890 g/cm3, more preferably about 0.880 g/cm3. Preferably the density is in the range of about 0.860 g/cm3 to about 0.890 g/cm3, more preferably, the density is in the range of about 0.865 g/cm3 to about 0.880 g/cm3. Densities were measured using ASTM D-1505 procedure, except that they were additionally conditioned by holding the resin for 48 hours at ambient temperature (23\ufffd C.) prior to density measurement., 41726=The melt index (MI) of the plastomers utilized in the invention are such that the plastomers can be extruded into a desired end product. In the preferred embodiment, the MI must be such that the plastomer will have sufficient drawability as desired. Generally the melt index is in the range of about 0.2 dg/min to about 1000 dg/min, preferably, the MI is at least about 0.5 dg/min, more preferably at least about 1 dg/min, preferably, the maximum MI is about 20 dg/min, more preferably about 5 dg/min. In another embodiment the MI is in the range of about 0.5 dg/min to about 50 dg/min, and more preferably in the range of about 1 dg/min to about 5 dg/min.
