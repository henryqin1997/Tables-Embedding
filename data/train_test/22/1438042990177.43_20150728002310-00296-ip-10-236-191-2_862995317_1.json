Circa 15 more packages will need update Additional 9 Gems will have to be packaged The whole Rails stack has to be updated (8 packages) Scope This update will keep Fedora up-to-date and will ensure that the current Rails developers stay with us as they will get support for system-packaged Rails of the latest version. Apart from that, Rails 3.2 also bring improved functionality, speed and security. Benefit to Fedora The Rails stack is evolving quickly and Fedora needs to keep pace with it. Therefore the whole Rails stack should be updated from 3.0 in Fedora 17 to 3.2 (latest version) in Fedora 18. This will ensure that all the Ruby developers using Fedora have the latest and greatest RPM-packaged Rails.

    "textAfterTable": "How To Test No special hardware is needed. To test Rails 3.2 before they actually get into Rawhide, use:  gem install rails rails new app cd app && rails s Go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ and make sure you are running Rails 3.2.x When all packages land in Rawhide, use:  yum install rubygem-{rails,sqlite3} rails new app cd app && rails s Go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ and make sure you are running Rails 3.2.x User Experience Ruby programmers will once again be able to develop using RPM-packaged Rails of the newest version, using all its advantages. Dependencies Apart from those mentioned in #Scope, all the packages from the Rails stack are dependencies of other cca 50 packages. These will have to be rebuilt and possibly updated.
