Only about $2000 a semester., 2426=I have been at Trident since August of 2010 and so far I have nothing bad to say about the teacher and academic advisers who I have had or come into contact with. I have a full 15-hr schedule this semester and although my classes are all quite different and unique, I am learning many new things in them. One of my favorite classes is Western Civ post-1689; which may not sound important but it is because I usually resent history classes about western civilizations. This one however, I quite enjoy.}",
