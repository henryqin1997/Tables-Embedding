He has warned Aston Villa that they won't get an easy time of it when the Premiership team face Hull at the KC Stadium in the 3rd round of the FA Cup. The Tigers are having a terrible season and are currently 17th with just five wins in twenty two games. That said, Villa have made their worst start in the league for over three decades and were knocked out of the Carling Cup by League One side Doncaster Rovers. Hull boss Taylor said: 'It's a tremendous draw and a very exciting one. I know some of the Villa players very well, people like Milner and Baros, and because of what's happened recently people will believe that we're capable of producing a shock. That gives it an extra edge and it's a tie that we're all looking forward to. It's a reward for everyone and I think it's great that our supporters will have the opportunity to see us play a Premiership team in a competitive fixture.' He also said Hull will push for an early goal like Doncaster did to put the pressure on Villa. 'They are a top side with a lot of very good players in their team. I know a few of them from the under-21s and it's a pity we haven't got an international before January - I could have tried to tire them out!' Adding O'Leary isn't the only manager under pressure as 'all managers are under pressure when you are not getting results.' **Why not join our forum and join in the debates?
