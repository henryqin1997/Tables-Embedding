I congratulate the slate of 2013 museum grant recipients for planning projects that advance innovation in museum practice, lifelong learning, and community engagement.\u201d, 9832=The National Endowment for the Arts was established by Congress in 1965 as an independent agency of the federal government. To date, the NEA has awarded more than $4 billion to support artistic excellence, creativity, and innovation for the benefit of individuals and communities. The NEA extends its work through partnerships with state arts agencies, local leaders, other federal agencies, and the philanthropic sector.\u00a0, 12865=The new NEA grant, a $30,000 grantthat runs through June of 2015, is being used to support audience-driven innovation. The goal of this initiative is to identify meaningful and effective approaches to engage the public, especially young adults. The scope of the project will include extensive research, data analysis, prototype development and deployment of new technologies., 10441=With the addition of these two new grants, MOPA will build on past successes they have had with interactivity. In 2012, they were one of the first museums to use interactive technology and crowd-sourcing to curate an exhibition. The level of participation and the feedback for their Soapbox! The Audience Speaks exhibition substantiated their theory that this is something their patrons want and solidified their desire to pursue the interactive concept further. The new grants will allow MOPA to do just that., 8696=The Museum of Photographic Arts (MOPA) is one of the leading museums in the United States devoted exclusively to photography, film and video. Since its founding in 1983, MOPA has been dedicated to collecting, preserving and exhibiting the entire spectrum of the photographic medium. The Museum\u2019s endeavors consistently address cultural, historical and social issues through its exhibitions and educational programs. Located in beautiful Balboa Park, MOPA is dedicated to serving local patrons, tourists and a global community through online access to the Museum\u2019s rich permanent collection. Learn more at mopa.org., 8032=FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 12, 2013, 13268=The Museum of Photographic Arts (MOPA) recently received grants from both the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) for new initiatives focused on engaging audiences with innovative technology. This marks the second straight year that MOPA has won both of these awards and the tenth year since 2001 it has won funding from the NEA., 11405=At the opposite end of the spectrum from MOPA\u2019s youth initiatives, the two existing grants that began in 2012 both deal with reaching out to senior citizens. The IMLS award is focused on a comprehensive approach to providing increased access and comfort to all museum visitors by directly serving the needs of seniors. With the 2012 NEA funding MOPA is reaching beyond the Museum\u2019s walls to provide hands-on photography courses and off-site lectures that enable senior citizens to develop new technical, aesthetic and critical thinking skills.}",
