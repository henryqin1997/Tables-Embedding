    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38061=FIG. 1 schematically shows a wireless system 1 according to the invention. The wireless system 1 comprises a wide area network 2 with wireless stations 3 and 4, radio base stations of a cellular telephony network. The wireless system 1 further comprises wireless stations 5 and 6, short-range communication or broadcast beacons using radio communication or infrared communication or any other suitable wireless communication or broadcast, and a wireless device 7. The wide area network 2 is coupled to an application server 8 that uses a database 9. The wireless device 7 may be a cell phone that uses a cellular network communication protocol and that is further capable of communicating with the wireless beacons 5 and 6 using another communication protocol. The wireless device may also be a dedicated device only capable of communicating with the beacons 5 and 6. The wireless device may also be a dedicated device only capable of communicating through the base stations 3 and 4 with the wide area network 2. Preferably, the wireless device 7 communicates with the beacons 5 and 6 through packet transmission using a packet 10. The packet 10 conveys small quantities of information at a time. Packet transmission may use a protocol as described in a patent application filed earlier by the same assignee (PHGB000084 (UK Appln No. 0015454.2, Filed Jun. 26, 2000), the contents of which is herewith incorporated by reference. In the packet transmission protocol described therein added data to an existing protocol, the so-called Bluetooth protocol, are piggy backed on inquiry facilitation signals, as sixty four bit payloads. In this protocol, in a full inquiry cycle over sixteen hopping frequencies and a number of repetitions, and through inclusion of clock information of the beacon for synchronization purposes, a full beacon signal of sixteen kBytes can be transmitted. Other suitable packet transmission systems, may be applied as well. In principle, also connection-oriented communication could be used. The database 9 may store user location information and user identities, applications to be downloaded, or other information used by the invention as will be described in further detail hereafter. The application server 8 may be configured to download applications to the wireless device 7., 27525=As example of a CA terminal is given in a technical report published by Hewlett Packard, \u201cUniform Web Presence Architecture for People, Places, and Things\u201d, HPL-2000-67, 13 pages, June, 2000. This report-decribes HP's \u201cCooltown\u201d vision. The Cooltown vision is that people, places, and things have web representation and that many useful services can be offered by creating a tighter link between the real word entity and its vitual representation. Software architectures are defined enabling the dynamic generation of Web contents based on the user context (location, identity, device capabilities), on his security permission, and on the relationships with other Web presences. In Cooltown, the future consists of nomadic people carrying personal communication and web browsing devices interacting with services that are location specific and customized to the user.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations In view of the foregoing it will be evident to a person skilled in the art that various modifications may be made within the spirit and the scope of the invention as hereinafter defined by the appended claims and that the invention is thus not limited to the examples provided. The word \u201ccomprising\u201d does not exclude the presence of other elements or steps than those listed in a claim. In block 164, the server waits for a location identifier. Upon reception, in block 165 it retrieves a user's last known location. In block 166, it then calculates a distance between a current and a previous location of the user and checks whether the distance is below a given threshold, e.g. 20 m. If so, no update occurs. If this is not the case, in block 167 the user's interested entries are retrieved and in block 168 it is calculated what is the distance between a user's current location and his interested entries. If the latter distance is too large, as tested in block 169, e.g. above 100 m, the server waits for another location identification. Otherwise, in block 170 an alert signal is sent to the user. Filtering at Server's Side: In block 160, a wireless device waits for a location identifier. When received, in block 161 it checks whether a predetermined period, for instance one minute, since a previous transmission of a location identifier to",
