            "The University of Central Florida is great for students who like large campuses with about 50,000 students which mean there is a great diversity and large classrooms. It is also good for those who like to live in a large suburb area and want a good cost of admission. UCF is located in Florida so the student would have to feel comfortable with the environment/weather. Most importantly, it\u2019s perfect for anyone who is looking to further their education. Anyone can quickly adapt to UCF and will fall in love with everything about it. If you feel that it is a right choice then go with that feeling and officially become a Knight (mascot).",
            "1. Time Management: Learn how to mange your time, get a planner so you can be organized and know when it\u2019s time for work and time for play. 2. Network: Get to know your professors, mentors, peers, and other administrators. By taking the time to know people you can create a comfortable environment for yourself and know where to go when you need help or even a recommendation letter. 3. Get Involved: There are tons of organizations and activities to do at UCF. By getting involved you can gain leadership opportunities which will enhance student success and involvement on campus. Most importantly you will get to meet new friends. 4. Live On Campus: By living on campus you will experience the real feeling of living in a dorm and walking to class. After your first year you will already know more about your campus and what goes on during the year. 5. Get To Know Your Campus: Take advantage of your campus and all the resources, assistance, and opportunities you have at UCF. You can find out where is the best spot at the library to study, shortcuts to class, where all the computer labs are, free printing machines, and vending machines that have supplies. 6. Create Strategies for Studying: Learn how to prepare and study for an exam. Go to class everyday, take class notes, participate in class, read the textbook, and complete all assignments. DO NOT procrastinate but keep an open mind and always do your best. It is good to set goals and keep yourself aware of what you want to accomplish. There is so much to learn about but don\u2019t stress yourself either. 7. Have Fun: These are suppose to be the best years of your life so take a break from the books and enjoy the experience.",
            "The University of Central Florida has one of the best admission cost especially with the way the economy is right now. If this was not true than it would not be one of the largest universities in the nation and have a big amount out of state students. UCF also has a listing of numerous scholarships for every student. Once again you cannot go wrong with all the free events and items that are available. There is not one student who complains about free food, shirts, concerts, movies, activities, resources, and much more. If you don\u2019t live on campus and don\u2019t have a car there is also a free shuttle that can take you to campus from most apartments and all UCF affiliated apartments. Even when it comes to your health there is a hospital on campus where you can get free check-ups and exams done by a doctor. You can still be part of an organization for free and attend meetings and events or take fun classes at the gym such as boxing, yoga, or something of your interest. It won\u2019t be a secret that there are free items or events, you will definitely hear or read about it everywhere. There is always something you can get your hands on for free and why not get stuff you will enjoy.",
            "The University of Central Florida is more than an amazing university. It is a very large campus with a variety of activities and events going on everyday. There are tons of organizations you can become involved in such as fraternities/sororities, Hispanic Organization, Caribbean Organization, Chocolate Club, Dance lessons, Movie Showings, Ice Skating during the winter, even associations that may be about your major. Don\u2019t forget one of the best gyms where you can workout, play basketball, rock climb, play volleyball, run in an inside track or take a dip in the pool. If that does not convince you then I\u2019m sure all the free events and items that are given will make your college experience unforgettable. Homecoming week is also very fun and you get to enjoy all the traditions such as going to the game and spirit splash. Celebrities are also known to visit the university where in most cases, concerts are held where you can attend for free as students. As a student you receive discounts on theme park tickets and other outside concerts and free admission to all athletic activities as well. UCF even has a whole day for students to attend Islands of Adventure, where the park is closed down just for the students for free. UCF is located in central Florida which is also a wonderful place since it is located near downtown and close to theme parks, beaches, restaurants, malls, and apartments. As a student you will NEVER have a dull moment where you cannot find anything to do.",
            "Since I have been at the University of Central Florida I have learned more than I could imagine. The professors truly know what they are teaching and are more than welcomed to give you any additional help if needed. There is no excuse that they cannot be reached because on the first day of class you are given a syllabus with everything that you are going to be learning, the professor\u2019s email, number, and their office hours so you are able to contact them at your convenience. There is also supplementary help offered such as tutoring and the Student Academic Resource Center (SARC). There is also the huge library and many other sources that can help with anything you need from financial advice to counseling. Other than the required courses you must take there are a variety of other courses that you may be interested in as well. Not only are there courses to learn from but they are plenty of events that you can attend in which you will gain a lot of information such as how to prepare to an interview, how to write a resume, or even learn about different cultures."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{988272=I can't say much, here, other than I've never felt unsafe while on campus. There have been a few crime reports, but mostly off campus, in the apartments, when someone got robbed. UCF does a good job of alerting students when a crime occurs and giving safety tips. Also, starting Fall 2012, UCF will be a smoke-free campus., 31485=With costs rising and funding dropping, UCF is starting to have trouble with the amount of aid it used to give. Still, the college is dedicated to finding solutions to the difficult financial times without putting too much burden on the students. Bright Futures is a huge help for in-state students, but most students with whom I have spoken on the subject also received varying degrees of financial aid, from partial tuition to full tuition AND room-and-board. As a hint, though, they LOVE national merit semi-finalists, finalists, and scholars. One semi-finalist I knew received around $8000 per year on TOP of a full tuition scholarship from the college AND full bright futures from the state! She is EARNING money by attending, as the extra defaults to her account. She can use it for books, school supplies, and sometimes just living expenses, which is fantastic. They also offer many kinds of grants and loans for financial need, even if your GPA has taken a hit from your financial situation. My neighbor has received several subsidized loans from the government and the school and is managing to keep his out-of-pocket expenses down to between $800 and $1500 per year even though he didn't qualify for too much merit-based scholarship money. There is a great opportunity for students here to save money and still get a great education from knowledgeable and enthusiastic professors and assistants., 992273=I was an English- Creative Writing major in the honors program, and most semesters were tough. During my first semester as a junior, I had an average of 300 pages to read a week! Of course, 1000 and 2000 level courses aren't as rigorous., 114168=Moderately active. Many different Greek organizations to choose from, if that's your thing. 100% no hazing policy and few legitimately concerning stories (that is, stories beyond that of a pillow fight gotten rough, harmless pranks, or of sending the pledge to buy 1000 condoms) ever really heard., 1117152=On the Friday of homecoming week we have spirit splash. It was name best campus tradition in 2011. They have a Live DJ, special guest, and free stuff while students are allowed to go into the fountain located in front of the library. It is a crazy wet day., 654705=the homecoming week. spirit spirit spirit. in 2011, for the homecoming concert, the sga booked lupe fiasco and panic at the disco. unbelievable concert.there is also something called spirit splash at ucf where everyone jumps into the reflection pond for one day. sports are a huge deal here especially football and basketball, be sure to go out to the games, lots of fun., 992704=If you want to contact UCF, I suggest using email instead of the phone whenever possible. Replies are always prompt and informative, and you don't have to go through the hassle of being redirected and put on hold. If you have to park on campus, take early classes. If you arrive by 8:30 AM, you'll pretty much have your pick of spots. Join the Burnett Honors College as an honors student, honors in the major student, or both. You'll have early access to classes, and the opportunity to take small honors classes. Watch what classes you take in the same semester. Try to balance more rigorous courses with easier ones, but watch out. Some classes that seem easy can actually be tough! Take online classes. They're amazingly flexible, and usually easier than lecture classes., 62540=Program SEPS (safety escort and patrol services) number into your phone if you have classes that let out after 7:00. They are wonderful people, and I'm really glad that I used their services. Carry a jacket with you. It might be hot outside, but the classrooms are generally way too cold. Watch out for longboarders. Not all of them know what they are doing. Avoid campus on game days, if at all possible. It's absolutely insane., 19080=The University of Central Florida is a very large school. With over 50,000 students attending classes at the main campus or one of their satellite campuses, and almost 1500 acres of land on the main campus alone, it is safe to say that UCF is one of the larger universities in the nation. That being said, in most of your classes you will be one of the three or four hundred students sitting in your classroom. The easiest way for you to make the most of your learning experience at UCF is to always sit in the front five or six rows of the class and GET TO KNOW YOUR PROFFESSORS. Remember that you will probably only represent .003% of the student body sitting in that auditorium sized classroom. The teachers, for the most part, are very willing to help and they are very good at what they do. However, if you don\u2019t ask for help and get to know your professors you will soon find yourself barely scraping by and doing poorly in the majority of your classes. Other great resources to help you learn more is to take advantage of the free tutoring, especially those offered by SARC (Student Academic Resource Center). If you follow this advice you will do wonderfully in all your classes and will definitely learn a lot., 263080=Fall 2013, the Neptune community will be built, brand new, very spacious and comfortable., 371797=I recommend living on campus. This is the best way to fully immerse yourself in UCF life. For freshmen students, the LINK program is an awesome way to meet new people and learn everything about the school. There are events every month where you earn LINK loot, redeemable at the end of semester auction for cool prizes like a $1300 scholarship and a year subscription of Netflix. I didn't take full advantage of this first semester but I certainly will in the spring., 802971=Lake Claire allows students to rent paddle boats/kayaks/canoes for free; it's located on campus at the end of Greek Park Drive. I go there on weekends sometimes. Every year in April UCF students are given 1 free ticket to Universal's Islands of Adventure. Athletic events are free, except for football games., 856744=UCF has a beautiful campus and most of the buildings are new. The gym is enormous and has a Subway restaurant inside, as well as an indoor track, basketball courts, an abundance of workout equipment, and several televisions to keep you entertained while you're sculpting yourself into shape. The dorm rooms for freshmen on campus are generally of good size and available for around $2000-$3000., 350780=Scholarships, average 1227 SA.T. score, average 27 A.C.T score. average High school GPA 3.8, 861178=nearly 1000 people run into a knee deep water fountain every year,, 421338=Don't take online classes your first semester! And take school as seriously as you can. This is the time where everyone wants to go out and party, and that's one hundred percent OK, but don't let it interfere with attending class and getting your work done! And avoid Alafaya Trail around 5:45 pm on weekdays, the traffic is terrible! And don't try to park on Campus between 10:30 and 1:30, there are never any parking spots! Take advantage of all of the free resources available, the gym, the health center, tutors, etc!, 1053170=I can't really say anything about this one because I haven't started class at UCF yet, I start June 25th., 175602=Surprisingly, as an out-of-state student you would think that the cost would be prohibitive compared to staying in state. I was accepted at both Penn State University main campus and UCF. Penn State 2010/2011 tuition is $14,412 and UCF non-Florida resident tuition is $19,832. Penn State did not offer any scholarship tuition assistance, but UCF offered me a $30,000 Knights Achievement Award scholarship! It was an easy decision for me when you add in the Florida sunshine and the fact that major theme parks and beaches are all within an hour's drive. You are not only getting a good education for your buck, but an amazing college life to go with it., 159602=I cannot stress this enough, APPLY EARLY!!! I applied ridiculously early (October, I believe) and got my acceptance letter literally a week later. While some of my other friends waited to apply and either got wait-listed or ended up getting accepted so late that it was even too late to apply for on-campus housing, forcing her to live off-campus by herself. Another thing (for those high school juniors), start taking the ACT/SAT the beginning of your junior year. I took my 3rd ACT the beginning of summer before senior year, that way, I was able to start filling out applications right when senior year started. You'll be so glad to just get those out of the way!}",

Reviewer has been to campus. 90 out of 103 people found this review useful. 2 of 738 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students who enjoy big campuses and classrooms with a lot of people will like it here because the class sizes are large. Also, they say there is always something to do and you will meet a lot of people. If you are shy, you wont be shy anymore probably. Tips for prospective students Don't think because you got into this school that you will survive. If you are going to this school just to make money, you will not survive.
