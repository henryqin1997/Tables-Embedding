            "One of the top Greek Life systems in the nation. There are just so many houses everywhere offering different things.",
            "If it does not already exist you can start it with the school's support. There is just so much you can do and get into its great.",
            "All different types of students. Except music students, that is not offered, unless you wanna join a wonderful marching band.",
            "The Bell Tower curse, if you walk under the bell tower you are cursed to attend for 5 years. Then there is another where if you walk under the Bell Tower then go drink from the Lions Fountain you will be destined to get married. Then there are so many others I just can't think of right now.",
            "World class education at a public school fee. It's unbeatable.",
            "What isn't there to do for fun. They always have an alternative to drinking so you will not feel pressured as well as every club you can think and if that club doesn't exist then you can make it with the university's support.",
            "Purdue's dinning service is amazing, it really is. It is an all you can eat set up with a wide verity and always has something healthy to eat. The unlimited chocolate milk was rather awesome to. But you really cannot go wrong with this dinning system.",
            "I had an amazing time in my dorm at Purdue and met some of my best friends and do not regret a single moment spent there.",
            "Purdue can be a very challenging university but it is a fair system with great educators who set you up for success as long as you want to succeed.",
            "Learn to manage your time between fun and studying to make sure you do not fall behind on school work. Do not be afraid to attempt something new that you might fail at. Always keep an open mind and do not judge others and let go of hate.",
            "Purdue University is a very good university and I have enjoyed my time there so far. It is a good mixture of fun and world class education. I would highly suggest students to go here because you cannot and will not go wrong here."

Usually, after a winning home game, the student section will sprint across campus and run through the two fountains in celebration. It is especially great on hot days in august and september! Also, you have to make a stop at the discount den and buy a den pop (yes, we call it pop, not soda). A den pop allows you to mix different drinks together, all for a cheap price., 886002=There are over 1000 clubs on campus, I'm sure you can find something!, 168321=Definitely take a tour. This lets you get a feel for the dorms and how far they will be from your classes. If your from out of state, definitely ask about the weather. Several of my friends had to make emergency trips to Walmart because they didn't have any winter clothing. If you can, try leaving your winter clothes at home for the warm months, and then switching your wardrobe over a break, so that you don't bring more clothes than you have room for, because you won't need that cute turtleneck sweater in August., 1103428=When you apply, be creative and be yourself. Apply by November 1st so that you can be considered for Scholarships and Honors College., 124742=Friday night's before home football games there is a walk with the team over the bridge . The marching band plays for the crowd as they march through the campus before each home game ., 152267=Do not schedule classes before 8:30 am ever and meet as many people as possible. There are 20,000 different students at Purdue, surely there is someone that you can connect with and friends make the experience that much better!, 877891=Try and really reach out during BGR, but don't feel bad if you don't click with the people from your group! My best friends were ones that I met through my roommate. Also, if you want to get an apartment, sign in October to get the best choice! We signed early November, and we were almost too late!, 856517=I've only been there once, but it was a fun experience. I learned a lot about Purdue, and may attend this coming fall of 2013., 435076=hanging out with friends are always great, going to the union is a good option. you can bowl or play pool, or simply just have a cup of coffee and chat with friends. the new gym will be completed in the fall of 2012, so you will have a great new place to workout and play sports. joining a club is always a good idea, there's no better way to meet other people who likes what you like too., 1082302=Very safe environment. Police officers are always around. Here is Purdue 2012-2013 Annual Security Report: http://www.purdue.edu/police/pdf/YourCampus.pdf, 746097=With almost 1000 clubs to join Purdue is the place for working out and having fun. JThey also just built a new recreation center as well which boasts a ton of sporting facilities and equipment. There is always something to do at Purdue in the fun sense., 694910=I've walked around at 3:30 am and felt perfectly at home.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I am in the nursing program and joined a learning community. This is where around 20 freshman nursing students get put in most of the same classes and are put in the same resident hall. This helps with finding people to study with and is a great way to easily make some new friends. Most of the programs have learning communities and I would recommend getting into one. It is not absolutely necessary for success in college but it might help make things a little bit easier.
