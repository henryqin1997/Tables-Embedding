The info on this PlantFiles entry gives a max. ht. of 36 inches, but those I saw that day were 36 inches at the minimum, going up to over 6 ft. Just the sort of plant I needed to hide that monstrous transformer! Harvesting the seeds was extremely easy. Now a nic... read moree thicket of these tall and strikingly lovely celosia is growing around the hideous thing, cloaking it with its gorgeous burgundy foliage - - shiny in the sunlight and swaying in breezes with a lovely rustle. It is only the end of May now - - I am so looking forward to a bit more height and the appearance of hundreds of pink-to-red tipped plumes. If you have anything you want to screen from view in a lovely way, this is a great solution. Though an annual, these will readily self-sow.",

I used Direct and Winter Sowing methods with high germination rates. In my garden, the red coloring really stands out. A real showy plant. Does very well in drought conditions too. Mine gets full sun, and the only water it gets, is when it rains. Seeds are easy to harvest.",
