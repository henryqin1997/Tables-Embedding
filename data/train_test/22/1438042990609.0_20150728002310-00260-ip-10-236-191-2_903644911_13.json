This is a new chapter for me and I'm awaiting to see the end result., 24886=The Academics here are good, and like any other college i'm sure if you procrastinate it's going to be too much for you to handle. Since there are about 1000 students on the entire campus the Professors have more time for the students and are always there to try and help them., 102328=My advice to prospective students would be to call the Forge and speak to a Financial Aid coordinator as they are very helpful in navigating the Financial Aid process and will make sure you have applied/signed up for all the Financial Aid you are eligible for. Also, don't wait until the last minute to get all of the paperwork in. The quicker you turn all of that in, the easier check-in will be on your arrival/move in day. Finally, I would advise students to get connected! Join the Class of 2019 (or whatever your year would be) page on Facebook and say Hello! These connections and friendships you will make are going to be life-long relationships with people who will love, encourage, and advocate for you!, 106056=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
