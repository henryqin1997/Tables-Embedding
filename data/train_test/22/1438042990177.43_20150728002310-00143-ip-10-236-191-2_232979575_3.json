This is why I use\u00a0per90\u00a0and it\u2019s why we should all use\u00a0per90. It gives us context when evaluating players who play wildly different minutes over the course of a season. Once we have factored in the minutes played Robben and Ribery are an awful lot closer in terms of goals and assists than table 1 would ever have us believe. In fact, Robben is a far better shots and shots on target player than his team-mate Ribery. Per 90 minutes is born! \u00a0 1.74 4.22 0.46 0.46 Robben 1.32 2.77 0.60 0.43 Ribery SoT p90 Shots p90 Assists p90 Goals p90 \u00a0 One simple calculation later\u2026\u2026 So what we need to do is marry the raw numbers (table 1) with the minutes played (table 2) to give us a greater understanding of how each player in terms of goals and assist given the number of minutes each player was actually on the field for. Ribery played more than double the amount of minutes that Robben did and hence Ribery\u2019s goals and assists totals were far higher. Now, once we have the added context of minutes played the first table, which features the raw numbers, just cannot be taken at face",
