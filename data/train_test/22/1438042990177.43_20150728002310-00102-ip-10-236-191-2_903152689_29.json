            "Campus police is seen patrolling campus quiet often, even into late hours of the night. And many of the officers are kind as well.",
            "There are Fraternities and Sororities on Campus but many students prefer not to be affiliated but from my friends that do partake in Greek Life they enjoy it.",
            "We have clubs ranging from major-based to investigating the Paranormal so we do have a large variety.",
            "Those who enjoy a rather small environment where people are most close-knit. Also, those that prefer suburban life as well",
            "If you step on the UNH logo in the Academic quad you might not graduate in four years.",
            "This school is rather expensive and I see myself paying off loans for a good chunk of my life. Is it worth it? I believe so as I am earning a degree in the field that I love from a University accredited to teach it",
            "There is usually something to do on Campus from performances to comedians to movie nights to fun parties and planned trips so you are never bored. Simply go outside and say Hi!",
            "The food selection is alright where after a month you have probably tried everything the campus has to offer. For more variety, we are luckily near downtown new haven and the Boston Post Road strip.",
            "The dorms are pretty nice, especially with a new building constructed especially for Freshman students where it is spacious and maintained well. The other residence halls are fairly roomy ( my room is pretty spaced out) while some resident halls are triples so they feel more cramped.",
            "Honestly the classes here are challenging but luckily Professors here do want you to succeed. It's really easy to have senioritis follow you from high school but that mentality will get you nowhere here. Definitely come here prepared to e challenged mentally and you will succeed.",
            "This is an AMAZING school for students considering any Law Enforcement field which ranges from Criminal Justice to Forensic Science to Fire Science and Legal Studies.",
            "Overall, I'm glad to call UNH my home and am excited to attend this school for the next four years."

They changed an upperclassmen dorm to a freshmen dorm and fall 2014 they'll open up a new dorm with parking and a movie theater., 273808=The great thing about living in Europe is that the airfare is really cheap through RyanAir. During October break six of us went to Barcelona, Dublin, and Paris. It is also easy to hop on a train during the weekend and explore more of Italy. At Keller Platz they have nights where bands play and there is great music and dancing!}",

Login to rate or flag the reviews Nick from NJ 10/13/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 19 out of 19 people found this review useful. 3 of 94 Categories Comments Great for these types of students New Haven is a great school for people who live close to new haven and will commute or live on campus during the week and then leave on the weekends. It is even better for those who are fire science majors, criminal justice majors and forensic science majors. Everything else can be found at other universities that have better programs. Tips for prospective students Do not sweat the college application process. Getting into New Haven was very easy. Do well in your senior year of high school, be involved in school and out of school. Study but don't over study for the SAT and ACT and you will do fine. The college application process is overwhelming if you make it overwhelming. there is a school",
