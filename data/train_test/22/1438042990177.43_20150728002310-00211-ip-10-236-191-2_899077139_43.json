    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17947=I graduated HS a year early, barely turned 17 in Aug. I did not want the big crowded campus setting of a university just yet. i live directly across the street so the campus s close for me, but really is small class sizes I don't think they have many over 28 students per class. I can easily choose a class schedule that fits my fancy! On top of it a lot of events are held by student. Ex. This month (Oct.) it is all about domestic violence, every week or every day something new is going on raising awareness. Right now T-shirts are hanging in the main center grass area made by staff and students who know or have been effected by domestic violence. Also donation boxes are throughout the campus. Very cool., 257394=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 88744=Tuition for full-time student is about $1000 a semester, much cheaper than at a four-year university. The personal support of college staff and faculty combined with challenging classes mean a high quality education. I've heard former EMCC students say they've gotten a better education at EMCC than they have at the four-year schools they have transferred to., 65195=There are traditions on campus for those history months such as Black History Month in February or Women's History Month in March. During these months when there are events commemorate the months there will be student speakers who go to the commons area to speak out about how they feel for this particular commemoration. Some students become very passionate and it is always fun to watch or participate in., 14767=If you want the actual or stereotype college/ university experience this might not be the best place. However, I really do recommend it for Seniors to look into just because it will be WAY cheaper to start off here and the transition will not be as over whelming or dramatic as if you wen straight from HS to say ASU. Also study before the placement exams, everyone has to take them. If you get these scores or better you will get a presidential scholarship and your tuition will be paid IN FULL for if I remember right your 2 first years! Placement into: Honors English 101 Exempt from Critical Reading 101 Math 121 or higher (aka 74 or higher on the ALEKS test) Try to take it before summer, and get registrar as soon as you can, summer is VERY busy. There is NO appointments to see advisors only walk ins. Expect at least an hour wait, even if you get there right as they open, you might cut down a few minutes but not too much. Seriously, I 110% finished HS July 30th, getting me enrolled was horrible. TONS of waiting and basically just took what classes were open my classes all have an hour wait time in-between. Also if you take the test while your in school you're a lot more likely to have the information fresh in your mind, so don't wait until like July when 1/2 the information has escaped your mind! Otherwise a class might be more of a boring review then learning mostly fresh new material! ALSO do not be afraid if you are an older student. I was shocked at how many were older then me and had kids, etc. I new I was younger but in reality only a small group kids in all 4 of my classes are my age. A lot of people who hadn't been in school for 10+ years are in all your classes, don't be surprised if at your placement testing you see some older students!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students This is a great school to take your science classes if you are planning on transferring to ASU, because EMCC using modeling to teach its science classes. Modeling is a self discovery way of learning and it is what ASU uses, so by taking your basic sciences here you get a feel for how you will be learning at ASU. Bang for the buck The classes are cheap compared to universities and other community colleges and you really feel like you get your moneys worth from each class. Am enjoying being here All of the teachers are very kind and helpful, plus there are two centers for free tutoring. One in the NASA center for math and sciences, and one in the library for English and other classes. Am learning a lot The class sizes are small, they keep them around 24 students per class. This allows a lot of student teacher interaction and allows you to ask all the questions you need. Login to rate or flag the reviews Mackenzie from Wickenburg, AZ",
