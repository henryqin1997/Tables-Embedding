I have built 10 of these and assembled 12 kits with all parts and an etched predrilled circuit board which we are making available to the community in an effort to spur more development (sounds like a contest entry). There is a thread in the Forums for discussion and announcememnts regarding the availability of these kits. If you are interested in assembling and distributing kits or have any assembly questions, please post a note in",

The circuit board can be purchased in quantities of 21 from www.expressPCB.com. Kits and/or single circuit boards may also be made available by one of the maintainers here. Tools Required 15 watt (maximum) soldering iron Diagonal cutters for trimming component leads Thin rosin core 60/40 solder (included in kit) Wire strippers. Three hands (a small vice will also work) Solder the D25 Connector Solder the D25 connector to the circuit board. pay close attention to the orientation of the circuit board and the D25 connector. Note in the photo in the following step the side of the D25 connector with 13 pins is facing up and pin 2 (on the right in the photo) is aligned with the first pad on the circuit board. Also note that the circuit board is double sided and you must make sure that you have the same side facing up as shown in the photo below. In some cases the board may have been cut a bit short on the D25 connector edge. Just line up the ends of the pins with the top of the solder pads on the circuit board and solder it in place. A good example of this condition is in the \"Install the 2.2K resistors\" photo. Also",
