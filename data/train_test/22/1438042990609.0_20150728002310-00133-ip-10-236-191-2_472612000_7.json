    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{353017=The voice codec unit (VCU) implements four full-duplex RELP voice compression systems. The VCU design is identical for the base station and the subscriber stations. In the subscriber station only one-fourth of the overall functionality is used (that is, only one of the four channels). The interface to the STU 27 in the subscriber station is identical to the interface used by each of the four PBX channels in the base station VCU 17 interface. The VCU 17, 28 uses an entirely digital scheme to implement the RELP voice algorithm, as described in co-pending U.S. patent application No. 667,446 entitled \"RELP Vocoder Implemented in Digital Signal Processors\", filed Nov. 2, 1984 by Philip J. Wilson, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, a sub-band codec may be used. The processed data is provided to the CCU 18, 29 on a common parallel bus interface which is controlled by the CCU software. The CCU 18, 29 sends the VCU 17, 28 control signals to determine the mode of operation and configuration in the VCU 18, 29. The modes of operation, functional description and implementation considerations associated with the VCU 17, 28 are described below., 365264=The RCDAV line 100 carries a receive channel data available signal from the CCU 18, 29 to the VCU 17, 28. The RCDAV signal indicates to the voice codec specified by the RCADDR lines that a data byte is available in the RCDATA register. The RCDAV signal gates the data onto the RCDATA bus and into the RCDATA register, and resets the RCDACK line., 422840=The modem receives symbols from its respective CCU at a rate of 16K symbols/second. These symbols are then converted to a DPSK code for input on line 143 to the FIR filter 132. The FIR algorithm requires that every other symbol be inverted before entering into the FIR filter. Gray code is used for the DPSK coding. This insures that if a symbol was received in error, there is a good probability that the two symbols to the receiver codec will be in error by only one bit., 236346=Digital voice information from the PBX 15 is next processed by a voice compression system known as a codec 16, which reduces the voice information rate from 64 Kbps to approximately 14.6 Kbps or less. The codec 16 uses either a Residual Excited Linear Predictive (RELP) algorithm or an SBC encoder-decoder to perform this voice rate compression. Typically, four codecs 16 reside in a single voice codec unit (VCU) 17 for performing voice compression for the four or more time slots in each frequency channel. Each base station VCU 17 can process four or more full-duplex voice connections for both the transmit channel and the receive channel of each channel pair. Connections by the PBX 15 determine which voice call is processed by which VCU 17 and by which codec 16 in the selected VCU 17. The circuits of each VCU 17 are hardware-mapped such that a voice call on a specific frequency and slot assignment in the base station is always processed by the same VCU codec 16., 371849=A codec frame is defined according to the implementation requirements of the RELP algorithm, but the frame must be an integer sub-multiple of the voice coded block period (VCBP), which is 22.5 msec., 363807=The TCSCWR line 94 carries a transmit channel status/control write signal from the CCU 18, 29 to the VCU 17, 28. The TCSCWR signal writes the voice codec control word into the appropriate transmit channel control register determined by the TCADDR lines. Data is latched into the register on the rising edge of the TCSCWR signal., 364415=The BLOCKRQ line 96 carries a block request signal from the CCU 18, 29 to the VCU 17, 28. The BLOCKRQ signal is used to initiate a 41 byte block transfer of data from the voice codec (specified by the TCADDR lines) to the CCU 18, 29 over the TCDATA bus. BLOCKRQ is used by the voice codec for start of VCBP timing., 356322=The VCU SDAT0 1, 2 and 3 lines 75, 76, 77, 78 carry data signals from the VCU to the PBX 15 in the base station. The VCU SDAT0 line 29 carries data from the VCU 28 to the STU 27 in the subscriber station. 8-bit \u03bc-255 companded serial data is sent to the PBX 15 or STU 27 from the voice codec during the active high portion of PBX/STU GATE0 or PBX GATE 1 . . . 3 at a 256 KHz clock rate. Data is clocked out of the VCU 17, 28 on the rising edge of the 256 KHz clock., 348010=In its basic mode of operation the STU acts as an interface unit to convert the 2-wire analog signal interfaced from a standard telephone set to 64 Kbps PCM encoded digital samples. Referring to FIG. 12, the STU includes a subscriber line interface circuit (SLIC) 53 which connects directly to a type-500 touch-tone phone set via lines 37. The SLIC 53 provides proper voltage and impedance characteristics for phone operation. In addition, the SLIC 53 allows a \"ring\" current to be applied to the phone set and also performs \"on-hook/off-hook\" detection. The signal outputs of the SLIC 53 on line 54 are analog voice-frequency (VF) transmit and receive signals. These are subsequently converted to PCM samples by a PCM codec 55. The PCM codec 55 uses the \u03bc-255 companding algorithm to digitize the voice signals into 8-bit samples at an 8 KHz rate. The PCM codec 55 is full-duplex in nature. The digitized voice samples are then fed over line 56 to a \"mode select\" multiplexer (MUX) 57. The mode of operation the MUX is determined by the subscriber controller unit SCU 58 which interfaces with the MUX 57 by a transmit and receive FIFO 59. The SCU 58 essentially includes a Model 803 microcontroller. The SCU is coupled to the CCU 29. Through an RS-232 interface circuit 60 and further controls the operation of the SLIC 53., 231605=The symbol rate on each 25 KHz FCC channel is 16 kilosymbols/second in each direction. Voice transmission is accomplished using 16 level PSK modulation and voice digitization with a coding rate of 14.6 Kbps. Alternatively, the modulation may be two-level (BPSK) or four-level (QPSK). A mixture of different modulations levels may be used on the same channel simultaneously. With time division multiplexing, the system provides one conversion for each multiple-of-two phases at the 14.6 Kbps rate (4 phases provides two conversations, 16 phases provides four conversations, etc.) or more as appropriate for lower rates. This is, of course, only one example since, as shown by the following chart, many different combinations of modem bits/symbols or phases and Codec rates may be used:, 253994=The basic TDM/TDMA channel per subscriber offers a total of 16 Kbps in each direction dedicated to each conversation. Of this channel capacity, 1.43 Kbps in each direction are required for control overhead and demodulation preambles. The VCU therefore operates at a fixed data rate of 14.57 Kbps. This is equivalent to 328 bits per codec frame period, defined as being one-half of the modem frame period or 22.5 msec., 212058=This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 349,301, filed May 8, 1989, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,022,024, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 324,651, filed Mar. 16, 1989, U.S. Pat.

No. 713,925, filed Mar. 20, 1985, U.S. Pat. No. 4,675,863 all of which are entitled SUBSCRIBER RF TELEPHONE SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING MULTIPLE SPEECH AND/OR DATA SIGNALS SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER EITHER A SINGLE OR A PLURALITY OF RF CHANNELS., 393752=Some status information, like the AGC value and fractional bit offset, may necessitate CCU action. Apart from being stored as status history, such data is used to correct subscriber power and ranging problems. In the case of RCC messages, power and range information is forwarded directly to the RPU as part of the RCC. The background process performs this function by formatting a BCC message containing the RCC, AGC and ranging data. Once the packet is ready it is placed in the transmit BCC queue and the BCC data process is notified. For voice channels, this status information is used to format code words which are embedded in outbound voice packets. The background process performs this formatting function and controls the transmission of the code word via the voice channel. All code words must be transmitted five frames in a row, providing 5:1 redundancy coding. The TX DMA process automatically transmits the code word selected by the background process., 366948=The RCVCRST line 105 carries a receive channel voice codec reset signal from the CCU 18, 29 to the VCU 17, 28. The voice code specified by the RCADDR lines is reset by the RCVCRST signals., 364155=The TCSCRD line 95 carries a transmit channel status/control read signal from the CCU 18, 29 to the VCU 17, 28. The TCSCRD signal gates the status byte onto the TCDATA bus from the voice codec status register designated by the TCADDR lines., 361658=For the transmit channels, one block of 328 bits (41 bytes) of processed speech is transferred from the VCU 17, 28 to the CCU 18, 29 prior to the beginning of each SVBP during a voice codec block transfer period (VCBTP). The VCU's 64 Kbps input data stream, which is associated with a processed speech block, is shown to be partitioned into voice coder block periods (VCBPs) that are 22.5 msec in length. Referring to transmit channel 0 in FIG. 19A, unprocessed VC input data in VCBPs OA1 and OB1 is associated with processed data in VCBTPs OA1 and OB1. Also note that the VCBPs for channels 0 and 2 are staggered by one-half of a VCBP (i.e., 11.25 msec) from the VCBPs for channels 1 and 3., 368886=In the standby mode, continuous hardware diagnostic routines are executed and the resulting status stored in the status register. Block transfers to the CCU 18, 29 will not occur until the operating mode is changed by a block request corresponding to VCBTPA. The new control word (and operating mode) is read by the voice codec and the diagnostic status information is passed to the CCU 18, 29., 369300=The transmit channel VCU hardware receives 8-bit \u03bc-law companded PCM (at 8 KHz sampling rate) from the PBX/STU interface. After processing the data according to the current mode of operation, the output data is transferred to the CCU 18, 29 in blocks of 41 bytes during a voice codec block transfer period (VCBTP) as shown in FIG. 19A. Data buffering is performed within the VCU 17, 28 to simplify the input/output requirements of the CCU 18, 29. Control information is passed between the VCU 17, 28 and the CCU 18, 29 via a set of control and status ports for each transmit channel at the beginning of a VCBTP as shown in FIG. 17. The following operating modes are supported by the transmit codecs:, 366497=The BLOCKRDY line 104 carries a block ready signal from the CCU 18, 29 to the VCU 17, 28. The BLOCKRDY signal is used to initiate a 41 byte block transfer of data from the CCU 18, 29 to the voice codec specified by the RCADDR lines. The BLOCKRDY signal is used by the voice codec for start VCBP timing. The CCU 18, 29 is required to have a data byte available in the RCDATA register prior to the rising edge of the BLOCKRDY signal., 266191=The remainder of the slot contains two voice codec packets containing 328 bits of information each., 377262=The reverse process is performed for the receive data from the modem, Data from the modem is received by a receive modem interface module (RMIM) 114 and buffered in a receive memory module (RMM) 115. This data is then converted from the 1, 2 or 4-bit-per-symbol format used by the modem to the eight-bit byte format used internally by the CCU and all other baseband processing. The overhead and control bits are stripped from the incoming data stream on the RX bus 108 by the MCM 111 according to its knowledge of the frame timing, which is provided by the modem to a frame timing module (FTM) 116 and its own identification of various code words in the symbol stream. The converted data is provided to the VCU via a receive voice codec interface module (RVCIM) 117., 375664=FIG. 21 is a block diagram of the CCU. The architecture of the CCU is essentially that of two one-way direct memory access (DMA) data channels with an intelligent microprocessor controller. The function of the DMA channels is to transfer data from the VCU to the modem and vice versa. The CCU interface to the VCU includes two parallel DMA buses, a TX bus 107 for the transmit (VCU to CCU to modem) and a RX bus 108 for the receive channel (modem to CCU to VCU). Data processed by the transmit circuits in the VCU is buffered in the VCU memory until the CCU requests a DMA transfer. Forty-one bytes are transferred to the CCU during each block transfer period. Two of these blocks are transmitted per active voice channel (up to four voice channels in the base station) per TDMA frame. The CCU receives these transmit bytes via a transmit voice codec interface module (TVCIM) 109 and buffers them in a transmit memory module (TMM) 110. Depending on the specific mode of operation for the given channel, a CCU processor embodied in a microcontroller module (MCM) 111 appends a control/sync header to the coded voice bytes, thereby formatting a complete voice packet for transmission to the modem via a transmit modem interface module 112. The MCM 111 maintains frame timing information and transfers the data to the modem at the proper time. Before being transferred to the modem the transmit data is converted by the MCM 111 from the eight-bit byte format used by the CCU to a symbol format containing 1, 2 or 4 bits per symbol, depending on the modulation levels for that slot., 284809=To ensure that utilization is not greater than 20%, we must consider the average time T between call requests per subscriber, the total number N of subscribers, and the frame time F for values less than 36%, the utilization is given by NF/T. For F=45 msec, N=1000 subscribers, and T=30 seconds, the utilization is 1.5%., 370312=In the internal mode, previously processed speech data is passed from the PBX 15 or the STU 27 through the VCU 17, 28 and into the CCU 18, 29. The 64 Kbps input data stream consists of an idle byte patter (FF hex), one sync byte (55 hex), 41 previously processed compressed speech data bytes, and additional idle bytes until the next sync byte occurs. The voice codec monitors the input data for the sync byte, which occurs on a byte boundary, then buffers the 41 bytes of speech data. The speech block is then transferred to the CCU 18, 29 during the next VCBTP as described above. FIG. 20B provides an example of the input and output data timing and content for 16-PSK modulation. Segment 1 on the output channel is a sync byte; and segment 2 is a processed speech byte. The cross-hatched segment represents an idle byte pattern. Note that the sync and speech data bytes will not occur across VCBP boundaries., 285148=Thus for the 20% maximum utilization value, a population of 1000 subscribers each making a call on the average every half minute can be supported by a 45 ms frame time with access delays of about 45 ms when one retransmission is required, and an average access time of approximately 70-80 ms. The price paid for the much lower average delay is an increased delay variance, which for the 20% or less utilization should rarely exceed two retransmission times, i.e., one second., 413499=The baud rate generator is programmed for a nominal rate of 9600 baud, resulting in a maximum of 1920 interrupts per second. Each interrupt must be serviced within a 1 ms period to avoid data loss. Since the typical interrupt frequency is low and the response time relatively long, BCC data transfer interrupts have a low priority., 355811=Referring to FIG. 13, the PBX SDAT0, 1, 2 and 3 lines 70, 71, 72, 73 carry data signals from the PBX 15 to the VCU 17 in the base station. In the subscriber station the data signal is carried on the STU SDAT0 line 74 from the STU 27 to the VCU 28 (FIG. 14), 8-bit \u03bc-255 companded serial data is sent to the voice codec during the active portion of the PBX/STU GATE0 OR PBX GATE1 . . . 3 at a clock rate of 256 KHz. Data is clocked into the VCU 17, 28 on the rising edge of the 256 KHz clock., 358202=The PBX-VCU and STU-VCU interfaces also perform the complementary function for the receive voice codecs. In the base station, 8-bit parallel data, received from the four codec channels, is converted into four 64 Kbps synchronous serial channels for transmission back to the PBX 15. In the subscriber station, one voice channel is converted and sent back to the STU 27., 433729=The modem 19 is unaware of the fact that there are four voice codecs in the base station, multiplexed by the CCU 18, for four 16 PSK subscriber slot assignments. The modem 19 accepts the bit stream from the CCU 18 and treats the transmission just as a single codec subscriber., 350594=The third STU mode is the call setup mode. In this mode, no data is conveyed from the STU 27 to the VCU 28 through the mode select MUX 57. However, a ringback tone generator circuit 65 is connected to the mode select MUX 57. This circuit digitally synthesizes the tones used in call placement procedures, such as busy and error tones. During call placement, DTMF digits dialed by the user are detected by a DTMF detector circuit 66 and processed by the SCU 58 to place the call. The ringback tone generator circuit 65 returns appropriate tones to the user's head set. A ring generator 67 is connected to the SLIC 53. A timing generator 68 provides timing signals to the PCM codec 55, the VCU driver receiver circuit 61 and the ringback tone generator 65. Once the call placement is complete, the STU will switch to either the voice mode or the data mode for communications with the base station., 364749=The TCVCRST line 97 carries a transmit channel voice codec reset signal from the CCU 18, 29 to the VCU 17, 28. The transmit voice codec specified by the TCADDR lines is reset., 365918=The RCSCWR line 102 carries a receive channel status/control write signal from the CCU 18, 29 to the VCU 17, 28. The RCSCWR signal writes the control word into the appropriate voice codec control register determined by the RCADDR lines. Data is latched into the register on the rising edge of RCSCWR signal., 349384=The STU can essentially operate in one of three distinct modes. The first, and most basic, mode is the voice mode. In this mode, voice samples from the PCM codec 55 are transferred through the mode select MUX 57 and a VCU driver-receiver circuit 61 to the VCU 28, where they are further processed to reduce the bit rate from 64 Kbps to 14.6 Kbps and then sent on for transmission to the base station., 366245=The RCSCRD line 103 carries a channel status/control read signal from the VCU 17, 28 to the CCU 18, 29. The RCSCRD signal gates the voice codec status word onto the RCDATA bus from the status register designated by the RCADDR lines.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes An important function of the diversity processor is to maintain communications between the CCU and the three modems. This communication must be done quickly enough so as to meet all of the CCU's requirements but not so fast as to overload the diversity processor. In the subscriber station diversity system, each modem has its own timing unit, and the timing signals used by the three modems in the diversity system are not necessarily in phase. Because the modem clock signals of the three modems are not synchronized to each other, latches are needed to hold the data symbol output from each modem until the diversity processor reads it. Because the I/O capabilities of the TMS320 microprocessor are small, and most of the processing works with one type of I/O register at a time, a special register which will hold the register address needed at the time is used. For example, the AGC value from each modem must be read, the highest value chosen, and the result written to the diversity processor's I/O registers where it can be read by the CCU. The addressing of these registers is most efficiently done if the address of the AGC register is first written to a port where it is placed on the modem address lines. Thereafter, the processor need only address the correct modem or the microprocessor register bank, thereby speeding I/O operations. The diversity processor-CCU interface registers",
