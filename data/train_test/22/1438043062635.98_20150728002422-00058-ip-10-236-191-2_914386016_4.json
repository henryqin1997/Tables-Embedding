The method chosen was Molecular Dynamics carried out on a series of DNA fragments containing multiple copies of the 136 unique tetranucleotide sequences. The calculations were carried out by a consortium of nine laboratories, four European and five in the USA. Having obtained the basic data the results are now being analyzed. The day long meeting on May 7 will have a number of talks describing results arising from, and pertinent to, the ongoing ABC project. On May 8 members of the consortium will meet in closed session.}",
