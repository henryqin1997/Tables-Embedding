            "Anyone who plans to major in Engineering (it is an engineering school after all). Anyone who plans to major in Business or the Sciences. Anyone who wants to obtain a taste of Rhode Island. This school is great if you enjoy sports and different events.",
            "Any student thinking about coming to this University should consider the following: 1) Am I ready to go to college? (no matter where you go, this is extremely important to ask yourself). 2) Am I willing to work hard and persevere in my work? (this does not mean you need to get straight A's. However you do need to remain focused, or it will come back to haunt you). 3) Do I plan to be an engineering, a science, or a business major? (this question may be too early to ask yourself. However since this University focuses on Engineering, Business, and the Sciences make sure you have a particular interest in one of these majors). 4) Have fun!!! (this is college; work hard but enjoy yourself. You do not need to be locked in your room studying 24/7).",
            "The expenses at this University are far from cheap. That being said, I do not feel that the investment put into this University has gone to waste.",
            "The University of Rhode Island has a great atmosphere, and makes a person feel at home. Being a student who has lived on campus for three years I enjoy walking on campus and looking at the trees, the different buildings, and being able to smell the roses.",
            "At the University of Rhode Island, I am learning about many topics that I have been interested in and that my high school did not offer. The economics courses and business courses are interesting and make me want to continue to learn more about the subjects. General Education courses are interesting as well."

You may have a few problems, such as the bathroom, with hall mates if you have a community bathroom. The quiet hours are always occurs after 11 o'clock. If you have a problem with your dorm building or roommate, you can request to switch rooms or dorms., 73242=Ive changed my mind about attending here because they obviously do a poor job of teaching business ethics. I researched the Frank Navarro scholarship and found that the fund was set up by his son/URI alum, Ben Navarro. He operates a company called LVNV Funding. Google LVNV Funding and you'll see an endless amount of unethical trash that comes up about this company. My application is cancelled since this school failed to research where they get their scholarship money from. http://advance.uri.edu/quadangles/sum2005/story10.htm, 448531=They have a nearly naked mile every year in early december and local businesses set up food carts and games on the quad for students during the day., 12863=I love it at the URI Kingston campus. It is a beautiful campus filled with Rhody pride! The great thing about this school is that all the students WANT to be there, and that makes the experience even better. I love going to class, spending time with friends, and kicking a soccer ball around in the quad. Everything on this campus is enjoyable, even the food! URI has one of the best food services in the state hands down, I have not heard one person complain about the food. There are so many organizations that you can join from sports clubs to Greek Life. I have enjoyed ballroom dancing myself, it is loads of fun and the best thing is that I have gotten to meet so many people. The weather is not too bad either. A bit of rain and snow, but that is everywhere in the north east. However, the sun still shines often and it is very comfortable living at school. I also enjoy the classes because the class are not too big and the teachers are so well trained, I could not ask for a better atmosphere. Walking to class is also a great way to exercise because the campus is on a hill, which makes it better because you do get a little workout on the way to class. Meeting friends has also been a blast because the school sets up so many events where you get to meet all different kinds of people. I even went to a comedy night where I saw Ralphie May perform and I cannot even explain how hard I laughed! This school has been so enjoyable, I don't know why people would decide not to go to URI., 531482=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 76670=FRESHMAN Make plans for living OFF CAMPUS.

There are the crazy, outgoing partiers; the studious students who are spend most of their time at the library; the indie-rocknroll kids who run the 198\u00b0 coffee shop; the preppy, well-dressed, perfectly manicured girls (and boys); and everyone in between. Trust me, you will find friends that will accept you just the way you are. Tips for prospective students URI is overall a great institution that can give students a good education and offer them opportunities that other colleges could not. If you are planning on attending the University take advantage of these opportunities provided for you. Establish a relationship with the teachers and staff and you can look forward to a rewarding college experience. Bang for the buck The University of Rhode Island is",
