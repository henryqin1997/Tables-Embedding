            "if you want to be involved in culinary arts, this is the place for you. not to say that that's all there is, but the culinary institute being on campus is pretty impressive. a huge building is yours for the taking when you go for culinary arts. even in it's magnitude, it's not intimidating at all. everyone here makes you feel so comfortable you will have nothing to fear and everything to gain.",
            "trident technical college is a great school, considering it's a technical college. it's surprising to me that some people actually classify technical schools as below the bar because this one is definitely way above the average.",

            "don't be afraid to ask questions. the faculty at this school is always willing to help but you have to take the initiative. this isn't highschool anymore. this is your stepping stone for an amazing future, but it belongs to you and no one else. what are you waiting for?",
            "so far, my experience with trident technical college has been wonderful. for a technical college, everyone is very professional and knows their area of expertise and is more than willing to help students in any way that they can. i look forward to finishing my associates and then transferring, and i will always remember trident technical college as where it all began."

I have a full 15-hr schedule this semester and although my classes are all quite different and unique, I am learning many new things in them. One of my favorite classes is Western Civ post-1689; which may not sound important but it is because I usually resent history classes about western civilizations. This one however, I quite enjoy.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck You get what you pay for. Trident is a very in-expensive school. The classes are just enough to be able to transfer to a 4-year school. Scheduling can just be plain miserable since the system they have set up for that is not too effective. They do though have a really nice learning center that allows students to go in to get free tutoring in almost all the subjects that Trident offers. Am enjoying being here Trident's an okay school though I have noticed that there are not a lot of student activities going on within the school. They have a student activity period once a month for an hour, but that's it as far as student get togethers are concerned. I tend to find that if I don't have a class, then I'm not on campus. There's not much to do on campus unless you enjoy playing video games in the cafeteria. Am learning a lot For the most part, I tend to feel that Trident's classes are easier then similar classes that I took in high school. Trident does not present much of a difficulty as far as classes are concerned. For the most part, if you show up and pay attention, you can pass",
