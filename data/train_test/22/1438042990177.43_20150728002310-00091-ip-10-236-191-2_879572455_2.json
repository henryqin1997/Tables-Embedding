    "textAfterTable": "Maildir implementation in KMail The implementation based strictly on the original maildir specification in kmail does not work on Windows' file system, since it uses the \":\" (forbidden on windows) character in file names. It also relies (as does maildir in general) on the atomicity of making a hardlink and then unlinking the original, to implement an atomic move. The implementation used by akonadi (kdepim/maildir) relies on QFile in that regard, but it's unclear if rename is atomic on all platforms. jstaniek 12:50, 7 January 2008 (CET): Hard/soft links could be handled on Windows by altering the source code so that the \"link\" file is a text file itself and contains the target path. If we need atomic renames, Windows apparently lacks them, I have found a pre-Vista blog which contains description on how to perform them in a messy but honest way (look at the very last \"Write process (on Foo.txt)\" version). There's also a way to recover from application/system crash during the pseudo-atomic operations (see the very last \"Recovery from a crash during write\" checklist). jstaniek 12:42, 24 January 2008 (CET): We will most probably benefit from maildir suport on Windows as Thunderbird (ver. <3) apparently lacks support for this storage, despite many wishes and plans. jstaniek 12:42, 24 January 2008 (CET): regarding replacing \":\" character on windows:",
