For example, the fluid might be a gas, but preferably it is a liquid, preferably an oil or an isotonic salt solution. It should further be evident that all components of the device are made of biocompatible materials. At the end of the expansion of the pouch 5, say after about a year, the loop opening has been reduced to its final size. The total process has been completed with a smooth, stepwise reduction of the loop opening without appreciable problems for the patient. As described, initially, the band 11 loop is disposed around the Esophagus 3, whereupon the upper part of the stomach 1 is pulled up through the band loop and then sutured to the stomach 1 part situated below the restriction, thereby forming a pouch 5 having a very small volume, e.g. about 7 ml and tunnellating the band 11. If the loop were directly tightened to its final size in association with the operation, said volume would be too small to give the patient sufficient nutrition directly after the operation. However, the pouch 5 will expand in course of time, normally up to ten times of its original size after about a year. Therefore, in order to solve the malnutrition problems the opening of the loop is initially adjusted to have its maximum size just after the operation. As",
