            "For fun on campus on nice days you see all the students on the mall playing kickball, sand volleyball or basketball. Another place we go is the underground, there is tv, food , and pool tables. Off campus we have movie theater , bowling alley and they were restoring the mini golf area when we were leaving. There are a lot of places to eat and hang out in town.",
            "Food got better as the year went on and as we were told , suppose to improve next year.",
            "The dorms are livable but need a little tlc. They are old .",
            "We are known for academics , some of programs people come from all over just to be in.",
            "Get as many scholarships as you can to help your parents out and so your loans aren't that high. And enjoy the campus.",
            "The campus is beautiful , it is small and makes you feel like home. All the staff are very nice and do anything they can to help you."
