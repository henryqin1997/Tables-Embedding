I know I would love that extra help that Stetson students receive, and it would help in giving me a better learning experience., 480993=Values Day, in September, everyone gets the day off of school to participate in community service. The library gives out milk and cookies during finals week., 508306=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 54839=with student to teacher 11:1 i say you can definitely learn a lot..and the professors are very open., 496032=The Rock is a pile of rocks Stetson paid $30,000 for in the fall of 2014 and has since become a location for students to share their views on the campus and the world. DeLand is affectionately known as the skydive capital of the world and Skydive Deland offers discounts to seniors during Senior Week. On a clear day on campus, you can see people skydiving., 456840=It's a great hands on college where you can connect with other students who have the same interests as you. the classes are a great size with a ration of a bout 1:11 so you can get that extra help and teachers know who you are. The campus is beautiful and serene, you can easily find a nice quiet place to spend your time studying or just to get away., 332915=It's not the best, but we have good coffee. When outside people visit, the food is better. Also, we are completely redoing our food services for the Fall of 2013 so who knows what it will be like}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Join an on campus organization. If you do so, you will have plenty of friends and never be bored. Also, take advantage of the small class sizes. Classes can be challenging, but the professors are all very willing to help. Bang for the buck The major drawback for me is the cost of attendance. It is not cheap. Even after scholarships and grants, I still have to take out loans each semester to pay for school. This is not the case for all students though. Many do receive enough financial aid to attend Stetson for free. Am enjoying being here The biggest complaint that students have about Stetson, and DeLand in general, is that it is too quiet on the weekends. If you are really big into drinking and partying, Stetson may not be the school for you. However, I have always found that Stetson has plenty to offer for me. Every Friday night, the CSA puts on fun activities, there is always some place on campus to find free food, and it is easy to keep oneself busy with all the concerts, organizations, and sports teams on campus. As an added bonus, Stetson is about halfway between Orlando and Daytona Beach and it is not a long drive to either one.",
