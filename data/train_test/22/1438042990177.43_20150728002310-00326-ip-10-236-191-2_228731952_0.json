Since many factors influence the pressure at which a hydraulic system will or will not perform satisfactorily, the values shown in SAE J1065 should not be construed as a guaranteed minimum. These fittings are capable of providing leakproof, full flow connections in hydraulic systems operating at working pressures as specified in Table 1 for respective sections. This SAE Standard covers complete general and dimensional specifications for 37 degree flared and flareless types of hydraulic tube fittings and O-ring plugs. Also included are pipe fittings and adapter unions for use in conjunction with these tube fittings. These fittings are intended for general application in hydraulic systems on industrial equipment and commercial products. Scope: 54",
