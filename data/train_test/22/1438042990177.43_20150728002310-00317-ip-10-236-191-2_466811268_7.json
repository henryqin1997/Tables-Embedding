No. 08/016,839, filed Feb. 12, 1993, now abandoned., 43921=The synthesis of DNA sequences is frequently the method of choice when the entire sequence of amino acid residues of the desired polypeptide product is known. When the entire sequence of amino acid residues of the desired polypeptide is not known, the direct synthesis of DNA sequences is not possible and the method of choice is the formation of cDNA sequences. Among the standard procedures for isolating cDNA sequences of interest is the formation of cDNA libraries (plasmid or phage), which are derived form reverse transcription of mRNA which is abundant in donor cells that have a high level of genetic expression. When used in combination with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, even rare expression products can be cloned. In those cases where significant portions of the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide are known, the production of labeled single or double-stranded DNA or RNA probe sequences duplicating a sequence putatively present in the target CDNA may be employed in DNA/DNA hybridization procedures which are carried out on cloned copies of the cDNA which have been denatured into a single-stranded form (Jay, et al., Nucleic Acid Research, 11:2325, 1983)., 52849=Previous studies have shown that striatal neurons in the basal ganglia could be stimulated by dopamine D1-receptor agonists (Shof, et al., Nature, 2:366, 1981). These studies examined the corresponding stimulation of CAMP to observe the relationship between CREB phosphorylation and activation of transcription of CAMP responsive genes. Cocaine has been shown to activate these neurons by inhibiting the reuptake transporter, thereby increasing synaptic levels of dopamine. Cocaine was examined to see whether CREB activity could be synaptically regulated. Sprague-Dawley male albino rats (250 g) were used for all experiments. All rats were housed in groups for at least 5 days prior to testing under a 12:12 light/dark cycle and standard ambient temperature. Food and water were available ad libitum. Animals were intravenously cannulated and injected with cocaine or vehicle on an hourly schedule over a 3 hour treatment period. Thirty minutes after treatment, rats (N=3 per group) were deeply anaesthetized and perfused transcardially with heparinized saline followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M NaPO4 buffer. Tissue sections were prepared and stained for CREB or c-fos as described previously (Torres, et al., Brain Res. 571:204, 1992). Stained sections were then treated with the chromogen DAB, washed with KPBS, mounted onto gelatin chrome alum-coated slides, and counterstained with pyronon Y. Representative coronal brain sections (40 \u03bcm) were counterstained with pyronon Y from male rats injected with cocaine hydrochloride (+) (5 mg/kg;iv) or saline vehicle (-) (0.9% NaCl). In FIG. 4 the arrows point to unreactive myelinated corticofugal fiber fundles coursing through the caudate-putamen. The upper panel shows immunostaining from sections incubated with non-discriminating (phospho and dephospho CREB) CREB Antibody 244. The middle panel shows sections treated with phosphoSer133-specific antibody 5322. The lower panel denotes c-fos expression as detected by polyclonal c-fos antibody. (Photomicrograph magnification 20\ufffd). Sham-injected animals showed only modest numbers of phospho-CREB immunoreactive cells distributed randomly throughout the caudate-putamen (FIG. 4). Acute injection of cocaine, however, evoked a dramatic increase in the number and intensity of phospho-CREB immunoreactive cells within the striatum. Moreover, this immunoreactivity was specifically blocked when the 5322 antiserum was preincubated with the CREB 128-141 phosphopeptide but not the unphosphorylated peptide., 25860=Antibody compositions useful in the present invention can be produced using various production systems well known in the art, such as by initiation of monoclonal hybridoma culture comprising a hybridoma that secretes antibody molecules of the appropriate polypeptide specificity. The culture is maintained under conditions and for a period of time sufficient for the hybridoma to secrete the antibody molecules into the medium. The antibody containing culture medium is then collected and antibody molecules can be further isolated by well known techniques. Monoclonal antibodies useful according to the method of the invention can also be purified from ascites fluid or recombinantly cloned (Huse, et al., Science, 246:1275, 1989; Mullinax, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:8095, 1990; Sastry, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 86:3833, 1989)., 40495=The peptides of the invention can be synthesized by such well known solid phase synthesis methods described by Merrifield (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:21-49, 1962) and Stewart and Young (Solid Phase Peptides Synthesis (Freeman, San Francisco, 1969, pp.27-62), using copoly(styrene-divinylbenzene) containing 0.1-1.0 mMol amines/g polymer. On completion of chemical synthesis, the peptides can be deprotected and cleaved from the polymer by treatment with liquid HF-10% anisole for about 1/4-1 hours at 0\ufffd C. After evaporation of the reagents, the peptides are extracted from the polymer with 1% acetic acid solution which is then lyophilized to yield the crude material. This can normally be purified by such techniques as gel filtration on SEPHADEX G-15 an ion exchange resin using 5% acetic acid as a solvent. Lyophilization of appropriate fractions of the column will yield the homogeneous peptide or peptide derivatives, which can then be characterized by such standard techniques as amino acid analysis, thin layer chromotography, high performance liquid chromatography, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, molar rotation, solubility, and quantitated by the solid phase Edman degradation., 42317=Alternatively, the polypeptides of the invention can be produced using recombinant techniques commonly known to those of skill in the art (see, for example, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel, et al., eds., Wiley lnterscience Press, 1989, incorporated herein by reference).}",

Indeed, those of ordinary skill in the art can readily envision and produce further embodiments, based on the teachings herein, without undue experimentation. By contrast with the increase in phospho-CREB immunoreactive cells noted within the striatum, no consistent changes were observed in other regions of the brain including the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cortex. Within the striatum, the induction in CREB phosphorylation was accompanied by a comparable increase in c-fos immunoreactivity (FIG. 4b) as previously described (Graybiel, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 87:6912, 1990). These results are consistent with previous findings from ours and other laboratories indicating the CREB binds to and activates the c-fos gene in response to cAMP (Dwarki, et al., EMBO. J. 9:225, 1990). Previous studies have shown that striatal neurons in the basal ganglia could be stimulated by dopamine D1-receptor agonists (Shof, et al., Nature, 2:366, 1981). These studies examined the corresponding stimulation of CAMP to observe the relationship between CREB phosphorylation and activation of transcription of CAMP responsive genes.
