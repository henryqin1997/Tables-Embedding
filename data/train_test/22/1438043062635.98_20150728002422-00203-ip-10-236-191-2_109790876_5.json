The project that is described here can be put together in 30-45 minutes.\u00a0 If you have to learn the knots as you go then allow a bit more time. Where To Build The best place to build the bridge is on flat ground between 2 anchors (trees) about 20 metres (60 feet) apart. I have used a telephone pole as an anchor and in a pinch you can create a holdfast (described later).\u00a0 DO NOT succumb to the temptation to build the bridge over a gully or stream. Unless the bridge will be used to actual cross these areas on an ongoing basis there is no point in adding the additional effort.

    "textAfterTable": "Step 1 - Build the 2 trestles Lay out 2 sets of spars as shown in the diagram and lash the spars together with a square lashing where they cross. (Note: Ensure the lashing at the crossing point of the longest spars is done well.) Step 2 - Lay out the long ropes Attach the footrope and the 2 handrail ropes to one of the anchors with \"round turn two half hitches\".\u00a0(note: If your handrail rope is a single length then loop the rope around the anchor twice to prevent slipping) String the ropes out on the ground to the next anchor.\u00a0 Attach the block and tackle to the second anchor and stretch it out towards the first anchor.\u00a0 At the point that the end of the block and tackle meets the footrope, tie a loop in the footrope using a bowline (if the end is handy) or a figure 8 1/2. DO NOT use an over hand knot to create a loop. You will have a great deal of trouble releasing the knot afterwards. Attach the block and tackle to the footrope Step 3 - Attach the first trestles Lay 1 trestle under the long ropes so that the top of the trestle is",
