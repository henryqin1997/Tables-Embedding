Running back Mike Davis did not play in last week\u2019s game against Coastal Carolina, but the sophomore is expected to be in the lineup on Saturday night. Davis is one of the SEC\u2019s top running backs, recording 1,112 yards and 10 touchdowns on 179 attempts. He is also a valuable weapon out of the backfield, catching 30 passes for 332 yards. Davis isn\u2019t the only runner for South Carolina, as Shon Carson and Brandon Wilds are capable options, while quarterback Connor Shaw is averaging 10 carries a game. Clemson has been slightly susceptible to the run this season, allowing an average of 3.8 yards per carry on 445 attempts. The Tigers allowed the last three opponents to reach the 100-yard mark, including 248 to Georgia Tech. However, Clemson held Boston College to 94 yards, and Florida State averaged 3.2 yards per carry on 38 attempts on Oct. 19. South Carolina\u2019s offense can match the Tigers in a shootout, but Steve Spurrier wouldn\u2019t mind if the Gamecocks control the clock and keep Tajh Boyd on the sidelines., 19233=94: Rushing yards per game averaged by Wake Forest \u2013 worst of the Jim Grobe era Losing receiver Michael Campanaro was a huge setback for Wake Forest\u2019s offense this year, but a bigger problem for the Demon Deacons has been the inability to run the ball. Through 11 games, Wake Forest is averaging just 94 yards per contest \u2013 easily the worst of the Jim Grobe era. The Demon Deacons averaged only 100.5 rushing yards per game last season, but 2013 is the first time under triple digits since 1998. Wake Forest\u2019s season rushing average has also declined in each of the last three years., 205530=Stopping the run has been a season-long issue for Texas A&M. The Aggies allowed 324 rushing yards in last week\u2019s loss to LSU, and two other opponents topped the 300-yard mark against this defense in 2013. The season totals don\u2019t paint a better picture for coach Kevin Sumlin, as Texas A&M is last in the SEC against the run, allowing an average of 5.3 yards per carry. The Aggies have some youth and inexperience in the front seven, so this unit is in transition in 2013. However, until Texas A&M can get stops, opposing teams will continue to exploit the front seven. Missouri averages 238 rushing yards per game, with three players recording over 500 yards this year. Henry Josey leads the team with 855 yards, but Russell Hansbrough (6.3 ypc) and Marcus Murphy (7.0 ypc) will contribute. Even though Texas A&M\u2019s offense is among the best in the nation, winning on Saturday night will be a challenge if the defense fails to slow down Missouri\u2019s ground attack. If the Tigers hit their season average on the ground, Missouri will be headed to Atlanta to play for the SEC Championship next week.\u00a0, 225299=The annual meeting between South Carolina and Clemson for bragging rights in the Palmetto State always has plenty of intrigue, but there\u2019s a little more at stake in 2013 when these two teams take the field., 168954=Georgia Tech won\u2019t have to face Aaron Murray, but the Bulldogs still have plenty of talent on the roster. The Yellow Jackets have not defeated their in-state rivals since 2008., 676=While athletic revenue isn\u2019t necessarily a true indicator of success, it\u2019s important to note when considering where Mississippi State is on the food chain in the SEC. The Bulldogs\u2019 2012 revenue of $69.8 million was considerably off SEC West rivals Arkansas ($99.7 million), Auburn ($105.9 million), Alabama ($124.9 million), LSU ($114.8 million) and Texas A&M ($119.7 million)., 137485=College Football's Post-Week 13 Bowl Projections for 2013, 165453=2. Duke (+5) at North Carolina (Noon ET, ESPN2) Excitement over a Duke-North Carolina game is usually reserved for the hardwood, but this season\u2019s game has major implications on the ACC and national level. The Tar Heels have won five in a row and can spoil the Blue Devils\u2019 Coastal Division title hopes with a victory. Not only is Duke a win away from playing in the conference championship, it needs a victory to set a school record for most wins in a season. North Carolina\u2019s offense has been on a tear over the last five games, averaging 44 points per contest in that span. Quarterback play is crucial for both teams on Saturday, as Marquise Williams stepped into the starting lineup for an injured Bryn Renner, and North Carolina\u2019s offense hasn\u2019t missed a beat. Duke\u2019s Anthony Boone struggled in wins over Virginia Tech and NC State but rebounded with a strong performance against Wake Forest last week (24 of 29, 256 yards, three touchdowns).\u00a0The Blue Devils won 33-30 in Durham last season, but the Tar Heels have claimed eight out of the last nine meetings. Duke\u2019s last win in Chapel Hill came in 2003. 3. Georgia (+3) at Georgia Tech (3:30 ET, ABC) For the first time since December 2009, someone other than Aaron Murray will be starting at quarterback for Georgia. Murray, one of the top quarterbacks in SEC history, is sidelined with a torn ACL suffered in Georgia\u2019s win over Kentucky last Saturday. In steps Hutson Mason, a junior who has thrown a combined 82 passes in his three seasons. Mason\u2019s task will be simple this week: Don\u2019t make many mistakes and hand the ball off to Todd Gurley on a frequent basis. Todd Grantham has had his struggles as the defensive coordinator at Georgia, but his defenses have done a solid job against Georgia Tech\u2019s option attack in his three seasons. Georgia has won all three by an average score of 38\u201320. 4. Florida State (+27) at Florida (Noon ET, ESPN) The annual meeting for bragging rights in the Sunshine State is usually one of the most-anticipated matchups of rivalry week. However, the 2013 matchup has a feeling of two teams headed in opposite directions. Florida State is two wins away from playing for the national championship, while Florida is having its worst season since a 0-10-1 record in 1979. The Gators enter Saturday\u2019s contest on a six-game losing streak, including a 26-20 defeat to FCS opponent Georgia Southern last week. Injuries have hampered Florida\u2019s season, and quarterback Tyler Murphy is questionable to play with a shoulder problem. Backup Skyler Mornhinweg has struggled in his two starts and faces a Florida State defense that leads the nation with 23 interceptions. Florida ranks second in the SEC in total defense, but the Seminoles average 7.9 yards per play and have scored at least 40 points in every game this year. 5. Miami (-2.5) at Pittsburgh (Friday, 3:30 ET, ABC) Miami and Pittsburgh are former Big East rivals, but these two teams meet for the first time as ACC foes on Friday. The Hurricanes own a sizeable 22-9-1 series edge over the Panthers and claimed a 31-3 win over the Panthers in 2010. Miami still has an outside shot at playing for the ACC Championship, but Al Golden\u2019s team needs a lot to go its way. The Panthers are trying to improve their bowl position, as well as win more than six games for the first time since 2010. Miami\u2019s defense snapped a three-game streak of allowing 40 points or more by holding Virginia to 26 points last week. But the Hurricanes are shorthanded at cornerback due to injuries and have generated only 11 sacks in ACC games. Pittsburgh has struggled to protect quarterback Tom Savage, but the receiving tandem of Tyler Boyd and Devin Street has combined for 78 catches (eight touchdowns) this season. Miami\u2019s offense ranks second in the ACC by averaging 6.8 yards per play, but turnovers (21) and inconsistent play have hindered this group\u2019s production. Both teams are struggling to establish the run in recent weeks, which puts even more pressure on Savage and Miami quarterback Stephen Morris to produce. 6. Boston College (-2) at Syracuse (3:30 ET, RSN) Syracuse needs one win to become bowl eligible, but the Orange has a tough assignment to earn win No. 6 on Saturday. Led by senior running back Andre Williams, Boston College has a four-game winning streak. Williams has 2,073 yards on 320 carries this season and has at least 263 yards in each of his last three games. Syracuse ranks sixth in ACC-only games against the run, allowing 149.7 yards per game. But a deeper look into the numbers shows the Orange has been vulnerable on the ground, as Georgia Tech gashed Syracuse for 394 yards and Florida State rushed for 225 yards on 19 attempts. Williams could find running room limited against the middle of the Orange\u2019s defense, which is anchored by senior tackle Jay Bromley. Syracuse\u2019s offense plans to have a similar blueprint of attack, relying on Jerome Smith and Prince-Tyson Gulley to anchor a rushing game that averages 210.9 yards per game. Both teams should have no trouble establishing the run, so this game could be decided by whichever quarterback \u2013 Chase Rettig, Boston College or Terrel Hunt, Syracuse \u2013 is more efficient and makes plays with the game on the line. 7. Virginia Tech (-13) at Virginia (3:30 ET, ESPNU) The Commonwealth Cup and bragging rights in the state of Virginia are on the line when the Hokies and Cavaliers meet on Saturday. While Virginia Tech has to be focused on winning this game, the Hokies have to keep an eye on the scoreboard, as a North Carolina win over Duke would send Frank Beamer\u2019s team to the ACC Championship. While there are reasons to be excited in Blacksburg, Virginia is looking for answers after a 2-9 start. The Cavaliers have lost eight consecutive games, with a struggling offense (4.4 yards per play) the primary culprit. Virginia Tech\u2019s offense has faced its share of struggles on offense, but quarterback Logan Thomas has been solid in the Hokies' last two games. Thomas doesn\u2019t need to throw for 300 yards each week, especially with a defense that holds conference opponents under 300 yards per game (268.2), has generated 34 sacks and forced 24 turnovers. If Virginia can force a couple of turnovers, the Cavaliers will have a chance to snap a nine-game losing streak to their in-state rivals. But if Virginia Tech controls the turnover margin, its defense is capable of pitching a shutout against Virginia. 8. Maryland (-2.5) at NC State (12:30 ET, ACC Network) Saturday\u2019s road trip to Raleigh will be the final game for Maryland as an ACC member. The Terrapins are off to the Big Ten next season, but there\u2019s more at stake than just another conference game. Maryland is on the bowl bubble in the ACC, and a win over NC State would help the Terrapins land in the postseason. The Wolfpack is still searching for their first conference win, and first-year coach Dave Doeren hopes to snap a seven-game losing streak to build momentum for spring practice. NC State\u2019s offense showed some signs of life in the fourth quarter against East Carolina, but the Wolfpack is averaging only 16.3 points in ACC games this season. Maryland\u2019s offense has been hit hard by injuries at receiver, while turnovers (18) have also slowed this unit\u2019s production. The Terrapins have lost three out of the last four against NC State, with their last win in Raleigh coming in 2007. 9. Wake Forest (+14) at Vanderbilt (12:21 ET, SEC TV) Vanderbilt returns home after its thrilling win in Knoxville with a chance to win eight games in the regular season for the second straight season \u2014 something that hasn\u2019t been done since 1927-28. Here\u2019s an interesting stat: Vanderbilt has averaged 289.4 yards in its last five games, but the Commodores are 4\u20131 during that stretch with wins over Georgia, Florida, Kentucky and Tennessee. Wake Forest has shown sings of life in the last month \u2014 they lost by three at Miami and by seven to Duke \u2014 but the Deacons have lost four straight and will miss a bowl game for the fourth time in the last five seasons. Vanderbilt has won two straight over Wake by a combined score of 96\u201328. ACC Week 14 Pivotal Players, 102442=Ranking All 125 CFB Coaches on Hot Seat/Pressure on Program to Win in 2013, 9969=Army and Navy will play each other on Dec. 14 and somehow manage not to wear camouflage: pic.twitter.com/A4SDa0go9b, 138255=The bowl season doesn\u2019t start until December, but with just two weeks to go in the regular season, it's never too early to take a look at what the matchups might look like., 104751=With two weeks left in the 2013 season, college football\u2019s coaching carousel is about to get interesting. And after this Saturday\u2019s slate of games, several teams will close the book on their 2013 schedule. With the season over for many teams, expect to see a lot of changes starting on Sunday., 195871=Auburn\u2019s last victory over Alabama came in 2010, as Cam Newton guided the Tigers to a 28-27 win in Tuscaloosa., 195583=Kickoff: 3:30 ET TV Channel: CBS Spread: Alabama -10.5, 10223=These two teams will meet on Dec. 14 this year, and both will wear alternate uniforms., 150421=Anthony Chickillo, DE, Miami Protecting quarterback Tom Savage has been a huge problem for Pittsburgh this year. The Panthers have allowed an ACC-worst 40 sacks in 11 games. Chickillo is Miami\u2019s best defensive end and has generated 43 tackles and 3.5 sacks in 2013. If Savage has time to throw, he will have chances to take advantage of an injured Hurricane secondary. With concerns in the defensive backfield, ends Chickillo and Shayon Green need to get pressure on Savage and not allow the senior to hit on big plays downfield to receivers Devin Street and Tyler Boyd., 24477=Oct. 19: The last time Georgia Tech threw a touchdown pass Considering Georgia Tech has a run-first offense, it\u2019s no surprise it has only nine passing scores all year. However, it\u2019s a bit surprising the Yellow Jackets have gone four games without a touchdown toss. Even in the Nov. 14 loss to Clemson, Georgia Tech did not record a touchdown pass despite hoisting a season-high 26 attempts. It\u2019s not critical for the Yellow Jackets to throw for a score against Georgia this week, but Georgia Tech will need to throw to take some attention away from the line of scrimmage., 17427=74: Rushing yards Kevin Parks needs to reach 1,000 Virginia\u2019s offense has struggled mightily at times this year. The Cavaliers rank ninth in the ACC (conference-only games) in total offense, averaging just 4.4 yards per play. The rushing attack has been one of the few bright spots, with running back Kevin Parks averaging 84.2 yards per game. Parks also has 11 touchdowns this year. If Parks rushes for 74 yards against Virginia Tech, the junior will become the first Virginia rusher since Alvin Pearman in 2004 to reach 1,000 yards., 176286=Mark Ross: East Carolina (+3) over Marshall The Conference USA East Division crown is on the line in Huntington, West Va., Friday afternoon when Marshall (8-3) hosts East Carolina (9-2). The two are tied at 6-1 in conference play and boast not only the conference's top two offenses, but two of the most productive in the entire nation. The Thundering Herd is eighth in scoring nationally at 43.3 points per game while the Pirates are 11th at 41.5. That doesn't mean either doesn't play defense however, as ECU and Marshall are second and third, respectively, in C-USA in yards allowed. The Pirates' two losses this season are by five points to Virginia Tech and a three-point overtime setback to Tulane on the road. The Herd's three defeats have come by a total of 13 points, the biggest being a 29-21 three-overtime loss in Blacksburg, Va., to the aforementioned Hokies. What tips the scales in ECU's favor, however, is that the Pirates have gone 2-0 in their home state, having beaten both North Carolina and NC State on the road. It's been a season to remember for the Tar Heel State's unheralded football programs with Duke grabbing most of the headlines, but I also think ECU's impressive 2013 campaign will continue with a 10th win and a C-USA East Division title on Friday. Stephen Schindler (@SteveSchindler): Clemson (+5) over South Carolina Tajh Boyd is perhaps the most accomplished quarterback in Clemson history. The only thing that eludes him is a win over in-state rival South Carolina, as he's 0-3 against the Gamecocks. Boyd sits just a single win behind Rodney Williams, the program's all-time winningest quarterback. Unfortunately for Boyd, he's been caught in the wake of the machine that is Steve Spurrier. The Ole Ball Coach has owned the Tigers as of late, registering four straight wins in The Battle of the Palmetto State. However, Spurrier hasn't been nearly as dominant in this rivalry as many believe, owning just a 5-3 record against Clemson in his eight years in Columbia. Despite the disappointing results for Dabo Swinney, this is the most talented team Clemson has put together in recent memory. Despite playing in the ACC, Clemson has played two top teams in Georgia (while they were healthy) and Florida State. South Carolina, on the other hand, has played an extremely weak schedule, albeit an SEC schedule. Because the Tigers' rushing attack will be nearly non-existent, the offensive line must give Boyd time to get the ball to his playmakers downfield. A major problem that Clemson must fix is all the turnover issues that have been so devastating in these games. During their four-game losing streak, Clemson lost the turnover battle with nine giveaways and only three takeaways. I think a mature Boyd, knowing what this game means to his legacy, will be able to buy himself the necessary time and make smart decisions with the football., 216489=Florida State needs two wins to play for the national championship, while Florida is in the midst of the school\u2019s worst season since a 0-10-1 record in 1979., 103683=Virginia\u2019s Mike London is in a similar position to Muschamp. London is on the hot seat after a 2-9 mark, but he is expected to return for 2014. The Cavaliers have a solid recruiting class on the way, which should help London restock the roster. However, London likely needs to make a bowl game to save his job., 20181=16: Florida State defensive players with interceptions this season Under the direction of first-year coordinator Jeremy Pruitt, Florida State\u2019s defense leads the nation with 23 interceptions. To indicate how deep the talent pool is on defense in 2013, the Seminoles have 16 players with interceptions this season. Freshman Nate Andrews leads the team with four, while senior linebacker Telvin Smith leads a group of four players tied with two. Five of Florida State\u2019s 16 interceptions have been returned for touchdowns, including two by Smith and one by Andrews.\u00a0, 25363=17-9: Frank Beamer\u2019s record against Virginia The Hokies are in the midst of a semi-disappointing season, but with a little bit of help, can still reach the ACC Championship. However, Virginia Tech has to beat rival Virginia to have any hope of playing for the conference title. Hokies\u2019 coach Frank Beamer has owned the Cavaliers in recent years, winning nine in a row and 13 out of the last 14. Beamer\u2019s all-time record against Virginia is 17-9, with the Cavaliers\u2019 last victory in Blacksburg coming in 1998., 990=In USA Today\u2019s 2012 athletic department revenue study, Mississippi State ranked 11th in the SEC, just ahead of Ole Miss and Missouri (Vanderbilt did not disclose its revenue)., 18267=211-194-4: Maryland\u2019s ACC record with one conference game remaining Maryland travels to NC State this Saturday for the final ACC game in school history. The Terrapins have made gains in reach of Randy Edsall\u2019s three seasons in College Park and should play in a bowl this year. Maryland\u2019s all-time record in ACC play is 211-194-4, with the last winning record in conference games occurring in 2010. The Terrapins are just 11-28 in ACC games over the last five years., 177939=Steven Lassan (@AthlonSteven): NC State (+2.5) over Maryland On paper, I think it\u2019s a light week for upset possibilities. But then again, this is rivalry week and anything can happen. NC State\u2019s first season under new coach Dave Doeren has been a disappointment, but the future in Raleigh looks bright, especially with Jacoby Brissett eligible to start at quarterback in 2014. Even though the Wolfpack has lost six of their seven ACC games by 10 points or more, I think they knock off Maryland on Saturday. This is Maryland\u2019s final ACC game, as a move to the Big Ten is in order next season. The Terrapins are dealing with a plethora of injuries on both sides of the ball and rank 11th in the ACC in total offense. It was no surprise Maryland's defense struggled to stop Boston College's Andre Williams last week, but the Wolfpack can test the Terrapins again with the run, as Shadrach Thornton is averaging 4.6 yards per carry and has two 100-yard efforts in ACC play. NC State\u2019s offense found a spark late in the fourth quarter against East Carolina, and I think the Wolfpack carry that into this week\u2019s game to send the Terrapins back to College Park with a loss in their final ACC game., 104176=Florida\u2019s Will Muschamp takes the top spot in this week\u2019s hot seat watch. The Gators have been hit hard by injuries, but there\u2019s simply no excuse for losing to a FCS team. Not only did Georgia Southern win in the Swamp, but the Eagles also dominated the line of scrimmage against a team that recruits among the best nationally. Barring a change of opinion by athletic director Jeremy Foley after playing Florida State this Saturday, Muschamp is expected to return for 2014., 23522=44: Average points per game by North Carolina with Marquise Williams starting at QB Williams has four starts under his belt this year \u2013 Virginia Tech, Virginia, Pittsburgh and Old Dominion \u2013 and the Tar Heels are averaging 44 points a game in those contests. The 80 points scored against Old Dominion slightly skews that total, but even if you remove the game against the Monarchs, Williams is still averaging 31.7 points in the other three starts. With Williams only getting better, along with a strong core of skill players returning next season, the Tar Heels should be in the mix to win the Coastal in 2014., 203546=What a difference a year makes. Coming into 2013, Missouri coach Gary Pinkel was on the hot seat, and there were plenty of doubters about whether or not this program was ready to compete for a SEC title. A year later, the Tigers are just one win away from a trip to Atlanta. Texas A&M won 59-29 over Missouri last season, but this is a much-improved team. The Tigers use their ground attack to control the clock, while the defense makes just enough timely plays to clinch the SEC East title., 190537=With both teams ranked in the top five of the BCS standings, this season\u2019s meeting is arguably one of the biggest in this rivalry\u2019s history. There\u2019s no shortage of storylines and national implications, as the winner of this game is headed to Atlanta to play for the SEC Championship. Not only is the SEC West title on the line, the Crimson Tide needs to win to stay atop the BCS standings. Auburn\u2019s 2013 season is no fluke. The Tigers are a much-improved team and will give Alabama\u2019s defense all it can handle. However, the Crimson Tide makes the necessary adjustments at halftime, which contains the Tigers\u2019 offense in the second half. Home field advantage helps Auburn trade punches with Alabama through the first three quarters. But Alabama finds a way to pull away in the fourth quarter, sending the Crimson Tide to Atlanta for the fourth time in six seasons., 196882=How high have the stakes been in this rivalry in recent years? The winner of the last four Iron Bowls went on to win the national championship. The Crimson Tide has won three out of the last four BCS titles, with Auburn\u2019s championship coming in 2010., 207111=Kickoff: 7:45 p.m. ET TV Channel: ESPN Spread: Missouri -4.5, 223994=Clemson\u2019s last win in this series came in 2008, while its last victory at South Carolina occurred in 2007., 196163=Alabama has claimed wins in four out of the last five meetings with Auburn. The Crimson Tide has won two in a row at Auburn, including a 42-14 victory in 2011. Alabama has dominated the Tigers over the last two years, winning the two meetings by a combined score of 91-14., 196612=While Alabama has been the standard in college football over the last six seasons, Auburn has only one year (2010) of more than nine victories in that span. Behind first-year coach Gus Malzahn, the Tigers are one of the most-improved teams in the nation. Former coach Gene Chizik recruited plenty of talent to Auburn, but Malzahn and his staff have done a better job of developing and maximizing the talent on the roster in 2013., 27214=0: Amount of times Duke has finished a season with double-digit wins Duke\u2019s annual matchup against North Carolina is usually one of the most-anticipated games on the hardwood, but this year\u2019s meeting has extra importance on the gridiron. With a win over the Tar Heels, the Blue Devils will clinch a spot in the ACC Championship and earn their first season of double-digit wins in school history. Duke won nine games in 1993, 1936, 1938 and 1941 under Wallace Wade. However, the Blue Devils have never managed to crack the 10-win mark. If Duke doesn\u2019t win this week, it will have another shot at 10 victories in a bowl., 7508=The FIRST photo of the Army uniform for the @Army_Navy_Game on Dec. 14! Check out Navy's at http://t.co/WGsRAgR790 pic.twitter.com/oICkgmgppf, 214630=Florida\u2019s Key to Victory: Establish the run and control the clock Florida\u2019s quarterback situation is up in the air for Saturday\u2019s game. Tyler Murphy stepped into the starting lineup after Jeff Driskel was lost for the season against Tennessee. Murphy threw for 1,216 yards and six touchdowns in his nine appearances this year, while third-stringer Skyler Mornhinweg has made two starts in a row while Murphy sat out with an injured shoulder. Mornhinweg has thrown for 229 yards on 24 completions this year but averaged only 8.7 yards per completion in last week\u2019s loss to Georgia Southern. Time of possession can be an overrated statistic in college football. However, Florida leads the SEC by averaging 34:16 in time of possession each week. Controlling the clock and limiting the possessions of Florida State\u2019s offense would seem to be the only hope the Gators have of winning. Running back Kelvin Taylor has been a bright spot for this offense, rushing for 483 yards on 105 attempts. The Seminoles struggled at times to stop the run earlier this year, but this unit has not allowed a team to rush for more than 150 yards in each of the last four games. And Florida State has not allowed a rushing touchdown since a 49-17 victory over NC State on Oct. 26. It\u2019s not an easy assignment against an aggressive defense, but the Gators have to plan for a run-heavy approach on Saturday., 207539=These two teams have met 13 times, with one appearance as SEC opponents. Texas A&M holds an 8-5 series edge over the Tigers. Missouri\u2019s last victory against the Aggies occurred in 2011. The last three meetings in this series were in College Station, and the Tigers won the last matchup in Columbia (2007)., 103353=Is Thursday night\u2019s game against Texas Tech the final home game for Mack Brown? The Longhorns are 7-3 and host the Red Raiders on Thanksgiving night, before playing at Baylor on Dec. 7. Brown could return for 2014, but with a new athletic director, his future in Austin is uncertain., 167377=ACC Week 14 Game Power Rankings 1. Clemson (+5) at South Carolina (7:00 ET, ESPN2) The Iron Bowl is stealing the headlines \u2014 and rightfully so \u2014 but the annual battle for bragging rights in the Palmetto State should be just as intense. For the first time ever, these two teams will meet with both schools ranked in the top 10. Clemson, at 10\u20131, is on the fringe of the national title chase, but the Tigers can put themselves in position to earn an at-large invite to a BCS bowl with a win over South Carolina. The Gamecocks will no doubt be focused on winning this game, but they will also have an eye on the scoreboard. If Missouri loses at home to Texas A&M \u2014 in a game that kicks off 45 minutes later \u2014 South Carolina will represent the East in the SEC title game. Diving into the matchup in Columbia, you might be surprised to learn that South Carolina has been the more efficient team on offense on a per-play basis (6.6 for the Gamecocks to 6.3 for the Tigers) and Clemson has been better on defense (5.1 to 5.4). The schedules haven\u2019t been the same \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s has been more difficult \u2014 but these stats seem to contradict the national perception of both teams., 187554=Catching up on the news from around the nation.... Contact us on twitter with a link or a tip we should include each day. (@AthlonSteven) College Football's Must-Read Stories Around the Web for Wednesday, November 27th It seems every coach celebrates a win by dancing in the locker room these days. Lost Lettermen ranked the best dancing moves from head coaches. Voting is open to honor the best college player in South Carolina this year. And 13 players have also been announced as finalists for the South Carolina Football Hall of Fame. Washington State athletic director Bill Moos hasn't forgotten about the nasty e-mails he received.\u00a0 Duke athletic director Kevin White is pushing for the ACC to have its own television channel by 2016. Iowa and Iowa State have announced an extension to their annual rivalry.\u00a0 LSU could be losing another group of underclassmen to the NFL Draft this offseason. The staff at Nunes Magician previews Syracuse's game against Boston College. Can the Orange stop Andre Williams? A good wrapup of California coach Sonny Dykes' postseason press conference. Running back David Fluellen's career at Toledo is likely finished due to a leg injury. Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray suffered a torn ACL against Kentucky, but the senior tried to play through the injury. Big changes appear to be coming for Florida's coaching staff this offseason. Oklahoma running back Damien Williams has been dismissed from the team. Notre Dame offensive lineman Nick Martin will miss the rest of the season due to a knee injury. Bad news for SMU's bowl hopes: Quarterback Garrett Gilbert is out against Houston due to a knee injury. UCLA offensive lineman Simon Goines is out for the rest of the season due to a leg injury.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{62877=This true freshman duo on Texas A&M\u2019s defense will eventually contend for All-SEC honors. However, in 2013, this inexperienced duo is what the Aggies have to rely on to slow opposing ground attacks. Golden and Claiborne have held their own this season, with Claiborne ranking second on the team with 69 tackles. Stopping LSU\u2019s rushing attack starts up front with Golden and continues with Claiborne in the middle. If Golden can get a good push, the Aggies can slow down the Tigers\u2019 ground game. It\u2019s a tough assignment, but Golden and Claiborne could hold the key to a Texas A&M victory., 13837=Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray suffered a torn ACL in Saturday\u2019s win over Kentucky and will miss the remainder of the 2013 season., 49287=Close games have defined this series in the last two years. UCLA won by two points last year and claimed a one-point victory in 2011. The Bruins own an 18-10-1 series edge over the Sun Devils, with Arizona State\u2019s last victory against UCLA coming in 2010. The Bruins have won two in a row over the Sun Devils in the Rose Bowl., 58407=LSU leads the overall series 28-20-3. The Tigers have won the last two meetings against Texas A&M, with the Aggies\u2019 last victory over LSU coming in 1995. This is only the second meeting between LSU and Texas A&M as SEC foes. This emerging rivalry will get some extra attention in 2014, as these programs are scheduled to play on Thanksgiving night in College Station., 51056=UCLA\u2019s rushing attack UCLA ranks seventh in Pac-12-only games in rushing offense. The Bruins are averaging 166.7 yards per game, but the ground game has received a spark in the last two games from linebacker Myles Jack. Yes, that\u2019s right, a linebacker. Jack is an athletic freak and has 179 yards on just 19 attempts. The coaching staff doesn\u2019t want to overuse Jack on offense, especially with a high-powered Arizona State offense on the other side. But Jack should expect to play some on offense, especially if Jordon James is less than full strength due to an ankle injury. James has played in only five games this year and has missed five out of the last six contests. The Sun Devils struggled against the run last season but rank second in the Pac-12 in 2013. Opponents are averaging just 111.3 yards per game on the ground against Arizona State this year. The Sun Devils held three of their last four opponents to 70 or fewer yards on the ground. UCLA has to be careful not to overwork Jack, but the freshman has been this team\u2019s best option recently. Will James be at full strength on Saturday night? If he is, the Bruins should be able to depend on him for 20 carries. However, expect to see Paul Perkins and quarterback Brett Hundley contribute to the ground game as well., 1309=If Mississippi State beats Ole Miss on Thursday night, the Bulldogs will earn a school-record fourth consecutive bowl appearance. Mullen\u2019s 24 wins from 2010-12 are the most for Mississippi State since Jackie Sherrill won 26 from 1998-2000., 48759=The Sun Devils have lost only one Pac-12 contest this season, a 42-28 matchup at Stanford in late September. Since losing to the Cardinal, Arizona State has reeled off five consecutive conference victories, including a 62-41 blowout win over USC., 5462=In the three years prior to Mullen\u2019s arrival, Mississippi State did not rank in the top 35 nationally in signing classes. In all five of Mullen\u2019s classes, the Bulldogs have reached that plateau, including the No. 19 overall class in 2009., 1568=Of Mississippi State\u2019s 15 SEC wins, none have occurred against Alabama, LSU or Texas A&M. However, the Bulldogs lost by only 13 against the Crimson Tide this season, which was Alabama\u2019s second-closest loss in 2013., 5042=Considering where Mississippi State is on the SEC\u2019s totem poll, back-to-back top-25 recruiting classes is a solid step for this program. And it\u2019s too early to judge the 2014 class, especially since the Bulldogs have only 19 commitments. Without a huge group of departing seniors, Mississippi State isn\u2019t going to sign a monster class this year, so it\u2019s likely the Bulldogs rank outside of the top 25., 5720=Within the state of Mississippi, the balance of power seems to have shifted back to Ole Miss. The Rebels signed seven of the state\u2019s top prospects in 2013 after inking three in 2012. And with a few months to go in the recruiting cycle, Ole Miss has a nine to five edge in top-25 recruits., 60483=Texas A&M\u2019s run defense vs. Jeremy Hill Texas A&M\u2019s rush defense has been gashed by opposing teams all season. Will that change on Saturday? The Aggies are allowing 223.5 rushing yards per game in SEC play. Auburn rushed for 379 yards against Texas A&M on Oct. 19, and only one opponent in conference action has been held under 100 yards by the Aggies (Vanderbilt). LSU goes four-deep at running back, and J.C. Copeland is one of the best fullbacks in the nation. Sophomore Jeremy Hill leads the team with 964 yards and 13 scores, but Terrence Magee (407 yards) and Kenny Hilliard (271 yards) should expect to see snaps on Saturday. Texas A&M defensive coordinator Mark Snyder has a tough choice. Does he load the box to slow down LSU\u2019s rushing attack? If the Aggies devote more attention to stop the run, the secondary will be vulnerable against the Tigers\u2019 receiving corps.\u00a0, 58896=Kickoff: 3:30 ET TV Channel: CBS Spread: LSU -4.5, 11160=If Mullen regresses to multiple years with a losing record, then it\u2019s time for Mississippi State to make a coaching change. But for now, Mullen is on pace to exceed the previous tenures in Starkville. And with improving facilities, Mullen has more ammunition to work on closing the gap in the SEC West.\u00a0 Mississippi State is a tough job, but Mullen has made progress. If the Bulldogs regress in 2014, then it\u2019s time to put Mullen on the hot seat., 10246=According to Mississippi State\u2019s game notes, the Bulldogs have only six seniors as starters. The two-deep depth chart also features 13 freshmen. This is clearly not a team built to win in 2013. With most of the core returning in 2014, combined with improvement on the recruiting trail, the Bulldogs should be in better shape to make a move in the SEC West. And with LSU, Texas A&M and Alabama losing key personnel, Mississippi State will have an opportunity to win eight games in 2014., 58147=LSU is likely out of the mix for a BCS bowl, but the Tigers have a chance to finish 2013 on a high note. And most importantly, with wins against Texas A&M and Arkansas, LSU will earn its fifth straight season of at least nine victories., 41722=After East Carolina\u2019s 42-28 victory over NC State, a billboard popped up in North Carolina celebrating the Pirates\u2019 2013 season., 35671=Boston College running back Andre Williams continued his stellar 2013 season with 263 yards and two touchdowns on 32 attempts against Maryland., 20573=Team of the Week: Boston College The Eagles continued their impressive turnaround under first-year coach Steve Addazio, recording a 29-26 road win against Maryland. The victory over the Terrapins gave Boston College seven this year, which is more than the program had from the 2011-12 seasons combined. Running back Andre Williams continues to carry the offense, rushing for 263 yards and two touchdowns on 32 attempts. Quarterback Chase Rettig completed only six passes, but the senior made a key 74-yard touchdown toss to Alex Amidon to give Boston College at 26-24 lead late in the fourth quarter. The Eagles\u2019 defense held Maryland to just 4.3 yards per play and sacked quarterback C.J. Brown four times., 59121=Johnny Manziel vs. LSU\u2019s defense LSU\u2019s defense managed to solve Texas A&M\u2019s high-powered offense last year. The Tigers held the Aggies to just 19 points (second-lowest total of the season), while quarterback Johnny Manziel recorded only 303 total yards and no touchdowns. LSU sacked Manziel three times and recorded eight tackles for a loss on the Aggies\u2019 offense. While the Tigers kept Texas A&M\u2019s offense in check last year, this unit is undergoing some major renovations. Through 10 games, LSU\u2019s defense is having an uncharacteristic season, ranking ninth in the SEC against the run and recording only 12 sacks in conference play. The Tigers\u2019 secondary has fared better than the rush defense, ranking sixth in the SEC in pass defense, but this unit has allowed 10 passing scores in six conference games. Manziel is still a dangerous runner (5.6 ypc), but the sophomore has made strides as a passer and is more patient in the pocket in 2013. LSU\u2019s defense was able to use its speed and athleticism on the line to keep Manziel in the pocket last year and limit his rushing attempts. With all of the personnel losses in the front seven, can the Tigers replicate the same gameplan? Or will an improved passing game from Manziel result in more big plays to receiver Mike Evans?, 61459=LSU\u2019s wide receivers versus Texas A&M\u2019s secondary These two teams aren\u2019t short on potential All-SEC talent, but Texas A&M\u2019s defense against LSU\u2019s offense is a mismatch. New coordinator Cam Cameron has made a big difference in improving the Tigers\u2019 offense, which includes the development of quarterback Zach Mettenberger. The senior has five of his seven interceptions in two out of his last three games. However, Mettenberger wasn\u2019t awful against Alabama (16 of 23, 241 yards) and was outstanding in a 44-41 loss against Georgia in September (23 of 37, 372 yards, three touchdowns). In addition to Cameron\u2019s play-calling and Mettenberger\u2019s development, another key reason for the improvement in LSU\u2019s passing attack is the one-two punch at receiver in Odell Beckham and Jarvis Landry. This duo has combined for 114 catches for 2,023 yards and 16 touchdowns this season. Texas A&M\u2019s secondary has struggled just as much as the run defense, ranking last in SEC-only games in pass yards allowed per game (278.7). Can cornerbacks De\u2019Vante Harris and Deshazor Everett matchup with Beckham and Landry? And their job could be even tougher if the pass rush doesn\u2019t get pressure on Mettenberger., 8375=One positive sign: Dak Prescott showed flashes of potential in limited action this season. If the sophomore quarterback can build on that success, Mississippi State\u2019s offense could show solid growth in 2014. Final Verdict}",

    "textBeforeTable": "To understand where Dan Mullen is at during his tenure at Mississippi State, it\u2019s important to examine the history of former coaches in Starkville.\u00a0 Analyzing Dan Mullen's Tenure at Mississippi State Even if Mississippi State falls short of a winning record, Mullen has done enough in five years to warrant more time to build this program. Even though Mullen has Mississippi State on the edge of a fourth consecutive bowl appearance, there\u2019s some grumblings in the SEC and around Mississippi about his job status. No, Mullen isn\u2019t going to lose his job this year, but there\u2019s plenty of talk around in the SEC about the fifth-year coach moving onto the hot seat. Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen is a hot topic in the SEC this season. Mullen has led the Bulldogs to three consecutive bowl games, and with a win over rival Ole Miss, can extend that streak to four.

Tennessee 8. South Carolina 9. Arkansas 10. Ole Miss 11. Missouri 12. Kentucky 13. Mississippi State 14. Vanderbilt Take a look at the numbers above. None of the last six coaches at Mississippi State has finished their tenure with an overall winning or SEC record. Jackie Sherrill is the only coach to get close, sporting a .500 overall record in his tenure with the Bulldogs. Sherrill also brought the program its only appearance in the SEC Championship. Although a SEC West title is a title, the division was very average in 1998, as Alabama went 7-5 and LSU and Auburn combined for a 7-15 mark.\u00a0 In terms of job hierarchy, Mississippi State is near the bottom of the SEC. Attracting top talent and overall program resources just aren\u2019t the same as what coaches can get at Texas A&M, Alabama and LSU. In USA Today\u2019s 2012 athletic department revenue study, Mississippi State ranked 11th in the SEC, just ahead of Ole Miss and Missouri (Vanderbilt did not disclose its revenue). While athletic revenue isn\u2019t necessarily a true indicator of success, it\u2019s important to note when considering where Mississippi State is",
