The campus is gorgeous and the friendliness and personable staff is just overwhelming and extremely encouraging! The curriculums for my double majors in Criminology and Martial Arts are interesting, informative, and very modern., 2386=Within the University of Bridgeport, the classroom ratio, students to teacher, is 17:1. The classroom has very little students in each class. For example, if you are taking an English 101 class there are about 20 english 101 classes giving during the semester so that no class is over booked. That is a benefit for each student as well as the teacher., 177548=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Don't party and forget why went there in the first place!! because they would not waste time in kicking you out. also ALWAYS check on your financial aid and make sure nothing goes wrong.. IT IS OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE.... things happen all the time and you might be able enjoy school.. Bang for the buck this school is very expensive and except you have up to 40,000 a year i wouldn't advice",
