    "textBeforeTable": "Position Report At 1600 Hours UTC, 24 February 2006 The next land mark will be the second ice gate which stands in between the yachts and their move south to pick up the strong westerlies that will take them round Cape Horn. Before this point though, the large polar low to the north of them will re-intensify, becoming the dominant weather influence for the whole fleet. As a result, strong (over 40 knots) west northwesterly winds will develop north of the ice gates, making for some fast sailing. Back on the race course Pirates will probably be the second boat to get through the ice gate by just clipping the very eastern end, only 14 nautical miles away, with the rest of the southern pack following very quickly. The young guns onboard Sebastien JOSSE's (FRA) ABN AMRO TWO unfortunately have found themselves in the area between the two tactical routes. They did not go far enough north to get the new breeze so are still stuck in light upwind conditions at the back of the fleet. Erle WILLIAMS (NZL) onboard the Pirate ship also had a bit of a surprise today when he started slipping around the leeward bilge in hydraulic fluid. The leak was found to be from the spare oil tank and thankfully it was quickly mopped up by WILLIAMS and skipper CAYARD, only to find the radar bracket was coming away from the mast which required Justin CLOUGHER (AUS) to go up and retrieve it.
