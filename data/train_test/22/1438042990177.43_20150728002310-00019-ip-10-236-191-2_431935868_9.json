His strong all-round season also brought him 27 Sheffield Shield wickets and he won the Steve Waugh Medal as the best New South Wales player of the season. A wicket-taking medium-fast bowler who also strikes the ball cleanly with the bat, Abbott was rewarded with a call-up to Australia's one-day and Twenty20 squads to play Pakistan in the UAE in 2014. Less than two months after that, Abbott bowled the ball which fatally hit Phillip Hughes, but he came back from that tragedy remarkably well, taking 6 for 14 against Queensland on his return to first-class cricket, just 17 days later.
