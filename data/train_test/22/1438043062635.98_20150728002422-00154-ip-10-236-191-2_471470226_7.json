The luer-lock* system permits application of a either a needle or a cathater to the syringe providing additional flexability in the use of this product. The flange 9 while primarily present to prevent tampering also provides greater stabilization of the plunger during injection. In addition the plunger rod 4 can be optionally tapered to permit easy handling during aspiration. Disclosed in the drawings is a ribbed type plunger rod, though the plunger rod could optionally be a solid cylindrical type which is designed to be close fitting to the interior of the collar 8 to further prevent insertion of a needle and thus to maintain the integrity of the contents of the syringe. The resulting syringe is of such a design that easy and visible aspiration is possible where the syringe is plastic or glass. The preferrable material for the cylinder is glass made of a type 1 bora silicate glass which has strength, transparentcy and inertness. Alternatively a pharmacy can obtain empty syringes consisting of the needle nub 5, the cylinder 2, the plunger 3, plunger rod 4 and collar 6. The syringe can be filled with a specific drug on a custom basis that is required for use in the hospital with the",
