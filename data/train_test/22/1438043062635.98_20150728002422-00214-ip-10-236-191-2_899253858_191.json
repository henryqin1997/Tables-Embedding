            "I feel pretty safe walking around campus, even at night by myself. There are call buttons in a lot of places around campus plus you can call Safe Walk and a girl and guy will escort you wherever you want to go.",
            "Greek Life is definitely a big deal here - a large portion of the student body is involved with it. I am not but I don't feel that has impacted me either way. I am still friends with both Greek and non-Greek people.",
            "I am in Pre-Medicine club and MEIDP (Medical Ethics and Issues Discussion Panel). They are both extremely helpful and interesting. Also, they have tons of intramural sports going on all year.",
            "Honestly, there is a wide range of students here. There isn't a particular characteristic that stands out. We are from all over the country and the world, so that's pretty awesome.",
            "Football is a huge deal here - tons of people come for the games. If you plan on coming here, get used to the phrase Boomer Sooner.",
            "The Union always has tons of awesome events going on. Also, Norman is a great city and Oklahoma City is only about thirty minutes away. So you always have stuff that you can do.",
            "I recommend that you take AP classes because that will help you get ahead when picking classes. Also apply for scholarships early - even if you think you might not get one.",
            "It has a great campus and the residence halls are really nice. Also, all of the professors I've had so far are awesome - willing to help, there for office hours, great to talk to. And the people here in general are really friendly and interesting - I always learn new things and feel very welcome."

For me anyway, housing and food services did not have you fill out a questionnaire to help assign a roommate to that could be problematic. There was a record number of changes during the 2014 school year., 1017252=Definetly apply early so that you can be enered into the freshman class scholarships which the deadline is February I believe. Also visit the campus because it is perfect for me, but others may find the campus to be out of their style or wants., 352334=The University of Oklahoma has an 18:1 student to teacher ratio. It is very known for the vigorous courses students take each year. With the toughness of the courses the ratio gives each student opportunities to learn more then they would in a big class., 22035=I greatly enjoyed being at this university! I plan on going back in the fall matter of fact! The campus is wonderful and beautiful. I felt like I was at home a week in. The people there are so happy and friendly and all the upperclassmen really do help you out and make you feel welcome. During welcome week there are a load of activities and they even have golf carts to take you to class if you get lost! Which is an awesome idea since the Oklahoma heat in September can be..overwhelming., 810708=Dorm Life is ok. Other than the opposite sex curfew they have it is just ok. P.S. Couch is the place to be. Westside 8th floor 2011., 1059878=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 211603=there's no place better to be than ou for college football. there's a wide variety of intramural sports, from rugby to quidditch, the later of which ou actually hosted the world cup for in 2010. if sports aren't your thing, the union programming board offers a free movie night every friday with screenings of recent movies., 99897=I haven't actually moved in & started attending classes yet (I move in August 15th) but I've been there twice. Once for Sooner Saturday, an event for prospective student & I went to enroll. I love the campus it's so beautiful. The people here are very kind & helpful.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck For me, OU is definitely worth it. Of Course, in-state tuition is lower than out-of-state tuition but its still worth it. I am so glad that I came here. I really didn't have a full plan for college. I just sort-of applied for this college and OSU and just went for OU to be going for it. Then, when I got here I was blown away. I am so glad that I chose OU simply for the fact that the people there are awesome and OU is just plain awesome. Am enjoying being here I love being at OU and I am sure that you will too. There are activities every week at OU. They have free movies every Friday in the Meacham Auditorium in the Student Union, for ex: I saw Get Smart there and they also showed the Dark Knight. The sound for the movies will blow your mind. They also do things like have Make a Necklace or Pot A Plant almost everyday in the Union. There are always club activities going on at OU. The way that you find out about most activities is to read the sidewalks. Yeah, I said it. I don't know who does it but, someone writes the activities on the sidewalk in chalk (some people call it chalking) so as",
