Flowable region may be formed using any known technique such as a hot embossing process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,905, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein, or a laser assisted direct imprinting (LADI) process of the type described by Chou et al. in Ultrafast and Direct Imprint of Nanostructures in Silicon , Nature, Col. 417, pp. 835\u2013837, June 2002. In the present embodiment, however, flowable region consists of patterned imprinting layer 34 being deposited as a plurality of spaced-apart discrete beads 36 of material 36 a on wafer 31, discussed more fully below. Patterned imprinting layer 34 is formed from a substantially silicon-free material 36 a that may be selectively polymerized and cross-linked to record the original pattern therein, defining a recorded pattern. Material 36 a is shown in FIG. 4 as being cross-linked at points 36 b, forming cross-linked polymer material 36 c.}",

The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined not with reference to the above description, but instead should be determined with reference to the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents. , may be improved by including, in the material from which the same is fabricated, a compound having low surface energy, referred to as a surfactant. The compound is caused to migrate to a surface of the layer formed therewith to interface with mold 28 using known techniques. Typically, the surf actant has a surface energy associated therewith that is lower than a surface energy of the polymerizable material in the layer. An exemplary material and process by which to form the aforementioned surfactant is discussed by Bender et al. in MULTIPLE IMPRINTING IN UV-BASED NANOIMPRINT LITHOGRAPHY: RELATED MATERIAL ISSUES, Microelectronic Engineering pp. 61\u201362 (2002). The low surface energy of the surfactant provides the desired release properties to reduce adherence of either imprinting layer 34 or conformal layer 40 to mold 28. It should be understood that the surfactant may be used in conjunction with, or in lieu of, low surface energy coatings 48 and 148. FIG. 11 .
