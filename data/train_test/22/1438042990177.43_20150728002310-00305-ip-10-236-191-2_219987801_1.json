Why do you expect feedback? The Solaris service integration was a third-party addition as far as I remember, yours looks pretty bad quality, I don't want to review anything but it looks like you don't really know fail2ban, nor Solaris. I have used the tcp-wrappers part for a long time with no problem (in Solaris, Linux, and Windows), they are banned and unbanned as expected. -- Ren\u00e9 Berber Re: [Fail2ban-users] tai64n trouble From: Ren\u00e9 Berber <rberber@ca...> - 2010-09-16 21:32:13",
