No. 104,271, filed Apr. 20, 1961, in the name of Gunther E. Fenner which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Further information on these devices is obtainable from the Semiconductor Products Department of the General Electric Company, Electronics Park, Building 7, Syracuse, N. Y., in the form of application note 90.55 dated May 1963 by a Zias and C. Purser. Typical devices are covered by semiconductor specifications 55.23, 55.24 and 55.25 of the above mentioned department issued April 1963 and covering devices 4JN307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 401 and 402. The Fenner Window 44 is grown on a silicon diaphragm 46 which constitutes the entire outer end of end piece 42. These diaphragms 46 are electron beam welded to the rest of end piece 42 which in turn may be electron beam welded to the ends of tube 20. In addition to the use of silicon-to-silicon seals to attach end cap 42 to tube 20, seals to aluminum, kovar and molybdenum, for example, may be used. Temperature control is required to yield an instrument of high accuracy. It may be provided by any well-known means of controlling the external temperature. In some applications with gyros where there is already a provision for holding the gyro within 1 Fahrenheit this mechanism should also serve to provide stabilization for the accelerometer. Again the transducers 44 are connected in series over lead 32 although a parallel connection may also be used and over lead 34 to an amplifier 30 the output of which is connected over lead 38 across motor electrodes 22 and lead 40 to ground. The other side of the input and output of amplifier 30 is again grounded over lead 36., 21786=The resulting current between electrodes 22 and in lead 38 is directly proportional to linear acceleration and may be read by a number of means. This might be done simply by measuring the voltage across a resistor in lead 38. Pulse forcing means using pulses of high frequency having a polarity dependent on the dircetion and using small pulse areas for high accuracy may also be used. Nuclear magnetic resonance is a new and suggested method in addition to the more conventional and presently used methods and is more fully described in an article entitled Two Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Devices Which Automatically Follow Time Varying Magnetic Fields-Possible Applications by Abrahamson, Heinen, Larson and Senstad. published in the Proceedings of National Electronics Conference, vol.

Cl. 73-516 5 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE An accelerometer in which the displacement of a fluid mass from a null position is sensed by a pressure transducer. The output of the pressure transducer is amplified in a plurality of stages and fed back to a motor that moves the mass toward the null position., 12281=In carrying out the invention in one form thereof, a hollow body or tube is provided of nonconducting material and is filled with a conducting fluid which serves as the mass of the accelerometer. A pair of electrodes are placed on diametrically opposed sides of the tube penetrating the inside wall. A pair of magnetic poles are placed on diametrically opposed sides of the tube orthogonally disposed to the electrodes. Both are provided to form the electrodes and the magnetic field for an electro-hydrodynamic force motor. When DC current is passed through the electrodes, a force is exerted on the fluid to pump it in one direction or the other as a function of the direc- Lil 3,479,886 Patented Nov. 25, 1969 tion of the current flow. A pressure transducer or pickoif is located at either end of the tube in a line approximately orthogonal to the plane of the lines between the electrodes and between the magnetic poles. The transducers are electrically connected to produce an error signal proportional to differential pressure which is sent through an amplifier to the motor electrodes. Acceleration along the transducer or sensitive axis thus creates unequal pressure on the transducers with resulting error signal causing current which is directly proportional to linear acceleration to flow in the force motor. With the constants of the system properly adjusted, this current will minimize the motion of the fluid., 38823=The operating characteristics of the above-defined amplifier means as relate to servo operation of the accelerometer appear in FIG. 9. Stability of servo operation is represented in the 20 db/dec. portion of the Bode diagram in FIG. 9. Without said above-described amplifier means the servo operation exhibits undesirable oscillatory response., 10055=This invention relates to acceleration sensing devices and more particularly to an improved accelerometer employing a force motor principle. This application is a continuation-in-part of my copending application entitled Accelerometer, Ser.
