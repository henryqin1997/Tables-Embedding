            "There are so many nature related places around Carbondfale you'll never ever be bored. Campus is number one walking through Thompson woods DURING THE DAY TIME is awesome. Touch or Nature, Giant City Sate Park, Green Earth, Fern Clyffe Sate Park and Garden of the Gods are all in reasonable distance. Hiking, canoeing, fishing, hunting, trail walking, and camping are with in reach.",
            "The food is awesome there are opportunities in several places and the prices are reasonable.",
            "I live off campus but from my understanding the dorms vary some are party halls, others are more serious it just depends. If you plan on living in a dorm inspect it before dedicating yourself to it.",
            "The academics are awesome here speaking from my own major department. I don't know for certain about the other departments but Forestry is awesome in academic rigor.",
            "Be prepared, have money available and saved especially if you'll be far from family. If you need help GET IT! Saluki cares, your parents, teachers, counselors keep them all updated. Buckle down and study if your going into the field you want learning about it is the most important aspect.",
            "I love SIU it's my dream school and I was accepted instantly. I'm already in the program I applied for and I'm totally satisfied with my professors and counselor. Most of the people are friendly and always helpful."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{235887=In fall of 2012 I will be moving in to Schneider in the East Campus towers. I have met my roommate for the fall and we get along great! I'm really looking forward to the independence and responsibility that goes along with moving out and living at school. The towers are set up so that each room is a suite joined by a bathroom with the room next to it. This makes things feel a lot more private as opposed to having a communal shower facility., 584032=As a Resident Assistant for 3 years, and a Resident for 1 years, Residence Hall Life has been quite an undertaking with changes happening each year. Living Learning Communities are a must for potential applicants and help network very quickly in the environment that you live in and could help you make life long friends in your field. Residence Hall Life has also started on becoming more inclusive to the LGBTQ community and will have a Pride floor starting in Fall 2014 for potential students who are allies or identify., 207919=The classrooms are not huge but they are not small. The lectors have mandatory small groups in which the TA teaches what you are learning in class, but in a smaller classroom. The teacher to student ratio is about 20:1 in small groups., 95135=All of October, SIUC students celebrate Halloween by dressing up every weekend and go out and have fun. It is great seeing people dress up as different stuff every week. The weekend before Halloween it is called Unofficial and that is when most people go out in costumes to have a great time., 575318=I live in the towers (Schneider Hall) which houses hundreds of students. In this environment it is often loud throughout the night and during days. The RA's do travel from floor to floor to make sure nothing too distracting is happening but students often learn the times they come and avoid being loud at these times. Another inconvenience is that there are no security cameras in the hallways. This has allowed many fire alarms to be pulled at all times during the night, this has become a trend in all three towers during the 2013-2014 school year., 533315=I have not run into extremely hard academics yet at Southern Illinois University, and I am a senior. I graduate in May 2014. Some majors I'm sure are rigorous, but my major, Paralegal Studies, is not rigorous if you try hard. My gen-eds were not hard., 621766=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 305804=Every thursday in June and July have free concerts. You can bring alcohol as long as it is in plastic. No glass alowed. The concerts are either on campus in front of Shryock Auditorium or at Truly park.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Brandon from Chicago/Carbondale, IL 12/10/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 17 out of 17 people found this review useful. 2 of 148 Categories Comments Great for these types of students this school is great for students looking to attend a college in an almost rural area and but to far from home depending on where you live. Also if you would like to reside in an are that like a suburb or city, the campus offers those potions to students as well. Tips for prospective students Some tips for future SIUC students would be to create a facebook account because facebook is big here. I once was a faithful myspace user but i soon realized that without a facebook account, you WILL be missing out on a lot of events that is taken place around and outside of campus. Bang for the buck Being a siuc student i found myself spending a lot of money on food more than anything else believe it or not lol. The cafeteria food isn't bad it's just",
