Mitigation via armor, damage reduction talents or damage reduction cooldowns is not shown, as this information does not appear in the combat log. Currently only direct damage attacks are recorded - DoTs are ignored, as they generally cannot be avoided or blocked and would skew the display. Due to combat log limitations, absorb mitigation includes absorbs from all sources, not just self-applied absorbs. So for example with a discipline priest in the raid, players will tend to have inflated absorb mitigation. Misc Notes: Crit, Crush: Attacks that inflicted a critical hit or crushing blow on the target. These should be very rare in PvE for correctly-speced tanks. Spell Hit: Non-physical attacks that were not avoided or mitigated in any way and inflicted full damage. Physical Hit: Melee swings and physical school attacks that were not avoided or mitigated in any way and inflicted full damage. Absorb: Attacks that were mitigated via partial absorption",
