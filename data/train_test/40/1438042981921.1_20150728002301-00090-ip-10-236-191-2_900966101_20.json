            "there is police force specifically for the college that is monitoring the school 24/7 and emergency phones through out the school.",
            "there is a club for just about everything and they hold many events besides those already held by the college itself. there is always something going on every day of the week.",
            "the tuition rate is high compared to most other universities, but smu does a great job of providing a generous amount of financial aide to its students. the majority of students here have some type of financial aide.",
            "there are always events going on in hughs trigg that any one can go to. also, there are many clubs to choose from that are fun and will keep you busy. the rec center is also another option, it has just about everything you need to get a good workout in. on top of that are the intramural sports that you can join which are a great load of fun.",
            "the food is exceptional i believe. i have tried many different things and have come to like many different things. there is always a large variety of choices so you will always find something to eat. however, the weekend food is not as great as it is during the week, but better then a lot of other campuses so i've been told.",
            "the dorms can get a little crazy at times, it really isn't for me. i don't like being woken up at 2 or 3 in the morning by screaming and yelling from people who just returned from partying, but perhaps this is just my dorm. i have not heard many bad things from other dorms so you should find out for yourself.",
            "the courses are challenging, i have yet to take a real blow-off class. every class i have taken has challenged me in some kind of way which is what i look for because it helps me to become a better student. if you seek a challenge, you will find one here.",
            "learning to organize and plan is key to success, and the faster you do this, the quicker college will be easier for you. after i learned to organize and plan my days out college became fairly easy, but before that it was hectic. learn to do these two things and learn them quickly.",
            "the academics at southern methodist university are outstanding. the professors are dedicated to their work, have a passion for their subject, and truly care about the success of their students. this really is a top-tier private university."

Recruitment is in January which allows for potential new members to get to know all sororities and fraternities in the fall semester before rushing in the spring., 152584=Really the clubs and activities at SMU are endless. If you can't find a club or organization that fits your interests, start a new one! SMU holds the annual Night at the Club event a few days before classes start in August, and the event helps new students discover all of the clubs on campus., 339918=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 31808=Heck yes. SMU gives you MANY opportunities to perform extra research and try out other projects AS AN UNDERGRAD (if you so seek). I'm always getting e-mails from my department about opportunities to get involved - and even get published. AS AN UNDERGRAD. (Dunno if you want to go to grad school, but if so - THAT IS HUGE) The faculty and staff here are STELLAR. AND THEY ACTUALLY CARE. And if you start to fall ... they won't let you hit rock bottom. :) You might also be interested to know that they also offer classes during May, Summer I, Summer II, August, and Winter Break. And they have so many interesting courses. Check out their listings: http://access.smu.edu, 24959=PHIL 1300 was a really interesting class, the professor was a little drab, but I learned a lot. Also Intro to EE was really engaging. I learned a lot of cool concepts and things that I could actually use & the prof was top-notch. I started to think differently about everything, but I now I hardly notice it. I think that's when you know you've really learned something.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Apply early to avoid stress. I suggest you tour the campus in order to know what residence hall you would like to live in. Once you gain acceptance, make sure to turn in your residence hall papers as quickly as possible in order to receive your first choice. I suggest attending any events like Mustang Days in order to meet people and a possible roommate. Avoid taking too many hours especially if majoring in a difficult field with difficult professors. That being said, ratemyprofessor.com is an amazing site so do your research before signing up for classes. Once you have your schedule, find where your classes are so you wont get lost and always have your books on the first day of class. Also, do not be skeptical and make sure you study. The workload is a lot more rigorous than high school so form study groups, work diligently, and do not procrastinate. Bang for the buck SMU is definitely an expensive school. Because of the scholarships and financial aide I received I was able to attend the school of my choice. Although most of the people there are wealthy, there are also others receiving help so there is no need to feel inferior. SMU is a beautiful campus with many resources for the students to use. From the dance performances to the sporting events, the money",
