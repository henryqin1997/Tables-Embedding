However, Mosa\u00efque is worth almost every minute you spend with it. Finally, here is a Cast opus that doesn't feel like it could have been scaled down for better effect. Is Mosa\u00efque's case different because it brings back together the new and old versions of the band? No, nostalgia has nothing to do with the quality of this album, even though the basic tracks of some of the songs have been salvaged from mid-'90s recording sessions. In fact, the lineup introduced on Al-Bandaluz is in most regards better than the original. Simply put, all but two of the songs on Mosa\u00efque are worth making the cut. \"Azteca Imperial\" kicks things off in typical Cast fashion: i.e., with a blistering instrumental opus. \"Signs of Love\" was recorded in part during the Endless Signs sessions, but completed only in 2005, like three other tracks on the album. It stands as one of the band's strong pieces, along with \"Sue\u00f1os Colectivos,\" \"Hay un Lugar,\" and \"Zona de Ilusiones,\" all outstanding compositions that epitomize Cast's brand of Latin neo-progressive rock. The smooth jazz number \"Cuerda Floja\" and the rather trite ballad \"Adapted to Your Eyes,\" both older tracks, are the only subpar offerings. Alfonso Vidales' songwriting is more concise, precise, and to the point, with instrumental developments being more purposeful and captivating. Mosa\u00efque is a late achievement for this Mexican group, and its best album since Angels & Demons. ~ Fran\u00e7ois Couture, Rovi, 30326=Formed: 1993 in Liverpool, England}",
