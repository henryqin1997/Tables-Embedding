It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. This application is based on French Priority Application FR96/15265, filed in the French Patent Office on Dec. 12, 1996, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The invention therefore makes it possible to combine two very significant advantages when these stacks are intended to undergo heat treatments, by an advantageous combination of two types of layers intended to \u201ccontain\u201d the silver layers and to preserve the integrity of their constituent material. Example 5a consisted in producing an example identical to Example 5, but by \u201cdoping\u201d, as in Example 4a, the Si3N4 final layer 8 a with aluminium. In this particular case there is again the Si3N4 barrier layer (8 b) and, as in Example 4, a non-porous or hardly porous ZnO \u201cstabilizing\u201d layer (8 a), the effect of which may be improved by the presence of the subjacent layer (5 b) of ZnO which is also non-porous or hardly porous. 18 (8b) Si3N4 20 (8a) ZnO",
