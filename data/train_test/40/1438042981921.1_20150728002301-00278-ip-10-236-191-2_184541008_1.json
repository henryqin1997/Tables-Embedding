    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{5128=The term diffraction refers to the phenomenon of wave interference. Until the early 20th century, diffraction was believed to be an effect reserved to waves, such as light. However, in 1927, an experimental 'accident' by Davidson and Germer led to the discovery that particles, too, could diffract -- that is, particles had some sort of wave nature [1]. Coincidentally, matter waves had been predicted in the doctorate thesis of Louis de Broglie, which was completed several years earlier, in 1924. de Broglie claimed that matter must behave like waves in certain limits to preserve the symmetry often observed in nature [2]. Although the first particles that were observed to diffract were electrons, it has been shown since that essentially anything can diffract, given the correct conditions. This was also something predicted in de Broglie's thesis. In 1929, de Broglie received the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his work on matter waves and wave mechanics in general., 34597=[2]. Biography of Louis de Broglie, from Nobel Lectures, Physics 1922-1941, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1965, http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1929/broglie-bio.html, 11668=The electron diffractor (model 2555, 5kV, .3mA ratings) consists of several key components. The first is the high resistance filament, which is responsible for ejecting electrons. The filament was powered a Teltron Limited power supply (London England 813KV), which was wired in series with a Wavetek-Materman 85XT ammeter, to monitor the input current. Just past the filament, a voltage was set up to accelerate the ejected electrons. This potential was also produced by the Teltron power supply. Immediately after the anode resides the graphite foil, which serves as the atomic diffraction grating and as an entrance for the electrons into the spherical vacuum bulb. The bulb is coated in a fluorescent compound, which was activated upon collisions with electrons. A schematic of the diffraction device is provided to the right in Figure 1.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Tables and Figures Data analysis was performed using MATLAB's built in algorithms, unless otherwise specified. The equation is fairly complicated due to the fact that several corrections were made to account for the geometry of the tube. The fact that the graphite foil is not at the center of the vacuum bulb and that the bulb has finite thickness introduced the need for corrections. Rc is the radius of curvature of the bulb, Dj is the diameter of the diffraction ring in question, Va is the accelerating voltage, Lo is the distance from the graphite to the opposite end of the vacuum bulb, t is the thickness of the bulb, h is the Planck constant, m is the electron mass, and e is the electron charge. After taking the measurements by the method described above, the atomic lattice spacings were calculated from the following relationship (see Appendix for an in-depth derivation and the list of used constants): Several minutes after turning on the device, the diffraction patterns become visible on the fluorescent screen. Due to the fact that graphite is highly pollycrystaline, the diffraction patterns are rings and not dots, as would be expected otherwise. Given that the diffraction rings had finite width, we decided to measure only the inner diameters of each ring to avoid ambiguity and",
    "textAfterTable": "Table 1: Measurements of the outer and inner diffraction maxima, for each respective accelerating voltage V. Uncertainties were prescribed for each measurement based on the approximate width of the diffraction rings. The inner diameter of the outer maxima and the inner diameter of the inner maxima were measured. Measurements cease at 3200V where the diffraction rings are nearly impossible to see. The calculated atomic spacings from each datapoint are given in the last two columns, for each respective diffraction ring. The given uncertainties are the propagated error for each respective data point, given by: \u0394d = d\u0394D / D. We believe that this uncertainty is the best 95% confidence interval.
