It is unknown why. In some video games an antechamber to the Mirror of Erised chamber appears, which makes out eight obstacles. However, it is possible that the antechamber is a part of the last chamber. In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4, desktop versions, the Mirror of Erised Chamber is right over a kind of volcano and this is what causes the walls to fire. It is possible that in all versions of the first year there is a volcano and this is why Quirrell can turn on the fire (as seen in the film). In the original script of Deathly Hallows Fluffy, the first obstacle, was going to participate in the Battle of Hogwarts. At one point in the \"Battle of Hogwarts\" chapter in Deathly Hallows, Hermione asked Ron are you a wizard or not?. This might have been a reference to what was said in the Devil's Snare Chamber by Ron to Hermione, are you a witch or not?. The fifth and sixth obstacles were cut from",
