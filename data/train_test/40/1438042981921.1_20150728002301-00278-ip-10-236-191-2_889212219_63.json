A large portion of the student body volunteers with their floors or student organizations and spends the day doing service somewhere in the community., 39968=When I first started school in August, I thought SLU would be boring...all about the academics. Although almost everyone is very academically focused, this school is so much fun too! I'm a commuter student as well which can be tough, but they really make an effort to reach out and get everyone involved. From soccer games to community breakfasts and Greek rush week, everything is soooo enjoyable!, 94907=I could not praise the programs here more. I had no idea what my majors entailed before coming to SLU and the extent that each would reach. The classes have a great 13:1 student-teacher ratio so I get one on one time with teachers, making the learning environment even better. I'm in my sophomore year and feel like I've already learned more here than I did in 4 years of high school., 383049=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 3567=Saint Louis University it is my favorite place to be in the world! All the people I have met here are caring and wonderful people. I can't imagine attending any other college because I believe that not only the academics wouldn't compare, but the environment in which you are in on and off campus is second to none. My new friends I've made I know will be life long friends that I will stay in touch with no matter where life takes me. We all have helped each other out and continue to do so, not because we have to, but because our floor has become a community. We look out for each other where ever we go and because of this, Saint Louis University is so enjoyable. I've heard similar stories from all of my other friends in different residence halls so it is not a isolated case. I believe it is because of SLU's learning communities. Learning Communities are people who live on the same floor who have similar majors and goals in life. This means that most of the people in learning communities are taking the same classes and experiencing the same hardships which makes it very easy to understand what people are going through and to help each other out. Everyone on campus is really friendly, including the professors! I stopped by my chemistry teacher's office one day because a problem on my test was not graded correctlyand we ended up talking for over and hour about family, gravity, and zero degrees Kelvin! I know it sounds nerdy but it was one of the most interesting conversations I've had. The thing that got me though was he has a lecture hall full of students and he still has time to talk to me for an hour and the only reason the conversation ended was because I had to head to work! The off campus experience is just as amazing. There are plenty of things to do in the city of Saint Louis and SLU students get discounts on many of the nearby performing arts centers such as Powell Symphony Hall and the Fabulous Fox Theatre. At Powell Hall SLU students can get $90 tickets for $10! The metrolink is also nearby which takes you to pretty much anywhere in Saint Louis that is worth visiting. This includes Forest Park (which is the largest park in the world). Forest Park houses the Muny which is the biggest outdoor theatre in the world! I've been to shows there and they have all been so amazing and there are also free seats! So you can go have a night out without spending any money at all! There are art museums and the St. Louis Zoo in forest park also and they are free too. The only thing you have to pay for is the Metro ticket which is $2.25 each way. Can you imagine only spending $5.50 but getting to go to the Zoo, see a profession theatre show, and get to appreciate some great art? No where else can you find a deal like that. The metrolink also stops by the Delmar Loop, which houses tons of restaurants and concert venues. Pi is the best pizza place you will ever go to and I'm not the only one that thinks that, even the President has it at the White House because it is so delicious! Froyo is a frozen yogurt/ice cream restaurant that will tickle your taste buds into delight because no other ice cream shop matches Froyo. Also there is the Pageant, which is a concert venue and I saw my favorite band there! The tickets only cost $18 and I got to get as close as I wanted! There are limitless possibilities at Saint Louis University and there is always something to do on and off campus. If you come here, you're in the prime spot to make tons of great memories with new friends but also to be challenged academically., 359871=Especially good school for students going into pre-med or for students wanting to be nurses. If you want to be in the pre-med program, pay close attention to the deadline. It's in December and easy to overlook if you don't keep an eye out for it.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck The school is really expensive! To be honest, I am not sure if the bang outweighs the buck! For example, the dorms, which are the size of a large one person bedroom, have 2-3 people in them, at a price tag of $4000-$5000 a semester. The interesting part, though, is that there are dozens of off campus apartments and dorms that are half the price, twice as large, and are across the street from the main part of campus! Food is pretty expensive, too; as a commuter, I get $200 a semester for food on campus, where the average meal is $7, which is hard to manage (considering that I not only attend class everyday, but I also work on campus). Between all the fees (rec center, lab, etc), books, and other necessities, it can get pretty expensive. However, Saint Louis as a whole is not an expensive city; there are so many cheap and free things to do around campus. In addition, there are many great and free services, like the Weekend shuttle, which runs a big loop around the city from the campus to the grocery store, the local mall, and Target for free, the free van rentals for students to use, the wonderful and free career services department, and the many free breakfast and lunch programs around midterms and finals time. The university is also generous with scholarships (yet they range from",
