            "UIC is very safe. Of course, being around certain areas alone after a certain time is not wise.",
            "There are a variety of different people and beliefs at UIC.",
            "I am a part of the Italian Club, which is fun.",
            "At UIC, you are never bored because there is always something to do.",
            "This will be fun to explore yourself.",
            "It really depends on you. What your interest is and what UIC has to offer differs depending on your independent interest.",
            "There are many things to do for Fun at UIC! Just about every month, there are different events, clubs, a lot of social life, etc. There is bowling, ping pong, and other fun things to do on-campus.",
            "Some of the food at UIC is good. It really depends on the day and where you eat. There are also a lot of good restaurants without walking distance around campus.",
            "I have lived in the dorms twice and it is very interesting. I say this because I lived on the west side, at the student residence halls, which is very clean, but so small. This is actually a good thing because everyone knows each other, so it is very easy to meet new people.",
            "It is very important that you study! Being in College is not the same as being in high school. You must know your trade, or else, your grades will quickly down. Trust me, I have been here. Developing study habits and knowing when to ask for help is very important for your own personal success.",
            "It is important that you make friends quickly. At UIC, everyone studies all day, all the time! It can be very lonely studying alone, or wanting to do fun activities on-campus, such as bowling, going to events, joining clubs, etc.",
            "UIC is, how can I put this into words; UIC is just awesome! It is a very huge campus with so much to do and see! The best part about UIC is the energy that you feel while attending, and the care the stuff members shows towards their students!"

Also, there are 1400 emergency call stations across campus which allow immediate Police assistance with the push of a button., 430279=Due to it being so close to downtown Chicago, UIC campus security is very efficient in the sense that they do the best job possible to keep students safe. You do get the crime alert reports but most of the time it's because a student was being risky and was walking at 3:00 am by himself., 329234=My Freshmen yr in 2010, food was crappy, however returning my sophomore year the CAF was completely redone and the food got alot better. The staff is very friendly and its best to develop close relationships with them!, 295429=The professors are brilliant, campus is nice, it's in the city, and it's right next to the train! I took the summer program offered for incoming freshman and met so many new people, I already feel comfortable going to college and I'll be a freshman this August.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The teachers are very knowledgeable. A lot of them encourage everyone to take advantage of their office hours, and they are always there when they say they will be. It is always important to check out your professors on ratemyprofessors.com as some teachers are definitely a lot better than others. Each teacher has his own teaching style and expectations, so make sure you are clear on what exactly those are and you will be fine.
