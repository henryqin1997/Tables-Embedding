After you have achieved that goal then and only then should you continue on to the category II goal of 30 miles per week. Let me remind you that category I is a nine week build up program. Follow the workout as best you can and you will be amazed at the progress you will make. RUNNING: The majority of the physical activities you will be required to perform during your six months of training at BUD/S will involve running. The intense amount of running can lead to over stress injuries of the lower extremities in trainees who arrive not physically prepared to handle the activities. Swimming, bicycling, and lifting weights will prepare you for some of the activities at BUD/S, but ONLY running can prepare your lower extremities for the majority of the activities. You should also run in boots to prepare your legs for the everyday running in boots at BUD/S (Boots should be of a light weight variety i.e. Bates Lights, Hi-Tec, etc.). \u00a0 WORKOUT FOR CATEGORY I The following workouts are designed for two categories of people: Category I are those future BUD/S students that have never or have not recently been on a routine PT",
