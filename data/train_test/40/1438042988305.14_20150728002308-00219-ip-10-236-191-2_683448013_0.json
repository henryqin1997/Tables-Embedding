Yes, Scottish GDP growth was 1% while UK GDP growth was 0.8% in the first quarter, but the stronger Scottish performance was very much due to the Grangemouth effect as the plant came back on stream in the first quarter after being shut down for a period due to the well-reported dispute in October of last year. In the fourth quarter, UK growth was 0.6% while Scottish growth was only 0.2%, again the difference in favour of the UK was largely due to the effect of Grangemouth., 82486=The source spreadsheets for these calculations can be accessed here: Download Business in Scotland 2013.

There is little doubt that Scotland's net trade position \u2013 excluding North Sea oil \u2013 is weak. From the latest SNAP data we can chart net trade as a percentage of GDP going back to 1998 and this is presented in the chart below:, 22711=\u2022 We have therefore revised up our forecast for 2014 from 2.5% to 2.7% due to the strong growth in the first half of the year. We have held our forecast for 2015 at 2.2% but have revised down our forecast for 2016 from 2.4% to 2.1% in the light of concerns about secular stagnation and a persistent weakness of aggregate demand., 50918=The Scottish economy is now enjoying a strong recovery. However, the Institute cautions that the recovery is subject to the risks of: a continuing unbalanced recovery; falling real wages; booming house prices in the London housing market, and deflation in the Eurozone. Nevertheless, the Institute has raised its forecasts from March and its latest economic forecasts for Scottish GDP are, for: 2014: 2.5% (up from 2.3%); 2015: 2.2% (down from 2.3%); and for 2016: 2.4%. Net job creation is forecast to continue and strengthen, while unemployment is projected to fall., 71721=Despite the recovery, the number of new businesses continues to fall. This should clearly give us food for thought. However, as I noted here, the CSCB data appear to conflict with the VAT registrations data, which are a trqditional proxy for new firms. Unfortunately, the VAT data are available only on an annual basis to 2012. A comparison of the two series is shown in the next chart:, 10332=This is an ambitious target. One might go further and suggest that without a systematic strategy to rebuild Scotland's non-oil export base there is little if any likelihood of policy raising the real value of exports in ten years never mind in two and a half years by 2017., 43898=Using the latest data available from the Scottish Government we can examine Scottish growth over the last 50 years.

On the same day, the Scottish Government published its quarterly accounts for the second quarter under the Scottish National Accounts Project (SNAP). The Commentary, therefore, could only analyse the drivers of Scotland's economic recovery up to and including the first quarter of this year, drawing on the previous SNAP publication in August., 97155=Posted at 12:11 PM in Independence, Labour Market, Scottish Economy | Permalink | Comments (1), 9863=Encouraging a greater international focus among Scottish businesses is a fundamental part of rebalancing of the Scottish economy, and delivering sustainable economic growth over the longer term. With this in mind, the Scottish Government has set an ambitious target for export growth, to increase the value of international non- oil and gas exports by 50 per cent by 2017., 64772=Posted at 11:59 AM | Permalink | Comments (0), 89760=There is a further problem with the estimates presented in Table 2: the estimated secondary effects are almost certainly too high. Where there is a large change in the demand for goods services, and labour in the economy prices and wages will adjust as well as output. In the event of a reduction in demand and loss of jobs prices and wages will fall and so the competitiveness of supplying firms will increase to partially offset the loss of demand. In our \u2013 the Fraser of Allander Institute's \u2013 analysis, in the June 2010 Economic Commentary,of the impact of cuts in the Scottish DEL under the austerity proposals of the new UK Government, a flex-price analysis led to a reduction in jobs which was about half \u2013 51% - of the fall when prices were held fixed under the standard Input-Output multiplier approach., 22518=\u2022 We are now forecasting GDP growth in Scotland of 2.7% in 2014, 2.2% in 2015, and 2.1% in 2016., 37487=Posted at 01:43 PM in Independence, Labour Market, Scottish Economy | Permalink | Comments (0), 11009=Posted at 02:13 PM in Independence, Scottish Economy | Permalink | Comments (0), 17986=\u2022 and, the employment to adult population ratio in June-August 2014 stood at -1.5% below the pre-recession peak, compared to -5.7% at the trough of the recession., 68979=Posted at 11:06 AM in UK economy | Permalink | Comments (0), 104541=Posted at 06:05 PM in Independence | Permalink | Comments (0), 27273=In seeking to achieve this I ignore links via the public sector and focus largely on the private sector, with the exception of education, which has to be included because of its significant export activities. I again use the Scottish Government's input-output tables for 2009 but use 2014 workforce data for export jobs and 2013 data for jobs in rUK and foreign owned firms. As with the earlier post, I make an adjustment to remover the overlap between non-Scottish owned activities that are also exporters. Finally, I estimate secondary effects differently. In the present work I include only the domestic jobs that are the consequence of the indirect domestic supply links to the non-Scottish owned and exporting firms. (Technically, the Type 1 multiplier relation). I therefore ignore the potential further boost of the secondary spending in the Scottish economy due to the additional incomes generated by the non-Scottish links. But, in so doing I also ignore the favourable competitive price effect of the price and wage adjustments that would see domestic activity increase to some extent as non-Scottish activity reduced. The scale of these last two effects is much less certain, while the indirect supply link is more robust. The estimates are therefore slightly more conservative \u2013 lower - than in my previous post., 48471=Posted at 12:41 PM | Permalink | Comments (3), 9518=So Scotland needs to boost its export performance. The Scottish Government's Programme for Scotland 2014-15 One Scotland recognizes the need for the Scottish economy to internationalise in Para 113:, 23682=\u2022 Our projection for unemployment on the ILO measure at the end of 2014 falls to 124,700 (5.3%). In 2015, unemployment is now forecast to fall slightly to 5.2% but to increase in terms of numbers to 141,019 as the workforce increases. Falling again, to 135,537 (5.0%) by the end of 2016., 41859=Posted at 11:31 AM in Scottish Economy | Permalink | Comments (0), 23350=\u2022 Our forecasts for employee job creation and unemployment are similar to June 2014, with some revisions. On the central forecast, we are now forecasting that net jobs will increase by 46,560 in 2014, 41,600 in 2015 and 48,900 in 2016., 23136=\u2022 Production and manufacturing continue to be the major sectors exhibiting the fastest growth in 2014, 2015 and 2016., 72494=The VAT data show a slight upward trend since the trough of the recession in 2009, whereas the CSCB shows a downward trend. In addition the VAT data show the a trend rise in the Scottish share of UK VAT registrations since 2004 which peaked in 2010 at 6.60% but has fallen since to 6.45% in 2012. The historic problem with the business birthrate in Scotland is still evident since we are still adrift of a population share of 8.3%., 66728=The IMF has sought fit to effectively\u00a0apologise for seeking last year to encourage the Chancellor to relax his austerity measures. Yes, they got the strength of the UK recent recovery wrong, everyone did, even Osborne himself. The Chancellor had quietly started to relax the austerity programme after 2012 as Jonathan Portes and Simon Wren Lewis make clear., 67760=What governed the IMF's views last year was the weakness of the UK recovery since 2010 and the subsequent largely austerity driven stagnation that resulted in the UK economy - its level of GDP - still below its pre-recession peak; worse than every major country except Italy as the chart shows., 79395=(2) BIS calculations based on Scottish Input-Output tables 2009 data, retrieved May 2013, http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Economy/Input-Output/Downloads and http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Labour-Market/BRES-Employee-Jobs-Sco}",

    "textAfterTable": "The estimates for each category are included in Table 1 above. So, about 1 million jobs are directly linked to the global economy outside Scotland and a further 400,000 are generated through supply links as local firms supply the exporters and the non-Scottish owned firms based in Scotland. Total Scottish employment minus the public sector (Administration and Health but including education) is 2,113,000, hence the percentage of total 'private' sector employment in Scotland due to globalization, or external links, is 66% or two-thirds. Interestingly, about 40% or 859,000 jobs are dependent on trade and ownership links to the UK, while the remaining 26% are linked to the wider world economy. In conclusion, the Scottish economy is significantly linked into the world economy with around two-thirds of jobs dependent on such links. Moreover, it is trade and ownership links to the rest of the United Kingdom that dominate these global links with the number of dependent jobs more than one and a half times greater than those linked to the rest of the world.
