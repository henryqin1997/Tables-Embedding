When people view the use of computer technology as a difficult job, their perceptions affect the person's self-efficacy and they may avoid computing. Self-efficacy is the belief\u00a0 \"in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given attainments\" (Bandura, 1997, p. 3). In relation to a technology, self-efficacy is the confidence of an individual that it can use (or control) a particular technology in performing its activities.}",

Logistic regression of background variables of computer possession in South Korea in 2000 In the first model, the dependent variable was the ownership of a home computer. Of the original 3,000 cases, 1,494 were deleted due to missing data. As seen in Table 6, the Wald test shows that, of the independents, only digital skill had significant relationship with the ownership of home computer (p < .05). Income, occupation, and age were significant variables, but its component dummy variables were not all significant when taken individually. On the whole, the pseudo R square (Nagelkerke R2) indicates that 16.4 percent of the variance in dependent variable is accounted for by the independent variables. For a scientific explanation of the impact of digital skill on home computer possession and Internet connection, the 2000 data provided by the ICC were analyzed. Five background variables (gender, age, occupation, income, education) and digital skill were entered into a logistic regression analysis to determine if they were significant predictors of computer possession and Internet connection. Two separate regressions were performed using an enter method. Scientific explanation For example, as summarized in Table 5, word processing is broadly",

The second model included Internet connection as a dependent variable instead of home computer ownership. As indicated by the significance levels of the Wald test, among independent variables, only digital skill was significant (p = .00). In addition, income and education were significant variables, but their dummy variables were not all significant when entered individually. These results are very similar to the first model.
