    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Although the foregoing invention has been disclosed in terms of certain preferred embodiments, other specific embodiments can be constructed in view of the disclosure herein without departing from the spirit of the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the Applicant's invention is to be determined by reference to the attached claims, which are not limited to any of the particular embodiments disclosed herein. Any of a variety of different mechanical or electrical devices may be utilized as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein, for producing the cavity 46 for receiving one or more bulking devices 16. An alternate method of forming the cavity 46 is illustrated in FIGS. 13-15. In this embodiment, a mechanical cutting device, such as a scissor 48, is introduced below the mucosa 15 and manipulated to sever the springy tissue of the submucosa 12 and produce a cavity 46 for receiving the submucosal bulking device 16. Following dilatation or manipulation of another pocket forming device, the balloon dilatation catheter 44 or other device is reduced in size and removed, thereby leaving a receiving cavity 46 for one or more bulking devices 16. The bulking device 16 may then be inserted within the cavity using any of a variety of delivery implements, the specific design of which will depend upon the size and configuration of the bulking device 16.",
