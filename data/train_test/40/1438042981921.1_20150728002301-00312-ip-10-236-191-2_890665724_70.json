            "Quinnipiac was named #1 for campus safety in the country and it is very true, there is never a point in time where i have felt unsafe on campus.",
            "greek life makes up 25% of our campus population, and with a zero tolerance policy for hazing it makes greek life on campus a very safe and amazing experience",
            "Quinnipiac has many clubs and activities, and if you dont see what you want you can even start your own club which is a great opportunity",
            "City and country lovers because the campus is centrally located between the beautiful hiking trails of sleeping giant state park and downtown",
            "Quinnipiac is definitely very pricey so it is a little nerve racking, I constantly find myself thinking about my student loans. But it is worth the education and experiences that you are being given.",
            "Food choices are good, but there are not many different choices so you are always eating the same things",
            "Out of all of the Universities and colleges that I visited Quinnipiac has by far the Nicest dorms for underclassman and upperclassman.",
            "Academics are amazing here and the teacher are more than qualified for all of the courses that are taught at the university.",
            "Quinnipiac University is an amazing college and an even better learning experience. Quinnipiac is such a diverse community and I have met some of the best people because of this."

The first weekend in May, which marks the two week celebrations before finals and the end of school, is May Weekend, the biggest party weekend at QU., 154552=The school has over 100 different clubs and organizations. They hold many events such as concerts, dinners, carnivals, etc. Despite what many people think about typical school run events, they are actually a lot of fun to go to. Sporting events are also very popular to students. Basketball and Ice Hockey are the most popular sports since there is no football team. The Men's Ice Hockey team was ranked #1 in 2013 and went all the way to the Frozen Four. The biggest game of the year is the Quinnipiac-Yale game., 16589=May weekend, two weekends before finals everyone likes to party hard for a final time. The school actually use to sponsor it. Now the school does everything in their power to prevent it though, but they can't do much against off campus housing., 337108=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 269133=Our school went to the Frozen Four finals against Yale in 2012. Unfortunately we lost, but the whole student body was excited for this game.

I feel like Quinnipiac University can offer an unforgettable college experience. Bang for the buck It is VERY expensive to go here, but in my opinion it is worth the debt because I'm having the time of my life! The only bad thing is that the food in the Cafe and the Bobcat Den is way over priced and your meal plan will go quickly, so you have to ration it and sometimes mooch off of others with more on their meal plan :P Am enjoying being here Being on campus is a blast and there is so much to do. Hike Sleeping Giant, hang out in the quad, go shopping in New Haven and Hamden, and of course the clubs on Thursdays and the weekends are a lot of fun. The rec center is pretty nice and intramural sports are a great way to get involved. There are a ton of clubs and organizations to get involved with. I transferred to QU in the spring semester and i had no problem making friends and getting involved. Everyone I've encountered has been extremely nice and",
