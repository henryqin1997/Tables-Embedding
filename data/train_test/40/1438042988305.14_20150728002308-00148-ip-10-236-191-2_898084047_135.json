            "UAPD is always driving around campus, all dorms and buildings are secure and the only way in is with your action card access. During weekends the strip has bouncers at all eateries and clubs, bars etc. This campus is very safe!",
            "Greek Life is the heart of the campus. If you are unsure of greek life, do some research and try to attend one of their viewing of the houses. Do give it a some thought. It is a lot of fun and great for students who want to have a fun busy schedule ( this being said in the most positive way)! :)",
            "UA has plenty of clubs for all types of students. From Key Club (community service club) to Anime Club there is a place for every student.",
            "At one dining hall, there is a thing called Late Night at Lakeside Dining Hall. There they serve breakfast from 10pm - 1 am. This is held daily and sometimes they show movies, have karaoke night and even a DJ.",
            "For the older students there are bars and clubs to go to on the weekends. There is a mall not even 5 mins away from campus, as well as a movie theater. UA is located next to a river so if any students enjoy fishing, boating, rowing etc it is possible. From UA you can drive 30mins away to Birmingham and Hoover where there are more malls and city life.",
            "Dining at the dining halls on campus are pretty good for dining hall food. There are 4 main dining halls as well as a few markets. There are many food places near/on campus that do accept Dining Dollars and Bama Cash.",
            "Dorm life is a great experience for all. UA has various dorms some being all girl, all boy, and co-ed. The rooms are nice, each student receives a bed, desk and chair, closest and small 3 drawer dresser. In cases of 2 people sharing 1 room they will also have their own set of what is said above and a small mini fridge and microwave. Do not fret about not having a kitchen! All dorms do have a floor or common kitchen, that has 2 or more stoves, fridges and cabinet space.",
            "UA wants their students to do well in their studies. Many classes will be more rigorous than others. If you feel overwhelmed or are having difficulty with classes, UA has many outlets to gain tutors, be it from the professor themselves or a student. The professors here at UA want to help you! So do not be shy in asking for help!",
            "Do your research and if it is possible go on a tour of the campus! If not possible go on the UA website and do the virtual online tour. Meet with your state representative to gather more information and have any questions you may have answered.",
            "UA is a diverse campus with a wide range of majors and minors to choose from. The faculty are passionate about what they teach and strive to have their students be just as passionate about their own personal studies. To top it all off the campus itself is rich in history and welcomes students with its good ole southern hospitality and loving family attitude."

I am defiantly a Crimson Tide football fan but not to the level seen by most of the students here. After three years, Saturdays in fall have lost their edge a little and I do not look forward to the massive overcrowding and crazy traffic that football weekends bring. The Rec Center is great (though very crowed in August, September, January, and February) and I love playing intramural sports there. I guess my biggest hang up here is again, the culture., 599575=I've had an unlimited meal plan for two years now. That's all day every day, anything in the dining hall you want, as long as it's open. There are four dining halls on campus and they all have their pros and cons, but overall there is nothing to complain about and there is something open from 7:15 am to 1am on weekdays and from 10:30am to 8:30pm on weekends., 512296=There are so many clubs and activities here! During Get on Board Day in September, hundreds of organizations have tables set up around the student center for you to look around for something that catches your eye! There truly is an organization on campus for everyone!, 622072=Why is an elephant the mascot of the University of Alabama? Alabama became associated with the elephant during the 1930 season when Coach Wallace Wade put together one heck of a Crimson Tide football team. On October 8, 1930, Everett Strupper, a sports writer for the Atlanta Journal wrote a story about the Alabama-Mississippi game. Strupper wrote, That Alabama team of 1930 is a typical Wade machine, powerful, big, tough, fast, aggressive, well-schooled in fundamentals, and the best blocking team for this early in the season that I have ever seen. When those big brutes hit you I mean you go down and stay down, often for an additional two minutes. Coach Wade started his second team that was plenty big and they went right to their knitting scoring a touchdown in the first quarter against one of the best fighting small lines that I have seen. For Ole Miss was truly battling the big boys for every inch of ground. At the end of the quarter, the earth started to tremble, there was a distant rumble that continued to grow. Some excited fan in the stands bellowed, 'Hold your horses, the elephants are coming,' and out stamped this Alabama varsity. And, voila... the Alabama elephant was born., 978407=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 96864=The dorms at school here are excellent. Alabama is constantly renovating and building new dorms on campus. In fact, a new one is set to be finished in 2014. The new dorm will be a clone of the one opened for the 2012 year. I would like to sound humble, but it is quite impressive., 502347=Our freshman class of 2012 is represented by 49 states and a few different countries. Make friends and get to know everyone. The rec center is a great place to hang out and make friends, 18054=I love The University of Alabama environment. It is my home away from home. During the week the campus environment is very relaxing and displays an easy-going vibe. People are friendly and helpful as well. Along with relaxing environment the campus is full of traditions. On game days there is not a dull moment. The University of Alabama football team won the 2009 National Championship and a member of the team won the Heisman Award in 2009 as well. Those two victories excites the students as well as fans. Game days are a blast at The University of Alabama., 39481=An expansion on what I see as the campus culture: Ive already touched on the somewhat dysfunctional academic culture that is present here and the fact that this is foremost a party school, but despite what the school shows in its advertising campaigns or student tours, the culture here is generally not one of diversity, tolerance, and inclusion. It seems every year we have a huge race issue or greek vs. independent issue, among the more frequent minor events, that pours salt into old wounds and deepens the divides of the student body. There are certainly pocket-environments where minorities of all types will find acceptance and there are student groups that work very hard to mend divides and make the culture more inclusive, but on the aggregate this is not the most welcoming place for people who are not white, male, and cis-gendered (disclaimer on perspective- I am all three of these) A word on the administration: President Witt was hired in 2003 with a ambitious plan to raise school enrollment among other things. He succeeded in hitting his 28,000 goal four years early, and new goals have been set to continue to grow the campus enrollment in the future. In this lies one of the fundamental problems with this school; money has become more important than the quality of the student experience here (though this is probably also the case for any large state-school). This is a point where the campus badly needs a moratorium on enrollment increase to address transportation issues, update dorms, deal with the rampant overcrowding seen in some areas/buildings on campus, and address other important issues. From my perspective and the perspective of many other students, the administration is ignoring the what is best for the student body because of a drive to increase their numbers and their prestige too quickly., 246965=Apply early, as most of the scholarships are given by December., 578866=Computer Science major students should often go to Help session that are in SERC 1016. It's very helpful and useful for their test or quiz., 111649=Apply early, because you can get your notice of admission very fast with no strings attached. Your SAT score matters a lot; if your composite score is greater than 1400, you will receive free tuition. If your composite score is greater than 1350, you will receive 2/3 off of the current tuition. It goes on down like this so Alabama is actually very affordable if you have good test scores. If you have any interest at all, apply to the Honors College. Admissions are not extremely competitive, but allow you a smaller community rooted in intellectualism. Honors classes are really interesting, fun, and typically not more difficult than other classes, just different and usually more discussion-based. Honors students also receive great benefits like early registration, etc. If you visit (which you should) go to an event that you're interested in. Campus tours are informative but don't really tell you about campus culture., 779339=The Greek Life at this campus is the largest in the nation. They are very active on campus. They have large houses that both surround the stadium and another location on campus. The sorority rush process occurs the week before school starts in August. It is a very welcoming community that offers many opportunities on and off campus., 785188=The University of Alabama is filled with traditions that have been around since its founding in 1831. A student will get the full college experience at this University. This University will allow you to make as much or as little of your experience as possible; you just have to be willing to do a little work to make the connections you desire., 722259=Academics are extremely competitive at UA. Honors takes up 30% of the school. Having a minimum of a 3.5 and 1600 on SAT is recommended. If you're out of state, it's easier to get into the school. There's more competition for in-state student prospects., 851462=The pre game rally and march to the stadium on game days is a spectacular sight to see, 128643=The University of Alabama has a great engineering college. If you want to become an engineer then U of A could be the place for you. There are loads of opportunities for mentoring and research in the different fields. I have expanded my knowledge of engineering a lot since classes began in August., 184004=apply for scholarships early! i think the priority deadline that you should aim for is december 1. look into the blount undergraduate initiative and the honors college., 400657=The dorm life is great at UA. They match you up with someone that has similar likes and dislikes of your characteristics. The dorms are nice. They are building a brand new dorm,which will be up fall of 2013. This dorm should have a cafe in it and a small gym in it as well., 758704=Make sure you get your scholarship application in!!! Go to camp 1831 and get on board day!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck As a student, unless you aggressively find ways to utilize Alabama do not expect to feel as if you are receiving the full extent of what you are paying. I recommend immediately becoming a Residential Assistant, working with or within the Student Government Association, or become a productive part of organizations if you want to fully utilized the money you have spent at Alabama. If you all you do is go to classes and party at Alabama, you are wasting your tuition money with great severity. Am enjoying being here I have enjoyed The University of Alabama for many of the quality friends I have found. Unfortunately, little else is worth mentioning especially if you are a minority. After one year, I have already dealt several prejudicial situations mired in race. Alabama Football is amazing, but it does not make up for the amount of segregation and underlying hatred sprawled across teh campus. Am learning a lot Coming from the International Baccalaureate school The University of Alabama has not been a very challenging school. If you were a well-versed academic student during your time in high school do not expect any of the core classes to give you much trouble. It is only when you begin",
