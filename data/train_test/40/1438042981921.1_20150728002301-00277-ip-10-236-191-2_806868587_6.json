United Kennel Club, Inc. All rights reserved., 11511=The United Kennel Club is very pleased with the final count of 737 coonhounds, representing 35 US states and Canada, that pre-entered the 53rd Annual Autumn Oaks Nite Hunt. Many of their owners, who make this event a part of their annual vacation, will already be making their way towards Richmond, Indiana early next week. Although the Autumn Oaks hunt will not kick off until Friday, there's lots of other activities including the Black Gold 2000 Slam Series available to them leading up to the Labor Day weekend. On Tuesday, the Hanna's Creek Conservation Club in Liberty will host the first of this three night Slam Series. Black Gold Dog Food provides added purses of $500, in addition to regular payouts, for each of the three events. They also provide an additional $500 to the owner of the dog who accumulates the most cast wins at the three events. On Wednesday night the Delaware County Coonhunters in Muncie will play host to Slam Event #2 followed by the Wayne County Coonhunters hosting the third and final leg of the series from the fairgrounds in Richmond. http://res.ukcdogs.com/pdf/BlackGold2000.pdf Autumn Oaks also marks the second leg of the UKC Triple Crown Challenge sponsored by Black Gold. The UKC Winter Classic was the first of this series and will be decided at the World Championship in September. The winner of this series receives a check in the amount of $3000 and is placed in an elite group who have conquered the Triple Crown Challenge.
