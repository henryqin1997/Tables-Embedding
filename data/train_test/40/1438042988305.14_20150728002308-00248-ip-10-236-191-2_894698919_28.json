            "Harvard is on the edge of a city (Boston), but if you use street smarts and stay alert it is pretty safe. There is the occasional robbery, but it is not widespread.",
            "Clubs for anything. You will always find other people passionate about what you love, and you may even start a club with them if none exists.",
            "People who are driven in their academics and extracurriculars (especially leadership roles).",
            "Financial aid is amazing, and if you can afford the sticker price, then where else would be a better deal?",
            "Restaurants around Harvard and Porter Square and in Boston. Campus parties.",
            "HUDS food is pretty good, but the eating environment in the houses is wonderful and meals are all you can eat.",
            "The housing conditions are excellent and the organization into 12 undergraduate houses (like Harry Potter...) creates a community of support and friendships that will last a life time.",
            "It's no MIT or UChicago, but Harvard is pretty hard as they come. You may not realize it while you're there, but Harvard definitely equips you well academically.",
            "Harvard is looking for people who will be the future leaders and difference-makers. There is a threshold of test scores and grades that needs to be met, but past that level it is really your passion for what you love that is important. Harvard wants to see that you will work hard and commit to whatever you decide is your path in life.",
            "Harvard was a wonderful place full of opportunities that offered both breadth and depth of exploration. No matter the discipline, Harvard had fantastic resources. I had the opportunity to learn from and work with leaders in scientific and academic fields, and my classmates were as much a bountiful source of ideas and growth as my professors."

If that's not your cup of tea, Harvard Square is the ideal college town, with lots of quality, affordable food (especially pizza), a movie theater, great places to walk and stuff open until 2:00 a.m. I'm told the party scene isn'\u00c2?t what it is other places, but if you want to dance you can find somewhere to do it. Granted, I'm not the type for partying, but the environment and the people around me were so stimulating that I never found myself with a lack of things to do., 138015=There is a huge gate called Johnston Gate that students supposedly never enter or exit through except for twice their whole lives: once when you first arrive on campus in August, and once after you graduate as a senior.

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck By and far, Harvard has the best financial aid of any college in the world. Income < $60k, you're in for free. FREE. You can't beat free. Even upper income family receive a lot of aid here. In many cases, they'll even send you refund checks when you have a positive balance from extra outside scholarship money. Am enjoying being here I absolutely enjoy being there. Wonderful students, wonderful staff. People actually care about you at Harvard. People always ask me, Do they party at Harvard? Yes! Maybe not as crazy as some schools, but we definitely have some great parties. The Cambridge/Boston location is very exciting. The only con I've noticed is a lack of school spirit sometimes. Am learning a lot YES, YES, YES. You will learn tons and only from the best and the brightest. The professors are amazing and the TFs, likewise. The courses are generally designed to push you towards the limit of learning. IMO, the clubs and the student community alone make Harvard a great place to pickup knowledge, skills, and new friends.
