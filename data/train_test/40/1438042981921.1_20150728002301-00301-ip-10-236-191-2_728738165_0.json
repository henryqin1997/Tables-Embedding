The last signals on 19.954 MHz were received by me on 20 May 1982, two months before the decay of the Kosmos-1267/Salyut-6 complex on 29 July 1982. However, I must admit that I did pay scant attention to Kosmos-1267 during the spring and summer of 1982, since Salyut-7 had just been launched and took most of the attention of amateur space trackers. \u00a0, 13745=\"... it was high tide and the force 7-8 gale and some waves were washing right over the breakwater...we returned to the van via Crooklets [beach] for an early night. But it was not to be! On arriving back Susan Colwill [the operator of the caravan park] brought me a telephone message from David Muggleton which had arrived shortly before. It said: SALYUT 19.950 APPROX. AOS 1030 1200 1330 CA 1507 RAPID DOPPLER CA 1640 RAPID DOPPLER AOS 1809 DAVID. Now what was all this about? If GMT, these times did not fit Salyut 5. .... I listened to Radio Moscow at 2000 Z and right at the end they announced Cosmos 929\u00a0 but without heights......\", 5737=In 1977-1984 four TKS vehicles were launched, 20092=Within ten of launch Kosmos-1267 had maneuvered up to an orbit with a period corresponding to a 63-rev repeating pattern. As far as I can ascertain the VA was detached from the FGB on day 144 (May 24, 1981), the 29 th day of flight (the Kosmos-929 VA detached after 30 days), and was recovered around 1440 UT that day. The FGB, remaining in orbit, maneuvered to an orbit with a 78-rev repeating pattern almost exactly 32.5 days after launch - just like Kosmos-929!, 25798=TASS announced the flight at mid-day UT and the announcement said that the craft would perform a joint flight with Salyut-7. Geoff Perry in Kettering picked up short-wave telemetry on 19.954 MHz at 1532:20 UT. This craft also had only a single telemetry mode on shortwaves. It showed some similarities to that Mode B of Kosmos-1267. The initial orbit was 1.25 degrees from the orbital plane of Salyut-7 and the orbital planes would have merged on 6 March if no maneuver was made., 28842=The flight of Kosmos-1686, 32972=1, 2, and 4 August 1987 A signal was present on 19.955 MHz with the same telemetry format type but with different word values compared to Kosmos-1686. the transmissions from the ground did not overlap with those from Kosmos-1686 in time or in frequency, because Kosmos-1686 was on 19.954 MHz (which is indeed very close in frequency)., 27668=On 13 August I had a phone call from Dick Flagg who said he had heard that Kosmos-1443 would undock from Salyut-7 and land \"next week\". In the morning broadcast in English from radio Moscow on 15 August 1983 it was announced that, 21915=After the docking had occurred, TASS lifted part of the veil around Kosmos-1267 and issued an intriguing, but somewhat vague statement about its mission and characteristics:, 30985=This was evidently a setback for the intended mission of Kosmos-1686 and another visit to Salyut-7 to finish the work with the TKS-M was carried out in 1986 by the Soyuz T-15 crew in connection with its fascinating and unique expedition from Mir to Salyut-7 and back again to Mir. Cosmonauts Kizim and Solovyev stayed on Salyut-7 from 6 may until 25 June. This was the last time Salyut-7 was manned. It seems that there were plans to visit again, but these had to be abandoned when the orientation system of Kosmos-1686 failed in December 1989. Salyut-7 with Kosmos-1686 decayed from orbit on 7 February 1991. I received the last transmission from Kosmos-1686 on 19.954 MHz on 27 November 1989. \u00a0, 26347=On 6 March radio observations showed that the orbital period had been raised the day before\u00a0 to a value near 90.4 minutes.\u00a0 It was then obvious that the orbital planes would merge on 10 March. And, indeed, around 1000 UT on 10 March , TASS announced that the docking occurred at 0920 UT.\u00a0 At docking short-wave telemetry ceased, but was was resumed on 11 March. On 3 July 1983, Pravda published a sketch of Kosmos-1443 (see picture above right). This was a great event at the time. Seven years after the appearance (Kosmos-929) of what we now know was the TKS, we finally knew what it looked like., 29937=The Kettering Group\u00a0 received normal telemetry and voice from the crew during October and most of November 1985. However, at 1909.05-1913.40 UT on 13 November 1985 I picked up scrambled voice (listen to 13 Nov 1985 recording here) (of the same type as that received from Salyut-6) indicating that something confidential was discussed, probably a medical problem. The Kettering Group received more scrambled voice in the days to follow (16 and 17 November). Interestingly, the 20.008 MHz telemetry transmitter also began to be heard at this time, indicating that the status of the return ship was of great interest. It was therfore not entirely surprising when the crew landed at 1031 UT on 21 November because Vasyutin was ill. Reportedly he had a high fever (40 C, 104 F) and suffered from an inflammation of some sort (6)., 28321=The undocking occured at 1404 UT on 14 August. The VA crew return vehicle finally landed with 317 kg of cargo at 1302 UT on 23 August 1983\u00a0 (3).. As described elsewhere (3) this capsule was sold to the Perot Foundation at the Sotheby's auction on 11 December 1993 in New York City (see picture on the right). It is displayed at the National Air & Space Museum in Washington D.C., 32486=14 and 19 July 1976 There were signals on 19.944 MHz with the same telemetry format type but with different word values compared to Salyut-5 but transmitted overlapping with Salyut-5 on the same frequency. For example: on 19 July Salyut-5 transmitted 1122-1144 UT while the ground based signal was on between 1138-1211 UT! Very strange!, 21011=Early in the morning of 19 June 1981 I watched as telemetry signals from Salyut-6 (192.0 MHz) and Kosmos-1267 (247.0 MHz)\u00a0 seemed to disappear below my radio horizon within 20 seconds from each other. Obviously the craft were extremely close when I lost Kosmos-1267 at 0650.42 UT. The shortwave transmitter on 19.954 MHz on Kosmos-1267 was swicthed off abruptly at 0646.56 UT, something that I had not heard happening at any time earlier during the flight., 28964=TKS-M, a.k.a. Kosmos-1686, was launched at 0841:42 UT on 27 September 1985. This craft did not have a functional VA, but instead an extensive set of instruments for military tests in space. Indeed, at this time the decision to develop add-on modules to Mir based on the FGB service part of the TKS had been taken (4). Kosmos-1686 can therefore be regarded as a prototype for later add-on modules to Mir. However it still carried subsystems very similar to those of the original TKS vehicle. Thus, telemetry was again received on 19.954 MHz and 247.475 MHz (see article on TKS HF telemetry). Kosmos-1686 docked with Salyut-7 on 2 October 1985. The resident crew on the space station had been launched to Salyut-7 just ten days before Kosmos-1686. The resident crew consisted of Vasyutin, Savinykh and Volkov - a \"military\" crew., 20633=When the orbit of Kosmos-1267 was raised the rate of approach between the orbital planes of this craft and Salyut-6 decreased somewhat and a straight-line extrapolation showed that the orbits would be co-planar on day 169 or 170, i.e. 18 or 19 June 1981(see figure on the right). We just had to wait and see., 15434=A day after launch I also detected strong PPM-AM telemetry on 166.0 MHz similar to that received from Soyuz spacecraft at the time. Interestingly the 166 MHz signals were very strong but always quite brief, only 1-2 minutes each time. This was caused by the transmitter being turned on quite far to the east, just before setting below my horizon. This could of course mean that the command station for this transmitter was quite far to the east. The figure on the right points to Tblisi being the command station. Signals on this frequency were very consistent during the first month. We certainly realized that something radical happened in mid August. The PPM-AM signals on 166.0 MHz ceased sometime between 16 August and 20 August. On 18 August, Geoff Perry wrote in his day-to-day log:, 19255=On the first day we also realized that the orbital plane of\u00a0 Kosmos-1267 was about ten degrees from that of Salyut-6 and that they would come together in roughly a month's time. They would have done so if the orbit of Kosmos-1267 had not been raised., 17084=The Kettering Group was indeed baffled by this flight. This is what I wrote in a note to Richard Flagg dated 10 September 1977:, 23151=Interestingly, at the end of June 1981, according to UPI, Konstantin Feoktistov, cosmonaut and spacecraft designer, had remarked that, 27029=What we did not realize was that this was not the start of something new - that vehicles just like this would serve future space stations - but rather the end of a story. In the Soviet logic, they could reveal the appearance of a space system when there was something more modern in development. This was the case when Vostok was revealed (Soyuz was in development). We should have realized this in 1983 and understood that Kosmos-1443 was the end of a line - the complete TKS., 18561=Thus, on 25 April 1981, Jan-Ola Dahlberg in Malm\u00f6 picked up telemetry at 0940 UT on 19.954 MHz, 12 hours before TASS announced the flight. Since the launch took place at 0201 UT (3), Jan-Ola had picked up the signals on the fifth orbit. Remarkable! Dick Flagg in Florida also received shortwave telemetry\u00a0 on launch day. We also discovered a second frequency, 19.942 MHz being used by this spacecraft.\u00a0 Short-wave telemetry from Kosmos-1267 was similar, but certainly not identical to that from Kosmos-929 (see story on TKS shortwave telemetry).}",

    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 In the table below, all flights with some heritage to the TKS has been listed. This includes both VA test flights with a TKS mock-up, TKS flights with VA crew return vehicles, flights with the service module of the TKS the FGB functioning as an add-on module to Salyut-7, Mir and ISS as well as the flights when a stripped down FGB, known as the FSB was used as a \"space tug\" for Kvant and Polyus. In this article only the proper TKS flights will be described. Kosmos-1686 was launched without VA. Kosmos-1443 had its VA cleared from crew support systems; Kosmos-1267 was modified for docking with Salyut-6/DOS; Kosmos-929 was a fully equipped spaceship; In 1977-1984 four TKS vehicles were launched Six TKS vehicles were manufactured. Their unmanned test flights began as late as in the summer of 1977 (Kosmos-929). Before that a series of recovery vehicle tests was initiated. In 1976-1979 four pairs of VAs were launched by UR-500K to test launch escape system and technique of deorbiting and landing of VA (three pairs were orbited as Kosmos-881,-882; Kosmos-997,-998 and Kosmos-1100,-1101, one pair failed to orbit due to Proton launch vehicle failure); TKS-related flights The VA was capable of 31 hours of autonomous flight (1), but according to the Russian sketch below the normal procedure was for the VA",
    "textAfterTable": "The flight of Kosmos-929 The Kettering Group was extremely successful in tracking Kosmos-929. Below is an excerpt from Geoff Perry's \"day-to-day log\" for 17 July 1977.

Incredible! It later turned out that the frequency was 19.954 MHz and that there were two independent telemetry transmitter, but telemetry values in the two systems were quite similar. The most significant change was in word 14 of the 15-word telemetry frame.",
