I think he will start in Potomac with a fast track to AA and be called up in September., 27427=I read Phil Wood this morning putting Gerardo Parra on the radar. Parra is another LH batter. Curious words from Rizzo that he will find his RH replacement for Cameron in-house. Its as if Cameron in Rizzo's mind already made the team. Someone has to come along who is better than the Jason Michael and Brett Carroll. Have you seen their stats? You might as well let Ankiel and Bernadina just bat against LH pitching!Someone has to shake loose in Spring Training. This is why I have said since August to grab Coco Crisp as I envisioned Rizzo coming up empty. Before someone writes that Crisp wanted to stay West Coast, Crisp would have come here if the money was right. The Nats never pursued him. Who wouldn't want to play in Washington these days. Its water under the bridge now.Maybe Davey and his coaching staff can \"coach\" up some of these guys to have career years and everything will be fine., 47704=erocks33 said\u2026If I were a betting man, I'd lay some good coin down that Rizzo will make a deal to bring Marlon Byrd over from the Cubs to be the RH CF before Spring Training is over \u2026Erocks, I'll take that, for a beer (XX or better). See you May 5? : ), 54107=Kenza Fan \u2014 Mookie is one reason why I'm not so worried about our outfield. Those '86 Mets were my guys (ALL METS from 1965, when I really started to pay attention, till 2004 were my guys\u2026okay, still in 2005\u2026 and I loved them. I saw a photo of Davey in the Post Sunday and suddenly I was glad we had him. It felt like he could maybe get our guys going for REAL this year.GYFNG! GYFDJG!, 15261=The Nationals losing in the 2012 WS won't be all bad, especially knowing that they will follow the next seven winning them all\u2026 :~), 50080=@ Richard who said\u2026\"Who led off for the '86 Mets? Is he still around?\"The Opening Day Lineup for the Mets in 1986 was:1. Lenny Dykstra (CF) .295/.377/.4452. Wally Backman (2B) .320/.376/.3853. Keith Hernandez (1B) .310/.413/.4464. Gary Carter (C) .255/.337/.4395. Darryl Strawberry (RF) .259/.358/.5076. George Foster (LF) .227/.289/.4297. Howard Johnson (3B) .245/.341/.4458. Rafael Santana (SS) .218/.285/.2549. Dwight Gooden (P) 17-6 2.843B Johnson was eventually replaced in hte starting lineup by Ray Knight .298/.351/.424.To answer questions about Mookie Wilson, he came off the bench and started, playing all three OF positions. There was also Kevin Mitchell .277/.344/.466, who was the Mets super-sub that year, playing every fielding position except for 2B and catcher.The Mets also had six, count 'em 6 pitchers who earned 10 or more wins, 5 had 14 or more, including the right-handed half of their closing duo, Roger McDowell. FWIW, the lefty half was Jesse Orosco., 51700=Foster was released in August, 1986. Famed for his black bat and power hitting for the Big Red Machine, Foster was a disappointment for the Mets., 40304=I asked this question about Chris Marrero a few weeks ago and nobody seemed to know his status. Glad Amanda Comak decided to write about him today:http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/nationals-watch/2012/feb/21/chris-marrero-arrives-camp-torn-hamstring-will-lim/Sounds like maybe he will be back the end of June., 77677=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 17585=Johnson says the typical things about this team having more \"athletes\", whatever that means. Until the Nats win a World Series, their athletes are not as good as the Mets athletes of 1986. Do the Nats have a Gary Carter? Ramos is not nearly as good. Is Adam La Roche as good as Keith Hernandez? Do the Nats have a centerfielder as good as the twin-headed Mets centerfield of Wilson or Dykstra? Is Werth nearly as good as Daryle Strawberry? And so on. The Nats are an 80 win team with plenty of potential to rise into the 90-95 win territory. Best of luck to them., 33904=All these posts are getting me amped up for the season! Just thinking back, and not too far back at that, about prior rosters makes me shudder now. Man, did we stink! But even then, we had hope. If Castilla, Vidro, Guillen, Johnson, Livo, et al could be pushing for the playoffs late in 2005, then why not this team, which is sooo much better in every aspect? Is there even ONE player from that team you would take over this year's? Perhaps a healthy Johnson is an upgrade over LaRoche, but only because we have not seen ALR healthy. But that is the only possible upgrade I can find, and I think it's a stretch in any case. So, pass the Koolaid, but also let's check the stock of bourbon and Maalox. After all, depth counts!, 65406=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)...

I'll take Jose Guillen's 2005 over Jayson Werth's 2011., 16748=Ladies and Gentlemen! Introducing the 2012 National League Manager of the Year!I am so looking forward to this season! I just see a much more overall professional MLB ensemble then we've had since this team came to town., 1587=When Johnson says this Nationals squad has a chance to be better than the 1984 Mets franchise he inherited and watched improve from 90 wins to 98 wins to 108 wins and a World Series title in just three seasons \u2026 well, who are you to argue with the man?, 42073=Nice post and good point. I might take the 2005 Jamey Carroll as a utility guy. Is there even ONE player from that team you would take over this year's? Perhaps a healthy Johnson is an upgrade over LaRoche, but only because we have not seen ALR healthy. But that is the only possible upgrade I can find, and I think it's a stretch in any case.}",
