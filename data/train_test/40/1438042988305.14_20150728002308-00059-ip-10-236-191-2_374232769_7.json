For all the promises of God in Him are true, and embodied in him Amen, to the glory of God by us. 21 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; Now He who established us with you in Christ, and had appointed us, is God; 22 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. Who has also committed us, and given the dedication of the Spirit in our hearts. 23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. Furthermore I call God as my witness, that it was to spare you that I had not returned to Corinth before. 24",
