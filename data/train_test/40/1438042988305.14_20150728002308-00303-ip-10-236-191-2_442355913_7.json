For instance, the share of native adult males without a college education in teen jobs increased by 3.5 percentage points over this period. However, the aggregate share of all adults in teen jobs increased by less than this amount because the employment-to-population ratio for non-college adults fell (column 2), as did their population share (column 3).

The first line in the top panel shows the actual change in the (annual average) employment or participation rate between 1985 and 2010. The second line shows the projected change had changes to the rate responded to changes in the GDP gap and changes in adult employment (or participation) rates in its usual fashion. Hence, the amount \"explained\" by the cycle (the combination of movements in the GDP gap and adult employment or participation) is the decline predicted in the second line. The goal of this exercise is to see how much of the remaining decline can be explained by the supply and demand factors considered previously.33 Changes in the GDP gap and the adult employment (or participation) rate can explain 60 percent of the decline in teen employment and 50 percent of the decline in teen participation (the third column of line 2)., 213651=Dustmann, Christian, John Mickleweight, and Arthur van Soest. 2009.

Empirical Economics, 37:201-218., 176196=Note: Table displays regression coefficients from regressions for which the dependent variable is the slope from a state-specific regression of teen employment rates (for all months) on a linear trend and a constant for 2000-2010. Across all states the weighted-average coefficient on the trend is -0.015 i.e. between 2000-2010 on average the teen employment rate fell by 1.5 percentage points per year. Regressions are weighted by the average of the sum of BLS weights across all years for the state. All variables are measured using CPS monthly outgoing rotation group microdata. Standard errors clustered at the state level are in parentheses. For all regressions the sample size is 51 (50 states and DC)., 6203=This paper has two purposes. First, it summarizes trends in teen employment in a manner similar to Morisi (2008 and 2010), and also introduces some new descriptive evidence from data sources such as the Survey of Income Participants (SIPP) and the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Second, and more importantly, it takes another look at competing explanations for declines in youth employment over the last thirty years. Using evidence mainly from the cross-state or cross-commuting zone relationship between teen employment and supply and demand proxies over time, I conclude that labor demand explanations (stemming from increases in the supply of adult labor that is substitutable for teens) appears to explain more of the recent decline than do labor supply explanations (which are related to increased emphasis on schooling and college): The demand factors that I examine can explain between half to two-thirds of the decline in teen employment that is unexplainable by the cycle, and the supply factors I consider can explain most of the remaining fraction. Of course there are surely supply and demand factors that are not included in this analysis, but a conservative interpretation of this evidence is that both demand for teen labor and the supply of teen labor play an important role in explaining why fewer teens work than ever before., 99960=Notes: Data are from American Time Use Survey for 2003-2009. Summer months are June-August. Non-summer months are January-April and October-December. Individual is classified as employed if they report being employed with job or absent from job at the time of the time use survey. Employment-related activities include time at work searching for a job engaging in other income-related activities or traveling to work- or job search-related activities., 61674=The rest of the table presents estimates from additional robustness checks. In column 11, I include state time trends. The coefficient is somewhat larger in magnitude than the baseline, though here the relationship is extremely imprecise. In column 12, I limit the time period to 1995-2009 and the relationship is in fact much stronger than baseline (although again, imprecise). In column 13, I limit calculation of the share variable to the native population, and the implied impact is somewhat smaller (which is to be expected, since available evidence suggests that immigration negatively affects teen employment and, as shown earlier, is responsible for part of the increase in the share of adults in teen jobs). Finally, in column 14 I also include the employment rate for adults, and this has almost no effect on the magnitude of the coefficient for the share of adults in teen jobs, suggesting that negative labor market shocks (correlated with changes in relative labor demand across skill-type of job) are not driving these findings., 217472=Stinebrickner, Ralph and Todd R. Stinebrickner. 2003. Work during school and academic performance. Journal of Labor Economics, 21(2)., 55587=Table 6 verifies this using microdata from the Census and American Community Survey. The dependent variable in panel A is the change in the fraction of native adults in teen jobs (between 1980 and 2007). The two covariates of interest are the degree to which routine tasks are used in the state (or commuting zone) in 198026, and the share of adults in production occupations in 1980.27 The theory outlined above suggests that areas for which occupations specializing in routine tasks were more prevalent in 1980 should have experienced greater subsequent increases in polarization; partially, though not entirely, this is because areas that with more \"routinized occupations\" were also more heavily specialized in manufacturing and production. Indeed, there is a strongly positive relationship between the routine task intensiveness of an area in 1980 or the share of adults in production occupations in 1980 and subsequent polarization. This relationship remains reasonably strong whether these summary statistics for the 1980 occupational distribution are entered separately or together, and whether the analysis is done at the state or commuting zone level.28 Consistent with adults crowding out teens, teen employment (panel B) also fell more in areas that were more heavily routinized in 1980 (though not for areas that concentrated in production occupations)., 214609=Light, Audrey. 2001.

Youth labor markets in the United States: Shopping around vs. staying put. Review of Economics and Statistics 84(3), 462-482., 64828=After instrumenting for immigrant shares (column 2), the coefficient on immigrant share becomes negative, suggesting that selective immigration into areas with more positive labor market conditions may bias OLS coefficients towards zero. However, estimates are still imprecise. One possibility is that, due to small sample sizes in the CPS data, state-level estimates of employment rates are noisy, and differencing over time exacerbates this. I therefore move to estimating employment using Census and ACS microdata. Column 3 demonstrates that, after doing so, both the share of native adults in teen jobs and the immigrant share of the population are strongly negatively associated with teen employment rates. In column 4, I add an instrument for adult natives in teen jobs, motivated from the earlier analysis (interacting the share of native adults in teen jobs in 1980 with the average change in the share, across states, between 1980 and 1990, 1990 and 2000, and 2000 and 2009). This has no effect on estimates of the immigration effect, but boosts the measured impact of the share of adult natives in teen jobs (though it is now much less precise)., 216902=Ramey, Garey and Valerie A.

The routine task and production occupation variables are normalized to have mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1., 155849=Note: Table displays regression coefficients from state-year level regressions for which the dependent variable is the log median hourly wage for 16-17 year olds in the state/year. Standard errors clustered at the state level are in parentheses. State-year observations are weighted by the number of individuals in each cell. Teen employment rates are estimated over all months. In addition to the variables in the table each regression includes state and year fixed effects (and state time trends for the indicated columns) the share of the state/year population that is age 16-17 and the log number of 16-17 year olds. For columns 1-11 the number of observations is 1326 (50 states and DC 26 years); for columns 12-14 the number of observations is 816., 16419=One reason for this may be that working part-time while in school detracts from other academic activities.4 There is a larger literature on this point, which is mostly in consensus that working while in high school has sizeable negative effects on academic achievement (Tyler 2003, though Rothstein 2007 finds smaller effects), though the effect may be non-linear with only the largest amounts of work having a deleterious effect on school grades (DeSimone 2006). The effect on grades may be more negative for minority high school students (Oettinger 1999), and working while in college also appears detrimental to grades (Arano and Parker 2008, Kalenkowski and Pabilonia 2010)., 30255=One piece of suggestive evidence that reported summer enrollment is related to subsequent college-going is that states with higher college attendance rates for their 19-21 year old population also have higher summer enrollment rates for teens.10 However, if the \"college attractiveness\" hypothesis explains all of the rise in summer enrollment, then it is unlikely that the number of primary teachers (i.e. elementary teachers) employed in the summer would increase substantially. CPS respondents are asked \"what kind of work\" they do regardless of current employment status, and, consistent with school teachers taking the summer off, a large fraction of those who report being teachers also report not being at work during the summer months; for instance, in summer 2010 nearly 50 percent of those who report themselves as teachers were not at work. However, the fraction of teachers at work in the summer increased from the early 1990s through the early 2000s, as shown by the red line in figure 17. Further, the shares of primary teachers at work in July show essentially the same pattern as that for secondary teachers (not shown). If the rise in teen summer enrollment is only because of tighter high school graduation requirements (a point which I explore more carefully below), then we might expect to see only the share of secondary teachers rise. Since the trend in July enrollment matches the trend in the share of teachers at work in July (at least through the early 2000s), it seems plausible that some of the increase in enrollment-and decline in employment-may be due to a change in the structure of the school year, i.e. more year-round schooling or a much earlier start date., 216414=Oreopoulos, Philip, Till Von Wachter and Andrew Heisz. 2006.

National Bureau of Economic Research, working paper no. 12159., 159844=Note: Table displays regression coefficients from state-year (or czone-year) level regressions for which the dependent variable is the change in the fraction of teens employed in the area/year. Standard errors clustered at the area level are in parentheses. For all regressions sample includes the change between 1980 and 1990 1990 and 2000 and 2000 and 2009. Area-year observations are weighted by a function of the number of individuals in each cell in t and t-1. For CPS data employment is estimated for school year months (January-April and October-December). For Census/ACS data employment is the fraction employed during the previous week. In addition to the variables in the table each regression includes year fixed effects the employment and participation rates in 1980 the change in the log number of adults with no college and the change in the log number of teens and the 1980 share of the area's immigrant population that came from each of four regions and for each of the four regions the share that lives in each area. For state-level regressions the number of observations is 153 (50 states and DC 3 years); for commuting-zone level regressions the number of observations is 2223 (741 commuting zones 3 years). See text for information on how instruments are constructed., 21979=The next set of figures explores how other (very coarse) categories of time use have also changed. Figure 10 plots the (annual average) fraction of teens in each of four mutually exclusive categories: those who are only enrolled, employed and enrolled, only employed, and idle. Since the mid-1990s, there is a gradual decline in the annual fraction not in school (idle, and only employed), and somewhat more recently, a decline in the annual fraction both enrolled and employed. Thus, the fraction only in school has been rising, from about 50 percent in 1985 to over 70 percent in 2010. One important takeaway is that the fraction idle has not been rising despite a decline in employment rates; instead, there is evidently substitution (on an annual average basis) towards schooling., 217987=von Hippel, Paul T. 2007.

Technical Report: Center for Immigration Studies., 20428=If the decline in youth employment is primarily due to an increased emphasis on academic activities (for improving the prospects of getting in to a better college), we might expect that employment rates fell more for groups that tend to have higher college attendance rates, such as females, whites, or teens from wealthier or better educated families. As shown in panels A, B, and C of figure 9, although employment rates are a bit higher for these groups on average, the decline is remarkably uniform (at least since the mid-1990s) across these groups. Additionally, it appears that employment rates may also have fallen for those not enrolled during the school year as well (panel D), although this series is admittedly noisy due to much smaller sample sizes (in 2010, about 95 percent of 16-17 year olds in the CPS report being enrolled during school year months)., 215865=Newmark, David and William Wascher. 2007. Does a higher minimum wage enhance the effectiveness of the earned income tax credit? National Bureau of Economic Research, Working paper 12915., 123611=Note: Columns 1 X 2 X 3 divided by the aggregate adult employment to population ratio for the year equals column 4 (all divided by 100). The aggregate emp-pop rate in 1995 is 64.4 percent and in 2010 is 61.2 percent. (As an example: In 1995 for adult immigrant adults without a college education .449 X .542 X .068 / .644 = .026 which is the contribution listed in column 4.) The sum of the contributions to the aggregate in each year is the percent of all adults in teen jobs for that year as listed in the bottom of the table. See text for further details. Calculations are derived from CPS monthly outgoing rotation group microdata., 73043=Supply and demand both evidently matter for explaining much of the decline in youth employment. But how much of the decline can be attributed to each? To address this, I construct counterfactual teen employment and participation rates, holding supply and/or demand factors at their 1985 level. To begin, I again estimate a state-year level 2SLS regression of the teen employment rate (this time, using annual averages) on the log minimum wage, the share of non-college adults in teen jobs (demand factor), and the following supply factors: the fraction of teens enrolled in the summer, the fraction of teens enrolled in the school year, the college enrollment rate for 19-21 year olds two years later, and whether the state offers merit aid scholarships or requires an exit exam.31 To form a counterfactual estimate of the teen employment rate had supply or demand factors not changed over the last 25 years, I hold these factors at their 1985 level and use the estimated coefficients from the regression to adjust each state's teen employment or participation rate to this counterfactual level. I then aggregate to the national level to form counterfactual rates holding either supply factors, demand factors, or both fixed at 1985 levels. For this exercise to be meaningful, I also compute a baseline counterfactual employment rate, which is the predicted teen employment or participation rate if it were to respond to the cycle (the CBO's estimate of the GDP gap) and the employment-population ratio for prime-age for adults in its \"historical manner.\"32, 4383=There is surprisingly little academic research related to understanding the causes of this decline in youth participation. Potential explanations naturally divide into supply and demand factors. Some possible supply factors are related to an increased emphasis on education, perhaps in part in response to a rising high school and college wage premium, which has increased the incentives to graduate high school, enter college, and attend a more elite college. Other education policy (such as stricter graduation requirements) may have also indirectly discouraged teens from working. Factors that may have reduced demand for teen labor include increased labor market competition from immigrants and native adults. Aaronson, Park, and Sullivan (2006), hereafter APS2006, provides one recent treatment of these issues; after demonstrating that the decline in youth employment is remarkably uniform across demographic groups, they provide ad-hoc tests for competing hypotheses. Their strongest finding is that teen employment rates fell more in states that provided merit-based college scholarships, perhaps because fewer teens needed to work in high school to save for college or because the returns to academic achievement in high school increased; they interpret this as suggestive evidence that supply explanations matter. On the other hand, recent research demonstrates areas that experience a larger increase in immigration have larger declines in teen employment (Sum, Garrington, and Khatiwada 2006; Camarota and Jensenius 2010; Smith 2012), suggesting that demand factors stemming from the increased supply of substitutable labor matter as well. Morisi (2008 and 2010) provide an excellent overview of trends in school year and summer employment, and carefully lays out hypotheses for the recent trends., 180099=Note: Demand factor is share of non-college adults in teen jobs. Supply factors are: the fraction of teens enrolled in June July and August; the fraction of teens enrolled in January-April/October-December; the college enrollment rate for 19-21 year olds; the log difference between wages for college educated and non-college educated adults (in panel B and C); whether the state requires an exit exam; and whether the state provides merit aid scholarships for college. See text or note to figure 8 for details on how the counterfactual employment rate assuming historical cyclicality is constructed. The counterfactual rates holding supply demand and/or the minimum wage fixed at the 1985 level are derived from a state/year 2SLS regression of teen employment rates on the supply and demand variables as well as state and year fixed effects (and state time trends for panel C) the population share of 16-17 year olds and the log number of 16-17 year olds. Counterfactual rates are computed for each state in each year and aggregated up to the national level for the aggregate counterfactual rate in each year., 32138=However, it does not appear that year-round education is widespread enough to be entirely responsible: For the 2006-2007 school year, the National Association of Year-Round Education estimates that about 2,750 public schools followed a year-round calendar, representing 2 million students, or about 4 percent of total public enrollment (see also von Hippel 2007). It seems more likely that earlier start dates may explain some of the rise; Morisi (2010) cites evidence that about 75 percent of school districts now start teaching before September, up from 50 percent in 1988, and Market Data Retrieval11 reports that around 20 percent of public schools will begin instruction prior to August\u00a016 for the 2011-2012 school year., 40692=One common assertion is that teens are spending more time watching video games and television than ever before. In fact, the fraction of 9-12 graders who used computers or played video games for three hours per day or more on an average school day increased from 22 percent to 25 percent between 2003 and 2009, though the fraction who watched television for three hours per day or more fell from 38 percent to 33 percent.18 And, as shown in figures 13 and 14, based in ATUS data the average amount of time spent playing games is no more than an hour and has increased only modestly since 2003., 14812=Before delving deeper, it is worthwhile to consider why we should be concerned about lower teen employment rates. First, from a welfare perspective it is possible that work experience while school-aged has important benefits later in life, related to learning good work ethic, the importance of punctuality, the ability to deal with bosses and co-workers, and so on. However, the literature on the returns to working as a teenager on later life outcomes is surprisingly meager.3 The primary papers on the subject all use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 to estimate the relationship between employment while in high school and later life labor market outcomes, controlling for the wide range of covariates made possible by the comprehensive nature of the NLSY. Ruhm (1997) finds positive effects of high school employment on earnings 5-10 years later, and Light (2001) finds that the returns to high school education are somewhat smaller after controlling for high school work experience (suggesting that work experience has positive effects on future earnings). More recently, Hotz et. al. (2002) argues that, after controlling for dynamic selection, work experience in high school has no effect, or possibly even a slightly negative effect, on future earnings. Although suggestive, these papers may have limited implications for recent declines in teen employment since the mid-1990s since they are derived from much older cohorts., 211777=Autor, David H. and David Dorn. 2009.

Evidence on youth employment, earnings, and parental transfers in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. Journal of Human Resources, 36(4): 795-822., 63154=In table 9, I take concerns about the endogeneity of immigrant concentrations more seriously. The share variable in the regressions presented in this table is estimated only for native adults, and is estimated from Census data for 1980, 1990, and 2000, and American Community Survey data for 2009. These regressions are differenced versions of those presented in earlier tables, with similar controls, except that state fixed effects are not included (because the results are differenced). The share of the non-college population that is immigrant also enters as a separate variable. I use a differenced equation because, as discussed in Smith (2012), the IV strategy as defined below predicts changes in immigrant concentrations., 54187=To further address this and other endogeneity concerns, my primary specification uses an IV-strategy to directly instrument for the share of adults in teen jobs, based on the share of adults in teen jobs in the state in 1985 interacted with the average share across all states in each year. The motivation behind this instrument comes from a recent paper by Autor and Dorn (2009), which provides a structural model of polarization.25 The model predicts areas that most heavily utilized routinized labor prior to the acceleration in polarization in the 1980s and 1990s (i.e. areas that employed a greater share of workers in occupations that specialize in routine tasks, like manufacturing and clerical work) have the most scope for polarization, will respond most strongly to improving automation and declining computer costs, and will therefore have shown the most polarization over time. Hence, if cross-state differences in the share of adults in teen jobs reflect underlying polarization, rather than the endogenous response to shifts in teen labor supply, then labor markets should have polarized more-and teen employment should also have fallen more-in labor markets for which routinized tasks were more important in the production process., 76017=The third, fourth, and fifth lines of the table adjust for supply and demand factors (and the minimum wage), independently, as well as in concert. Supply factors matter: Holding the supply factors (summer enrollment rates for 16-17 year olds, exit exams, merit aid scholarships, college enrollment rates) at their 1985 level, teen employment would have fallen 17 percentage points, and so supply factors can \"explain\" an additional 1 percentage point of the total decline or 6 percent of the total decline (or about 16 percent of the decline not explained by the cycle, column 4). Similarly, supply factors can explain an additional 3 percentage points of the decline in participation (35 percent of the remaining decline). In contrast, the teen employment rate would be about 4 percentage points higher if the demand for teen labor remained at its 1985 level, and the participation rate would be about 2 percentage points higher. In total, these supply and demand factors (and the minimum wage) can \"explain\" most of the decline in the teen employment and participation rates that is unexplained by the cycle variables (80 percent of the remaining decline in teen employment, 75 percent of the remaining decline in teen participation)., 215066=Morisi, Teresa L. 2008.

The impact of low-skilled immigration on the youth labor market. Journal of Labor Economics, January 2012., 58569=The first column of table 7 shows the coefficient from a regression of teen employment rates on the share of employed adults without college experience, controlling for state and year fixed effects and a host of other controls (as indicated in the note to the table). The dependent variable and the share variable are calculated each as fractions, so the interpretation of the coefficient in column 1 is that a one percentage point increase in the share of non-college adults in teen jobs is associated with a 0.4 percentage point decrease in teen employment rates. In column 2, I instrument the share variable with the share in 1985 for each state interacted with the national average share in each year. The coefficient, though less precise, is larger in magnitude, suggesting that reverse causality is not driving the relationship (and in fact the other forms of endogeneity discussed above, such as immigrant locational choice and native out-migration may negatively bias the OLS results)., 66539=In summary, estimates from this section suggest that there is a strongly negative relationship between the share of adults in teen jobs, that this relationship is robust to the choice of time period and how the share variable is measured, and that this relationship appears as if it may be causal in nature. Based on estimates from table 7, anywhere between 1 to 9 percentage points of the 18 percentage point decline in teen employment rates between 1985 and 2010 may be explainable by these measures of adult employment in teen or lower-paying jobs. However, these estimates do not simultaneously control for supply measures; the next section puts all of the pieces together to consider the relative importance of both supply and demand in explaining recent movements in youth employment., 217173=Ruhm, Christopher. 1997. Is high school employment consumption or investment? Journal of Labor Economics 15(4)., 36772=During summer months, states that require exit exams and more credits have higher summer enrollment rates and lower teen employment rates (columns 1 and 2, panels A and B), although the coefficient on exit exam is insignificant. On average, states that provide merit aid have summer enrollment rates that are around 5 percentage points higher, and summer employment rates that are 7 percentage points lower. A 1 credit increase in the number of required core credits (equal to about half of the average increase between 1990 and 2010 across all states) is associated with a 1 percentage point increase in summer enrollment and a 1 percentage point decrease in summer employment. However, after including state fixed effects (columns 3 and 4), the negative relationship between the state policy variables and summer employment becomes insignificant; this may be because there is something fundamentally different about states that enact stricter graduation requirements or provide merit aid (i.e. a weak within-state relationship), or because it takes the state teen population a few years to adapt and fully respond to these laws.14 States that provide merit aid for college also have lower teen employment rates during the school year (columns 5 and 6), consistent with the summer results; these are also insignificant after state fixed effects are added (columns 7 and 8). In general, these education policies are positively associated with log median wages (panel C), consistent with a shift in labor supply, though these results are rarely significant., 213353=Dee, Thomas S. and Brian A.

A drought of summer jobs: Immigration and the long-term decline in employment among U.S.-born teenagers. Backgrounder, May 2010. Center for Immigration Studies. In Adam Gamoran, ed., Will No Child Left Behind Help Close the Poverty Gap? Washington, D.C.: Brookings University Press., 8479=On the other hand, labor market competition from adults also appears to have been increasing: as shown in figure 4C, the immigrant share of the population has continually risen (and comparing the red and blue lines in figure 4D, immigrant adults are more likely than native adults to work in occupations that are common among teens). Further, the fraction of native adults working in teen jobs has also increased (figure 4D). This primarily reflects the increasing importance of the service sector as a source of adult employment, which in turn may be partially related to the polarization of the U.S. labor market (Autor and Dorn 2009). Figure 5 plots the smoothed change in the share of adults employed in every percentile of the occupational distribution (ranking occupations on the x-axis by their percentile in the 1985 wage distribution), and shows that share of adults in lower paying jobs has been increasing over the last few decades. Job polarization has been well-documented in the U.S. and other developed economies (Autor 2010; Goos, Manning, and Salomons 2009), and is hypothesized by some to be caused by declining computing costs, which have reduced the costs of mechanization and automation. As a result of this technological change (as well as possibly due to increasing ease of offshoring), some have argued that relative labor demand for easily routinized and mechanized occupations has fallen (which tend to be middle-paying jobs, such as manufacturing and clerical occupations), and as a result, some of the less-educated who were in (or would be in) those occupations have been displaced into lower-paying ones. Figure 6 shows that most employed teens work in these lower-paying jobs. Hence, it is possible that polarization of the adult labor market may increase competition in the labor market of which youth are a part. To date, the polarization literature mainly describes this structural change and tests explanations for it; to my knowledge, there is no research exploring the consequences of polarization on other populations that have not experienced as dramatic polarization in labor demand themselves, but which may nonetheless be affected by polarization of the labor market for prime-aged adults., 21316=Table 1 provides a range of summary statistics for hours worked (conditional and unconditional on being employed), the fraction employed and enrolled, and four mutually exclusive categories based on employment and enrollment status. On average in 1985, males worked more, while in 2010, this gender gap flipped and now females work more (columns 1 and 2). Conditional on employment (columns 3 and 4), however, male teens have always tended to work longer per week. Confirming figure 8, on average whites tend to work more than blacks, and teens with more educated parents also tend to work more; conditional on employment, the reverse tends to be true., 34593=In addition to stricter graduation standards, one other relevant education policy is the introduction of merit scholarships for college. The most famous of these is the Hope Scholarship in Georgia, which in 1993 began provided full scholarships for in-state tuition for Georgia students with a B-average or higher in high school. Since then, an additional 10 states (mainly in the south) have enacted similar policies (see appendix table 1). APS2006 demonstrate that teen employment rates declined more over the first five years of the 2000s in states that provided merit scholarships than in other states. They suggest that this may be for two reasons. First, merit scholarships of these sorts increase the returns to high school achievement dramatically. Second, they also reduce teens' need to save for college and hence work in high school., 210966=Aaronson, Daniel, Kyung-Hong Park, and Daniel Sullivan. 2006. The decline in teen labor force participation. Economic Perspectives (2006 Q1): 2-18., 81389=This paper represents the latest and most comprehensive attempt to address these factors in combination. Based on the proxies for labor demand and supply included in this analysis, teen employment rates would be at least 3\u00bd percentage points higher in 2010 (and up to 5 percentage points higher, depending on the specification) if not for declining labor demand due to increasing competition in the low-skilled labor market (i.e. crowd out by adults). Labor supply explanations can each explain at most another 3 percentage points or so of the decline in teen employment (the contribution of supply factors are somewhat more significant for counterfactual estimates of labor force participation rates). Much of the crowd-out from adults is likely due to polarization of the adult labor market, driven by the declining costs of computerization and automation which have displaced some less-educated adult workers into service sector jobs that teens tend to do. This finding is the first evidence, to my knowledge, regarding how occupational polarization in the labor market for prime-age adults also indirectly affects other labor markets. Related questions for future research include how this trend in low-skill adult employment has affected employment outcomes and occupational choice for other traditional participants in the lower-skill, service-sector labor markets (i.e. immigrants, natives near retirement age)., 214049=Kahn, Lisa. 2010.

Except between 2008 and 2009 there are no striking declines in the average amount of time spent in work-related activities, despite the decline in employment observed in aggregate CPS data. This is possibly because the data is noisy due to small sample sizes (on average, there are a bit more than 100 observations per year). Nevertheless, between 2008 and 2009-the first year of the recession-the decline in time spent on work-related activities appears to also be associated with an increase in time spent on homework and television watching during the school year, and associated with an increase in time spent watching television and playing games during the summer., 166643=Note: Table displays regression coefficients from state-year level regressions for which the dependent variable is the labor market outcome listed in the heading for teens in the state/year (calculated for school year months only January-April and October-December).

Although this pattern is suggestive evidence that the availability of videogames itself can influence time usage, the difference in videogame usage between employed and not employed males is too small to account for the difference in time spent on work-related activities. For instance, for 15-17 year old males, the non-employed play about 25 more minutes of games per school day than the employed, about 30 percent of the difference in time spent on work-related activities., 215518=National Association of Year-round Education. Statistical Summary of YRE 2007. http://www.nayre.org/STATISTICAL%20SUMMARIES%20OF%20YRE%202007.pdf. Accessed on 8/19/2011., 70914=APS2006 show that teen employment rates fell over the 2000s more for states that provided merit aid scholarships. One interpretation of this is that there is an interaction between trends in labor demand (either cyclic or more persistent) and the ability and desire for teens to substitute time towards schooling; that is, if competition in the teen labor market increases, as it did over the 2000s, teens may be more likely to drop out of the labor force if the opportunity costs to working are greater and if the substitutes for their time (i.e. academic activities) are more attractive. To assess this further, I first estimate a time trend for teen employment in each state between 2000 and 2010. I then regress this time trend on four state characteristics, measured in 2000. To proxy for the state of labor demand for teens in 2000, I include the share of adults in teen jobs and the immigrant share of the population. To proxy for the attractiveness of academic pursuits and the willingness of the state's youth population to focus on academics, I include the fraction of teens enrolled in school during the school year (in 2000). Following APS I include the merit aid dummy as well. Column 1 includes only demand measures; teen employment actually fell less for states in which more adults were employed in teen jobs in 2000. This is consistent with the earlier findings from table 6 that showed polarization tends to be greater in areas that begin as less polarized. Column 2 includes only supply measures, and teen employment rates fell much more in areas that had higher enrollment rates or offered merit aid scholarships in 2000. Column 3 includes all measures, and the magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficients remain largely unchanged. In sum, the results from this table present suggestive evidence that declines in demand (from polarization and the cyclical relative declines in demand for teen labor due to the weak labor markets in the 2000s) may interact with state education policies that affect youths' willingness to substitute time away from work and towards academics., 18555=One other implication of declining youth labor force participation and employment is that it accounts for a disproportionate share of the recent declines in total participation and employment. Further, cohort-based models of U.S. labor force participation do a reasonably good job (at least until the mid-2000s) of explaining trends in participation for most groups, except teens (Aaronson, Fallick et. al. 2006); hence, understanding why teen employment is falling would improve the ability to forecast aggregate participation. To demonstrate the disproportionate importance of employment trends for youth, I first predict how the employment rate of 16-24 year olds would have evolved since 1990 had it responded to the business cycle (changes in the GDP gap) and changes in the adult employment-population rate as it had historically done.6 The red dotted line in Figure 8 shows this counterfactual. I aggregate this counterfactual rate with the actual employment-population rate for the 25 year olds (assuming that this rate evolved as it actually did) to get a counterfactual rate for the entire population. By the end of 2010, the counterfactual aggregate employment-population rate was about 2 percentage points above the actual, equivalent to about 40 percent of the actual decline since 1990 (for comparison, in 2010 16-24 year olds comprise about 16 percent of the population 16 and older).7, 216071=Oettinger, Gerald S. 1999. Does high school employment affect high school academic performance? Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 15(1)., 59582=In columns 3 and 4, the share variable is estimated over the entire adult population (unconditional on education). Although the coefficient is larger in magnitude, the change in the share over the sample is smaller, and the overall \"impact\" of polarization on teen employment over this period (the product of the coefficient and the actual change) is also somewhat smaller. In columns 5 and 6, share is defined as the share of non-college adults in lower paying jobs (jobs in the bottom quarter of the wage distribution in 1985), and in columns 7 and 8, the share is defined as the share of adults in retail or service jobs. These are all analogous methods of describing the impact of polarization on the lower tail of the occupational skill-distribution, and all are negatively (and significantly) associated with teen employment; as before, IV estimates are larger in magnitude, though in some cases, very imprecise.29 Finally, in columns 9 and 10, the share variable is defined as the share of adults in production or office jobs, which tend to be in the middle of the skill or wage distribution, and which lost employment share over these periods (i.e. the \"hollowing out\" of the middle, as seen in figure 5). An increase in this share is associated with an increase in teen employment, consistent with the notion of a negative relationship between the share of adults in these jobs and the share in service, retail, lower paying, or teen jobs. Given the magnitude of these coefficients and the change in the share between 1985 and 2010, and giving preference to the IV estimates, these results imply that polarization in the adult labor market can explain between 1 percentage point (column 4) to 9 percentage points (column 6) of the 18 percentage point decline in youth employment over this period. I more carefully estimate counterfactual changes in teen employment in the final section of this paper., 217812=Tyler, John H. 2003.

Standard errors clustered at the state level are in parentheses. State-year observations are weighted by the number of individuals in each cell. Teen employment rates are estimated over all months. In addition to the variables in the table each regression includes state and year fixed effects (and state time trends for the indicated columns) the share of the state/year population that is age 16-17 and the log number of 16-17 year olds. For columns 1-11 the number of observations is 1326 (50 states and DC 26 years); for columns 12-14 the number of observations is 816., 1441=Since the beginning of the recent recession, the employment-population ratio for high-school age youth (16-17 years old) has fallen by nearly a third, to its lowest level ever. However, this recession has exacerbated a longer-run downward trend that actually began in the 1990s and accelerated in the early 2000s. There is little research regarding why teen employment has fallen. Some earlier work emphasized labor supply explanations related to schooling and education, such as an increased emphasis on college preparation (Aaronson, Park, and Sullivan 2006), while others have argued that adult immigrants have crowded out teens, at least in part because adult immigrants and native teens tend to be employed in similar occupations (Sum, Garrington, and Khatiwada 2006, Camarota and Jensenius 2010, Smith 2012). This paper presents updated trends in teen employment and participation across multiple demographic characteristics, and argues that, in addition to immigration, occupational polarization in the U.S. adult labor market has resulted in increased competition for jobs that teens traditionally hold. Testing various supply and demand explanations for the decline in employment since the mid-1980s, I find that demand factors can explain at least half of the decline unexplained by the business cycle, and that supply factors can explain much of the remaining decline., 33133=Another explanation is that more states require students to pass exams to graduate high school, and the difficulty of these exams (i.e. the grade level of the material it tests) has been increasing; students who fail the test the first time often attend summer school in preparation for taking it again (Bishop and Mane 2001).12 For instance, my research into state laws (updating data from Dee and Jacob 2007) indicates that 27 states will require the class of 2011-2012 to pass some sort of exam in high school in order to graduate, up from 14 in 1990. Of these, 3 states require \"minimum competency\" exams that test material at the 9 grade level or below, while the rest require more stringent tests. (Tests have evidently become more difficult over the years; in 1990, all states that required graduation exams only tested at the 9 grade level or below.) In addition to exit exam requirements, the number of credits for high school graduation have also risen (Lillard and DeCicca 2001, Morisi 2010), which may induce students lacking in credits to attend summer school., 215360=Mroz, Thomas A. and Timothy H. Savage. 2006. The Long-term effects of youth unemployment. Journal of Human Resources, 41 (Spring):259-293., 7569=Figure 4 provides an introductory overview of these arguments. It has been noted that the fraction of teens in the CPS who report being enrolled in school during summer months has been rising dramatically since the mid-1990s (Morisi 2010), which mirrors the downward trend in employment. Indeed, figure 4A shows that by July 2010, nearly half of 16 and 17 year olds report being enrolled in July. The blue line displays the fraction who report being enrolled in June, July, and August (using matched monthly CPS microdata); roughly one-third of teens now report being enrolled in school over the summer months. This may be due to increased attendance at formal summer school or informal academic and extracurricular camps, perhaps in order to appear more attractive to colleges; indeed, college enrollment rates (as calculated from CPS microdata) have continually risen over this period (figure 4B)., 57403=These findings suggest using a Bartik-style (Bartik 1991) instrumental variable, which I construct by interacting the share of adults in teen jobs in 1985 (the start of the analysis) with a national summary measure of the share of adults in teen jobs (I use the unweighted average share across states in each year). This instrument isolates variation in the share of adults in teen jobs that comes from polarization of the adult labor market, rather than the reverse channel of falling teen employment or endogenous immigration. The relationship between the share of adults in teen jobs in a year and this instrument is very strong and negative, that is, areas that had a larger share of adult in teen jobs in 1985 experienced smaller increases in the share over the next 30 years (from a first-stage regression of the share of adults in teen jobs on this instrument, state and year fixed effects, and the host of controls listed in the bottom of table 2, the coefficient on the instrumental variable is -18.3 and the standard error is 2.4)., 211133=Aaronson, Stephanie, Bruce Fallick, Andrew Figura, Jonathan Pingle, and William Wascher. 2006.

Nevertheless, it appears that teens are substituting more formal forms of human capital (i.e. summer school and college prep) for work experience, which may mitigate some of the negative effects. This is especially true if teens were previously spending inefficiently low amounts of time on academics. Although analyses of time use data, like the one presented here, start to fill in our knowledge about what non-employed teens are doing with their extra time, bringing additional data to bear on the question, with longer sample periods and larger samples, will be valuable for describing what non-employed teens are doing with their time, how time use has changed over the years, and ultimately what the long-run ramifications may be. At the moment, we do not know enough about the returns to working while in high school (relative to the returns to alternative time uses) to make definite conclusions about welfare costs; future research might address this question by using the supply and demand shifters presented in this paper to explore how youth non-employment affects later life outcomes. At a minimum, these results are strongly suggestive that the on-going decline in teen employment is at least not entirely due to a shift in labor supply. This paper represents the",
