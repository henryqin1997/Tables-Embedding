            "We are an open campus and its right in the heart of the city of Columbia. So even though you would think that that would be a problem, USC and the city of Columbia have campus security down pack.",
            "Greek life is pretty evident on our campus. This is the South so what more do you expect than Southern belle and gentlemen on this campus. Sororities and fraternities are a great way to meet some of your college long and even life long friends. They do so many events around and off campus, it's hardly ever a dull moment. We have almost all of the most well known fraternities and sororities...so you do have options.",
            "We have over 400 student organizations on campus for you to choose from...and it's constantly growing! For every interest you can think of, there is probably a club for that here.",
            "The diversity here is pretty amazing. You get to meet people from all different walk of life. We also have the #1 international business school here, best known for our outstanding business, nursing, and engineering programs.",
            "Tiger Burn- During the week of the Carolina vs. Clemson(our biggest rival) game, the engineering students come together to build a tiger about 30 feet tall and the night before the game all the Carolina students come together to have a good time and watch the Tiger being burnt down.",
            "USC, student organizations and greek life, they all hold many events for students through out the days of the week and even in the night. When those aren't going on, Carolina productions have a calendar full of events such as; poetry nights, talent shows, concerts for well known musicians, nationally known comedians come through, Thursday through Sunday they play fairly new movies in our Russell House Theatre.",
            "Being in downtown Columbia, aside from our approx 30 options to choose from on campus, you can always go down the street to eat at the local restaurants(all of which are walking distance). There is something for every taste and many healthy options for those who are worried about the Freshman 15.",
            "For the 2013-2014, the women's quad has been shut down due to renovations. For the upcoming school year those dorms are said to be bigger and better. And looking at the past dorm renovations USC has done has been pretty awesome. Also over the next 5 years USC is expected to build a couple more dorms. I promise they never fail to disappoint with new technology installed and eco-friendly dorms.",
            "The workload here at USC is certainly not a walk in the park. The curriculum here challenges you in so many ways but that's exactly what you want from a college and it is the reason why many of our programs have been ranked the best in the nation. Also almost every teacher has more than enough office hours available if you have questions. USC offers tutoring, academic centers for excellence, and the well known Supplemental Instruction which is students who have already made an A in the class hold hours each week to assist students in any way that they can to help them grasp the material.",
            "Tips for prospective students: The best advice I can give is do your research and take campus tours. I always knew I wanted to come to Carolina but once I drove through the campus I was sold, when I first step foot on campus for my tour I was ready to graduate high school already. Also most importantly see what school has the best programs for your major since that is the main reason you are coming to college anyways. I highly encourage that you apply by the early admission deadline. You get to know your acceptance early, still have time to improve your application if you are wait listed and you get priority on your dorm rooms!",
            "University of South Carolina is a great school if you are looking for an overall college experience. I love this school because I can have teachers who are truly concerned about my academic and future endeavors to finding awesome diverse friends to hang out with and even go to the Gamecock football games (which I must say is truly an experience!). What more could you ask for?"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{585634=Carolina is all about tradition. One of our strangest, but also the tastiest, is Chicken Finger Wednesday. Also, the campus is full of beautiful historical sites, as the University was built in 1801. It has survived a number of wars and events in history, and that history is alive on campus., 816402=Classes are fairly challenging. Lectures with one professor can reach up to a ratio of 120:1, so peel out those listening ears!, 860405=For the 2013-2014, the women's quad has been shut down due to renovations. For the upcoming school year those dorms are said to be bigger and better. And looking at the past dorm renovations USC has done has been pretty awesome. Also over the next 5 years USC is expected to build a couple more dorms. I promise they never fail to disappoint with new technology installed and eco-friendly dorms., 31046=Schedule classes earlier during the day so you will be more than likely to go! I'm not saying to take all 8 o'clock classes, but the sooner in the day you go to class, the sooner you are done. Also, make sure to get a planner! There are so many assignments to keep up with. Labs for certain classes are also scheduled at a different time than lecture, so it can be easy to forget to go., 548673=The Greek Life is one of the main parts of social life at the University of South Carolina. With over 700 freshmen boys and several hundred freshmen girls trying to rush in 2012, it is readily apparent the Greek Life is very popular and highly sought after., 1069226=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 400204=USC has its own police sqaud that patrol the campus to ensure the safety of its students. Around campus are many emergency boxes that light up the area and make students feel safe. Campus security has been ramped up the past few years starting in 2012 and continues to be a top priority for USC officials., 970431=The Univeristy of South Carolina's Resident Halls are excellent! Currently being renovated is what will be known as the Women's Quad which will house many female student-residents in the coming 2014 Fall academic year. Other residental halls include the Apartment-Style Quads (West Green Quad, South Quad, & East Quad), McBryde (all Male Hall), and the Honor's College Resident Hall. Here at the university, all first-year freshman students are guarenteed housing. The Resident Mentors, 1000172=The meal plan here is frustrating to me. You have to choose a set number of meals you want to eat a week and then you receive a corresponding number of meal swipes of the card. The catch is that you have to use them all in a week otherwise the money goes to waste! The meal timing is divided into four sections. There is breakfast from about 0730-1100, lunch at 1100-1600, dinner from 1600-0000, and then something called midnight swipe from 0000-0300. You can only spend a swipe once during a meal period meaning you can't use two swipes during breakfast. Also, you can only use a meal swipe for the midnight period if you've missed a meal period during the day. For example, if I ate breakfast and dinner, but skipped lunch, I can go to an on campus restaurant that is open after midnight and spend a swipe there. The swipes are also like credit, and the credit is different for each period. This means if you buy food that costs more than the credit, you have to pay the difference somehow. You can find a list of all the restaurants on campus that use meal plan on the USC website. I would say that the selection is very good. There are fast food places like Chick-fil-a and Taco bell, dining lines similar to high school such as the Grand Market Place and Honeycomb Cafe, buffets like Bates, and even higher class eateries like Preston's. They also make a point to accommodate to every diet. You can find carnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan options at the various restaurants., 972492=The University of South Carolina is a great school. If I had to rate it on a scale of 1-10, it would definitely get a 9.5! Established in 1806, the University of South Carolina gives its students a traditional home feeling with a taste of southern hospitality!, 114805=Five points can get sketchy at night but the Vista is always super safe. Campus itself is very good about security. With the Carolina Alert system, students and parents get immediate alerts if a threat is present. Walking across the horseshoe after my last class gets out at 9:30 p.m., I always see a minimum of two to three campus police walking around.}",

Look up financial organizations because there are a lot that students don't know about. Bang for the buck Being at Carolina is really worth the money. You receive a great education and you'll never have a dull day. Am enjoying being here I love USC, GO GAMECOCKS!!!!! There is never a dull day at Carolina.
