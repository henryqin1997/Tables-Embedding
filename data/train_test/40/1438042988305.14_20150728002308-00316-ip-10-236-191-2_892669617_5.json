    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{19765=3/18/15: It is almost time for the real games to start, and for those that may have forgotten, the Kansas City Royals are the reigning American League champions. The Royals have made some moves in the offseason, including signing Casey Kotchman, who is trying to make a comeback, as well as right-handed pitcher Chris Young. Unfortunately, the team has lost pitcher Tim Collins for the entire 2015 season, as he is undergoing Tommy John surgery. The Royals will try to recreate the magic that got them to the World Series last season, though the rest of the AL Central will not be caught napping again., 19143=3/25/15: A year ago, there was very little support for the Kansas City Royals to win the American League Pennant and get to the World Series. That actually happened. Heading into the 2015 season, the sentiment is exactly the same. Sure, the Royals overachieved last season, but they did it. Now they have the experience and confidence, so they should at least be given some consideration of doing it again. The did lose ace James Shields as well as designated hitter Billy Butler and right fielder Norichika Aoki, but give this team credit where it is due. They did it last year and they can do it again., 21677=2/25/15: Royals outfielder Alex Gordon may not be long for Kansas City. He is on the roster for 2015, but has a player option for 2016 and has not committed to the Royals for that season. Gordon has been outstanding for the past few years. He has won four consecutive Gold Gloves and been named to the past two All-Star teams. If Gordon stays, he would make $12.5 million. He will be 32 before the start of the 2016 season, and may just try free agency to get one last big contract - which may be more than the Royals are inclined or able to pay., 22914=1/7/15: The Royals hope to have Alex Gordon at full health next season, unlike much of the 2014 campaign. Gordon played, for the most part but had wrist discomfort. He did miss a few games in mid-season, though. That may have shown down the stretch as his batting average dropped from .266 in regular season to .204 in the playoffs. Of course, much better pitching and being on a bigger stage could have something to do with that. Gordon had wrist surgery recently and is expected to be fully recovered in time for spring training. It will be an interesting year for Kansas City, who will try to get back to the World Series following their surprising 2014 run., 25391=10/22/14: Congratulations to the Kansas City Royals for sweeping the Baltimore Orioles in four games to advance to the World Series. The Royals have played eight games in the postseason and have won them all, including the Wild Card Game against the Oakland A's. This is the first time since 1985 that the Royals have been in the playoffs, and they won the World Series against the cross-state St. Louis Cardinals that season. KC is up against the San Francisco Giants this time, who eliminated the Cardinals last week. Games 1 and 2 are in Kansas City tonight and tomorrow (October 21 and 22) before heading out west for Games 3, 4 and 5 (if needed)., 26060=10/14/14: Game 3 of the American League Championship Series was postponed due to rain, but that still means that the Royals are up two games to none on the visiting Baltimore Orioles. Kansas City has simply been astonishing in the Major League Baseball playoffs - the first time that the Royals have been in the postseason since winning the World Series over the St. Louis Cardinals in 1985. Games 3, 4, and 5 are in Kansas City, so get to the game if you can. The way the Royals are playing, there may not even need to be a trip back to Baltimore.}",
