            "Sporting Kansas City: Montr\u00e9al is bad, but when you remember how the Impact performed in places like Dallas and Philadelphia, you get a greater appreciation for Sporting\u2019s 4-0 win. Yes, you expect the league\u2019s best team to clean against on the league\u2019s worst. That Sporting did only confirms the fact that they deserve this list\u2019s top spot. (3-1-2)",
            "Real Salt Lake: RSL was the target of a frustrated, focused Portland team, yet they still managed to get full points. Thanks to Ned Grabavoy\u2019s late winner, Real Salt Lake got back into the in column, maintaining the league\u2019s only unbeaten record in the process. (3-0-4)",
            "Seattle Sounders: Seattle\u2019s three-game road swing ends with seven points and the Clint Dempsey-Obafemi Martins partnership looking unstoppable. This clearly isn\u2019t the same team that lost last month to Toronto and Columbus. The Sounders have \u201cgelled.\u201d They\u2019ve improved. They\u2019ve passed the teams that handed them their early losses. (4-2-1)",
            "LA Galaxy: A come-from-ahead draw on the road isn\u2019t something that usually results in a two-spot climb (especially at this place on the chart), but the Galaxy were the better team on Saturday. In light of the Eastern Conference correction and what we know from LA\u2019s two meetings with RSL, this seems right. Though they\u2019ll need Landon Donovan to get going to be firing on all cylinders, the Galaxy are getting close. (2-1-2)",
            "FC Dallas: Coming off their loss to Seattle, Saturday\u2019s was a welcome rebound, particularly considering the quality of their opposition. Though Toronto\u2019s conservative approach played into the result, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine other teams being forced to settle for a draw. Thanks to Dallas\u2019s continued set piece mastery, \u00d3scar Pareja\u2019s team stayed at the top of the Western Conference. (5-1-1)",
            "Toronto FC: A one-goal loss at Dallas would normally be forgiven, but it\u2019s become pretty obvious Toronto has a serious flaw \u2013 one that severely hurts the team by our \u2018one game, neutral site\u2019 standard. Ryan Nelsen is far too conservative, an approach that too often leaves his team within one goal of dropping points. Toronto has to at least try to win these games. Come the last 20 minutes, they\u2019re just holding out, something that\u2019s produced a the team\u2019s first losing streak of the season. (3-3-0)",
            "Columbus Crew: In weeks\u2019 past, we\u2019ve talked about apportioning blame and credit: decide what led to the result; hand out blame proportionately; don\u2019t just blindly hurt one side and promote another. In Saturday\u2019s 1-1 in Columbus, D.C. offered the same, limited, opportunistic approach we saw against New England and New York. The surprise was Columbus\u2019s inability to overcome it. (3-1-2)",
            "Colorado Rapids: The game was boring, Colorado should have expected more, but there also wasn\u2019t any reason to think our impression of the Rapids needs to chance. San Jose is a better team than people are giving them credit for, and while Pablo Mastroeni should have still found a way to get full points at home, the inability to do so is less reason for concern than a slight down day.(3-1-2)",
            "Vancouver Whitecaps: The Whitecaps weren\u2019t great on Saturday, arguably performing worse than they did in their previous week\u2019s trip to Carson, Calif., yet Carl Robinson\u2019s team still found a way to take a point. That, however, isn\u2019t the reason why they\u2019ve climbed this week. This ranking is more a result of Philadelphia\u2019s fall than Vancouver improving. (2-2-3)",
            "New England Revolution: The Revolution failed to inspire at Chicago and shouldn\u2019t have had their chance to steal it late. But that\u2019s the current state of the Fire, and with Chris Tierney\u2019s late chance from close range, the Revolution nearly got three points in Bridgeview. That they didn\u2019t means Saturday\u2019s game felt like a bad performance, but compared to the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the teams below them, the Revolution deserve this spot. (2-3-2)",
            "Houston Dynamo: The Dynamo had a strong first half on Saturday, one that lends credence to the idea their New England performance was a fluke. In the second half, however, Houston gave up two good chances that should have cost them the game. They move up, but only because the Union fall. (2-3-1)",
            "Philadelphia Union: The Union have the pieces to reclaim a higher spot on this list, but until those pieces start performing like they did in the season\u2019s first few weeks, Philly\u2019s place is in the bottom half of this list. John Hackworth\u2019s team was completely outplayed last Wednesday by New York \u2013 one of the league\u2019s worst teams over the first month-and-a-half. (1-1-5)",
            "San Jose Earthquakes: People are starting to take shots at San Jose, but those shots ignore a difficult opening schedule. This team is hard to watch and seems to have inspired some resentment from the rest of the league\u2019s fans, but they\u2019re not that bad, in a competitive sense. They\u2019ve drawn three teams above them on this list. (0-2-3)",
            "Chicago Fire: Same as last week: played better than their opponents; found a way to draw; just need to stop making defensive mistakes. This week, it was Patrick Nyarko taking down Kevin Alston in the box. Converting late penalties would help, too, but until Chicago actually starts playing bad (which, it\u2019s not dong now), there\u2019s no reason for alarm. (0-1-6)",
            "Portland Timbers: Remember the standard here: Who wins a neutral site game tomorrow. After watching the Timbers at Rio Tinto on Saturday, can you honestly say they wouldn\u2019t beat the teams below them on this list? They\u2019d probably beat some of the teams above them, too, but given their inability to break into the win column, we\u2019ll stay conservative. Portland is improving, though. (0-3-4)",
            "D.C. United: Unbeaten in four, D.C. United have proven more dangerous (or, less self-destructive) than last year. Still, the team\u2019s progress has been as much about opponents\u2019 struggles as their own successes. The actual games show a team that\u2019s still very limited and likely enjoying an uncharacteristic string of results. Now it\u2019s up to Ben Olsen to turn this run into something sustainable. (2-2-2)",
            "New York Red Bulls: It would have been nice for Philadelphia to come back strong on Saturday and show New York\u2019s first win of the season wasn\u2019t just them taking advantage of struggling team traveling (albeit at a short distance) on a quick turnaround. Regardless, the Red Bulls are still in the win column, quickly rebuking the notion they are \u201cthe worst team in Major League Soccer\u201d (as we called them last week). (1-2-4)",
            "Chivas USA: Chivas doesn\u2019t seem this bad, but as teams like New York and D.C. make progress, the Goats are finding ways to lose at home. There\u2019s a pretty big gap between them and 19th place Montr\u00e9al, but Wilmer Cabrera\u2019s team needs to recapture some of its early-season confidence if it\u2019s to climb back up this chart. (1-3-3)",
            "Montr\u00e9al Impact: Not only is this team really bad, but they have no fight. The expressions, body language, results during that last 20 minutes in Kansas City gave the impression this is more than a slow start. The Impact have no identity, no direction, and seem without potential solutions. Maybe, having hit rock bottom, there\u2019ll be an awakening in the squad, but if the teamy can\u2019t show more this week against visiting Philadelphia, it\u2019ll be time to consider a major shakeup.

    "textBeforeTable": "(MORE:\u00a0Player of the Week\u00a0|\u00a0Team of the Week\u00a0|\u00a0Week 6\u00a0Power Rankings) But this isn\u2019t another Power Rankings manifesto, though it does seem to devolving into that\u00a0every week. This is about our thoughts on the league after seven\u00a0weeks. Here\u2019s who\u00a0we see as\u00a0Major League Soccer\u2019s strongest , right now: Power Rankings don\u2019t need to be about anything, but if you\u2019re going to do them, let them\u00a0be about\u00a0all the data points that inform a team\u2019s current quality. They should be about what this week\u2019s games tell the author\u00a0about the whole picture, if they\u00a0can be about anything at all. But a team\u2019s spot in the league\u2019s pecking order is about more than how it performed last weekend; more than whatever biases the author\u00a0carried into the previous ranking. It\u2019s about what the latest results tell us about our previous assumptions. It\u2019s about context. It\u2019s about continuously learning and letting that education come across in the order. Those connections also hint at a problem Power Rankings have brought upon themselves. The process, already a curious one, is typically defined as moving teams up or down from the previous ranking (or, just the standings). Team wins? Move it up a little. Win big? Move it up a lot.\u00a0These Power Rankings really aren\u2019t that hard, ya\u2019 know. It\u2019s a natural correction,",
