Trivia A Nickname for Tepig Debut Simisear is Chili's only known Pok\u00e9mon that first appeared as a Pansear. Along with being his main Pok\u00e9mon, Simisear assists Chili and his brothers in the kitchen by boiling water for tea. It, as a Pansear, was used against Black, Cheren, and Bianca in a Gym battle. Despite proving powerful, Pansear was defeated by a water-soaked scalchop and was the only one to be knocked out. This loss causes the challengers to win with 3 to 2 after the time limit expired. Later, it was used to battle the Shadow Triad in a Triple battle. Although the battle was tough, Pansear was given a Fire Stone, enabling it to evolve into a Simisear to become stronger.
