Most MMP's are secreted as inactive proproteins which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. The protein encoded by this gene is considered a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily. However, this protein is unique among the MT-MMP's in that it is a GPI-anchored protein rather than a transmembrane protein. The protein activates MMP-2 by cleavage. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]}",
