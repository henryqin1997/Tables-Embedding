            "While I don't live the Greek Life, everyone I've ever heard has said it is really in a class of its own. I remember seeing in a magazine (can't recall the name) the top ten schools for Greek Life. UM wasn't on the list. However, tun the page and they had their own article saying they were so far above the others, the editors felt it would be an understatement to put Ole Miss as #1 on the list.",
            "All accounting majors are welcome.",
            "There is The Square which is actually a big circle, however it's not on campus. It has nice smaller shops if you can afford them.",
            "If you like to play sports, there is a rec center that has everything one could wish for. Other than that, people like to walk around the square (which is actually a circle??). If you like to listen to live music, the school has concerts occasionally, and there are small venues in the area more Indie bands play at on occasion.",
            "It's the South: dining can't be bad. But seriously, there are places to eat for every taste. Even the main cafeteria (JC) is very diverse and consistently offers great food for everyone.",
            "Living on campus is pretty good, but not stellar. There are a lot of activities to do on campus (e.g. a rec-center with everything one could wish for), and there are some nice eats on campus. The town is very slow-paced, therefore, there are not a lot of activities to do off campus.",
            "Accounting classes are not for the faint-hearted. All classes and test require one to think critically and thoroughly understand all real world concepts. However, the 4/5 rating is because the lack of refinement in so many non-accounting courses. The marketing program is a joke.",
            "If you are considering accounting, this is THE school to go to. If you are considering another program, I recommend looking at other students' reviews of the classes before signing. There are both stellar teachers and programs as well as teachers and programs that really shouldn't be a part of any university.",
            "UM is the best accounting school I've ever looked at or heard of. The outreach campuses are also great options for students that live in the area and want smaller classes. However, the marketing program at the university is severely lacking in good teachers and innovative material."

The union is gross but the new Grill @ 1810 is wonderful., 422710=Basketball, football, softball, track/field, and more. Also, they have intramural sports as well. I do not know much about the clubs. Since, in this upcoming August this will be my freshman year., 175017=Great academics, legendary for social activities, and winner of most beautiful campus 2011. I can attest to all of these., 96932=rather big here. this year, the sororities had nearly 2000 girls rush. i suggest doing it because it is an experience, even if you decide not to join an organization., 192240=The Univeristy of Mississippi has a beautiful, very inviting campus. Everyone is welcoming, and I can not wait to attend! I am enrolled in the Honors College and can not wait to enjoy the experience in August, which I have heard is wonderful., 172329=The James Meredith statue celebrating the official integration of Ole Miss in 1962. It is also possible to walk in the underground tunnels that he had to walk in to get to class without being attacked. There's also the grove, which is infamous for tailgating and was ranked #1 in a national magazine. http://zing.olemiss.edu/national-magazine-ranks-um-no-1-for-college-tailgating/, 213436=I lived in the Residential College my Freshman year. This was the best possible dorm on campus. I did not have to share a room and only had to share my bathroom with one other person. There was a cafeteria, a gym, and a full-service kitchen available to me at all times. There are several types of rooms, including the typical 2-person dorm room with one bathroom, a 2-bedroom suite with 2 bedrooms and one bathroom, and a quad-suite containing 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a common area. The only down-side is the cost of the residential college. It was at least $1,000 extra a semester. You also have to obtain a minimum GPA of approximately 3.0. The traditional dorms on campus are double-occupancy with a communal bathroom on each floor. The majority of them are fairly old, but are very clean and kept up. There are two new dorms being built now. They should be available in the Fall of 2012. This is the beginning of an all-around renovation of the older buildings on campus. All of the dorms have multiple RA's on each floor that are ready and willing to assist you in any issue you may have--from being locked out to more personal issues. The RHA (Resident Housing Association) also hosts multiple events throughout the year to give students the opportunity to not only meet the people in their dorm, but to socialize with other students living on campus. Did I mention that they give free food and T-shirts at these events?! Overall, Ole Miss' Dorm life is very good. The majority of the students that live on campus enjoy it due to the accessibility as well as the affordability. Living off of campus in Oxford is very expensive due to the high-cost of rent, utlilties and gas to get to and from campus., 127772=Dorm life, in my case, is fun. The dorm I reside in is co-residential and it gives an awesome experience for freshman. The Residential College and the Luckyday Residential College are also co-residential and also some of the newest dorms here on campus since about 2007. Some of the other dorms are not co-residential, but are still up to par even though they are not as new. In July 2012, the new dorms being built will be ready for the new incoming freshman. They are in for very nice complexes., 224784=If you are an upcoming Freshman, I highly recommend the Summer Program in July. It is awesome and it allows you to take a couple classes while getting acclimated on campus and meeting other new students. It made the transition to college life in the fall so much easier!, 455599=I can't wait to attend I think this may be the best kept secret in Higher ED People make fun of the Admissions process but they are too stupid to know the they are controlled by the 1968 Federal Civil Rights Act so they are forced to be Liberal in there Admission standards but only the Brightest and Coolest really succeed. Are you Brave enough to Put Yourself to the TEST Most Beautiful Campus Sexiest Ladies Strongest and Top Notch Greek System in the Country And on top of that you get a really great education!, 538562=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 88191=Call admissions often! I applied in August but didn't get accepted because they lost my application! The application fee was processed, but they had no idea who I was. Because of this I didn't get accepted until late, and I missed all of my opportunities to apply for University Scholarships, 448=looking for a small school education, and a big school weekend atmosphere. the student teacher ratio, 17:1, is the size of Rhodes or Vanderbilt. The Grove on game day is the #1 place to tailgate, and you cant get that anywhere else. go visit! go rebs!, 142138=The Johnson Commons food is okay, but easily becomes tiresome. There are a variety of food options in the Student Union and more, such as a Papa John's, are slated to open in the Fall 2012 semester.}",

    "textAfterTable": "The University of Mississippi is a unique, close-knit environment. It is a small campus, so everything is nearby. Even if your late for class, it will only be 2 minutes late! Don't underestimate the campus though. It has ALOT to offer. They have squeezed SO much important useful things in the small acreage is rests upon, it will take you your entire 4 years to discover what all it has to offer... and then some! Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to ask you teachers questions, thats what they are their for, but that goes for every university. For Ole Miss, be apart! Get out there! Go to football games! Drag a friend along, even if you didn't finish your home work. All ways make time to see them rebels play! Also, consider going greek and joining a panhellenic fraternity or sorrority! Ole Miss has some of the most acclaimed greek societies in the country! Bang for the buck Oh yes! Ole Miss is one of the most ecnomical state universities in the US. Definitely consider The University of Mississippi for that. All of my teachers have gone out of their way to be certain that I was gaining, and was equipped with all of the tools and information I needed to make my learning experience the best possible. Am",
