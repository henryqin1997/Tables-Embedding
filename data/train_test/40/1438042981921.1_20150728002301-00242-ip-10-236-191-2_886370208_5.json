Will enjoy being here i feel that i will definitely enjoy my time at maui community college. the scenery as well as campus are both beautiful and the beaches are only minutes away. it also allows me to become independent but know that im not far away from my relatives. Will learn a lot from studying this college, ive found it to be a great match to what im looking for. the classes are relatively small and there are many places on-campus that i can find help. after reading some reviews of instructors, i seen that they use different tools to help students understand the course.
