Net sales of firearms for the quarter were $127.4 million, a 34-percent increase compared to the quarter ending March 31, 2011. According to data from Southwick Associates (see below), Ruger has dominated handgun sales for the first four months of 2012. Southwick data shows Ruger as the top-selling handgun brand in 2009, 2010 and 2011., 370=In 2011, the top importers were: \u2022 Brazil: 830,302 (+22%) \u2022 Austria: 520,851 (+25%) \u2022 Germany: 302,924 (+15%). Roxanne Smith contributed significantly to the production of this report., 11235=Posted in Firearms Production | Comments Off on U.S. Firearms Industry Today 2012, 6744=Even if you took away the continuing Obama Factor \u2014 fear of what the president may do if reelected \u2014 the market would be healthy. That said, the Obama Factor has had another positive element, which has helped the cultural resurgence of firearms. The president has effectively muzzled the anti-gun movement since 2009, while promising, \u201cWe are working on it.\u201d The lack of near-daily diatribes from the anti-gun movement has provided an opportunity for the industry and gun owners to tell their story. Even the president\u2019s begrudging admission that the Second Amendment guarantees the right of citizens to own firearms helped provide an opportunity for the truth to emerge. Playing a major role in getting that truth out is NSSF, which has firmly established itself as the voice of the industry. That has been key to getting the industry story told \u2014 including recent data on impressive hiring by industry companies. NSSF\u2019s near-instant reaction to anti-firearm business legislation and initiatives, and their consumer information programs and better-business projects \u2014 all have a major impact., 1435=2010 U.S. Production, 4718=Also notable is the number of background checks conducted in December 2011, the largest number in any one month in the history of NICS, which began in 2008. NICS conducted 1,410,937 (NSSF adjusted) background checks in December 2011, a 25-percent increase over December 2010., 8378=Yet, all those firearms purchased after the presidential election of 2008 have played a key role in today\u2019s renaissance. Then, driven by the fear that the new president would ban certain firearms, many seasoned gun owners and even more first-time buyers, swarmed gun stores to purchase firearms, primarily \u201cblack rifles.\u201d However, most of those firearms were locked away, untouched, unfired., 3202=According to the \u201cATF\u2019s 2010 Annual Firearms Manufacturing and Export Report\u201d \u2014 the latest data available from the agency \u2014 U.S. manufacturers produced 5,391,311 firearms, a decrease of less than 1 percent from 2009. Such a slight decrease is impressive, given the significant increase (29%) in manufacturing in 2009, which was the first year the industry produced more than 5-million firearms since 1994. The largest drop in 2010 production was in rifles, with a decrease of 19 percent from 2010. Handgun production continued to climb in 2010, with a 17-percent increase over 2009, this following a 33-percent jump in 2009 over 2008., 9639=By Russ Thurman From The July 2012 Issue Of Shooting Industry, 4211=On May 21, Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. reported preliminary net sales for the fourth quarter ending April 30 were approximately $129 million, an increase of approximately $28 million, or 28 percent, compared to the same quarter last year., 5180=In May, NICS conducted 840,412 background checks (NSSF adjusted), reflecting a 20.6-percent increase over May 2010. This marks the 24th straight month that the number of background checks have increased, compared to the same months of the previous two years. NSSF reports that their adjusted NICS data shows increases for 2012, compared to 2011, in January: 17.3 percent, February: 31.4 percent, March: 20 percent and April: 10.5 percent., 1380=The top U.S. firearms manufacturers in 2010 were: \u2022 Ruger: 903,968 (-3%) \u2022 Smith & Wesson: 681,834 (+2%) \u2022 Remington Arms: 555,794 (-9%)., 3447=Remington, Southwick reports, is dominating rifle and shotguns sales for 2012, a trend begun in 2009, with Mossberg tying Remington for the best-selling shotgun brand in 2010., 2550=Ruger was the number one U.S. fire arms manufacturer in 2010, outpacing all other U.S. firearm manufacturers by an impressive margin. This was the third year in a row that Ruger achieved the top ranking. In 2010, Ruger manufactured 903,968 firearms, a drop of 3 percent from 2009, when the company increased its production by 56-percent over 2008. For 2010, Ruger ranked number one in handgun production, with 665,954 units, a 16-percent increase over 2009 when the company\u2019s handgun production jumped 70 percent. In foreign trade, U.S. exports in 2010 increased 21 percent, a welcome turnaround after an 18-percent decrease in 2009 (see page 44). Mossberg/Maverick Arms was the top U.S. firearms exporter with 48,696 units exported, an 8-percent jump over 2009. U.S. imports decreased 22.8 percent in 2010 (see pages 46, 48, 49), with 2,508,888 firearms imported. In 2011, they rebounded with 2,992,982 units imported, a 19-percent increase over 2010. Brazil continues to dominate firearm imports, with 679,350 units imported in 2010, and 830,302 in 2011, a 22-percent increase., 8793=To buy a gun for personal defense \u2014 yes, that factor is still very high. Consumers get that; they\u2019re very serious about the protection factor. Concerns about how the present administration, if reelected, will attack firearms \u2014 yes, that\u2019s still in play. However, it doesn\u2019t stir the hearts of gun owners like it did in 2008 and 2009, and the \u201cObama Factor\u201d is not driving most firearm sales today., 4425=For the first quarter of 2012, Ruger reported net sales of $112.3 million, an increase of 49 percent, compared to the same quarter in 2011, along with corresponding earnings that \u201cnearly doubled.\u201d}",
