The full import is required to bring the OU, FIMObjects, which is used as a target for the sample objects, into the connector space. The full synchronization is required because the synchronization rules changed when the new synchronization rules were projected from the FIM 2010 R2 connector space into the metaverse., 36540=In FIM 2010, open the Synchronization Service Manager, and on the Tools menu, click Management Agents., 23501=Applies To: Forefront Identity Manager 2010, 53165=In FIM 2010, open the Synchronization Service Manager and on the Tools menu, click Management Agents., 98076=To open the Administration page in the FIM 2010 R2 Portal, click Administration, and then click Synchronization Rules., 69217=For the scenario in this document, you complete the following configuration steps in the FIM 2010 R2 Service:, 39202=The Fabrikam FIMMA is a management agent for FIM 2010 R2 Service management agent. To create this management agent, you use the Create Management Agent Wizard., 25132=A description of how to set up FIM 2010 and AD\u00a0DS is out of the scope of this document., 92076=To open the FIM 2010 R2 Portal, start Windows Internet Explorer\u00ae, and then navigate to http://localhost/identitymanagement/default.aspx., 127400=Log on to the FIM 2010 R2 Portal as an administrator., 60133=In FIM 2010, open Synchronization Service Manager and on the Tools menu, click Management Agents., 89930=To open the Workflows page, on the FIM 2010 R2 Portal home page, in the Management Policy Rules section of the navigation bar, click Workflows., 41585=In FIM 2010, open Synchronization Service Manager, and on the Tools menu, click Management Agents., 128588=After you synchronize the HR data to FIM 2010 R2, you can now also synchronize these objects to AD\u00a0DS. To synchronize the scenario objects to AD\u00a0DS, you run the run profiles in the following table., 109250=The FTE Applications security group is required to group FTEs. To create the FTE Applications security group in the FIM 2010 R2 Portal, you use the related wizard pages., 23465=Updated: April 5, 2010, 126800=As a result of a successful synchronization cycle, the objects from the HR data file are populated in the FIM 2010 R2 data store. In addition to this, Terry Adams and Jimmy Bischoff became members of the FTE Applications security group and Lola Jacobsen became a member of the Contractors Applications security group. You should verify the group membership of these objects in both FIM 2010 R2 security groups., 26456=Fabrikam, a fictitious company, is investigating how to deploy and maintain the management of security and distribution groups. After working through the Declarative Provisioning scenario, Fabrikam has determined that FIM 2010 provides the required functionality for its users. However, it still must evaluate the functionality provided by FIM 2010 with regard to group scenarios. The decision was made to deploy a simple scenario in the corporate lab environment. The objective of this lab is to test the following essential requirement:, 69955=For the scenario in this document, you enable some of the preconfigured MPRs in FIM 2010. Enabling these MPRs is required to grant the synchronization account access to the components that are required to synchronize the identity data for this scenario., 124436=To synchronize the HR objects to FIM 2010 R2, you run the run profile sequence, as shown in the following table., 71962=The objective of the HR inbound synchronization rule is to populate the HR data objects in FIM 2010 R2. To configure the HR inbound synchronization rule, you use the related wizard pages., 104587=To open the Workflows page, on the FIM 2010 R2 Portal home page, in the Management Policy Rules section of the navigation bar, click Workflows., 24953=For an overview of FIM 2010 documentation and guidance for using it, see the Documentation Roadmap., 79066=So that the scenario users can access the portal, the account, and the domain, the security identifier (SID) attributes must be populated on a FIM 2010 R2 user object. The domain and the SID attribute are contributed by Active\u00a0Directory Domain Services (AD\u00a0DS). This is why the synchronization rule that is used to manage the user objects in this scenario is a combination of an inbound synchronization rule and an outbound synchronization rule., 94840=On the FIM 2010 R2 Portal home page, on the navigation bar, click Management Policy Rules to open the Management Policy Rules page., 28359=The scenario outlined in this document has been developed and tested on a stand-alone computer. On this computer, FIM 2010 is already deployed and the computer is configured to be a domain controller for the Active\u00a0Directory forest Fabrikam.com. The name of this domain controller is FabrikamDC1. The following illustration shows the forest configuration., 77762=Active\u00a0Directory users in this scenario originate in the HR data file. This creates an outbound-facing object and attribute flow from the metaverse to the Active\u00a0Directory connector space. For an outbound-facing synchronization operation, you link an outbound synchronization rule to all affected objects. In FIM 2010 R2, workflows are used to add or remove managed objects from the scope of an outbound synchronization rule. A third component, an MPR, is required to determine when a workflow must be activated. The combination of an outbound synchronization rule, a workflow, and an MPR that is used to add or remove a managed object from the scope of an outbound synchronization rule is also known as a synchronization configuration triple., 123526=To test the configuration, you will publish the objects from your HR data file to FIM 2010 R2 and then to AD\u00a0DS. As a result of the synchronization cycle to FIM 2010 R2, the group membership is updated, and the new users and the updated group membership are published in AD\u00a0DS. After that, you will log on as Terry Adams and create a distribution list (DL). Next, you will log in as Lola Jacobsen and try to create a DL. This attempt should fail. Complete the following steps to test the configuration:, 66607=In FIM 2010, open Synchronization Service Manager, and, on the Tools menu, click Management Agents., 68075=The scenario in this document takes advantage of the new declarative provisioning feature to implement the object and attribute flow between the connected data sources. To enable declarative provisioning, enable synchronization rule processing in the FIM 2010 R2 Synchronization Service Manager., 106597=To open the Management Policy Rules page, on the FIM 2010 R2 Portal home page, in the navigation bar, click Management Policy Rules., 109625=To open the Security Groups page, on the FIM 2010 R2 Portal home page, in the navigation bar, click Security Groups., 25353=This guide is intended for IT professionals who are interested in learning about the new security group management features in FIM 2010., 23618=The management of security and distribution groups is a basic task in a directory. Microsoft\u00ae Forefront\u00ae Identity Manager\u00a0(FIM) 2010 introduces new features that simplify this task significantly. This document shows how you can use FIM 2010 to manage security and distribution groups in your environment., 125525=After you complete the run profile sequence, you verify that the users are created in FIM 2010 R2 and that the membership in the security groups that are part of the scenario in this document has been updated., 111549=The Contractors Applications security group is required to group contractors. To create the Contractors Applications security group in the FIM 2010 R2 Portal, you use the related wizard pages., 34854=To configure the FIM 2010 R2 Synchronization Service, you perform the following steps:, 70374=On the FIM 2010 R2 Portal home page, in the navigation bar, click Management Policy Rules to open the Management Policy Rules page., 120698=During the initialization of the management agent, the two configured synchronization rules were brought into the metaverse. Because the sample HR data source is authoritative for certain attributes, the attribute flow precedence must be adjusted for the attributes that were contributed by this management agent to make sure that these attributes can flow into the metaverse and later into the FIM 2010 R2 data store.}",
