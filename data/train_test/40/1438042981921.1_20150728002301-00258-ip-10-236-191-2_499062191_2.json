We retained the stock 327's Power Pak iron cylinder heads, opting for a previously owned Performer intake manifold we found at the swap meet for $35. Rather than blasting it, we just doused it with carb cleaner and painted it light silver to give the manifold a different look. The glitter comes via a simple Summit chrome dress-up kit that includes valve covers, a timing chain cover, a 14-inch chrome air cleaner, a chrome pointer, one breather, and some gaskets. We spent a few more bucks on a shiny 100-amp alternator and added some aluminum pulleys and a slick Summit alternator mount. Adding a small Holley 600-cfm carb and a used set of swap meet shorty headers completed our simple small-block makeover. We chose three completely different styles for our split personality Mouse. The first is what we're calling Small-Block Basic, where we exercised restraint, approaching this from a budget standpoint",
    "textAfterTable": "Dupli-Color MetalCast Silver MC100 Summit Racing 7.95 Spectre water pump pulley shims 4480 Summit Racing 6.95 Street/Strip Package It was now time to step up our game. Jeff Latimer at Jim Grubbs Motorsports likes to build high-winding 331ci, small-journal small-blocks, which gave us the inspiration to bolt on a Summit combo tunnel-ram and some big-tube headers and tall valve covers to give our small-block that racer look. Did you spot our other subtle swap? Yep, we dumped those two-barrel 327 heads for a set of big-valve 492 castings. This approach still has a budget flavor because the tunnel-ram package from Summit delivers a pair of 600-cfm vacuum-secondary carburetors and the Weiand tunnel-ram intake, plus linkage all for less than $850. 9/17 Velocity stack air cleaners are like Mouse motor elevator shoes. We decided to reuse the stock thermostat housing, painted orange for a little contrast. We retained the accessory drive from the basic kit and added a set of Made For You plus wire looms.
