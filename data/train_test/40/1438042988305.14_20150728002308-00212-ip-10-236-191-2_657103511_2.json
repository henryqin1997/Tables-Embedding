            "Great shipment and good communication. Got 2 bottles very special to me and my wife and I Very much look forward to opening them!",
            "For the April Growler Swap, Sebasian sent me a growler of Dragoon IPA and added an extra of Citra Saison home brew. Thanks dude!",
            "In growler swap of doom, Sebastian hooked me up with a cool sounding Saison from Dragoon\u0092s, E. River Collaboration and tosses in a bonus bottle of Santa Fe Wild 3. Thanks again man, can\u0092t wait to try these out!",
            "Great trade with Sebastian. He hooked me up with some long sought after sours in return for a bunch of sours on my end. Communication was top notch and shipping quick. Couldn\u0092t ask for a better trade.",
            "For the June 2012 growler swap, Sebastian sent me a Dragoon IPA. Bomb proof packaging. Awesome Thanks!",
            "Super easy trade. Bulletproof packaging and great communication. Highly recommended.",
            "Great muling for this man, took great care of me , and makes a mean home brew.",
            "Quick and easy trade with Sebastian. We exchanged a couple of beermails during the day, had the boxes packed up that night and moving the next day. Great communication, and the fastest trade I think I\u0092ve ever completed.",
            "Sebastian helped me with two very difficult to find SN Bigfoot vintages and has put me just one bottle away from completing a 20yr vertical by 2013. Great packaging and really willing to help me out! Thanks!"
