There has been a push within the industry to create shorter radiused drilling. The definition of what constitutes a \"short radius\" is constantly been redefined. U.S. Pat. No. 4,442,908 which issued to the Preussag Aktiengeselischaft firm of Germany in 1984 describes what is entitled a \"Tool for Drilling Curved Sections of Well Holes\". In the description of prior contained in the Preussag patent the following comment is made regarding the radii of curvature available at that time;, 16970=\"the radii of curvature are relatively large, so that deviations of, say, 90 degrees are attainable only by traversing vertical depths on the order of 600 to 1000 meters.\", 17440=In 1992 Eastman Christensen issued a brochure describing their long radius, medium radius and short radius, horizontal drilling systems. This brochure maintained that their short radius system \"can turn a well from vertical to horizontal in 30-60 feet along radii of 20-40 feet\". The approach taken by Eastman Christensen appears to be similar to that proposed in the Preussag patent. A \"flexible drive pipe\" is described and illustrated. This flexible drive pipe appears to consist of a series of generally-tubular individual link members pivotally connected to each other.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that modifications may be made to the illustrated embodiment without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter defined in the claims. The use and operation of articulated swivel union 10 will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1 through 3. Referring to FIG. 3, it will be noted how a number of articulated swivel unions 10 can be incorporated as part of a motor drive assembly, generally identified by reference numeral 82 secured to a drill string 83. Referring to FIG. 1, it will in particular be noted how a drive shaft 84 can be accommodated through both interior bore 22 of first tubular member 12 and interior bore 46 of second tubular member 36. Referring to FIG. 3, drive shaft 84 is necessary to couple drive components 86 of drive assembly 82 disposed on either side of articulated swivel union 10. Referring to FIG. 2, balls 74 disposed in pockets 34 and 72 couple first tubular member 12 and second tubular member 36 so that they rotate together with drill string 83. Referring to FIG. 1, when a rotational force is exerted upon articulated swivel union 10 in a bent position, that movement is accommodated by movement of bulbous first end 14 of first tubular member 12 within socket 58. Referring to FIG. 1, articulated swivel union 10 is assembled",
