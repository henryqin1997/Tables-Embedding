FAM is a blend of 50% toluol, 30% isooctane, 15% isobutene, 5% ethanol. The fuel which has permeated through the wall of piping 5 enters enclosure 8 and is then conveyed over activated carbon filter 7 in the carrier circuit 6 by 100 ml/min of nitrogen, and its weight after 300 hours is determined. The apparatus also comprises a carrier circuit 6 which is connected to both ends of the length of piping 5 to be tested. The carrier circuit 6 is guided through an arrangement 7 of activated carbon filters. The",
