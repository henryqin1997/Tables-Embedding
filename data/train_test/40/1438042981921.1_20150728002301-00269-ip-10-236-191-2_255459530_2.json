    "textAfterTable": "Directions Soak rice for 4 to 5 hours only. Soak all the dals together for 2 hours only . Grind Rice, Dals, red chillies, together. The dough should be coarse(dals should be half grinded). Note : The dough should not be watery. It should be thicker than a normal DOSAI dough. Mix grated Coconut, Onion, Curry Leaves, Salt and Turmeric Powder to the dough. Heat Tawa. Grease Tawa with little oil. Pour the dough in the Tawa. Make a round shape. Make a hole in the center and another 5 holes a little distance from the center. Pour Oil in each hole and on the adai to make it crispy. Wait till it is golden reddish brown in colour and turn it. Again pour oil in each hole and little on top of adai also. Serve with little butter on top while Adai is hot. The adais crispness depends on the length of the time on the tawa and can be made according to taste. About Recipe Recipe Tips",
