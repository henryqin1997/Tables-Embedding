            "Musical. If you love playing, singing, making, or listening to music. This will be your paradise. You'll find friends the first week and participate in multiple jam sessions a week with several different people.",
            "Cafeteria food is terrible, but I've heard it has gotten better. Prepare yourself for a dry and cigarette free campus.",
            "The degree from Belmont is worth the cost.",
            "The people make the school worth it. The school board doesn't completely care about current students. It is tough to get your voice heard for them to change their policies. The teachers are fun and completely care about their students. They will know if you miss class and are understanding. Music is all over campus, which is amazing.",
            "The classes are challenging, but the teachers and students are extremely helpful. Classes are incredibly small so teachers have the time for one-on-on attention. Some classes are a joke, but most are challenging and you will leave with a lot of information."

Thankfully, you can't usually hear it in your dorm room., 366995=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 338315=Depending on your situation, the most accessible source of food is the cafeteria and though it may not be the best at times, it is the best choice due to your meal plan than spending seven to ten dollars eating out. For the year 2014-2015 there will be a new dining hall and other food places being opened to the students which expands the variety of food offered to them., 129606=the dorm life is strict but fair. the students have a curfew of 11:00 pm or weekdays and 1:00 am on weekends. the opposite sex has to sign in at the front desk to go to the other persons room. this system is very safe and allows the students to get their school work done but also have a good time at school., 39947=Even though the newer dorms are certainly nicer, the older dorms are the best place to be. Everyone bonds so quickly through the events hosted by Residence Life. I live in a dorm built in 1960, and all of the people who live in the new dorms come to hang out in our dorm because there's always something to do!, 201399=You need to realize that tuition goes up between $1000 and $2000 each year. Be prepared. Your professors are great sources of help and wisdom - use them!, 239665=The caf right now doesn't always have the highest quality food. However, Belmont is currently building a new Dining Hall which is said to be completed in 2015. There are plenty of other good on campus and close to on campus eating options as well., 46441=Although I am not involved in Greek Life, my roommates all are. Belmont has a strong Greek system. They hold eight different sororities and fraternities. All of which get to participate in Greek Week come March}",

Tips for prospective students Take as many Advanced Placement courses and their tests to get those college credits, so that when you get to college, you will have a head start on you degree requirements! Also when you get to college, take your decision to go to college seriously; this is not the place to play around and party! The partying can wait! Get involved too! Being involved in different organizations on campus will yield so many opportunities and networks that will propel your growth as a student and an overall person! Bang for the buck",
