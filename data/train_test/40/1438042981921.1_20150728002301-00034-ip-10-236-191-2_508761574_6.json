    "textAfterTable": "Rod makes a great sound on guitar and writes cool tunes, mixing jazz and world music with lyrical melodies. A Cool Move features Rod Fogg on guitar, Jerome Davies on bass and Dave Webster on drums. \u00a0 Reviews \u00a0 01/01/2001\u00a0Ben Bartlett, Guitarist Magazine. Heard here with his three piece outfit comprising himself on guitar, Jerome Davies on hot upright bass and Dave Webster on drums, Rod's fluent phrases and melodic lines have an uncanny ability to weave themselves into the \"hum this\" department in your brain. A master of expressive playing, Fogg's command of the instrument and ability to really hold back and use the musical space to best effect is a great lesson in subtlety. A fantastic \u00e2\u0080\u009clive\u00e2\u0080\u009d drum sound and beautifully simple production consisting of just a smidgeon of reverb on Rod's creamy toned guitar make \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Cool Move\u00e2\u0080\u009d a highly listenable record\".
