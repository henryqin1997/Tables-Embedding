There were a few like myself that couldn't find any issues during Spring Training as the starting row was solid. Marquis and JZim were stellar. Livo was Livo. Lannan was mostly untested and Gorzelanny was getting the 5th spot regardless.Again, the good news is Strasburg is progressing and Maya is in the wings and Detwiler has to be utilized in some capacity to help this team even it is in the role Adam Wainwright played on the STL Cardinals in 2006. To let Detwiler sit in the Minors past May 1st in Syracuse is a waste of his talent.Once the hitting starts to click with this team to back up the pitchers, this will be a better than average team if the bullpen can hold the leads., 68922=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 32054=Feel Wood said\u2026 @ April 4, 2011 10:29 AM I couldn't have said this better myself. If a guy is under 100 pitches and pitching well. Leave him in and if he hits his innings cap sooner rather than later, so be it. It's different if he gets pulled for a pinch hitter in a game that he trailing, but that wasn't the case here., 57888=Clearly Riggleman is a mundane, average to below average manager. He's not going to let Zimmermann or Gorzelanny go deep into games because then he'd lose his favorite toy: the double switch!Might as well get used to being marooned on Giggleman's Isle in 2011.That said, it doesn't matter **how he does it** as long as he does it and that is limiting Zimmermann and Gorzelanny 2 pitchers who could be top of the rotation types but have a history of arm trouble.Limiting Livo, Lannan, and Marquis makes no sense. All three have pitched more than 200 innings in a season. Bringing up Detwiler, Maya, (And give it a rest peeps! Wang will never pitch as a starter for this team nor any other? His future if there is one will be in a bullpen somewhere.)and yes, Tom Milone \u2026 watch out for JD Martin who is set up to again be the Syracuse ace. Mock? Why Mock? That is the question one should be asking \u2026 even before Wang., 18928=This is baseball according to Riggleman. The minute a starter gets past the 5th inning he is not allowed to give up a hit or a walk or he's outta here; 3 days in a row now he has taken out a starter who is still effective and who has a very low pitch count. When we get to July and August our bullpen will be completely worn out (ALA Clippard 2010) and our starters won't be able to give you the extra innings because they have not been stretched out properly. The idea of babying Zimmermann is also not that sound. People who have studied the subject have found that it is critical to develop young arms slowly but when they turn 25 and their shoulder joints are fully developed (Zimm turns 25 in May) you can increase their work load and keep building up their arms with minimal risk; this has everything to do with age and physiology and nothing to do coming back from surgery 18 month ago., 17922=Feel Wood \u2014 you have an awful lot of faith in unproven pitchers. Yeah, Detwiler, Maya, Wang might work out \u2014 but they haven't shown anything yet, and using up JZimm because you think those there are going to be great is short-sighted.JZimm is young with tremendous upside. Babying him is the right thing to do right now \u2014 the potential payoff could be 6-8-10 years of solid pitching from him., 26558=\"Does everyone remember Livo when Robinson was managing? 120 \u2013 130 pitches time and time again; effective and with no arm problems.\"Umm . . . Livo was six years younger then. Further, while Livo had an ERA of around 3.00 for the months of May, June and July \u2014 his ERA for the rest of the year was approx 5.50. OTOH, for 2010, his ERA was under 4.5 for Aug/Sept/Oct.And many people thought Robinson burnt out a lot of the starting pitching staff in '05 \u2014 just like he did to Livo \u2014 which was, in part, a cause of the team crashing in the second half. Livo's arm is not bionic. It may be special, but it will wear down over time.\"MANY is not everyone\"C'mon, \"everyone\" is an expression. You might say \"everyone thinks the Mets have an awful team this year\", or \"everone things so-and-so is an AAAA player\" \u2014 but I'm sure you can find some intense fanatics that think the Mets can win, or that so-and-so deserves to be in the majors., 45454=My thoughts on Riggleman are simple. There was no reason to bring in a replacement last year. The team is building for 2012-2013. Why bring in a new manager and pay the money for 2011, especially since Riggleman was already under contract.I have no doubt we will see a new manager next year. All the talk around bringing in Werth was because he is a winner and knows what it takes to win games. With Rizzo wanting proven winners in key positions I don't see how Riggleman is managing next year unless the team really blows everyone's expectations out of the water.}",
