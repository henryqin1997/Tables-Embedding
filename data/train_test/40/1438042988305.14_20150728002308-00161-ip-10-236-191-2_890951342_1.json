            "This school is great for all students who want a smaller step before going off to a big school or who just want their associate's. They also have a great nursing program, so I'd recommend this school for those students as well.",
            "Take a tour or a look around before you start, you don't want to get lost. Be friendly to your teachers, if you respect them then they will respect you.",
            "Being a 2-year community college, this school has one of the cheapest tuition rates around. There are also many scholarships you can get and they offer book buyback at the end of the semester for everyone.",
            "The atmosphere is so friendly and helpful all over. People greet you with a smile on their face and are willing to go that extra mile and do something for you.",
            "I have loved almost every class I've had here, even the ones that were more challenging. The faculty is excellent, and even though there are a few duds that slip in an out occasionally, this school by far has great teachers."

I've heard the nursing program is really great as well. Tips for prospective students Don't be shy about going to the school and talking with students and teachers, especially in the art department. East Central is really friendly and all of us in the art department love to welcome new people into the studios and talk to them about fine arts and answer any questions. Bang for the buck Because East Central is a small community college the prices are so affordable! My tuition, including books, is about $2,000 a semester. It's great for getting general education classes out of the way so I don't have to pay a ton of money to take them at",
