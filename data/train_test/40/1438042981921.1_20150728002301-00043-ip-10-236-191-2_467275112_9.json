    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{55917=To that end, a video signal processing apparatus (set-top box) for converting the ATSC video signal received from the broadcasting station into the NTSC video signal has been widely used. As such a conventional video signal processing apparatus, there is known an apparatus disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-208100., 52500=Now, a description is given of why the ATSC system defines two field frequencies fv of 59.94 Hz series and 60 Hz series. The 59.94 Hz series is defined in conformity with the conventional standard NTSC system, and this frequency is intended for compatibility with the NTSC system. With this series, existing NTSC-compliant contents/devices (accumulated asset) can be used as they are, and it is easy to exchange contents between the NTSC system and the ATSC system. During a period of transition of the broadcasting system from the NTSC system to the ATSC system, devices of the two systems would be used, so this is extremely efficient. The reason the field frequency fv is not set to just 60.00 Hz but to a little smaller value, 59.94 Hz is that at the start of NTSC color broadcasting, the frequency fv of the color subcarrier SC is delayed from the frequency of a sound signal at a ratio of 1000/1001 in order to prevent the interference between the sound signal and the color subcarrier SC., 53528=The 60 Hz series is 1.001 times (1,000 ppm) higher than the field frequency fv of the standard NTSC system, and is suitable for global distribution of broadcasting materials albeit sacrificing the compatibility with the standard NTSC system. The PAL system as an analog system adopted in Europe uses the field frequency fv of 50 Hz. As compared with a complicated field frequency fv ratio between NTSC system and PAL system (=59.94 Hz:50 Hz=1200:1001), the field frequency fv ratio between the ATSC system using the frequency of 60 Hz and the PAL system is as simple as 60 Hz:50 Hz=6:5. This facilitates the Europe-North America rate conversion. Further, it is said that the ATSC system using the frequency of 60 Hz is based on the fact the MUSE-compliant HDTV that has been developed in Japan prior to the ATSC system uses the frequency fv of 60 Hz, and its contents and devices can be easily applied. The ARIB system conforming to Japanese digital broadcasting standards is intended for the compatibility with the standard NTSC system, and standardizes the frequencies at 59.94 Hz series., 58779=Further, the conversion ratio for the field frequency fv is as complicated as 60 Hz:59.94 Hz=1001:1000. This conversion based on the field frequency fv ratio means that one picture is removed from 1001 moving pictures to obtain 1000 moving pictures (referred to as \u201cskipping\u201d). The \u201cskipping\u201d takes place every 16.68 second, which value is calculated by converting 1001 to seconds (1001/60=16.68). As a result of \u201cskipping\u201d, the continuity of moving images is lost every 16.68 seconds, resulting in unnatural images with a deteriorated quality. The resulting image quality is not an intended quality, so there is a fear about the collision with the portrait rights., 39339=Meanwhile, in the USA, an ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee)-compliant digital television broadcasting service has started from November, 1998 as the next-generation television broadcasting system in parallel with the NTSC-compliant broadcasting service. This ATSC system features \u201chigh definition/wide screen\u201d, \u201chigh-quality sound\u201d, \u201clow noise\u201d, \u201ccompatibility with various media\u201d, and other such characteristics of a digital broadcasting system. Table 1 shows a result of comparing the ATSC system and the NTSC system as below., 50882=As shown in Table 1, in the ATSC system, 18 display systems from an SDTV (Standard Definition TV: standard quality) to the new system, HDTV (High Definition TV: high quality) are set for the moving pictures in varying combinations of a resolution (1920\ufffd1080, 1280\ufffd720, 704\ufffd480, and 640\ufffd480), an aspect ratio (16:9, and 4:3), and a field frequency fv (24 Hz, 30 Hz, and 60Hz). In the NTSC system, only one image quality, standard image quality, is defined.}",

The above embodiments describe the apparatus for converting the ATSC video signal into the NTSC video signal, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and may be applied to the other apparatus for converting a video signal In particular, with either field frequency fv, the color subcarrier frequency fsc is selected, by which the phase of the color subcarrier SC is inverted between frames. Hence, the carrier interference and dot interference can be minimized with accuracy to enhance the image quality. Further, a value of the color subcarrier frequency fsc is set to a frequency sufficient for the Y/C separation with the general NTSC receiver, so an existing receiver can display ATSC video contents with no problem. Further, in this embodiment, upon conversion into the NTSC signal, the color subcarrier frequency fsc suitable for the field frequency fv of the video signal is selected for encoding, whereby a receiver can display an image with high quality regardless of whether or not the field frequency fv is 59.94 Hz or 60 Hz. As described above, in this embodiment, the apparatus for converting the ATSC video signal into the NTSC signal encodes the signal into the NTSC signal without using the",
