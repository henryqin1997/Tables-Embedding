            "Every week in the Nite Spot Duquesne Program Council hosts bingo! Prizes include gift cards and a few times a semester they host Epic Bingo, with larger prizes including video games consoles, televisions and Keurigs.",
            "Lorde's Grotto is a neat spot to visit on campus!",
            "Many students take the loop bus on Fridays and Saturdays to Oakland, the Waterfront and South Side to do their shopping or to see movies and hang out.",
            "Duquesne recently changed food service providers, so Parkhurst is trying to adjust and tweak things. Duquesne has 3 dining halls, one all-you-can-eat style. There is a campus market as well as a Coffee Tree Roasters and a Freshens. The food has improved greatly, but their prices are a bit ridiculous.",
            "I currently live in Duquesne's on-campus apartment building in a one bedroom apartment, and I'm a senior. I definitely paid my dues living in less than ideal spaces. My freshman dorm, St. Martin Hall was small and crammed with my roommate, and it was difficult to organize our furniture without being forced to bunk our beds, and our floor had a shared bathroom with stalls, showers and sinks. Sophomore year I lived in Towers, on a renovated floor. The floor had wifi, unlike my building freshman year. The rooms were slightly larger and it was nicer. Junior year I lived in Vickroy, which was a large suite style building. It has tons of space and there is lots of room for storage. It's a good building to live in.",
            "In my major, the classes aren't that difficult because I enjoy the subject I'm studying. A lot of my classes relate to one another and it's nice. Duquesne has a great business school and their pharmacy program is extremely good. Students will get a great education here.",
            "Make sure that you're okay with paying for public transportation- Duquesne does not have a deal with Pittsburgh Port Authority so students must pay to take the bus, unlike students at Pitt. Be prepared to walk up hills! Duquesne is a very hilly campus and helps you get your exercise in! Duquesne is currently admitting more freshman than they can house, so some students were forced to have three people in a two-person room. If you're okay with that, go for it!",
            "Duquesne is a small campus in an urban location. The university takes pride in its students and faculty. The faculty truly care about their students and go above and beyond helping them make the most out of their education."

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students If I can give you any advice, I would definitely recommend eating at Options as much as you can. Out of all the food places and cafeterias on campus that you can use your meal plan for - Options is the best. It's the closest to home cooking and the staff workers are always super friendly. Also, Starbucks accepts flex only during evening hours... but remember that usually the last 2 weeks of school they accept it any time of the day! And trust me it will be needed during finals week. Bang for the buck As I mentioned previously, it is a prestigious school and it definitely will leave a dent in your wallet. The school offers plenty of jobs for students, activities, internships and more. Also, unlike larger colleges, the majority of classes will consist of about 30 students and teachers will learn your name quickly. Which is nice to have because they get to know you personally rather than just be a name on their attendance sheet. So it may be more expensive than some public or other private schools but you will end up paying for it in the end. Am enjoying being here This university is practically in the heart of Pittsburgh, however, it has it's own",
