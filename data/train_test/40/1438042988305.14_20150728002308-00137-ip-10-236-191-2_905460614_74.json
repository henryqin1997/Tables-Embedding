They changed an upperclassmen dorm to a freshmen dorm and fall 2014 they'll open up a new dorm with parking and a movie theater., 273808=The great thing about living in Europe is that the airfare is really cheap through RyanAir. During October break six of us went to Barcelona, Dublin, and Paris. It is also easy to hop on a train during the weekend and explore more of Italy. At Keller Platz they have nights where bands play and there is great music and dancing!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students -like small campus -don't mind the not so nice environment -not big partiers -don't get bored easily Bang for the buck I was disappointed with the atmosphere however the classes and the professors are worth it. Am enjoying being here Okayy, this school makes it sound more interesting then it really is. The people are nice and the classes are good, however the campus is kinda boring. It is very small and right now a lot of construction. This is also not the best area to live in. There have been lock downs and such on campus, students have been robbed at gun point etc. There are campus police and they seem to do there best, and they will send out txt messages to students about what is currently going on. It is just an such an expensive school and financial aid people are horrible! I was very disappointed and its too much for me, since I am paying for it myself, I'd rather be somewhere where I'd be more excited about the school. Am learning a lot The professors are great!!!
