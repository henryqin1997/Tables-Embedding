    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6114=A cavity mask is then used to pattern and etch the dielectric, as illustrated in FIG. 8 a. During the etch process, layer 40 acts as an etch stop in order to avoid damaging the surface underneath it. Sacrificial material 50 is then deposited over the cavity and planarized, stopping at the ILD dielectric, as shown in FIG. 8 b. The sacrificial material can also be embedded within the dielectric by depositing sacrificial material after the insulating material 40 on top of the first metal level (FIG. 9 a). The sacrificial material 50 is then patterned using a reverse tone resist to keep sacrificial material of known thickness over the first metal level (FIG. 9 b). An interlevel dielectric 45 is then deposited over the sacrificial material and planarized, stopping at the sacrificial material (FIGS. 9 c and 9 d). The sacrificial material is preferably made of SiLK, DLC (Diamond like carbon) or any polynorbornene based polymer. The height of the sacrificial material preferably ranges between 2000 \u212b and 7000 \u212b.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34400=A. Dec et al., in an article entitled \u201cRF micro-machined varactors with wide tuning range\u201d, published in the IEEE RF IC Symposium Digest, pp. 309-312, June 1998 describe building a MEMS variable capacitor by actuating the movable electrode using two parallel electrodes above and below the movable electrode. The total capacitance tuning range is significantly enhanced as a result of the individual capacitance between the top-movable and movable-bottom being in series. The maximum tuning range achievable using this approach is a ratio of 2:1. A. Dec et al. have reported achieving a tuning range as high as 1.9:1. Even though the tuning range significantly improves when using this approach, the process complexity increases correspondingly., 61700=Furthermore, the conditions governing the deposition of the barrier films determine the stress gradient over the entire structure. Barrier material is deposited using physical vapor deposition techniques, preferably, TiN, Ta, or TaN. TiN or TaN is deposited by reactive, magnetron sputtering in, preferably, in an Argon, nitrogen atmosphere. Sputtering is sequential with or without an air-break. For TiN, a nitrogen to argon gas mixture is used, ranging between 3:1 and 5:1, and preferably at 4:1, while maintaining the total chamber pressure between 2 and 20 mT. The temperature of deposition oscillates between 40\ufffd to 100\ufffd C. Under the aforementioned deposition conditions, an X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the sputtered film is cubic osbornite TiN, irrespective of whether the deposition is on an oxide or TaN. For TaN, the argon to nitrogen ratio ranges from 1.5 to 3 and preferably between 2 and 2.5. The pressure in the chamber preferably ranges from 2 to 20 mT, with the temperature of deposition remaining between 40\ufffd to 200\ufffd C. XRD (X-ray diffraction) scans indicate that TaN is a combination of the cubic and hexagonal phases when deposited on an oxide. The thickness of the TiN barrier film varies between 20 to 200 \u212b, preferably, between 40 and 100 \u212b, while the thickness of the TaN film oscillates between 200 \u212b and 1000 \u212b, preferably around 400 \u212b to 700 \u212b. The copper plating is performed in selrex or viaform chemistry leading to a low stress copper film. The stress gradient in the film and the net deflection of the electrode are carefully monitored by controlling the film thicknesses and the deposition conditions.}",

Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations which fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. All matters set forth herein or shown in the accompanying drawings are to be interpreted in an illustrative and nonlimiting sense. . Electrode 76 is illustrated in the background, showing the sidewall overlap area between the curled movable electrodes 66 and 76. Any change in the sidewall overlap area resulting from the action of the movable electrodes, leads to a change in capacitance of the device.
