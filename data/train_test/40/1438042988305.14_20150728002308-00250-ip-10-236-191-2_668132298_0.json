Since the crystal filters are much larger and will not fit in the sockets, they must be wired in. There is room for one or two crystal filters plus one mechanical filter. We have instructions for you to install one or two crystal filters. We can provide a preassembled cable for wiring in one crystal filter at $10 each. Yaesu FT-847 Filters for Yaesu Radios",
