There are currently around 1600 students, so the class sizes are small and the professors know their students. The school provides many opportunities for the women, such as a variety of majors, a large network to aid in job applications, and a chance to take classes at the other two schools., 195529=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here South Bend is not the most exciting town to live in. Football weekends here seem to be the most fun. There are a lot of things to do off campus, you just have to try really hard to find stuff. I recommend going to ND to eat a few nights a week. You meet some cool people and therefore, you have more connections as to what to do on weekends. Am learning a lot Classes are tough, but to be honest, I learned more in the first year of college than I did my whole high school career. It is totally worth it!! Do not skip class a lot, especially math classes, because on the day you think you won't be doing anything special, it turns out to be the worst day in the world to skip! No joke.
