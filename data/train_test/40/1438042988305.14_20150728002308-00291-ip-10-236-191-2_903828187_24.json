            "I've always felt really safe, even when walking back to my dorm at 1am from the library after a long day of studying.",
            "I'm not personally involved but many of my friends are and they love it, so if it's something you're interested in I would encourage you to go for it.",
            "I really think that there is something for everyone, and once you get involved in one organization, it's only too easy to get more involved.",
            "Missouri S&T is primarily a school for those interested in science and engineering. However, there are a lot of other great programs as well, like the business and humanities programs.",
            "The biggest event on campus is Saint Patrick's Day and we get a 2 day recess to celebrate, although festivities usually last about 2 weeks. There are all sorts of games and fun things to do and every year celebrations conclude with a parade and concert.",
            "If you live in Missouri, it's a really good deal. I also have some friends from outside Missouri who said that this school was cheaper than other options back home.",
            "For fun, my friends and I like to take road trips to St. Louis or the Lake of the Ozarks which are close enough for a day trip. There are a lot of great outdoors activities around Rolla.",
            "The food isn't that great in my opinion, but most people enjoy it. It really depends on the kind of food you are used to eating.",
            "The Residential Life staff puts in a lot of effort to make sure that students are getting involved outside the classroom and making lasting friendships. All the housing options are really nice and the living communities are what you make of them.",
            "Some of the classes can be really challenging, especially if you've never been exposed to the material. There are however, help sessions available for almost every class. For the classes that don't have a help session, the professor is more than willing to help you out as long as you communicate with them.",
            "No matter where you go to school, it's important to get involved outside of the classroom because you will build a good network that can be really useful once you graduate.",
            "It's a really good school with great teachers that really care about making sure you get a good education. The atmosphere of the school is open and it's very easy to get involved in extracurriculars."

Many Greeks help out with volunteer work and other activities outside of their house. Greek housing can range from very ornate to run-down depending on different chapters., 317894=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 13690=Engineers. This school gives you the knowledge to be successful in whichever area you're interested in. And the have quite a lot of engineering departments. Nerds. Hard workers. Team players. Hands-on learners. Boy to Girl ration - 5:1 - Ladies, must I say anymore?, 112568=There are a lot more guys than girls at this university. Freshmen and Sophomores are ~3:2, after that age group, the ratio drops to ~4:1., 202016=I have visted S&T during one of there miner days and plan to attend Fall of 2013. I'm so excited about going to this school. I love the student body size and the courses offered., 31155=I enjoy MS&T for the most part, but there are a few things that aren't so great about it. The work load seems to really build up sometimes and the Male to Female ratio is 3:1 to name a few. Things like the annual St. Pat's celebration always make up for stuff like that though.}",

Among the most popular extracurricular activities here are student design teams. These are teams of students that build engineering marvels: solar cars, solar houses, F1 racing cars, fast human powered machines, satellites, etcetera, etcetera. These are the kinds of students that thrive here at S&T, and the kinds of classmates and peers that you will constantly be interacting with. If a student-run organization that genetically engineers bacteria for competitions is the kind of thing that sends shivers down your spine, this is the place for you. Tips for prospective students Although S&T offers a few majors in History and English, it's really an engineering and science school at its core. I know a few humanities majors here, but usually they attend for reasons other than the curriculum (baseball, living local, etc.) I recommend",
