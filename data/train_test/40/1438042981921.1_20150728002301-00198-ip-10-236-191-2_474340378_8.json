    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{28813=Referring first to FIG. 1 the fluid heater of the present invention is shown in exploded view. A housing 10 consisting of a hollow tube formed in the shape of a \"U\" serves as the fluid passageway for the invention. A fluid mixer 12 is inserted into each of the legs of the \"U\" shaped housing, the outer diameter of fluid mixer 12 being sized to relatively snugly fit inside of housing 10. An electric heating element 14 is inserted inside of each of the fluid mixers 12 to a reasonably close diametric fit. Heating element 14 may be a commercially available product, such as Model L323323-5TB5HJO, manufactured by ITT Vulcan Electric Co., Kezar Falls, Maine. In the preferred embodiment heating element 14 is rated at 2550 watts with 240 volts AC applied, and produces a power density of 58 watts per square inch. Each of the open ends of housing 10 is threaded to accept the complementary threads of a fluid manifold. Fluid inlet manifold 16 is threaded to one end of housing 10 and fluid outlet manifold 18 is threaded to the other end of housing 10. Manifold 16 has a threaded inlet port 17 which is adapted for coupling to a fluid hose or other piping arrangement. Manifold 18 has a threaded port 19 which is adapted for similar attachment as an outlet port. In each case heating element 14 is insertable entirely through the respective manifolds, and has a threaded lock and sealing nut 15 for threaded attachment to the respective manifolds. A pair of power wires 13 protrude from sealing nut 15, and may be connected to a suitable source of power for energizing heating element 14. The use of a U-shaped tube enables the concentration of a significant heating power into a relatively small package; if the heating demands of a particular application do not require such heating capabilities other tube shapes could be selected.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof, and it is therefore desired that the present embodiment be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, reference being made to the appended claims rather than to the foregoing description to indicate the scope of the invention. When temperatures within the heater are at or near the nominal setpoint temperature the voltage on line 51 tracks these minor disparities, increasing or decreasing slightly the duty cycle of triac switch 44 to increase or decrease AC power applied to heater wires 28 by the small additional amount needed to compensate for the temperature disparity. Under these conditions bridge amplifier 50 functions as a high gain amplifier, and small voltage changes at junction 42 produce significant corrective voltages at line 52. When wide disparities exist between the temperature setpoint and the actual temperature the circuit permits rapid heater buildup by tracking the rate of change of actual temperature versus setpoint temperature, thereby permitting the heater to develop full power until actual temperature approaches nominal temperature settings. The output from bridge amplifier 50 is effectively desensitized by capacitor C1, causing it to react with high sensitivity toward slowly varying temperature disparities, and with lower sensitivity towards rapidly varying temperature disparities. Conversely, the output from differential amplifier 52 causes it to react only toward rapidly varying temperature disparities,",
