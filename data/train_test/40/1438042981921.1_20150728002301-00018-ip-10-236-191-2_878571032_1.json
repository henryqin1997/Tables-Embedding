Most of the members of the Knight Company deserted their Confederate units rather than evaded conscript. Like the majority of Southerners who initially opposed secession (such as the Jones County Collins family), pro-Union men generally complied with conscription in hopes of a short war, and in hopes of serving alongside their kin and close neighbors. Many other men turned against the war by late 1862 and early 1863. Some joined the Knight band, but many others, as Ed Payne has demonstrated with his careful research, migrated to New Orleans and joined the Union Army., 240326=Fort Pike was one of a series of fortifications, including Fort Sumter, built by the federal government in the wake of the War of 1812 for coastal defense.\u00a0 The massive brick and mortar structure was completed in 1827. Situated on a peninsula of land, it guarded the Rigolets\u2014a strait connecting Lake Pontchartrain with the Gulf of Mexico.\u00a0 Louisiana militia occupied the fort at the outbreak of the Civil War, but it was abandoned by the Confederacy after New Orleans fell into Union hands in April of 1862., 215561=12/23/1863, 145861=1860, 189131=07/10/1864, 33876=June: Appreciate your comments and family lore. I\u2019ve not found any men with the surnames of \u201cWhite\u201d or \u201cTemple(s)\u201d on the various rosters of the Newt Knight band. But there were other men in the area who, singularly or in groups, sought to evade Confederate conscription authorities\u2013especially after the surrender of Vicksburg in July, 1863., 214245=05/15/1864, 226026=05/19/1864, 210744=02/02/1864, 205869=08/23/1864, 218583=06/15/1864, 158554=05/18/1864, 216422=04/28/1864, 233477=Finally, Table 4 lists other men who reported southern or even Mississippi nativity, but who are currently excluded from the count due to lack of supporting evidence.\u00a0 While most probably resided in neighboring states, a few may be candidates for inclusion pending further research.\u00a0 For example, Benjamin B. Patricks joined the 1st New Orleans at Fort Pike on March 25, 1864, stating he was 45 years-old.\u00a0 Also attempting to enlist that same day was Edward Patricks, who claimed to be 17.\u00a0 Both reporting being natives of Orangeville, South Carolina.\u00a0 While Edward was rejected as underage, Benjamin was accepted and served until his desertion after the war.\u00a0 The 1860 census of Jones County listed Richard Patrick, age 45, and a son named Edward, age 12\u2014both natives of South Carolina.\u00a0 Did Richard adopt \u201cBenjamin B. Patricks\u201d as a nom de guerre and if so why?\u00a0 He later successfully applied for a pension and his file may provide an answer., 121366=03/12/1864, 119715=04/14/1864, 223844=02/20/1864, 51162=Some genealogies list James W. Lee as a son of Nathaniel Lee and wife Sarah. If so, he would most likely be the child recorded as \u201cWilliam T. Lee\u201d age 15 on the 1850 census of Covington County. Note this would match the name James gave his first son. Indeed, some genealogies list James\u2019s full name as James William T. Lee, but I not found any documents to support this. Whether Nathaniel was James\u2019s father or not, \u201cNathaniel Lee\u201d was enumerated in neighboring Perry County on the 1860 census., 219453=03/25/1864, 123854=10/09/1863, 51969=Brent: the information that James W. Lee was born in Wayne County comes from his 1st New Orleans Union military records. As you noted, his age (29) at the time of his enlistment on 13 April 1864 indicates he was born circa 1835. He can be found on the 1860 census of Jones County as \u201cJames W. Lee\u201d age 25 with wife Delphine and 3 children. While serving in the 1st New Orleans, James W. Lee died of typhoid fever on 28 July 1864., 213376=04/30/1864, 198791=04/15/1864, 129902=01/23/1864, 205414=04/19/1864, 76265=I have images of the Asa Easterling pension file and it contains a notice that he died in 1913. His lengthy (213 documents!) quest to obtain a pension had only been granted in Jan 1912., 221660=03/30/1864, 184737=11/18/1863, 219914=04/21/1864, 224275=06/11/1864, 51522=In 1867 his widow filed for a Union pension. These records establish that her maiden name was Delphine Landrum and they married in 1856. Among their children were a son named William T. Lee born in 1859 and one named Abraham Lincoln Lee born in March of 1863. Delphine and her 5 children by James can be found on the 1870 Jones County census., 197921=06/25/1864, 150582=05/04/1864, 157659=12/24/1863, 120955=04/27/1864, 241673=Readers of \u201cRenegade South\u201d will be familiar with the fact that in the spring of 1864 Confederate forces, most famously those of\u00a0 Col. Robert Lowry, were sent into the Piney Woods to quell resistance and compel deserters back into their units.\u00a0 Many of those not caught up in the Confederate dragnet fled south to the swamps of the lower Pearl River, a region known as Honey Island.\u00a0 At this point the refugees were encamped a mere 10 miles from the Union garrison at Fort Pike, Louisiana. Communications were established and groups of men began arriving at Fort Pike., 155449=05/24/1864, 61616=Always nice to hear from descendants of these men. My own link is via the Collins family, with 1st New Orleans enlistee Riley J. Collins being a 4 x gr uncle. As I noted in Part 3 of the series (and you probably know), father David McBride and his son William enlisted together and died within days of each other in late July 1864 \u2014 David of chronic diarrhea and William of smallpox. The pension file for David McBride, as filed by his widow Agnes (Redd) McBride, contains 28 documents. I am advising Vikki via this post to provide you with my email address. Please contact me if you wish to know more about the McBride pension file., 125488=04/12/1864, 55665=[\u2026] Yet when over two hundred Piney Woods men trekked south in the spring of 1864 and agreed to join Union Army regiments in New Orleans, it was hardly due to the machinations of Newt Knight.\u00a0 He remained in Jones County until the end [\u2026], 211634=07/05/1864, 65611=[\u2026] is clear is that Joel W. Walters enlisted in the Union 1st New Orleans Infantry on 25 March 1864.\u00a0 He earned promotions to corporal and then to sergeant.\u00a0 A month after Lee\u2019s [\u2026], 234509=To determine if reliance on enlistment at Fort Pike as an indicator had been too exclusionary, a further check was made.\u00a0 This focused on 63 men, all with records lacking nativity information, who enrolled between January and August 1864 at locations other than Fort Pike.\u00a0 Among this group, only one emerged as a possible Piney Woods resident., 74023=Thank you Ed\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026I have noted the 1913 date for Asa Easterling\u2026\u2026.I look forward to your next writing., 195329=05/12/1864, 208079=06/29/1864, 177741=12/20/1863, 222117=05/29/1864, 174238=05/25/1864, 197492=06/14/1864, 126308=06/06/1864, 141441=05/05/1864, 176416=05/14/1864, 186950=04/23/1864, 88985=http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/CREEL-MS/2006-01/1137354866, 202760=12/29/1863, 222977=07/02/1864, 179465=05/26/1865, 237819=The names in the accompanying tables were ascertained by several methods: first, a table was created of all enlistees who reported Mississippi nativity.\u00a0 It should be emphasized that enlistment documents recorded the birthplace of the recruit, not his pre-war residence.\u00a0 Therefore, an attempt was made to crosscheck names against the federal censuses of 1850 and 1860.\u00a0 It was not possible to establish matches in all cases, but the effort revealed the first evidence of kinship ties mirroring those explored by Victoria Bynum in Free State of Jones:\u00a0 Mississippi\u2019s Longest Civil War.\u00a0 Of the 178 men whose military records identified them as native Mississippians, 170 reported Piney Woods nativity and census records indicate three others had apparently settled in the region by 1860.\u00a0 These individuals are listed in Table 1 (see note 2)., 78550=Les, thank you for the link. I was not familiar with this cemetery. I see the date at that link as 1913 for death, but I wonder if that could be 1915?, 53764=I can find no James Lee born in wayne county around 1835, do you have any idea who his parents are?, 138563=1850, 70072=[\u2026] Mississippians who joined the Union 1st New Orleans Infantry Regiment\u00a0 in late 1863 and 1864 signed enlistment documents pledging \u201ctrue faith and allegiance to the [\u2026], 227784=Note 3:\u00a0 The figure of 99 names associated with the Knight Band comes from my cross-compilation of three rosters:\u00a0 1) The 1870 roster Newt Knight submitted as part of his claim for federal compensation, 2) the roster included in Thomas J. Knight\u2019s Life and Activities of Captain Newton Knight (p 16-17), and 3) the roster published in Ethel Knight\u2019s Echo of the Black Horn (p 89-89, 161)., 129510=06/13/1864, 225162=05/23/1864, 240452=Aerial view of Fort Pike as it appeared prior to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, 119303=03/11/1864, 207191=05/03/1864, 180777=07/08/1864, 124672=05/02/1864, 105278=Great article and beautifully written. I am glad that you continue to pursue this history and hope that a book comes out of all this work. Thanks to you and Vikki, I am gradually finding answers to unanswered questions about my GGreatgrandfather\u2019s brother, William A. Mauldin. He enlisted as a Confederate soldier in August 1861, fought in the battle of Ft Donelson, was wounded, captured and hospitalized in February 1862 and deserted shortly afterwards. Finally, he enlisted in the NO 1st in April 1864 and died of pneumonia in a military hospital in December 1864. My primary question was his motivation to join the confederacy, since he deserted shortly afterwards. Still haven\u2019t answered this one. But, as Vikki points out, his change of heart was most likely caused by the \u201c20 Negro Law\u201d (rich man\u2019s war/poor man\u2019s fight) which caused many poor farmers who owned no slaves to rethink their allegiance after the Mississippi Legislature passed that law. Another question: where was William between February 1862 and April 1864? And why did he wait to April 1864 to enlist as a Union soldier? I assume he went back to Jones County, but he does not appear in any of Newt Knights rolls. The answer to this one is obvious: after Lowry\u2019s raid in early 1864, his choices were stay and be hunted down and killed, join Knight\u2019s renegades, rejoin the Confederacy (as many did), OR follow his soul (after Lowry\u2019s men killed Taply Bynum, his sister\u2019s husband), which meant joining the Union army. Unfortunately he died a few months later and didn\u2019t get to enjoy his army\u2019s win. I noted in your table that nearly all of the Piney Woods men joining the Union Army in New Orleans, did so within a few months of Lowry\u2019s raid. Vikki says in her book, that they floated down the Mississippi to New Orleans. This alone would have been a dangerous venture. Of all my ancestors, William is near the top of the list of those I plan to connect with to listen to their life stories in the hereafter. Keep up the scholarly research, Ed. I can hardly wait to read the next one., 212489=05/22/1864, 193093=06/20/1864, 238569=At the outset my expectations were modest.\u00a0 Several decades ago researcher Jean Strickland compiled information on 34 Union Army pension applications filed from Jones County.\u00a0 During preliminary research, I located nine additional applications filed from other counties.\u00a0 It seemed possible that by reversing the focus and examining all 1st and 2nd New Orleans records, perhaps another 30 or 40 names might be revealed.\u00a0 But this proved to be a sizable miscalculation.\u00a0 The records yielded the names of 206 Mississippians who enlisted in these regiments between November of 1863 and November of 1864.\u00a0 Out of this total, 201 (97.6%) can be identified as inhabitants of the Piney Woods region (see note 1)., 234140=Fifty-one of the Mississippians identified on the 1st New Orleans rolls were initially assigned to the 2nd New Orleans.\u00a0 As mentioned, this unit was disbanded in August 1864 and the men transferred to the 1st New Orleans.\u00a0 However, the 2nd New Orleans records proved useful in establishing nativity for several men whose birth information was missing in the 1st New Orleans files.\u00a0 Only three Piney Woods men appear in the 2nd New Orleans files but not subsequently on the 1st New Orleans rolls.\u00a0 Their names are listed in Table 3, but they were excluded from all analysis pertained to the 1st New Orleans Piney Woods enlistees., 236923=To identify enlistees from Mississippi who had been born elsewhere, or whose files lacked nativity information, required delving deeper into census records.\u00a0 Nearly all the military files recorded the date and location of enlistment.\u00a0 It became evident early in the study that a large majority of Mississippians (84%) enlisted at Fort Pike, whereas other enlistees more typically joined at the New Orleans recruiting depot.\u00a0 Therefore, census crosschecks were done on all men who enlisted at Fort Pike between January and August of 1864 using name, age, and state of birth.\u00a0 This method identified men born in other states, but who later settled in the Piney Woods.\u00a0 An example is John W. Axton, a 28 year-old farmer who enrolled at Fort Pike on March 25, 1864.\u00a0 His enlistment papers state he was born in Morgan County, Alabama.\u00a0 Census research shows that by 1850 his family had moved to Lauderdale County, Mississippi.\u00a0 In 1860 he is found residing in Perry County with a wife and infant son., 215989=05/26/1864, 213810=04/18/1864, 228768=Note 2:\u00a0 As a general rule, enlistees reporting Mississippi nativity but found to be residing outside the state on pre-war censuses were excluded from the list.\u00a0 Exceptions were made in three cases, all owing to kinship ties with other enlistees.\u00a0\u00a0In the first case, the family of Ellis Bounds moved to St Helena Parish, Louisiana shortly before the 1860 census. Ellis was related to several other Bounds men who enlisted.\u00a0 The other two cases involved brothers Martin Van Buren Parker and Thomas Jefferson Parker.\u00a0 Their family moved from Jones County, Mississippi to Washington County, Alabama (across the state line from Wayne County, Mississippi) in the late 1840s.\u00a0 The censuses of 1850 and 1860 show them residing there.\u00a0 However, they were cousins of several other Parkers who enlisted in New Orleans and Martin Parker resettled in Jones County after the war (his brother Thomas died while serving in the 1st New Orleans)., 179037=05/20/1864, 239269=In counterintuitive military fashion, the 2nd New Orleans began enrolling troops in October of 1863, six months prior to the 1st New Orleans.\u00a0 Never reaching full strength, it was disbanded in August of 1864 and its men transferred into the 1st New Orleans.\u00a0 The 2nd New Orleans Infantry rolls cover 267 men, totaling 1,813 documents.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Those of the 1st New Orleans Infantry account for 1,377 men and comprise 20,829 documents.\u00a0 The military files have been digitized and are available via the subscription service Footnote.com.\u00a0 For purposes of this study, the records of every man in the two regiments were reviewed and summarized on spreadsheets., 63695=Very interesting. My GG Grandfather is listed in your table. David McBride and also his son, William. I was born in Jones Co. MS and have heard and read the Free State of Jones stories all of my life. I have a copy of the Widow\u2019s Pension Application made by my GG Grandmother in New Orleans in 1865 a year after David McBride died. Thanks for the research and article., 125898=02/18/1864, 162021=11/11/1864, 203632=02/23/1864, 201873=05/21/1864, 178172=07/13/1864, 147829=An asterick (*) appearing after the nativity county indicates that it is located outside the Piney Woods region.\u00a0 The 1860 census records suggest that Bailey Martin, James Taylor, and Andrew Walker had relocated to the Piney Woods., 137549=1870, 185628=05/27/1864, 235191=About one-third of the regimental files are missing nativity information.\u00a0 \u00a0Still, the names and ages of those who enlisted at Fort Pike from January to August of 1864 provided some basis for crosschecking against 1850-1870 federal censuses of Mississippi.\u00a0 In practice this method was less capricious than it may sound.\u00a0 \u00a0Common names that yielded too many possible candidates were excluded.\u00a0 \u00a0Of the names included, 70% can be verified through later pension applications.\u00a0 Table 2 lists the 25 Mississippi recruits ascertained by these methods, along with census identification.\u00a0 All lived within the Piney Woods region., 76062=In the matter of the spelling of names, for the sake of consistent I used the spelling found in the 1st and 2nd New Orleans files. These files include many reference cards indicating various spelling of the same name. I have developed a spreadsheet in which I\u2019ve attempted to cross-link each these men with the 1850~1870 censuses. This has turned up alternatives such as Reynolds = Runnels and Oadum = Odom., 33517=Whether connected to your line or not, I did some research on a Jones R. Temples of Marion County. He can be found on the 1860 census in that county as a 27 year-old married man with several children. He apparently volunteered for the Confederate 7th MS Infantry in the spring of 1861 but his records end in December of that year. On June 25, 1864 a James/Jones R. Temple of Marion County (apparently the same individual) enlisted in the 2nd New Orleans and was transferred to the 1st New Orleans. Within 2 months, however, he was sentenced to confinement for the duration of the war at Fort Jefferson, in the Dry Tortugas off the coast of Florida. Contrary to most court martial proceedings in the New Orleans regiments, no reason for his imprisonment was cited in his military papers., 126713=04/17/1864, 125075=02/23/1865, 138789=11/06/1863, 147578=TABLE 2:\u00a0 1st New Orleans enlistees with Mississippi residency established through cross-checks of the 1850, 1860, and 1870 federal census records., 223412=11/04/1864, 188700=04/13/1864, 204093=03/14/1864, 97752=Thanks Vikki, I did a reply but not sure it was inserted in the right place. With the movie coming out soon, this must be a very exciting time for you. I am a very PROUD relative. Thanks so much for all of your hard work to keep history recorded correctly. I remember as a kid asking my Dad why we (and other Mississippians) weren\u2019t celebrating the 4th of July, and his answer was \u201cSon, this was the day that Vicksburg fell to the Yankees.\u201d When I was a kid, Newt Knight was relegated to the Trash Bin of history. YOU dug out the truth and started new debates on issues with the Civil War which are still on the table as current issues today. It seems that we will never learn. If you look at our recent history and Military today, it\u2019s still a \u201cRich Man\u2019s War and Poor Man\u2019s Fight.\u201d, 185173=03/05/1864, 235392=Enlistment doc. of John W. Axton, who resided in Perry Co., MS in 1860, joined the 1st N.O. Infantry on 25 Mar. 1864, and died the following October., 232460=It should be kept in mind that the 206 men thus far identified formed a distinct minority among all those from their region who served during the Civil War.\u00a0 Many others remained within the Confederate ranks, however faithfully or begrudgingly.\u00a0 But the current research suggests that dissenters were more numerous and diffuse than previously thought.\u00a0 While some might have harbored Unionist sympathies from the outset of the war, most probably developed growing resentment towards Confederate authority as the war dragged on.\u00a0 The campaigns by Col. Henry Maury and Col. Robert Lowry in the spring of 1864, aimed at forcing them back into southern service, instead provoked a final severing of loyalties., 218152=06/21/1864, 87045=Texxan, we are related. Seleta\u2019s (also went by Lettie) Grandfather, William A. Mauldin who fought for the Confederacy but later fought for the Union, was my GGrandfather Lemuel\u2019s older brother. Lemuel (I have his first name) was too young to fight. I grew-up on the same 200 acre farm in Jones County, MS as William and Lemuel and often tried to place myself in their shoes while roaming the woods and pastures and creek (Chicken Branch) as a kid. The 1850 Log Cabin built by their father, William Harrison Mauldin, still stands after 165 years. We used it as a hay barn and Boy Scout Troop Headquarters. I am proud of my renegade ancestry, but very sad that the sisters burned William\u2019s Union Army Uniform rather than admit and feel proud that their ancestor was a hero and on the right side of history. Glad to meet a new Cousin. We should stay in-touch, so I would like to have your contact information., 68186=[\u2026] Nor were all Chains loyal to the Confederacy. Military records indicate that Isaac Chain\u2019s brother, James Alexander Chain, deserted the 7th battalion in October 1862 after hospitalization for wounds sustained at the battle of Corinth. Although James never formally joined the Knight band, he remained AWOL until December 1863. Another Chain, first name uncertain, was similarly reported AWOL following the battle of Corinth, and again in early 1864. Like so many Piney Woods men, the Chains and the Dykes alternately served and deserted the Confederacy. By late 1863, many\u00a0of these men (including Newt Knight) refused to go back, and joined the Knight band instead. By April, 1864, many more were joining the Union Army in New Orleans (see Ed Payne, \u201cCrossing the Rubicon of Loyalties\u201d). [\u2026], 149696=07/20/1864, 222549=06/24/1864}",
