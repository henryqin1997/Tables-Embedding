    "textAfterTable": "17 Songs Album Review For those who want lyrical bones to chew on, there's no denying Neil Hannon's sly appeal. To dismiss him as \"baroque\" would be as misleading as pegging him as the missing link between Noel Coward, Anthony Newley, and Scott Walker. But Hannon's highly evolved song constructions, grandiose orchestral pretensions, and baritone crooning seem as much quaint classicism as a bicycle built for two \u2014 even as his deft, complex, ambitious arrangements are contemporary.
