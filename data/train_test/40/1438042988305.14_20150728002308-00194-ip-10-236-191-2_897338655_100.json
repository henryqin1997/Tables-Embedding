            "The food is a great like back home, but ts pretty satisfying. If you do not want to eat at the local campus diner you can always cook back at your dorm or go to a local fast food restaurant that are all over campus.",
            "I currently live on campus and I love it. You get to meet a lot of people. If you stayed up late studying you can literally role out of bed and get to class since everything is very close.",
            "It all depends on the class you are taking and the amount of credits that define the academic rigor.",

            "On a scale of 1-10, I give PSU a 10. I really feel at home and well connected to the campus. This university's main focus is their students."

There are always people walking around, the library is open and filled with students, the rec center still has classes going, and best of all, campus security and Portland police are constantly patrolling so I see them often. Over all? Extremely safe!, 614474=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 47023=Apply very early! The application process takes a few weeks and the deadline for all scholarships is February 1st. Take the time to apply over winter break (or even November/December); even if you don't decide to go, it will save you a potential headache., 282083=5th and Washington, Downtown Portland Or,,, 11:11 Gallery, 119198=Tuition has raised amazingly high since I started going to PSU in 2003 and managed to get two bachelors degrees. Students are nickeled and dimed for miscellaneous fees, student rec fees, and stuff that has to do with PSU's constant expansion. We don't see what the fees actually go to. If I could get some of the fee money back, I would be happy., 125777=Plenty of clubs and events on campus, especially during the spring and early fall. A farmers market is held on the weekends in the middle of campus starting in March until mid-November.}",

Tips for prospective students If you choose this school, don't overload yourself with courses in your first term. You will want to only take about 12 credits (that is full time) to give yourself time to get used to studying AND to be free to explore the city and campus. Bang for the buck While they aren't 100% streamlined in all processes, this school really tries to give you what you need, and tailor your education to your specific goals.
