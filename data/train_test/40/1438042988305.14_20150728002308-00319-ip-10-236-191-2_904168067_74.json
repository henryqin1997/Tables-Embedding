            "The campus is very safe, Xavier Police and New Orleans Police Dept. are always driving around campus for your aid. Whether it be your'e hungry and have no ride, to a flat tire they are always there. There are also emergency buttons in case of urgent matters.",
            "Greek Life is available, but not a huge thing on because it is such a small population that attends Xavier. We try to make it as fun and known that the greeks are around and near.",
            "Xavier makes clubs for literally everything. Abstinence, Stress,Drug abuse, and Science. If you feel it and have people behind you supporting, there's your club. And the school supports each and everyone if appropriate.",
            "After all studying there is need for recreation, and the city of New Orleans is full of good whole-sum, safe fun. With the city already being a tourist attraction there are a multitude of art galleries, theaters and restaurants.",
            "There is a dining hall available in the University Center. Food is usually pretty good, the cafeteria staff tries to have a variety of foods, as well as keeping up with traditional New Orleans meals. On weekdays breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast is from 7am-9am, Lunch is from 11am-2pm and Dinner is from 5pm-7pm, as well as brunch on the weekends.",
            "Freshmen girls are required to live in the living quarters of KD short for Kathrine Drexel, it one of the oldest buildings but has been renovated for for the safety and well being of students, The young men live in a separate living quarters called ST. Mike's. There are visitations hours for both, the first day of visitation starts on Thursday-Sunday from 6pm-11pm.",
            "Although there is personal relationships with professors, that only is on your side to a certain extent. Xavier is all about grades, they will push you past yours limits, you will become overwhelmed but if you prove your efforts, you will succeed.",
            "Definitely watch your crowds, stray away from being that freshmen. Parties will always be there living in city of New Orleans, so no distractions, make sure you are on top of your academics. Don't be afraid to ask for help, take full advantage of the resource center.",
            "Academically every staff member at Xavier is on your side for you to achieve nothing but success. The classrooms are of a smaller than an average University setting and that allows a more personal and hands on relationship with students and professors. Resource centers are available for a wide variety of the majors. All I can say is It really does happen at Xavier."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{263468=Unfortunately the freshman dorms are not awesome. There is a curfew (12:00 Sunday-Thursday and 2:00 Friday & Saturday) and the bathrooms are hall bathrooms. On the upside, the RA's schedule cute get togethers for the floors to mingle., 326909=Considering I was on a scholarship, I thought that the quality of education and resources offered was fair. This is a private institution, so it's pretty expensive: tuition is around $18000 a year + $4000-$5000 room & board + $2000-$3000 fees + around $200-$300 for books. There are also other random things you have to pay for when attending. I'm a chemistry major and was recommended/required to buy a $2 laminated periodic table that could be used on tests, a $35 lab coat, and $5 lab goggles., 114311=When you walk into the communal bathroom and dookie is smeared all over the floor, it really puts into perspective where you are and with whom you live. Freshman dorms especially are horrible. They are separated by gender, come with a very strict 12:30 AM curfew on weekdays and 2:00 AM curfew on weekends, and are just old. The air condition unit in my room would leak, and it wasn't until I and my roommate decided not to clean the water up and let it leak into the hallway, that it was fixed. (They probably didn't want that lawsuit for a slip and fall). I heard of multiple room units that didn't work, which is even more of a problem when you're in a place where temperatures reach 90+ degrees with 100% humidity. There is a janitorial service that cleans the restrooms once a day everyday and they do a decent job, but when you're in a place with a bunch of dudes that still have a high-school mentality, it kinda doesn't look like it was cleaned at all., 141322=The school has a very unique menu when compared to out-of-state schools. There are many cajun dishes that they love to serve, like red-beans and rice, gumbo, dirty rice, and others. Even if you're not from Louisiana, you'll easily get accustomed to the food here. I will write this though: have emergency food items in your dorm!! The cafeteria workers are human, and sometimes the food that they serve isn't as great as what you're used to at home. If you do find that the cafeteria food is bad on a certain day, there are many restaurants close to the campus. Specific ones include McDonalds, KFC, a lot of Chinese restaurants, Popeye's, and other small restaurants. WARNING!!!: the Freshman 15 does exist on this campus!!! Make sure that you have frequent workout regimens, and think smart about what you eat., 384281=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 380982=Other than that, I love the Chemistry courses the most. Xavier makes Chemistry fun and interesting. Warning: Biology not so much. I think they were weeding the CHEM PrePharmacy students in the spring semester in 2015. The first test in biology was an average that is on a very low 60% range. I was one of the lucky few who made a B on their first test., 250060=Xavier is located 10 mins from the world famous Bourbon Street if you ever need a get away from the study life. If the night life isn't your scene there are tons of restaurants to go get lost in the local cajun cuisine. Being one of the first major ports in the New World, New Orleans is rich with French flavor as well as many interesting historic sites.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Always be ready to work when you come to class Always use planner Utilize the fact the professors are constantly there to help to you Organization is the key to a smooth college life and transition Bang for the buck Xavier is definitely worth the money because you can go to no other school and receive a better education. This is true because you are given the chance to succeed. The school works with you no matter any issue you may. Money is never a problem because if you do the work the school will work with you to keep you in school and try to do as much as they can to help you stay in school. Am enjoying being here Xavier is a very small school so the campus is very intimate. You get the chance to know everyone. Our campus is very active there is usually an event going on no matter what day. The Fraternities and Sororities are very active on the campus and give you multiple opportunities to do volunteer work and just to be involved with the community. We are not the biggest party school but campus life is great. Safety is also a top priority on the campus Am learning a lot",
