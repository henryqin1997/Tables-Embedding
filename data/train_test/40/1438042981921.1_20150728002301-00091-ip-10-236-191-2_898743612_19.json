            "NU is great for liberals and wealthy students.",
            "There is a rock with a plaque that literally says that nothing happened there.",
            "Northwestern is not very good about giving aid for middle class ($100,000) income families.",
            "There are lots of a cappella shows, plays, talks, and parties going on every weekend. Chicago is not too far, going on the train. If you bring your car, take Lake Shore Drive because it's faster than the Edens Expressway.",
            "The food is, well college food. It definitely gets better the later and hungrier you go. Make sure that you inspect your plate and cutlery because sometimes they can be dirty. Football players/athletes normally go to Plex in the late afternoon. Allison and Sargent have the best food. However, especially if you live on South Campus, there are a good amount of food options in Downtown Evanston.",
            "The bathrooms are definitely not the cleanest, but hey, that is college. Open the bathroom handle with your elbow because plenty of people do not wash their hands at dear old NU. The dorms range in size. PARC, NMQ, SMQ and Shepard have small rooms. Rogers House is somewhat large, but there is no air-conditioning. Beware of incidents in the hallways of Bobb-McCullouh and Elder on the weekends. People tend to get rowdy there.",
            "This school is very difficult and will challenge you in many ways. It is not for the faint of heart. That being said, try your best everyday. Take the hardest classes in the fall and you will be fine.",
            "Take AP classes, lots of them. The best ones to take are language because if you get credit, you don't have to take two years (6 classes) of a foreign language. Also, if you are on a pre-medicine path, start studying chemistry the summer before your freshman year. It will make it much easier. Also, don't take two distros at the same time (ex. two literature courses or two history classes) because you will go insane. Also, if you did not take calculus in high school, take the 212-213-214 calculus course sequence. It is much more manageable than the 220-224 series.",
            "This is a very difficult school that will stress you out quite often, especially if you are an engineering or pre-medicine major. They are not very good at providing financial aid for middle-class students. However, there are many clubs and activities to involve yourself in."

The university has purchased some area hotels.I chose to live off campus because they offer apartments and not dorms and you had to share with 5 people. The new apartments require less roommates. They just added a food service option this 2012 academic year, which is a real plus., 78435=We paint a giant rock over and over, but you have to guard it first. Also, along the lakefill are these giant rocks which also get painted. Dillo Day is a concert that goes up at the end of May and lasts all day. Primal Scream happens the Sunday right before finals week when everyone goes outside and yells., 257619=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2998=Northwestern offers so much to students that it seems like too much. There's plenty of different social scenes (Greek life is a big one, but you don't have to be in a frat or sorority to be social), plenty of arts and entertainment, hundreds of student groups, opportunities for work, research and internships, volunteer groups, easy transportation, great dorm life... The professors I've had were generally really accessible, too. Again, the problem with all the NU offers is that it's hard for someone to have a job, be in a sport, be in ten extracurriculars, double major, volunteer, do research *and* have a normal social life without getting three hours of sleep and having no time to eat or relax. A problem I've encountered is that the course listing is difficult for freshmen. Upperclassmen and declared majors get class registration priority, so freshmen and undeclared majors have slim pickings when it comes to classes. I haven't met anyone who got into all the classes they wanted to. I'm ambivalent about the quarter system - it's nice that you only have to take four classes at a time, but when you take a class you like, it's upsetting because it's over so quickly. It's also nice that you get to go back to school in September, but on the other hand, you have to stay around until June. It's really easy to get distracted with all of Nortwestern's small faults when you get used to all it has to offer.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Come visit! Evanston is wonderful and campus is beautiful at first glance and once you get to know the people. Build a resume TRUE TO YOURSELF. Contact a current student to get a feel for the real experience if you can't make it to campus. Talk to the financial aid crew here... they have some great packages! Bang for the buck I don't have another experience to compare this too. Northwestern comes with a hefty price tag but the resources, outlets, professors, activities, and student programs are innumerable and incredible. You can make every dollar count if you try. Am enjoying being here The kids here are talented, smart, intellectual people but no one is uptight. The student body knows how to party like rockstars and still debate political policies over brunch on a Sunday morning. The work is heavy but stimulating and interesting. Professors and TAs alike are incredibly helpful. The students are diverse in ideas and interests. People are NICE. and we're right near CHICAGO, an amazing city. But you'll have an awesome time even if you never leave campus. Am learning a lot I came to college to learn lessons beyond the liberal arts.",
