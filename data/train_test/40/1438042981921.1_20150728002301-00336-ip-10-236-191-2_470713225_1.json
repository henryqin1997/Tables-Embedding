A The premise was great, and it was certainly hard to put down--until the author started going overboard on exposing the back-story of each character. At the same time, despite the melodramatic back-stories, the characters seem more like archetypes than real characters: the Egotistical Actor, the Heroic Yet Traumatized Soldier, the Saintly Woman Wronged. The dialogue seemed forced. Certain stereotypes about Muslim terrorists, the over-sexed French and emotionally frigid scientists also rubbed me the wrong way, and (as so often) I have a few nits to pick with the historical details. The conclusion felt more like an exercise in narrative structure variation than a satisfying and believable course of events. All the same, it was better written than much of what's available, and I did enjoy reading it. ...more",

Connie Willis feelingly portrays the gorgeous day-to-day heroism of Britons on the homefront during the Blitz, and the \"unintended consequences of time-travel\" conceit allows readers to increasingly appreciate just how narrowly the Battle of Britain was won.
