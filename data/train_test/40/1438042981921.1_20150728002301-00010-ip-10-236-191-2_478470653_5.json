Each plate can be provided with a first and a second means for selectively removably engaging the plate with two other plates, or can be provided with only one means for selectively removably engaging the plate with one other plate, or can be provided with no such means as desired. The present invention comprises one bone plate with at least one means for selectively removable engagement with a second bone plate, and further comprises a plurality of bone plates each provided with at least one C-shaped channel for selectively removable engagement with another bone plate. As shown in FIG. 12, when an end of a second plate member which is configured and dimensioned identically to the first end 63 of plate member 62, as detailed above, is disposed within the connecting C-shaped channel or cavity at second end 65 of plate member 62, first connecting screw aperture 72 of the second body member can be vertically aligned with second connecting screw aperture 74 of plate member 62 so that a straight bone screw can pass through first connecting screw aperture 72 of the second plate member and second connecting screw aperture 74 of plate member 62 so as to selectively removably engage plate member 62 with",
