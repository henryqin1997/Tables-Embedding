            "I've heard of people who are scared to walk around at night, but that is not the case for me. I dormed last year and whenever I'd have to walk home late from the library or a friend's dorm, I'd feel pretty safe. I never encountered any danger at all, and I didn't even feel endangered walking alone.",
            "There's always the beach, which you can go to pretty much any time of the year because of the awesome weather! Then there are parties as long as you know people around.. The REC center is pretty nice and it has a huge pool which is always good. There are a lot of things to do, as long as you're willing to look for them!",
            "Sometimes there is good food, but others there seems to be nothing good to eat. It really depends on the day. Also, towards the end of the semester, food gets worse...",
            "Dorm life is great for meeting people. You are constantly surrounded by strangers and it makes it that much easier to meet other students. Also, most people dorm Freshman year, so everyone is pretty much going through the same thing all year long. The dining hall food gets repetitive, and RAs get crabby around finals time, but other than that, it's a great experience.",
            "Some classes are hard, others are easy. Honestly it depends on the subject and what teacher you get. Some people prefer taking difficult teachers who know the subject well, and others prefer taking on easy teachers who make class seem like a joke. It's up to you.",
            "Be ready for a lot of walking. The campus is huge and requires a lot of walking time to get from one class to the other. The weather is great for the most part, so you will hopefully enjoy the walks!",
            "CSU Long Beach is amazing. The diversity and number of students on campus makes it easy to find people you like wherever you go. The weather and campus scenery are beautiful."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{579638=The campus is beautiful, and HUGE. They are incredibly impacted, and aren't accepting ANY applications for Spring of 2013. Seems like a good school., 249654=It depends who your teacher is . Some teachers don't really care about your grades so it your responsibility to ask other people you know at the school such as friends or family members and see if they are good teachers. Also they are trying to change a lot of things for the next incoming freshman's of Fall 2012 which will make it more difficult to receive scholarships. As long as your grades in High School Are Good, Your Straight., 1114968=CSULB has one of the most diverse and well-rounded campuses. For Fall 2014, our university was the #1 most applied to school in California! There are so many clubs, organizations, and opportunities to become involved that you will always feel at home at CSULB., 1063889=I got into every school I applied to, even some Ivy's. I chose CSULB because of its prestige and mainly its cost effectiveness. CSULB has been named among \u00e2??America\u00e2??s Best-Bang-for-the-Buck Colleges\u00e2?? in a new list released Aug. 26 by the Washington Monthly. It does the best job of helping non-wealthy students attain marketable degrees at affordable prices.\u00e2?? CSULB appears at No. 6 on the list of colleges and universities from across the country., 732751=Make sure to have at least a 3.0 gpa and/or 1300 on your SATs this school is one of the harder CSUs to guarantee admission., 25378=The food and dining services at California State University Long Beach provide students with an excellent variety of places to eat at. The Nugget Grill and Pub, located near the Bookstore, is an excellent restaurant that offers popular sport games on a big screen television for all students, it has the best turkey burger and provides students with the perfect social ambiance. During the 2010 FIFA world cup, student flocked The Nugget to watch Spain and Netherlands fight for the gold cup. Then there is The Outpost, a delicious restaurant to attend if you need to grab a quick bite before class. Located near the Engineering and Journalism buildings, it provides students with affordable fast food such as pizza, sandwiches and salad. Adjacent to the Outpost is a small convenient store that has all the necessities a student needs such as food, refreshments, scantrons, pencils, pens, paper, etc. A favorite coffee shop among all students is Starbucks, which is located in the library. Known as one of the best coffee shops around the world, it serves all the students at my university who need a quick wake up before class or even after a long day of studying. Affordable coffee for coffee lover and addicts, it is definitely one of the best places to grab a delicious coffee on campus. I give my university five stars because of the affordable prices, delicious food, and excellent services., 4351=I enjoy CSULB. The students are all pretty chill (for lack of better terms) and there are many diverse food venues. Every Wednesday at noon bands play near the Union Center. There are movie screenings every two weeks and a Student Rec. and Wellness Center will be finished in fall 2010 (rock climbing wall, beach vollyball courts, yoga/fitness classes, pool, indoor track, workout machines, juice bar... yata yata). Plus its close to the beach and downtown Long Beach where there is always something going on., 844368=The academic level seems to be very advanced and the program I'm planning on attending in spring 2014, looks really qualified, so I'm sure that I could become a better psychologist at CSU, compared to the study in Denmark, 540394=Long Beach is very affordable for students paying instate tuition. However budget cuts and the new unit cap for the Fall 2012 semester are a huge impact on the school., 1046324=Common joke around campus: Our football team hasn't been defeated since 1991. That's because we have no football team. Baseball is the biggest sport of choice here. Also, if you are looking for a fun fact about Long Beach, the most popular one is that the school has one of three pyramids in the US., 72134=Be sure to look at the General Education requirements and what classes you need for your major. They're important for you to take in order to graduate. Definitely try to see if a class for your major can be considered for GE. Also, see if you have to apply for your degree. Like for film, you have to apply in the January of your second year., 995639=I was a resident assistant for Spring 2013 of my freshman year. This was one of the best decisions I had made, and would do it again. Definitely a place where housing is good., 1141902=The food is better than first anticipated. They are rebuilding Hillside dining hall, so the food should be better in Spring 2015/Fall 2015 at latest. Parkside and Beachside both have good options constantly., 701263=There are several art installations throughout campus, as well as a bell tower with no bell. It rings unusual tunes, and one is never sure what they'll hear. A student swears up and down he heard the Imperial March from Star Wars once.}",

    "textAfterTable": "YES! despite the economic status and budget cuts AND rise in tuition everywhere, it is still one of the least expensive universities in California. The campus is still running many programs which have a big outreach for students (psychological services, scholarship center, career development center, student support service program, student life and development, women's resource center intramural sports and wellness and associated students inc.) Plus they offer book rentals which make accessing GE books cheep and easy. Am enjoying being here I enjoy CSULB.
