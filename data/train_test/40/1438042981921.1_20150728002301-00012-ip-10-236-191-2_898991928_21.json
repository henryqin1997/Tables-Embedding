            "If at all possible, bring a car. Public transportation isn't very reliable, and the school is very secluded from many fun places. The closest Wal-Mart is about 4 miles away. Doable, but you might not want to carry your groceries that far. Also, GET INVOLVED. It is one of the best ways to meet new people and have something to do. Service is a big deal here, so many classes will require you to do community service in order to pass. Make sure you do it, and go to all mandatory events or you will get additional service hours. If you want a bigger school, this is not the place for you. It is a great school, but very quiet and small. Be aware that their is a mandatory attendance policy for classes. If you miss 6 hours or more, you fail the course. Not all professors follow this policy, but most do.",
            "I have found Barry University to be a wonderful investment. If you aren't serious about your career just yet, and are looking to party more, then you might not want to spend as much money here. Tuition is expensive, but Barry is very good about giving financial aid, especially if you do well in high school.",
            "While some people hate how small the college is, I love it. I have found the staff to be very helpful, and the school hosts lots of events such as dances and trips off campus, many of which are free. The dorms are your typical college dorms. The food gets old after a while, but again, that's part of the college experience.",
            "Most of the professors are very invested in their students, and will help you outside of class with anything you need. I am a member of the Honors Program, and the HP classes are very interesting, especially PHI 191. If you are willing to work hard and study you can learn a lot."

Make sure that you know deadlines for payments and the changes made to your account 3. Park in areas that you can park, otherwise your car will be towed and you will get a ticket. 4. Join an organization or more, and be involved. 5. Most resident Halls are not that bad, just remember its an old university but in Fall 2012, there will be a new resident hall & if you can apply to live in the houses around campus. 6. If you are not Catholic, Barry doesn't mind they will accept anyway. 7. Focus on your studies, the better that you do the more that will shine. 8. Moonlight Madness is one of the most sporting events that the school hosts., 146762=It's expensive because it's a private university, but the classes are smaller which is better for 1:1 time. I think it's worth the money., 409028=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 29180=The food here is AMAZING for about the first four months, then you get sick of it. I stopped eating at the WOW by about January and started eating at the BUC stop, which can be pricey. So i stocked up on lots of snacks, noodles, mac n cheese, and it worked out. I didn't even like walking to the student union to eat so the snacks worked out well., 273001=If you are looking for a party school, Barry is not for you. The teacher student ratio is about 1:20. Beautiful and peaceful campus with people who truly cares about your success here at Barry., 259913=The University is catholic based and it was founded in 1940, it was all girls then, it became co ed in 1960, there are a lot of old buildings and structures around. There are foxes on campus, Yes Foxes!}",
