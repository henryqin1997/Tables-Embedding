            "Winthrop has a variety of clubs and club sports such as Quidditch, fencing, Ultimate Frisbee, soccer, volleyball, and Swing dancing. There are also several campus ministries, such as RUF(Presbyterian), Wesley (Methodist), and BCM (Baptist), that you can get involved with.",
            "There are several options for on-campus dining, but it won't be the same as a good home-cooked meal. If you don't want to eat on-campus, there are places nearby for off-campus dining.",
            "Living in the freshman dorms will give you a chance to meet people because most residents leave their doors open. The suite-style dorms give you your own bathroom, which is nice.",
            "The small class sizes make it easy for you to ask questions and the professors are available during office hours. The difficulty of the class definitely depends on who your professor is and what the class is, too.",
            "Try to get involved with at least one club or some kind of activity during your first semester. I did this and it helped me to meet a lot of people and connect with a group that have similar interests."

The faculty are also top notch and that transcends into the type of students that make up the Winthrop student body. I love to study and get good grades. I fit right in at Winthrop. For this reason, I am hoping I receive this scholarship so that I can continue at Winthrop in Spring 2014., 457291=You really CAN'T beat it. Washington Monthly named Winthrop one of America\u00e2??s \u00e2??Best Bang for the Buck Colleges\u00e2?? in its 2013 College Guide Rankings edition. Nationally, Winthrop was ranked 93rd out of 349 public and private universities and colleges that were named \u00e2??Best Bang for the Buck.\u00e2?? In the master\u00e2??s degree-granting category for the value ranking, Winthrop came in at 37th out of 152 institutions. Both of my parents are working 2 jobs each to try to send me to Winthrop. However, although this is the very best school for the money, I have been unable to secure the funding to continue at Winthrop. Your help would be greatly appreciated., 440378=Ghost Tours in October to share more about Winthrop's History, 289580=Worth the money. Small student body, small student to teacher ratio (about 15:1 at most). Lots to do on and off campus, just about everything you need in walking distance., 506089=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 460996=Winthrop is a GREAT school because of it's student support system at the Student Resource Center. As a result my persistence and their willingness to help me, my first semester grades improved with each exam. For this reason, I am hoping that I obtain this scholarship so that I will be able to continue at Winthrop University in Spring 2014.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Prospective teachers, art majors, biology majors Tips for prospective students Get to know your advisor. Bang for the buck A teacher I had my first semester here said, Winthrop is like the beauty parlor of SC universities. You get private school attention for a public school price. It's a small school and the teacher to student ratio is very comforting. Am enjoying being here I have never had better relationships with teachers as I have had in my first two semesters here. Am learning a lot I never thought I'd learn so much pursuing a Computer Science degree from a liberal arts college. The classes are small so you receive individual attention from teachers who really care, and are more than willing to meet with you after class to help you with anything.
