            "I feel extremely safe on this campus. Haven't heard of any incidents since I've been here. The school keep the campus and the students pretty safe here.",
            "Since I'm in my first semester not able to get involved with the Greek Life just yet.",
            "Like any other college and Universities there are plenty of Clubs, social events and activities on campus you can get involved with at Florida Memorial. They are well know for keeping the students busy. You will never be bored.",
            "Well they have a pool room and I play basketball but on the weekend I try to visit South Beach or Bayside. There's plenty to do in Miami or I will just relax around campus.",
            "The dinning area is alright and the food is not so bad. Its not moms or grandma cooking but since I've been here I haven't lost a pound.",
            "Dorm life is good. I have meet a lot of new friends and classmates. But I must say they do have some very out dated dorm rooms. They do have new dorm room and they are in the process of renovating a lot of these dorms but other than that I love it here.",
            "The course's are challenging but not too difficult to overcome. The instructors at Florida Memorial are very helpful. They pride themselves to make you pull out your best potentials and to help you do your best and be your best in their class.",
            "If you're coming from out of state like myself make sure you do your research on the school you choose. Check everything from classes, teachers, to dorm rooms. This is my first time ever leaving home and I wanted to make sure that I fit in when I got on campus. This is my second home.",
            "My decision to attended Florida Memorial University was base on one thing and that was getting the best education that I could get. A small school with a large passion for its students."
