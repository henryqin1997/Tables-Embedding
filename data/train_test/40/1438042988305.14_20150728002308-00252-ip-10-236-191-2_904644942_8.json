You can go shopping, see a movie, go out to eat, play a sport, walk around downtown....If ever you feel like you want to go for a drive, you can drive to Cocoa, Orlando, Viera, Rockledge, or another nearby place. There's this little place between Melbourne and Orlando called Harmony, and I know at some point (I think maybe January or February) they have this festival (Dark Sky Festival) where all the lights go out and telescopes are set up in a clear spot near some horse stables....communal star-gazing. It's really quite wonderful. :) Personally, I just hang out with my friends. The majority of your fun isn't something you have to find. It's right in front of you, in the people you love and in yourself., 37931=They have rolling admission, but if you get everything in by early January then you get priority consideration for scholarships (check fit.edu/e-mail the admissions department or your admissions counselor for the dates for the year you're applying). You'll also know the decision in some cases in just a few weeks! Same goes for the FAFSA, file early and you'll get priority and also in the past there have been early filer grants where if you file your FAFSA before a certain date you'll get another 1,000 for that year (not this year so they may not be doing it again). ***If you visit and attend a campus tour, half-day, or full-day event, on campus then you get another $1,000 per year automatically if you attend! It's worth the visit - you can get into Florida early and go to Disney, see a game, explore Melbourne or the state, go to the beach, and get some more money for tuition!, 135129=Florida Tech is a campus that is busing with international flavor. I started as a freshman in 2010 studying aviation management / flight. Florida tech offers a very wide varieties of degrees to chose from. Sports and recreational activities are all over the campus. Although small there is always something to do on campus or within the town of Melbourne. Florida Tech is a bit on the pricey side of colleges on the coast but i am confident in what i'm paying for., 150143=Become friends with the RAs, the residence hall dorms are a lot larger than you think (except for Roberts Hall). Study math and grammar over the summer so you don't have to take the introductory classes. Join a sports team., 386278=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students If your looking for a peaceful, small, urban college, this is the place for you. There is a lot of activity because FIT is located in a city, but it can also be very relaxing because the beach and the harbor is only 15 minutes away. Bang for the buck The tuition is very expensive, but most of their grants and scholarships pay for most of it. You definitely get what you pay for from your classes, but they could improve on their library. Am enjoying being here",
