They put on a fall carnival for students and their families in October, they have movie showings every once in a while in the student center, there are many wellness seminars and get-togethers for those who are looking for a group of encouraging people to exercise with.

Some programs change requirements and some 4 year schools change what they will transfer., 152544=It might not be a huge campus, but it gives the welcome and warmth of any other college I have visited. Not only is in driving distance, it has many encouraging staff members and advisors. I'm fortunate to be going to that college in the fall of 2012., 78887=FRCC is amazing. Starting in the Fall of 2011, I was able to gain the knowledge I needed to succeed in classes as well as other places.
