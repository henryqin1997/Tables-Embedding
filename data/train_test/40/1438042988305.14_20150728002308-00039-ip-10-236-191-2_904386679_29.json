            "This campus is safer than my high school ever was! The campus police are always around to make sure that nothing bad is happening. If there is an emergency, there are these polls where you push a button and it alerts the campus police. The campus police are always there for you!",
            "Greenville Tech is great for the type of students who like small class sizes and challenging work!",
            "This school is worth the tuition that you have to pay (which isn't that much)! They give you the quality teaching time that you need, and the teachers make sure that you understand the material, so you're not just confused for the whole semester.",
            "There are plenty of things to do for fun at Greenville Tech! There are many clubs and organizations, and sometimes, the teachers even tell you about some of the things that they're in charge of; and it all actually sounds like fun!",
            "Although I have yet to actually have some of the food at Greenville Tech, I have been in the dining area. It is ALWAYS clean and sanitary!",
            "I currently do not live in a dorm, so I really have no feedback on this aspect of the college-but I heard that it's great!",
            "The course work is challenging, which is a very good thing! It makes you really think about the material and it makes you feel like you actually learned something.",
            "If you're thinking about spending a year or two at Greenville Tech, you will not regret it! One thing you have to make sure you do ahead of time is take the placement testing and fill out your FAFSA. Both of those things are essential! Another tip, relax! The first day is always crazy, so you're best to get there a hour before your class so you can find parking and find your class.",
            "Greenville Technical College is a wonderful school to attend! The classes are small, so it's really easy to focus on what the teacher is teaching. The teachers will do everything in their power to help you understand the material and pass the test."

    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor the classes are very easy. the most challenging courses i have taken are the biology courses, but even they do not require intense studying. i have been able to obtain a very good gpa without having to study around the clock. Tips for prospective students make sure you do research and ask around about the professors you are getting. the teacher can be a difference between a good class experience and an a, and a withdrawal halfway through the semester. In three sentences this school helps you to get accustomed to college and is very cheap. the college does have some professors who are not very good at what they do and may have been teaching for too long. overall the school is a decent option for those trying to raise their gpa to get into a better school, or for someone who cannot afford to pay the money for a 4 year school all 4 years.
