While the invention has been described in detail with reference to a preferred embodiment implemented in GaAs, other structures may be employed by the skilled worker to implement the invention, including such compound semiconductor families as AlGaAs or InGaAsP. Thus, it should be apparent from the foregoing that the invention includes a number of variations and different embodiments which the skilled worker may readily implement. A lateral optical waveguide boundary may be formed in the waveguide layer by ion implanting impurities in the waveguide laser in a region surrounding the desired V-shaped optical path between the terminated end of the optical fiber 34 and the vertical diffraction grating 30. Such an implanted region is the shaded region of the integrated circuit 20a in FIG. 8 and in FIG. 9 and also the shaded region of the integrated circuit 20c in FIG. 8. The FET control circuitry 104 has other electronic outputs coupled in like manner to the outgoing fiber 90 via a 1.33 micron laser array 106', a 1.5 micron laser 112, a narrow-band VDG 108' and a broad-band VDG 110'. The FET control circuitry 104 routes data it has received at 1.55 microns from either of the two",
