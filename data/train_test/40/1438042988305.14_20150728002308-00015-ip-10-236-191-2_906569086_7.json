A normal course load is four 4-credit courses per semester. Thus any open spaces will be filled with core courses, requirements of your specific major, and/or electives Pre-medicine program: curriculum options and suggestions If you choose to initially follow a slower path [such as Option E, Option F or Option G], you should recognize that after your first year you will have to double-up on sciences, and/or plan on applying to medical school after your senior year, rather than your junior year. Additionally, keep in mind that medical school admissions committees look carefully at your ability to handle a heavy academic load successfully, so taking a full academic load is important. 4. Are you concerned about your science background and wish to begin slowly with science courses [i.e. one science per semester]? b) Most of the science medical school prerequisites are sequential and cannot be taken out of order. Also, it is not good to take one part of a two semester sequence at one school, and the second part at another school. Each school designs their own curriculum -- courses from one school are not necessarily interchangeable with another school. a) Medical school prerequisites should be taken at CSB/SJU. Many medical schools discourage taking science prerequisites during summer school, and will not accept",
