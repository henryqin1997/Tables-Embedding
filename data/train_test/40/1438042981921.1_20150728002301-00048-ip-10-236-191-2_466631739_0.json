            "This minor release fixes compilation of radiusd with gcc version 4.3.0 (or later), which overly optimizes some code. It does such a remarkable job of optimization, that reduces a perfectly valid code to explicit dead loops in the produced object files. To avoid this, starting from this version GNU Radius will be compiled with -fno-strict-aliasing. I can only repeat after Linus Torvalds, that \"the aliasing code in particular is not even worth enabling, it's just not possible to sanely tell gcc when some things can alias.\"",
            "The syslog statement (file raddb/config) takes an optional 3rd argument specifying the syslog tag to use, e.g.: channel default { syslog local1.info radiusd; }; New attributes: GNU-Server-Address Holds IP address of the RADIUS server that recieved the request. Notice, that the value of this attribute is \"0.0.0.0\" if there are no listen statement in your raddb/config. GNU-Server-Port Holds UDP port number of the RADIUS server that recieved the request. Autoconf function AM_GNU_RADIUS is provided, for checking if GNU Radius is installed from configure.ac scripts. Guile support requires Gule version 1.8 or later. Bugfixes: Pass NAS-IP-Address to mlc_stop_query.",
            "Licensed under the GPLv3. The libgnuradius library uses its own namespace. Wildcard matching in raddb/hints considerably improved. The new code supports everything wildmat used to support plus allows to select arbitrary parts of the matched string using \\( and \\) grouping. Fix builds on non-glibc systems. Fix handling of max-port-count statement.",
            "Hints are evaluated before verifying the user name validity. New builtin functions in Rewrite language: time, strftime. Exec-Program-Wait and Scheme-Procedure can occur in hints profiles. Rewrite expressions are allowed as values of Exec-Program and Exec-Program-Wait pairs. Bugfixes: Properly protect occurrences of define in scm4 files. Explicit assignments in naslist flags were incorrectly parsed. Rewrite functions correctly handle strings, containing nul characters. Fix format string vulnerability in sqllog (IDEF1590)",
            "See the announcement.",
            "This release fixes the following bugs: The first two file descriptors were not closed when launching a program by Exec-Program attribute, which, if the program was printing something on stdout, interfered with normal inter-process communication. Fixed timeout computation in RPP code. Radtest no longer requires libreadline",
