    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. Similarly, utilization of two BTSes to determine the mobile's position will use the strongest signals (presumably a direct or nearly direct signal path) to determine the mobile's position from two possibilities determined from TDA information. The use of these two position determining techniques, both signal strength and TDA information, tends to ameliorate the effects of these signal anomalies. Of course, as previously discussed, the effects of these signal anomalies may be further ameliorated through the use of redundant position determinations such as the use of information maps or signal detection at additional BTSes, if desired. It shall be appreciated that the above discussion has assumed substantially direct communication between the mobile unit and the various BTSes in order to simplify the description of the inventive concepts involved. However, it shall be appreciated that the methods of the present invention will provide an accurate determination of a mobile unit's position even when multipath signal reflections or other signal anomalies cause by structures are introduced. For example, the information map of the first preferred embodiment will simply record exemplary information which includes the effects of these signal anomalies. Additionally, the communication between the communication network and",
