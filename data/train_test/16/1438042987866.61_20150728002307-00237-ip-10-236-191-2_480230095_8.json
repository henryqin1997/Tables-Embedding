Thus, the illumination successively of light of red, green and blue color is sensed by monochromatic solid state image sensing elements and stored in synchronized with the illumination in each frame memory or the like. These signals are read concurrently from these frame memories during regeneration to provide a color image., 24406=Moreover, in prior art as disclosed in Published Japanese patent application No. 90685/1978, three color filters are rotated by a motor to illuminate the three primary colors successively by a time division system. In this prior art, the filter should be rotated at a substantially high rate of rotation for regenerating one frame in 30 seconds as so images on conventional color televisions, which rate of revolution requires a relatively large motor. If the number of color filters attached to the supporter disk are increased, the rate of rotation may be reduced but the load is therefore increased excessively to cause the motor to overload.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It is obvious that embodiments differ within a wide range can be structured on the basis of this invention without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. Thus, the present invention should not be limited by any particular embodiments except by the attached claim of this invention. Moreover, as shown in the embodiment of FIG. 9, the color image sensor of successive color modes can be achieved by incorporating three color filter 16 and liquid crystal panel 112 at the pulpillary position of objective lens system 3. In the above-mentioned embodiments, the light transmitting portions and reflecting portions of three color filter 16 and liquid crystal panel 112 comprise stripes, but the invention should not be constructed to be limited to such stripes. When the light from illuminating lamp 13 is incident directly to the condensor lens system, a shutter disk may be provided between the lamp and the condensor lens system. This embodiment is advantageous in that no reflector 14 is required. Namely, three color filter 16 is bonded with the concave surface of concaved liquid crystal panel 112 in which portions applied with a voltage on the concave surface comprise reflective portions and residual portions comprise light transmitting portions or non-reflective portions. This embodiment is different from the seventh embodiment in that three color filter 16 and liquid crystal panel 112 are not attached between condensor lens system 15 and illuminating",
