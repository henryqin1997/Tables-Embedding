As expected, both the mRNA and protein of mPGES-1 were not present in the lungs of mPGES-1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 2A,B). The protein expression levels of mPGES-2 and cPGES were not significantly different in mPGES-1\u2212/\u2212 and mPGES-1+/+ mice treated with saline or bleomycin (Figure 2B). The PGE2 content in four groups of mice was as following: the mPGES-1+/+ mice with saline (2763 \u00b1 415.2 pg per mg protein), mPGES-1+/+ mice with bleomycin (1101 \u00b1 249.6 pg per mg protein), mPGES-1\u2212/\u2212 mice with saline (1631 \u00b1 353.9 pg per mg protein) and mPGES-1\u2212/\u2212 mice with bleomycin (312.8 \u00b1 128.5 pg per mg protein). Although bleomycin treatment reduced PGE2 content in the lungs from both mPGES-1\u2212/\u2212 and mPGES-1+/+ mice, it resulted in a more pronounced reduction in the mPGES-1\u2212/\u2212 mice (p < 0.05) (Figure 2C). The LTC4 content in four groups of mice was as following: the mPGES-1+/+ mice with saline (101.8 \u00b1 11.94 pg per mg protein), mPGES-1+/+ mice with bleomycin (193.5 \u00b1 35.15 pg per mg protein), mPGES-1\u2212/\u2212 mice with saline (89.30 \u00b1 18.04 pg per mg protein) and mPGES-1\u2212/\u2212 mice with bleomycin (210.2 \u00b1 51.52 pg per mg protein) (p < 0.05) (Figure 2D). This data indicates that mPGES-1 deficiency does not exacerbate bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice via 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) metabolic pathway., 1314=Fifty micrograms of tissue or cell lysate were resolved in SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia, Buckinghamshire, UK). After blocking in skimmed milk (Applygen, Beijing, China), the membrane was incubated in primary antibody: anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA, monoclonal antibody, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, 1:1000), anti-fibronectin (FN, monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz, 1:1,000), anti-\u03b2-actin (mouse antibody, Santa Cruz, 1:2,000), anti-mPGES-1 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cayman, 1:200), anti-mPGES-2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cayman, 1:500), anti-cPGES (rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cayman, 1:500), anti-EP1 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cayman, 1:500), anti-EP2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cayman, 1:500), anti-EP3 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cayman, 1:500) anti-EP4 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, Cayman, 1:500), anti-TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz, 1:1,000), anti-p-FAK (CST, Beverly, MA, USA, 1:1,000), anti-FAK (CST, 1:1,000), anti-p-Smad2 (CST, 1:1,000), anti-p-Smad3 (CST, 1:1,000) or anti-Smad2/3 (CST, 1:1,000). Blotted antibodies were developed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence. Positive bands were quantified by a densitometer and the \u03b2-actin was used as an internal standard control., 3669=We used synthetic siRNA (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) for the experiment. The siRNA sequences for knockdown of mPGES-1 were sense: 5'-GGAACGACAUGGAGACCAUTT, and antisense: 5'-AUGGUCUCCAUGUCGUUCCTT; for negative control were sense: 5'-UUCUCCGAA CGUGUCACGUTT, and antisense: 5'-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT. MRC-5 cells growing to 80% confluence were synchronized by incubation in FBS-free medium for 24 h and then transfected with 0.1 nmol siRNA-mPGES-1 or siRNA-control using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After the transfection for 6 h, TGF-\u03b21 or other reagents were added into the medium for defined hours to study the role of mPGES-1 in the pathogenesis of IPF.}",

Measurement of Lung Hydroxyproline Content The hydroxyproline content of the lung for each group was quantified utilizing a Hydroxyproline Testing Kit (Jiancheng, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 3.9. Quantification of PGE<sub>2</sub> in Lung Thirty micrograms of lung tissue were resolved in 1 mL homogenization buffer (0.1 M phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA and 10 \u03bcM indomethacin). The samples were homogenized with a sonicator and centrifuged at 5000 rpm speed, and then the supernatant was collected. The content of PGE2 and LTC4 in lungs was determined using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Cayman) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. The PGE2 and LTC4 content was corrected by the protein content for each sample. 3.10. Statistical Analysis The results were presented as means \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Comparisons were performed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Student\u2019s t test, with a p value <0.05 considered statistically significant. 4. Conclusions In summary, we firstly reported mPGES-1 deficiency aggravates lung fibrosis after bleomycin exposure in mice. mPGES-1-derived PGE2 exerts beneficial effects against pulmonary fibrosis mainly via activation of EP2 receptor signaling transduciton. Activation of mPGES-1-PGE2-EP2 signaling pathway may represent a novel strategy for treatment of IPF patients.
