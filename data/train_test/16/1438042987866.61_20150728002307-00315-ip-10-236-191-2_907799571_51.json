            "HPU has 24-7 campus security on both campuses.",
            "HPU has no greek life.",
            "HPU has a huge variety of clubs and if we don't have it then you can start it!!",
            "HPU is great if you are looking to become more independent. HPU is known for its nursing, and marine science program. Though we have many other programs as well.",
            "HPU is a very diverse school, with many inter nation students, and people from all over. This is the school to go to if you want to meet people from other countries. HPU also has a tradition of holding an annual Intercultural Day, where all the cultures at HPU can hold a booth to tell others about themselves and their traditions.",
            "The tuition is a lot, but you will never have a class over 25 students, and all the teachers are awesome, and they are truly invested in your future.",
            "Well its Hawaii!! You can go the beach, the park, go hiking, go clubbing, go shopping, see a movie, golf, bowling, ice skating. Plus tons more stuff to do. Don't let the fact that its an island make you think there is not much to do.",
            "The food here is great!! Sure, its not your moms home cooked meal, but its usually quite good. The only downside is there is limited hours that the cafeteria is open.",
            "The residence halls are great! Each building holds about 30 students and so we are a family away from home. Everyone looks out for one-another, and its mostly freshman. There are many activities going on each month to be involved with, and each individual hall does movie nights and stuff. The only downside is the campus with the residence halls is a little away from everything so you either need to take the shuttle, the bus, or have a car.",
            "Most of the classes are pretty straight forward. There can be a heavy workload once you get into the higher up classes but the majority of teachers are pretty laid back.",
            "Just because its Hawaii does not mean that its going to be sunny all the time. It does rain here, and once you are used to the weather it does get a little cold. SO pack a couple pairs of pants and a couple sweaters!",
            "HPU is a great community! Everyone here is super nice and very helpful! We have many great teachers with great programs!!"

But please, please, please, don't give in to your feelings of wanting to go home. They pass, I promise. I'm 6,000 miles from home. Believe me when I say that I was homesick but I came home for summer and could not wait to return. You will too., 259786=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 7592=Although this is just my first semester and third month at Hawaii Pacific University, I must admit that it has been, so far, the greatest three months of learning I have ever received since grade school. I am currently taking five courses: COM 1200, WRI 1100, CSCI 1011, ARTS 1000, and MATH 1105. The instructors I have are profoundly passionate about what they teach. Furthermore, HPU instructors remarkably do their best to help when students are in need of assistance. Students are free to let the instructor know whether or not the pacing of the lecture is too quick, too slow, or just right. When students are stressing before a test, HPU instructors carefully explain to the students what to know and review what will be on the test. In COM 1200, I have learned that mid-terms, finals, and other tests are a \u201ccelebration of knowledge.\u201d With that in mind, I became more excited to learn about new concepts, new lessons, and further my knowledge than simply skim at through the surface of new ideas. One of the most important things that I have learned in all my classes is the importance of understanding. I realized how each of my professors has taken into account that not all students are at the same level of understanding. Therefore, each professor would ensure that they are teaching at the level to which all students are able to understand what is going on in the class. Especially since there are foreign exchange students, I condemn my instructors for clearly explaining the syllabus and what is expected to earn an A for their class. HPU professors really take the time to ensure that students receive the full education and learning they paid for., 147622=Current dorm life is less appealing than one would wish for a school in Hawaii. The dorms are located on the Windward side of the island where it is more isolated and rainy. It is not east to get anywhere from here, so most students opt to live in apartment buildings near the downtown campus. However, HPU has recently acquired Aloha Tower, and iconic center right on the water near the downtown campus. The university plans to build dorms there for students to live. These dorms are expected to open by 2016. Aloha Tower would be a prime location for student life., 51913=hpu is quite expensive but the experience here is priceless. for example during my final exam in my mars 1020 class on the boat, we all stopped the exam to follow a group of manta rays and green sea turtles. what other school can offer that?, 245876=If you don't get into the actual dorms at the Hawaii Loa campus you end up living in basically a motel in Wailkiki. I've heard rumors of a new dorm location in 2015, they are converting an old shopping center called Aloha Tower. Walking distance from the downtown campus! Don't count on it being available until it's officially announced however, things here are often on Hawaiian Time.}",
