    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in connection with one or more embodiments, it is to be understood that the specific mechanisms and techniques which have been described are merely illustrative of the principles of the invention, numerous modifications may be made to the methods and apparatus described without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The present invention provides a vision system that is capable of generating an image through the fusion of dual images from a single receiver. The fusion of dual images improves image clarity of a target area. The present invention provides the fused images without generating artifacts from misregistration between adjacent images or image signals, such as between an illuminated image signal and an adjacent non-illuminated image signal. Also, the present invention is capable of generating active night vision images without being negatively affected by non-host vehicle light sources. The above-described steps are meant to be illustrative examples; the steps may be performed sequentially, synchronously, simultaneously, or in a different order depending upon the application. Also, The above-described methods provide gradual merging of the illuminated signals with the non-illuminated signals, as opposed to abrupt switching therebetween. The gradual merging provides images of the target area 24 that appear natural and realistic. In performing steps 200-216 the system 10 prevents blinding and saturation from illumination beams generated by vehicles in",
