    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{8256=This is a large, well built trampoline. We have had it since Christmas 2014. Assembled by the dealer (highly recommended), anchored to the ground (another great feature) and has the basketball net (the kids love this). I feel that with one kid on it at a time, it is 100% safe. That of course is hard to do, with multiple kids, just like any trampoline, the kids should be near equal size as you can easily land on each other. Flips are forbidden as they could cause serious problems. Great height, the net is strong also. We use it EVERYDAY and even at night with a light near it; we have had severe winds, snow, etc... and it has done well. We have not had to lower the net at all. Bottom line is that this trampoline so far is top quality. The other we looked at was Vully and we liked this one better. We have friends that have had these for longer with no problems. Premium price but a premium product. Hope this helps., 9995=My son loves to bounce up and down. He has severe autism and first was introduced to trampolines at a sensitive Santa day at Springfree. He fell in love with trampolines and Santa after that! We bought a trampoline at the beginning of March and rain or shine he wants to be on it. He doesn't have too many activities he can participate it freely with ease, but jumping on his trampoline is definitely one of them. We are so grateful for our trampoline and highly recommend Springfree. They are kind, patient, and extremely helpful! Thank you Springfree}",
