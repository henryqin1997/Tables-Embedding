A.J. says he needs to keep the ball down to get back to where he was in his first two starts, which were very good (although his numbers obviously don\u2019t show that any more). Jackson has pitched pretty well for the Nats. He hasn\u2019t been un-hittable or anything, and still has had some wildness issues\u2026but the Pirate bats went awfully cold again over the weekend. This Nats staff isn\u2019t all that likely to help them heat up. Let\u2019s flash back a couple months, shall we? The Pirates were looking to spend big on a starting pitcher. Jackson was one of the most attractive arms still on the market, and it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to think the Pirates could afford him. One night, we took it upon ourselves on Twitter to convince him to sign with the Bucs. It didn\u2019t work, of course, but it ended up being really funny, trended in Pittsburgh, and Jackson himself even responded. Shortly after he turned down a good offer from the Pirates and signed with the Nats instead, the Bucs went out and got Burnett. So basically, it\u2019s the guy the Pirates wanted against the guy they ended up getting. Edwin Jackson (1-1, 3.69) vs. A.J. Burnett (1-2, 8.04) Tonight\u2019s starters\u2026 The Nats",
