    "textAfterTable": "What to do for fun There is always something that you can do on Campus at CLU. There are sports games at least 2/5 days of the work week and there are different clubs that meet every single day. From College Republicans and Democrats, to the Philosophy Club, to the Gospel Ensemble, there's always a way to keep yourself entertained when you need a break from studying. Student Life also organizes tons of outings to local places for CLU students to relax on Friday nights. Food and Dining The food in the cafeteria here is pretty good. The Centrum, however, has such a variety of delicious food that you could try a new food every day for a month! There's also a place to grab snacks called the Purple People Eater, which is located in the middle of the classroom area. Oh, and did I mention there's a Jamba Juice on campus, as well? Dorm Life The residence halls (aka dorms) at CLU are wonderful! Each suite has it's own bathroom area so you're sharing a bathroom with about six people instead of the 100 people that live on your floor. If you're super social, there's always someone that you can talk to, but if you need to get work done, there are study rooms set aside",
