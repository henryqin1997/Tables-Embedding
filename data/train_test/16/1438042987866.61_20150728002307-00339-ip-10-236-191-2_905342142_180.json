            "There is a lot of work that goes into making sure UF students are safe, including late night buses and transportation to ensure people get home safely after a certain time. There are police scattered throughout campus readily on call and on duty. Emergency notifications are sent to all students whenever there is something going on in campus, so you will always know what's happening. Even so, knowing when to be out, locking your doors, and making sure to stay safe is strongly suggested in order to make sure that you are doing your best at keeping yourself safe at all times.",
            "Fraternities and sororities are not essential to the college experience, but certainly you will be living up the true social life by joining one. Find a fraternity or sorority that really fits you and you'll find friends that will probably last a lifetime. The greek life is truly what makes the college social experience so much different from high school, so it is recommended that you at least try it out!",
            "Clubs and activities are a central part of UF. There are clubs for different religions and races, alongs with shows, performances, and events planned for each of these clubs. There is a club fair at some point during a preview session that you go to before coming to UF in which all these clubs, some of which are open to all, but others targeting a more specific group, are able to present their mission statement and share more about what they do so you can see if you're interested in which club.",
            "If you're the type of student who loves to be social and interactive, willing to try new things, creative and open to experience, then you'll have a blast at UF. IF you're the type of student who loves to be isolated, loving to enjoy a quiet read in the library, and play music by yourself, you'll also find a place here. UF is made for everyone, and there is no discrimination on what type of personality you have. You just have to find the right spot and people who share similar values and goals as yourself and no matter what, you'll still live the college experience.",
            "There are some really unusual traditions and locations on campus, but some of my favorite are the dance marathon and the underwear run. For the dance marathon, you literally dance for 26.2 hours straight, and it is a super fun (but tiring) experience. The underwear run is even more unusual, but the title says it all; one night, a whole bunch of college students go and run around campus in their underwear.",
            "Certainly, college is one of the more expensive experiences that you'll come across in life. However, UF is definitely worth it. The teachers and experience that you get from this campus is a value worth much more than money. If you happen to live outside campus, there is a great system called the RTS, which is a bus service that can take you almost anywhere around Gainesville and back to anywhere on campus. It's free for UF students and is a great resource. The only complaints are that living on campus is relatively expensive, as is the meal plan, and with any college, the books can feel a bit too pricey as well, which is why it is better to order some stuff online or buy used from others.",
            "There's so much to do at UF because there's always events going on. Whether you enjoy playing pool or bowling in the game room at the Reitz, enjoying a nice book to yourself in a study lounge at Library West, or playing ball with a group of friends at the gym, there should not be a time when you say that you are bored, while you are on campus and not in class.",
            "You can get meal plans at UF or you can just go around to the various restaurants scattered around campus. There's even a vegan restaurant known as Krishnas that provides very healthy, cheap lunches in the plaza at UF. If you're looking for quality food, there's not a whole lot of options on campus, but for variety and convenience, UF has it all.",
            "Dorm life is a fun, social experience, where you get to bond with people whom you may have never hung out with before. You really grow close with the community and the people there and hopefully your roommate as well! It's very easy to get around campus while living in the dorm, so it's really a great experience for first-year students.",
            "This will vary depending on major, but most likely you will stumble across some fairly difficult classes. Chemistry, biology, physics, and calculus are usually doable, but some people still have problems. But when it comes to classes such as financial accounting, organic chemistry, and the like, that's when people really freak out. When it comes to that, make sure you know how to manage your time and understand your priorities. That party may sound great, but really, you need to think about your future and what your real goal is as a college student.",
            "If you know some upperclassmen, utilize them for help and resources. Their knowledge of the campus and experience will go far in helping you have the smoothest transition from high school to college.",
            "UF is a social hub of some of the brightest and funnest people in Florida. There are always new people to meet, of different races and religions, and places to go all around campus. The professors are approachable and really know what they're doing."

Aim for an SAT and ACT score within their middle 50% (somewhere between a 1900 and 2100 for the SAT and 27-31 for the ACT) or better, and make sure to take many rigorous classes in high school. Also, show a passion for attending UF in your essays or elsewhere on your application., 582346=i guess we're safe... there's blue emergency lights scattered around the campus, a separate police dept for uf, and scan-card dorms, but rapings and suspects with guns have been reported to the students via email and text just in fall 2011. oh and some shots fired... but i haven't seen anything, which is good. just make smart choices. the person who got raped, got in the car for a ride to campus with an elderly male she didn't know., 613241=there is so much to do at the university of florida! in the reitz union there is a game room with a bowling alley which is always a lot of fun. uf also has gator nights every friday night, where students can go to the reitz union for free and partake in a bunch of activities including midnight breakfast. they also show movies in the reitz union on fridays. there are also about 1000 clubs at uf as well as multiple sororities and fraternities. lastly the gator nation is very big on football. there's nothing like being in the swamp cheering on the gators with your gator family., 911913=There are numerous blue light emergency posts everywhere on campus, and guarantee police assistance within 60 seconds of when the button was pushed. A free snap transportation service is provided, which gives students a ride anywhere on campus after 3:00 AM., 49808=UF is one of the top 50 universities in the US and a great education for a tuition of about $4000 a year and housing is about $2000 for each semester is an amazing deal. If you received Bright Futures you really only have to pay for housing (and of course books and food.) UF also has many research opportunities with top-rated professors available for undergraduates., 48916=Apply as early as possible, way before the November 1st deadline. The earlier you apply, the earlier you can apply for housing (if you are planning on living on campus.) I find that living on campus is really convenient, where you can literally wake up ten minutes before your class and still make it. Off campus has it's perks but it costs about the same as on campus housing and you have to take the bus (which are often times always late.) I suggest living on campus for at least your first year. Also, UF seems to emphasize this quite a lot but GET INVOLVED! Try something new! Get new experiences!, 820345=There are over 1000 student organizations, if we don't have the one you are looking for it is extremely easy to create one yourself., 611633=the university of florida has about 1000 clubs with everything from a quidditch team to clubs for intramural sports., 939581=Dorms are not my thing. I stayed in them and sharing a bathroom with many girls is not what I enjoy. A plus for dorms is that you can meet a lot of people and you are right on campus so classes will be closer, as long as your 7:30 class isn't on the opposite side of campus, you will be able to enjoy every second of sleep., 502966=The campus is gorgeous (besides the weather in August and September, but that's horrible everywhere in Florida)! For being such a large university, it's really easy to get involved in organizations., 322695=The French Fries is a favorite sculpture near the Marston Science Library done by artist John Henry that was placed on campus in February 1989. Though the actual name of the piece is Alachua, named for the county which the city of Gainesville calls home, it still remains a notorious landmark often referred to when giving directions to campus visitors and Freshman. Another popular sculpture around campus, The Potato, is located near Turlington Hall and serves as a popular meeting point. Krishna Lunch, a full vegetarian meal, is served daily in the Plaza of the Americas for dirt cheap, and it is delicious!, 246201=Home to almost 1000 campus organizations, UF offers something for every student that attends. From greek life to skydiving to intramurals, almost anything you can think of will probably exist at the University., 172699=Like I previously mentioned, there are almost 1000 clubs and just about anything you can think of. There are tons of intramural sports and workout facilities all over campus!}",
