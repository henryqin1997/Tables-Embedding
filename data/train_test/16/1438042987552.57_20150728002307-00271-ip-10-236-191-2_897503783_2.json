With the exclusion of one apartment-style building that is available for juniors and seniors, all dormitories are single-sex and members of the opposite sex are only allowed to visit during a few open house hours each week. Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol are not allowed. Freshmen have a curfew of 12:30 on weeknights and 1:00am on weekends for the first semester. Dancing is technically allowed, but it is a controversial issue in the Church of the Nazarene, so we don't have organized dances. These rules are manageable for many people, but prospective students should be aware of them before deciding on ENC.}",
