If he flounders he goes the way of Garret Mock a similar right-hander. Perhaps the pitching coaches can get him right then they have another starter in 2013. That is how the Nats surely see him : as a starter not a reliever. And it does look like they are going to have to scramble a bit to put together a starting rotation in AAA. I guess its started., 79485=Yo Anon 2:19, read the reports. Elevated testosterone. And tests showed there to be the presence of synthetic testosterone.This ain't pot., 70760=Taking the second test is more PR than anything else. Chemists and players know there are random tests. So they make and use stuff that is only detectable for a short period of time. You can give a second sample at some future date with complete confidence.And of course MLB knew Braun had failed a test when MVP voting was happening.Just like they knew JC Romero tested positive in September 2008, let him pitch in the World Series where he won 2 games, and then announced his failed test.Ah well., 81105=To clarify, the quote I'm going off of is: \"While Braun tested positive for a substance that triggered a violation of baseball\u2019s steroid-testing policy, that substance was not a performance-enhancing drug, a source close to Braun said Sunday.\" Rosenthal at http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/ryan-braun-tests-positive-even-if-clean-major-league-baseball-is-not-121011, 100321=gonatsgo said\u2026So many posts during the winter meeting \u2013 now a break. Hoping for something new today. Following the Braun debacle and glad it's not a nat.December 12, 2011 6:44 AM______________________________________________________________________I agree.We need a fix!______________________________________________________________________I also want to just say that I believe that I'm in the majority on this board when I say that we detest the name calling. This is a great board and when the discussions get to a level of immature personal attacks it just pollutes and cheapens the experience for the rest of us.

Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 65068=fwiw, the ESPN story also says this:Appeals usually are heard by arbitrator Shyam Das. One of the people said the appeals process is not likely to be concluded until January at the earliest. That person also told the AP that after being informed of the positive test, Braun asked to have another urine test taken, and that the second test was within normal range., 13843=It's not a big deal, but I think the Nationals came out ahead on this swap. OK, Perry\u2019s \u201cbig moment\u201d in Detroit was giving up Nelson Cruz\u2019s walkoff grand slam in the playoffs last year, so it\u2019s best for everyone that Perry get some distance. On the plus side Perry is a year younger than Balester and throws harder. On the minus side he is no more accurate than Balester, and doesn\u2019t have the \u2019stache cred that Balester brings to the table.More important even than 'stache cred is that, if my calculations are correct, Perry still has one remaining minor league option and Balester does not. Players get three option years \u2013 years when they are on the 40 man major league roster, but spend some time not on active (25 man) roster. Both Perry and Balester have spent part of 2009, 2010 and 2011 bouncing between the majors and the minors (Balester actually started his yo-yo routine in 2008).OK, but if a player has fewer than five years of professional experience, he can be sent to the minors for a fourth time without clearing waivers. Ryan was drafted in 2008 and thus has less than four years of professional experience. Balester began his professional career in 2004, and so seems to be out of minor league options., 1107=The impetus of the trade, from the Nationals\u2019 perspective, might be the roster flexibility it will provide. Balester will be out of options in 2012 and thus can\u2019t be sent to the minors without first passing through waivers. Perry, meanwhile, has one option year remaining, allowing the Nationals to retain his rights even if he doesn\u2019t make the Opening Day roster.}",
