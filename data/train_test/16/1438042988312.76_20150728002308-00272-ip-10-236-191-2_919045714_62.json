            "My experience at Pace has been good. It met and exceeded my expectations in every area, especially on the teach-student relationship. There's no need to slack off, and asking for help isn't as threatening as it was in high school.",
            "You're in downtown New York City, what more is there to say? If that's not enough there are several campus activities waiting for you attend; just have to look them up.",
            "Food is excellent, the only problem I can see for students is in wasting the balance in their meal plans! All food is fresh, and they even have sushi chefs. What more could you want?",
            "Dorm life is great, you're in the middle of downtown, and the school is only a few blocks away, or even at the school itself! Traffic won't stop you from getting the rest you need.",
            "It's tough, so no slacking!",
            "Be on time, talk to the professors; make a relationship with them. And above all else do not be intimidated by how others may look or act, chances are they are the same as you.",
            "Pace is a place for diversity, you won't find another campus with so many different types of people in the area. Teachers and other faculty actually care about your performance and will help you reach your goal. Bottom line, Pace is a school for anyone hoping to achieve their dreams, whatever they might be."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Pace is a private institution that is quite costly. What helped me to make my college decision was the amount of scholarship money I received. Pace provides 95% of its students with merit based scholarships and financial aid, so there is help in paying for school. Is it a bang for the buck? I would say so considering I believe it is a great school with numerous challenging courses that will help me to become a successful business woman. Am enjoying being here I love being at this school because there is always something to do. Whether it be a club event inside school or the thrill of city life outside of Pace's doors, you will never be bored. The university provides a friendly, welcoming environment that is definitely carried on in the classroom as well. Am learning a lot I am a freshman at Pace and I feel that I have definitely learned a lot. Though I have been at Pace University for one semester so far, I am doing excellently, holding a GPA of 3.8. The teachers are extremely friendly and helpful and are very knowledgeable of their material. Login to rate or flag the",
