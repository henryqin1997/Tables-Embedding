            "Literally nothing happens in this town and the campus is very small so everyone is pretty safe.",
            "Greek Life isn't supported very well by the campus. There are no fraternity or sorority houses on campus and they don't seem like they are much of an honor.",
            "Very inclusive, there is something for everything.",
            "Animal Science majors - specifically equine, Elementary Education majors, or students who prefer a small town setting.",
            "There are squirrels everywhere and if you get caught harassing them, you can get fined and your name will be printed in the newspaper.",
            "For the price, River Falls is exceptional. I believe it is the cheapest school in the UW system.",
            "There is not a lot to do for fun in River Falls. Most people go home on weekends leaving it a ghost town.",
            "The food on campus is disgusting. There are not a lot of places to eat in town, either.",
            "The freshman dorms are pretty average, but the sophomore suites and upperclassmen dorms are extremely nice.",
            "Don't expect too much.",
            "The University of Wisconsin-River Falls is a great choice if you live in the area since most students go home on weekends. It is the best choice in the state if you want to study equine science, and is also a good choice for dairy science or if you would like to become a teacher. If you don't like traveling into Minnesota or to another town to do literally anything, look elsewhere."

Luckily, you can get a transfer meal (if you're on a meal plan, which freshmen are required to have) at the retail dining areas on campus and at the UC Convenience store. Retail dining includes an Erberts & Gerberts ( a sandwich shop), St. Croix Grill (beef and burgers), Noodles and Greens (a pasta/noodle/salad place), and Petes Creek Market (a variety of foods like chicken tenders and macaroni and cheese). There is also a coffee shop, Peregrine Park, which brews and sells Caribou Coffee items. The UC convience store offers a transfer meal of a sandwich, chips, and milk after 7:00 pm.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here For me, campus is a lot of fun. It is a balanced mix of academics and fun. There is always an option for an entertaining activity throughout the entire week, even between classes! It also like that I am only an hour from home so I am far enough away that I am on my own but I can also drop in on my parents anytime I need to also. Am learning a lot Even in classes that I took similar ones in high school, there is always something new to learn. You get many different perspectives and are given the opportunity to explore them and choose for yourself. I've already gained more knowledge about myself and this glorious world in my first semester here than I remember gaining in high school, and I still find it exciting every day!
