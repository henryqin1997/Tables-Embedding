    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{75191=I've never written one of these before, but I liked Grammar Girl enough to sign up for an account. G.G. is a quick and to the point podcast, which is rare. Heck, some of them don't even have a point to get to, which makes this podcast stand out. Grammar girl is an animated speaker, and she makes what could be a very dry subject matter into amusing little 5 - 10 minute shorts. Like her cheerful logo, she's bright, helpful, and educational., 105672=Copyright \u00a9 2014 Apple Inc. All rights reserved., 73299=I'm a college Junior majoring in English. I feel I'm reasonably good with grammar, but there are often grammar points that confuse me even still. Grammar Girl's Q&D Tips really have helped me in writing papers and helping my boyfriend (who is a writer and college Senior) edit, correct, and improve his stories. This podcast has helped remind me when to use \"who\" vs. \"whom\", and how to properly use prepositions. (Yay! They CAN be at the end of your sentence in certain circumstances). I keep the episodes to listen to over and over, and refer back to them when I am writing. The episodes are the PERFECT length - short and to the point - and Grammar Girl uses excellent examples that are easy to understand, which is helpful when you can't remember quite what a prepositional phrase actually is. This is a great Podcast for anyone: students young and old, businessmen and women, writers, admin assistants, or ANYONE who writes emails, business letters, press announcements, technical documents, papers, stories - whatever! Thanks to Grammar Girl, I will endeavor to stop using two spaces at the beginning of a sentence, since most the time it's unnecessary. :) GET THIS PODCAST! You really won't regret it!, 76300=I love listening to this podcast on my way to work... as a Spanish teacher, every day is a grammar day and you have given me great explanations to help my students better understand concepts that can be daunting. After having been a subscriber for only two weeks, your podcast has already put to rest one of the grammar battles that has been raging among teachers in the World Languages wing for quite awhile...and let's just say that you helped to prove that I was right yet again! Thanks, Grammar Girl. Keep up the good work!}",
