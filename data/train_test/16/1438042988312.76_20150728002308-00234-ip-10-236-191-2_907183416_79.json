            "The campus safety is pretty good. There are places around the edge of campus that should be lit more, but on campus it's not bad and there are emergency buttons throughout.",
            "There is Greek life here but it isn't a major thing that's as prominent as other colleges and universities.",
            "There are multiple clubs and activities on campus. However, more awareness needs to be made for these things.",
            "Clarion is great for students who don't want to be a big city and are focused more on getting a degree than getting drunk every night. Also, it is a great school for business students.",
            "There is an apple on campus in which any one can write/spray paint on it.",
            "The price of Clarion is definitely great, but the curriculum isn't too rigorous and the atmosphere on campus isn't overwhelmingly great either.",
            "There is a mall with a movie theaters and a few stores. There are also activities and current movies being played every weekend.",
            "The food here is pretty good and they try to have a variety of places/things to eat.",
            "There are many places to live in Clarion. I live in the traditional dorms and they aren't too bad. They are a nice size and very clean. The cleaning staff is so nice as well as the CAs. The only downside is that the traditional dorms have community bathrooms, but that is going to change once they finish building the other ones. The campus also have suites and more apartment like living called Reinhard Village.",
            "The academics are can be challenging at times. It just depends on the class and teacher.",
            "Make sure that you visit the school before you attend.",
            "Clarion University of Pennsylvania is small, rural school located in Clarion, PA. It provides opportunities for success, like internships and clubs. It has a diverse amount of degrees, specifically in business."

In October all the leaves change in Clarion and a week long festival is held in town. Vendors and rides sweep through, and the town becomes the mecca of activity. There is a Crafter's day, where the main street is shut down, and tons of hand-made crafts, are put on display, and also a parade leading to the stadium for our homecoming football game., 21816=Keep yourself in a good mood and surround yourself with things that you enjoy. There are so many options of things to participate in, so many people to become friends with, and so much down time to study and keep your grades up. Also, check the weather before you go home for the weekend, you never know what you'll come back to; there was a snow storm in October and it is currently over 70 degrees in mid-March., 339362=Clarion has a student-run University Activities Board (UAB) that plans events once a week. All of these events are 100% free to students and often end with participants leaving with free goods. There is also a free movie screening at 11:00 PM of saturdays at the Hart Chapel. Other than that, there is not a ton to do., 337542=Clarion University is a small campus located in the middle of Western Pennsylvania. The University makes effort to involve and attend to students in the same institutional manner as any other University; University organizations, events, scholarships, and alumni association. Yet, to reiterate it is a very, very small campus with, currently as of 2013-2014, as shrinking student body., 4018=-Having a car on campus is a lot easier than taking the bus! -Get flex points with your meal plans. They really come in handy and the food at the Gemmell Student Complex [where you can use flex points to pay] is a lot better than it is as Eagle Commons. -Get snow boots early, because it can snow as early as October. -Rent your books instead of buying them from the bookstore. Most of your textbooks you won't want to keep and you don't even get half of their original price when you try and sell them back., 47795=- Join an organization or club! You will make a lot of friends here. - In the fall, go to the football games. - Don't miss out on going down to the Autumn Leaf Festival (ALF) in October., 17689=Supposedly, a few old buildings on the campus are haunted. Every October they go on a paranormal ghost hunt. Also during October, Autumn Leaf Festival (ALF) allows us to be pardoned from class to participate in the festivities. Every Spring, at CampusFest, there is a big performer; such as Kesha or Mac Miller., 141661=Greek Life is a wonderful opportunity. I joined Delta Phi Epsilon in the spring 2011. I met over 40 loving, outgoing, and caring sisters. I also met many others that are in other sororities. I can guarantee that there is absolutely no hazing., 301292=During finals week in both the spring and winter semesters, the university offers a late night breakfast with professors. This activity includes a free breakfast meal to all students. There is music, dancing and is an all around great time. Also, in the Fall of 2013, Clarion University Alumni Association constructed an apple in the center of campus. The apple is used for students to promote on campus activities by being spray painted., 343533=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 217050=ALF week in October is made out to be such a big deal but its lame and a disappointment.}",

I like being in the college-town atmosphere. Tips for prospective students Make sure you check all of your possible options first then if you feel comfortable then make the best of what you have. Bang for the buck This was one of the main reasons I came here. Clarion is an excellent value. Am enjoying being here I love being at college but I know that it can always be better. Am learning a lot I've learned something new everyday. Login",
