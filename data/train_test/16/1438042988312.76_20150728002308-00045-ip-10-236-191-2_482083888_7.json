White, \"Considerations in High Fidelity Moving Coil Earphone Design\", IEEE Trans. Audio, pp. 188\ufffd194 Nov.-Dec. 1963)., 85885=14. Landgarten et al., U.S. Pat.

Ogata, Modern Control Engineering, Prentice Hall, 1968., 86496=20. Nagayasu, U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,218, Jul. 2, 1991., 77408=In other words, the FFT device 400 or algorithm is used to compute the sample spectra of the noise and speech signals. A push to talk or digital VOX 132 is used to determine speech from noise. The digital VOX or algorithm (code and programming provided below) preferably uses the following test statistics to determine the speech from the noise: sample zero crossings, changes in the number of tonals, energy, and a nonparametric test such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test on the sample data. The Spectral Subtraction processor 130, in the absence of noise, updates a sample power spectrum of the noise. When speech is detected, the phase is computed from the spectrum, the noise spectrum estimate is subtracted from the speech spectrum, the phase function is restored, and additional reconstruction constraints based upon the number of tonals detected in the noise and the shape of the noise spectrum are used to reconstruct the speech signal with attenuated noise., 86736=23.

Kuo, Automatic Control Systems, Prentice Hall, 1965., 33644=Although these publications describe numerous acoustic noise suppression techniques, they fail to provide an acoustic noise suppression technique as set forth in the present invention. For example, in Borth, a noise estimation means generates and stores an estimate of background noise based upon a pre-processed input signal; a noise detection means performs speech/noise decision based upon a post-processed signal; and the noise detection means provides the speech/noise decision to noise estimation means so that the background noise estimate is updated only when the detected minima of post-processed signal energy is below a predetermined minima. A key difference between the present invention and Borth is that the present invention employs an improved speech detection means utilizing delays so as to minimize any possibility of lost unvoiced consonants, preferably by use of an adaptive non-parametric detector statistic based upon a Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, to more evenly discriminate speech from a given user from background noise consisting of several voices., 38668=Thus, the prior art fails to provide a noise cancellation and speech enhancement system and apparatus as described in the present invention. More specifically, the prior art fails to provide a noise cancellation system including a spectral subtractor and a push-to-talk or VOX switch which enables a speech/noise determination by use of test statistics including, for example, sample zero crossings, changes in the number of tonals, energy and a nonparametric test such as a Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Further, utilizing a spectral algorithm with a LMS algorithm in a noise cancellation and speech enhancement system and apparatus, as in the present invention, has not been taught or suggested. Furthermore, a noise cancellation system wherein the spectral algorithm not only employs the above-described test statistics, but also includes a constraint function for minimizing residual musical noise, as well as a tracking device to identify tonal noise components and predict trajectories thereof, as in the present invention, has not been taught or suggested. Further, the in-ear and in headset (or handset, e.g., for telephones) devices of the present invention which utilize the previously mentioned features have not been heretofore taught or suggested., 37636=Stettiner is akin to Borth and likewise fails to teach or suggest a VOX switch with a push-to-talk option for determining speech from noise. In the present invention which is a voice detection means (algorithm) is streamlined and robustized by using inter aIia, a nonparametric test such as a Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Cantrell addresses the dominant harmonic by essentially using a phase locked loop approach to control a notched filter. While the present invention focuses on speech enhancement, by the use of adaptive filters, the present invention is able to work with a wider variety of modulated signals, as well as with several given signals at a time. Elliot relates to zonal quieting to control the phase of a propeller or fan and does not appear to relate to speech enhancement. Likewise, Hill is concerned with reducing noise in rotating equipment, such as, a fan, and does not appear to relate to speech enhancement as in the present invention. Zinser merely provides a variation on the LMS algorithm., 85992=15. Zeigler, Jr., U.S. Pat. No. 4,878,188, Oct. 31, 1989 (\"Zeigler 188\")., 86816=24. Chance, Jr., U.S. Pat.

The headset includes a reference microphone, feedback microphone, speaker, housing (e.g., a plastic housing) and wires coupled to the processor. The A/D interface converts the voltage levels and impedances from those of the microphone to those required by an A/D chip for optimal (minimum mean square error) quantization.
