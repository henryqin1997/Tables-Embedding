            "UIC is cheaper than a lot of other universities, but any college is still expensive.",
            "You have access to public transportation, so go explore the city!",
            "The cafeterias do not have many options for vegetarians or people who want to eat healthy.",
            "Not many people dorm at UIC, but it is still a great way to meet people your first year. They are very overpriced though, and you'll save a lot by commuting or living in an apartment nearby.",
            "Many of the science classes are really difficult, and some of the teachers are not the best. I've had great experiences with mathematics and teaching classes though.",
            "Get involved! Also, get a planner and organize your time well so that you have balance in your academic and personal life.",
            "UIC is a very diverse school, and there are plenty of opportunities to get involved. It is located in Chicago, which allows for many great volunteer and job opportunities. It has many great professors, but it also has some pretty awful ones."

Also, there are 1400 emergency call stations across campus which allow immediate Police assistance with the push of a button., 430279=Due to it being so close to downtown Chicago, UIC campus security is very efficient in the sense that they do the best job possible to keep students safe. You do get the crime alert reports but most of the time it's because a student was being risky and was walking at 3:00 am by himself., 329234=My Freshmen yr in 2010, food was crappy, however returning my sophomore year the CAF was completely redone and the food got alot better. The staff is very friendly and its best to develop close relationships with them!, 295429=The professors are brilliant, campus is nice, it's in the city, and it's right next to the train! I took the summer program offered for incoming freshman and met so many new people, I already feel comfortable going to college and I'll be a freshman this August.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The teachers are very knowledgeable. A lot of them encourage everyone to take advantage of their office hours, and they are always there when they say they will be. It is always important to check out your professors on ratemyprofessors.com as some teachers are definitely a lot better than others. Each teacher has his own teaching style and expectations, so make sure you are clear on what exactly those are and you will be fine.
