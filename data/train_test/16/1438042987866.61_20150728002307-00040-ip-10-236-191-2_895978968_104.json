            "We're in downtown Atlanta, so safety is our number one concern. We have the best campus police in the state, so no crime happens on campus.",
            "There's plenty of frats there, whether they be traditional or multicultural or whatever other type there are. The frats party like all other ones, and they all seem to have the same brotherhood. Oddly enough, the greek population at Tech have higher average GPAs than the non-greek population, which is opposite than normal schools.",
            "I will guarantee there is a club for everyone here. Whether you're looking for a minority group, a sports club, or some type of gaming club, we got it. And everyone wants to ensure that their club is best possible for its members.",
            "Come to tech if you: Are a nerd. Were bullied in high school Want to succeed in life Hate U(sic)GA or are a human being.",
            "Don't even get me started on traditions, we have a whole article on wikipedia if you want those. There's an observatory on the top of our physics building with a beautiful view of the city as well.",
            "Tech is honestly one of the best places to go if you want a job after college, which is usually everyone's intent. We have one of the, if not the, highest returns on investment, with a 90% job placement rate.",
            "There is always something going on around campus, whether it be a club meeting, a performance, or a random petting zoo in the middle of campus, there is always something to do. Or you could just go chill with your friends, or study if you're into that kind of thing.",
            "The dining halls are good, but you will get sick of them. In the student center theres a Chick-Fil-A, Dunkin Donuts, Taco Bell, Subway, Pizza Hut and the Food Court, which has all sorts of multicultural foods, but the best place on campus is Highland Bakery, it seems a little pricy, but it's so worth it.",
            "Some of the dorms aren't so great, but the housing office picks the best RAs possible to make it enjoyable, along with all the events they have planned throughout the semesters.",
            "Like I said, Tech is hard, because most everyone is an engineer. Engineering is hard. Other majors have it difficult too, but the classes are worth the work.",
            "DO NOT let the stress get to you. Tech is hard, but that doesn't mean you have to close yourself off in your room. If you work at it, you can have plenty of time to do other things, like clubs, which are highly reccomended. The moment you let it get to you, you lost the game.",
            "Georgia Tech WILL prepare you for the real world. Its hard, but all engineering is hard. The students there have a real sense of spirit and welcoming, so everyone is welcome there."

It looks a lot like soft serve ice cream and students will put sticky note sprinkles on it., 360011=Don't let the classes take you by suprise. You were smart in High School, but so was everyone else at this place. You will discover quickly that your 4.0 in High School and your 2100 on the SAT does not take you very far when you get here. Study hard, study soon, don't procrastinate, and don't get Bellassard for Calc 2., 537011=Engineering students, and nerds who want to make an impact. (2013 Convocation speech: If you want to change the world, you can do that, you're at Georgia Tech. If you want to build the Ironman suit, you can do that, you're at Georgia Tech!), 417581=Freshman cupcake race: at roughly 6:45 in the morning, freshman are HIGHLY encouraged to participate in a semi-short race. Bright side: everyone gets a cupcake at the end, and the two top-finishers get a whole cake!, 720750=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 644424=Stealing the T of tech tower has long been a tradition, but is now considered vandalism and is illegal. Over spring break 2014 the T was stolen, but the student was caught and had to face a judicial hearing. They were going to press charges but the alumni stopped it. It takes a lot of work to steal the T, as it has been wired with sensory detectors, and the climb up to get it is very dangerous., 500451=May not seem like the money is worth it at the time, but Tech has one of the highest return on investment rankings., 48480=Tech has an enormous list of ongoing traditions, and to name them all here would be impossible, but perhaps the week that is surrounded with the most tradition is of course Homecoming week. During this week, many events take place, such as the Mini 500, a tricycle race around Peters Parking Deck, which is led by the Ramblin Wreck, a 1930 Ford Model A Sport Coupe that is one of Tech's mascots. It also leads the football team out at every football game and has been doing so since 1961. Also during Homecoming week is the Freshman Cake race, a mad dash where the prize is an entire cake, as well as a kiss from the Homecoming Queen during the halftime of that week's football game. I'll close this section out with Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate, the name bestowed upon the Tech - uga rivalry. All you need to know right now is TO HELL WITH georgia! (yes, the lowercase georgia is necessary)., 138614=They have programs for Freshman that are always entertaining, and brand new (relatively) West Campus dorms that were built for the 1996 Olympians., 135246=i'd definitely recommend submitting your application by november 1st for those juniors considering applying to gatech. i found out about my admittance by december 16th!!! now i have a lot more time to plan towards next year :d}",

These students are serious towards their studies, but also like to be involved in clubs or sports. Also, students who are looking for a life in the city or near a city will enjoy being near Atlanta. Tips for prospective students 1] Please learn to manage your time. There is time to study, have fun, and just relax. Make sure to not stress yourself out too much! 2] Make sure to be involved in clubs in high school because it helps build teamwork skills needed in college. It is also good to have some leadership positions. Being active in high school tells a college that you are most likely to be an active student in college as well. 3] Study for the SATs and ACTs.",
