Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2SE This command was integrated into Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2SE. Usage Guidelines Once a policy has been identified or configured, it is applied on a target using the ipv6 snooping attach-policy command. This command is applied on any target, which varies depending on the platform. Examples of targets (depending on the platform used) include device ports, switchports, Layer 2 interfaces, Layer 3 interfaces, and VLANs. Examples The following examples shows how to apply an IPv6 snooping policy named policy1 to a target:  Device(config)# ipv6 snooping policy policy1 Device(config-ipv6-snooping)# ipv6 snooping attach-policy policy1 Related Commands",
