            "Liberty University has there own police department. They recently made a four way stop for an intersection that was seemingly unsafe for students crossing the street. They are always looking out for the best for everyone.",
            "There are so many clubs that you can join. There is the pre-med club, family and consumer science club, pro-life club, break dancing club, chemistry club, and so so so many more! The Student Activities department plans events almost every weekend for students to attend. From concerts to shows to carnivals, there will be something planned for everyone!",
            "Students who want to have a social life but also take school seriously will thrive at Liberty University. There are so many opportunities to make close friendships while also being able to pursue a worthwhile degree. Liberty University is the largest Christian university in the world. This atmosphere is so extraordinary that you will not find it anywhere else.",
            "Liberty University awards a large amount of scholarships to incoming freshmen that have worked hard in high school. Students with high GPAs and standardized test scores will be rewarded accordingly. There are so many amazing facilities that are available to students that this college experience will be so unlike any other place. The money that each student is responsible is so worth it because of all of the amazing moments that students get to be a part of.",
            "The LaHaye Student Union is a very nice facility. It is a full gym with a cardio room, basketball and volleyball courts, weight rooms, and more. Next to east campus, there are outdoor sand volleyball courts that are great places to meet new friends. There are plenty of places in town to visit such as the dollar movie theater, Sweet Frog frozen yogurt, and the Blue Ridge Mall. The Liberty sports games are certainly the most exciting games around. From football to soccer, field hockey and lacrosse, Liberty's sports are the best.",
            "From Dunkin Donuts to Doc's Diner, there is something on campus that everyone will like. The main cafeteria on campus is the Reber-Thomas Dining Hall. It has so much variety. There is a Chick-fil-a and a Subconnection, which is similar to Subway. The Bistro is a very convenient place for sandwiches on the go. There is a nice Starbucks in the bookstore and Jazzman's coffee shop in the library.",
            "Living on a hall can be one of the greatest experiences at Liberty University. With prayer leaders, student life directors, resident advisors, and resident directors, all students are placed under a group of responsible student leaders that genuinely care about them. Every hall plans individual activities, either with themselves or with your brother dorm.",
            "Whether you choose to be a part of the Honors Program or not, Liberty's academics should be taken very seriously. Liberty has an excellent Honors Program. Everyone is taught the same things, but Honors students get a chance to do a little extra in order to show their knowledge of the material. Most students are not Honors students, and still have to work hard for their grades.",
            "Be excited for convocation. You will get to hear some of the greatest speakers in the world talk about topics that they are fired up about. As a freshmen, choose to live on a hall so that you will be able to meet friends right from the start. It is harder to make friends in apartment-style living, although it is definitely still a nice option to have on campus. Take advantage of all of the concerts and activities that are planned. Liberty's Student Activities office is so creative and resourceful when it comes to having fun. Lastly, don't get too wrapped up in all of the fun activities and speakers. Take your classes seriously because your professors care about your education and you personally more than you know.",
            "Liberty University has a strong, Christian atmosphere that fills the campus with God's joy and love. It is a very large community of students, but between hall activities, intramural sports, and certain small classes, finding friends is made much less stressful. The facilities on Liberty's campus are phenomenal, and convocation is an enjoyable break from everyday classes."

The 2011-2012 tuition for graduate courses for online was around $438 a credit hour. That is cheap for graduate level., 141456=I LOVE being at Liberty! There is so much to do here, I'm still learning and this is my second semester. There's sporting events of all kinds (along with being an NCAA Division I school, there are also TONS of intramural sports to get involved with), movie nights with free refreshments, karaoke nights in the student union (aka the Tilley) concerts with well-known bands (Skillet is coming in December, woot woot!!) and so much more. There's paintball, there's archery. You can go to snow-flex (the mountain near the school is covered in artificial snow allowing you to ski, snowboard, and tube any time of the year). And then off campus you can go salsa dancing, swing dancing, head down to the dollar theatre, or you can go to every college student's favorite place: Walmart. There are always exciting things going on at Liberty, from white-water rafting trips to hiking trips to canoeing trips to horse-back riding. I'm pretty sure the only thing Liberty doesn't have is a roller coaster. They even built a skate park recently! I'm telling you, don't listen to people who say that Liberty is boring. There is ALWAYS fun stuff going on here., 84251=Liberty University is just amazing. This is coming from an actual student who is accepted and is definitely coming in the fall of 2011 if the finances are right. The biggest thing I saw about the academics is the love and passion the teachers have for glorifying God and striving to teach to the best of their abilities., 894308=Liberty University was easy to adjust to since I haven't been enrolled anywhere since 1979. The Professors are so hands on, there's no room for failure, unless the student does'nt apply themselves. What really caught my attention with Liberty is that's it's a Christian school., 289802=liberty university is a private school which means that tuition is rather expensive, but this school is worth every penny that is spent on it. the facilities at the school are exceptional, with new construction going on all the time. liberty is currently working on building a brand new library, along with tearing down old dorms and replacing them all within the nest few years. the professors are some of the most respecting in the teaching community, many are experts in their field also have been on shows on the history channel and have written many books. at convocation the speakers that come are for the most part exceptional, in my time here i have heard almost every single one of the gop nominees for 2012 speak, as well as other important people from across the world., 526147=Famous and important people come to speak in our convocations. Some people that have come just in the fall of 2011 are The Douggar Family, Francis Chan, Rick Warren, Derwin Gray from the NFL, and many more., 198982=The ratio student to teacher ratio is on average 25:1, which is so amazing since there are 12,000 students on campus. You really get to know your teachers and your teachers really get to know you. The education is 10x better because its more personal rather than having all lecture classes., 1119989=Excellent school. I attended in 1990, and could not continue. I started back in Aug '12 online. My experience has been awesome!, 309563=i attend liberty university on line. i am a non-traditional student at 54 years of age and disabled. i can only take 1 class at a time because of my psychiatric and physical disablities. liberty university is a great place to attend online. i started in the spring of 2011 and have passed every course with a b or better. my problem is that the way biology 101 is structured (17 weeks). to qualify for fafsa i have to be going to school on a 2 classed per semester basis. biology will cost me $925 to take by itself. this scholarship would be of great help to me and my family. i enjoy liberty very much and am pleased that it is a christian based university. highest marks to them,, 380772=The dorms at Liberty are nice and comfortable. I currently stay at the South Tower and I am happy with it. I like the girls on my hall and have made some great friends. If the dorm you are staying in requires a bit of walking to get to class or to get to the Vines Center like mine does, you can always wait for the bus and take that. There is curfew but in all honesty, it is not torturous. On the weekdays and Sunday, except for Tuesday and Friday, you have to be back on your hall by 12 am but you can sign out to go to the clab (ILRC computer lab) and stay until 2 am. On Tuesdays you have to be back by 10 to have hall meeting and go to your prayer group which is like a mini Bible study. Fridays and Saturdays you have to be back by 12:30 am., 730612=I graduated from Liberty in 2009 with a BA in Religion and found the curriculum challenging. I am now seeking to get my MA in Special Education and am looking forward to see what they have to offer., 325451=there are a multitude of activities and clubs in which to get involved. there is a jiu-jitsu club, sports clubs, sports teams and ministry teams for which students can audition. in addition, a new organization called band of leaders that was created in the fall of 2010 is becoming popular on campus. our mission is to impact liberty university and the world by creating god-made leaders who can share christ on campus, with the lynchburg community, and beyond., 1032302=LU does supply campus security, however. There is an additional security which is the Presence of The Lord! At LIBERTY University, there he dwells. 2 Corinthians 3:17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty., 13911=When I first heard about Liberty, I thought I'd never have the money to go there because it's an out-of-state, private, Christian university. However, it's not bad at all! I have friends who are at state schools that are paying more than I am. Liberty gives out many scholarships for little things like applying early, for how many years you've gone there in a row, having a pastor... Most of the scholarships are around $500 to $1000, but every little bit helps!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck After adding everything up on the college necessity list, it's normal to stress and need to step away to catch your breath, but with Liberty you can feel extremely secure in knowing that every penny is going to a strong establishment that is 110% focused on your future. Yes, its a private, Christian University, but its worth every penny. You have some of the best educators in the country at this school and amazing programs that will challenge you in every aspect of your major, but it doesn't stop there! Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, we have something called Convocation, which is pretty much like a HUGE chapel for the entire campus to come together and hear encouraging words from famous authors, musicians, artists, pastors, athletes and missionaries. So, on top of the great professors, we are taught even more by the visitors also interested in our callings. There's a gym, ice skating rink, basketball courts, an indoor track, indoor soccer and basketball arena, plus computer labs, curriculum libraries...EVERYTHING you could ask for. An additional plus about Liberty is the willingness to help in any way possible financially. Depending on one's major, their family's income, and even educational achievments like honor roll or high GPA, Liberty offers many scholarships in order to decrease financial burden. Am enjoying being here The campus",
