    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34908=The Pacific in early 1942, 40668=\u201cLieutenant Commander Edward N. \u2018Butch\u2019 Parker was a veteran of the Asiatic campaign of early 1942, where he had fought in several battles in the Java Sea as a destroyer division commander. This made him one of the only destroyer officers in the Navy with experience in the type of close-range night battle that Callaghan sought. It didn\u2019t seem to bother Callaghan that the Cushing\u2019s fire-control radar hadn\u2019t worked reliably since installation. The cost of that handicap was well compensated for by having an old salt like Butch Parker at the head of his line.\u201d, 33207=Three days later, on Dec. 10, the British battleship Prince of Wales and the battle cruiser Repulse were sunk by land-based bombers and torpedo bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, north of Singapore, off the east coast of Malaya. This loss of two capital ships was a strategic setback for the British, who had most of their navy in the Atlantic., 35661=After dark, on Jan. 23, 1942, Parrottwith three other old destroyers entered Balikpapan Bay, where, lying at anchor, were 16 Japanese transports and three 750-ton torpedo boats, guarded by a Japanese Destroyer Squadron. They fired several patterns of torpedoes and had the satisfaction of seeing four enemy transports and one torpedo boat sink as the Japanese destroyers searched aimlessly in the strait for non-existent submarines., 36878=\u00a0(A NOTE ON \u201cILLUMINATION.\u201d When I served aboard the battleship Tennessee (BB-43) during 1938-39, we conducted night battle practices, using star shells or huge searchlights to illuminate the target. Star shells, fired from our guns, would be timed to burst in the sky behind distant targets, in order to bring their silhouettes into view. For short ranges, the searchlights would be used, as they obviously were in this case.), 33572=Repulse was an old World War I battle cruiser carrying six 15-inch guns; Prince of Wales was a huge, modern battleship, commissioned early in 1941, carrying 10 14-inch guns. The dismay of the British Admiralty can only be imagined., 37327=Just a week later, during the battle of the Java Sea, on Feb. 27, 1942, now-Capt. Parker fought his ships boldly, going in unsupported anddelivering a successful torpedo attack against two hostile heavy cruisers and seven light cruisers. This forced the Japanese to break off the attack, enabling the Allied Ships to regain their battle formation. For this action he was awarded the Silver Star., 49413=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 35122=In the dark days following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Lt. Cmdr. Butch Parker was in command of USS Parrott, an old 4-stack destroyer of the type that Roosevelt had lent to the British in 1940 in exchange for use of British bases in the Atlantic. These thin-skinned destroyers were affectionately called \u201ctin cans\u201d by their crews., 36321=On Feb. 19-20, just past midnight, Parker, now in command of Destroyer Division 59, made contact with Japanese cruisers and destroyers off the Island of Bali, Netherlands East Indies. The destroyers under his command were illuminated by the enemy and subject to heavy gunfire. He managed to score two gun hits and at least two torpedo hits on the enemy before withdrawing his division from a situation of grave peril without serious damage to his command. For this action he received a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Navy Cross., 33820=Before the end of December 1941, the Japanese had conquered Wake Island, Guam, Burma. British Borneo, Hong Kong and had invaded the Philippines. We had always denigrated the Japanese as little men, wearing glasses, who couldn't shoot straight. We had greatly underestimated them and were surprised by their courage, technical capabilities and tactical abilities., 26751=When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor more than 70 years ago, on, Dec. 7, 1941, I was stationed aboard the USSWasp, an aircraft carrier, anchored in Grassy Bay, Bermuda. Having just returned from one of our so-called \u201cneutrality\u201d patrols, we found our attention, which had been focused on the Battle of the Atlantic, suddenly shifted to the Pacific.}",
