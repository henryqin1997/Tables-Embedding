    "textBeforeTable": "Students interested in the business elective focus area should identify a second electrical track technical focus area of interest, and consider the course selection suggestions listed both there, and below, when completing their plan of study form. Electrical engineers with business backgrounds find employment in all engineering industries, as project leaders, mid-level managers, and even as CEOs. In fact, a recent SpencerStuart study found that 20% of all Fortune 500 CEOs hold engineering degrees of some kind. Depending on the courses selected electrical track students in the business focus area can earn a business minor without taking any courses beyond those required to complete their B.S.E. degree. In addition to their EE courswork the focus area provides background in engineering economics, financial management, business law, and marketing. Electrical engineering studies provide a great foundation for business decision-making because they couple objective analysis with the development of strong problem solving skills. The business elective focus area aims to prepare students to apply this foundation to business problems. Overview \u00a0\u00a0",
