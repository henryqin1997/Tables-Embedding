Giniel de Villiers and his Toyota finished second, ready to pounce on\u2026 St\u00e9phane Peterhansel. The X-Raid Team leader drove confidently throughout the loop stage and grabbed his 60th special in the Dakar, as well as taking control of the general classification with a 2\u201938\u2033 lead on the South African, whom he\u2019d marked as his main rival. Everything\u2019s going to plan., 2812=They all faced the same course, but not all of the leading lights of the car category ran into trouble in the same places. Not even those at the top of the ranking lucked out. Not even Carlos Sainz, the ephemeral leader of the 2013 Dakar\u2026 until km 50. The Spaniard and his co-driver were the first victims when they misread the road book and started \u201cdriving in circles\u201d through the Peruvian desert. Nasser Al-Attiyah and later Nani Roma had the same problem. Guerlain Chicherit didn\u2019t make any mistakes, but his first mechanical issues at the wheel of his SMG buggy cost him half an hour. Nevertheless, his team has good reason to be proud today, as Ronan Chabot drove an identical car to third place.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Today\u2019s loop around Pisco saw Joan Barreda win the stage and the usual supporting cast of the Dakar step up to the plate and take the top honors, together with talented rookies like Matt Fish and Kurt Caselli. In the car category, Sainz and Al-Attiyah\u2019s navigational problems were a blessing for the most experienced of the Dakar champions: Peterhansel, who took his 60th special, and Giniel de Villiers, who climbed to second in the general classification. One of the things that make rally raids special are those little mistakes which can turn the race on its head every day. Specials which seem harmless on paper can sometimes yield surprises. Today, a small collective navigational mistake by those at the front of the race gave those at the back the opportunity to shine. Following yesterday\u2019s winner in Pisco, \u201cChaleco\u201d, Cyril Despres succumbed to the temptation and took a detour around a huge dune at km 75. But it was more difficult than expected for the defending champion to get back on track. In the meanwhile, industrious Joan Barreda never strayed from the course. His handling abilities hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed in the two previous editions of the Dakar. The Catalan showed it wasn\u2019t a fluke by riding his Husqvarna to the second stage win of his career, made even sweeter by the third place of his helper Matt Fish, who romped onto the stage in the Dakar. Joan Pedrero, another Catalan who\u2019s more used to riding in the shadow",
