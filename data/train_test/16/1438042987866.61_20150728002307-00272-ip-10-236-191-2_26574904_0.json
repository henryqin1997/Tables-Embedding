Since it\u2019s free and provided as a courtesy (not mentioning a thought toward upgrading to priced services later), there are some limits. Criteria are mainly: This week, I searched for free online SVN repositories for closed-source projects. Of course, there are plenty of sites offering services for OpenSource projects: Google Code, SourceForge, etc. It may seem amazing, but everybody does not necessarily want to expose its code to the world.

This is not to say the others are bad but the free account has also some very interesting features: Unlimited Bandwidth Transfer SSL Encryption (very unusual for a free service) Redundant RAID storage and Nightly Backups I would definitely be interested in knowing what free Subversion provider do you use for your closed-source projects.
