    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations [0044] Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purpose, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims. [0043] As described above, the present invention provides the display apparatus to which the TV function is selectively added at the user's option. The present invention also provides a method of controlling the TV tuner through the OSD. [0042] Accordingly, a connecting port for an external TV tuner is provided in a display apparatus, so that a TV function is selectively added at a user's option. A TV function is selected through an OSD, and the external TV tuner is controlled through the OSD, when it is connected to the display apparatus. Further, a reliability of the display apparatus is improved by preventing the TV tuner controlled through the OSD from being displayed when the TV tuner is not connected to the display apparatus. [0041] In the above embodiment, in order to display the signal selection OSD for selecting which of the video signals outputted from the computer 21, the VTR 23, and/or the TV tuner 5 will be displayed, a signal selection button is employed; in the alternative, a touch screen or a remote controller may be employed.",
