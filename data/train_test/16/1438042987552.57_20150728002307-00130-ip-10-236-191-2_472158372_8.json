The present invention includes all such equivalent alterations and modifications, and is limited only by the scope of the claims. As is illustrated by the graphs in FIGS. 8 & 9, the temperature is greatly reduced in the enclosure space 14 when the installation template of the present invention is used when installing the refrigerator cabinet 10. A temperature range of 52 degree F. and below is acceptable, while a temperature range of 43 degree and below is preferred, for the enclosure space to permit reliable operation of the refrigerator. As may be seen from the graphs, a wattage of 45 watts is also found to be within the reliable operating range for the refrigerator. As illustrated by the charts, the enclosure space may be constructed at a minimum of 47 square inches or more to achieve the 52 degree or below temperature. These graphs were used to formulate the design criteria to shape the installation template 12 and its accompanying ventilation openings 20 and required temperature range. The performance charts in FIGS. 8 & 9 show the relationships of time vs temp and time vs watts comparisons for the present invention. FIG. 8 illustrates test results with no",
