            "WVU is great for any type of student. We have superb academics, great athletic teams, and also a nice night life too. The greek life on campus is also very good for those who want to be a part of a fraternity or sorority. There is also a great variety in majors so there is something for everyone.",
            "Make sure to apply early and schedule a visit before you decide. I was set on a small private school until I visited and hated every moment of it. When I reached Morgantown, I instantly knew I belonged here and that this was the school for me. So take your time to see the school and ask questions. If you plan on living in the dorms make sure to fill out the proper paper work and make the right payments so you can choose early, dorms fill up fast and you want to make sure to get a nice place to live since you'll be sharing such a small space with a roommate..or two.",
            "WVU is one of the cheapest schools I looked at and has to most to offer. They have top rated programs and the best professors you can find. You also receive free admission to sporting events which you don't find everywhere. Also the dorm life isn't bad and the food isn't terrible either. I would definitely say that WVU is worth the money.",
            "I absolutely love the atmosphere in Morgantown. There is never a dull moment on the weekends whether it's going to a sporting event or hitting the clubs with a few friends you can find anything to do. Sporting events, especially football games, are my personal favorite. Seeing the amount of pride students at wVU have will encourage anyone to come to school here and know that they belong. This school may be big but we are all one big family.",
            "WVU has some of the top professors in the country, I have learned a lot more than I expected since I got here. WVU is a very large school, but by being an engineering student I have been able to have smaller class sizes, personalized tutoring, and professors who take time to talk outside of class. Other majors also have these benefits especially after their freshman year."

The campus is beautiful covering over 1000 acres and transportation is great , buses and trains (PRT) carries people all over the campus . Transportation is free and tution fee is average , take a campus tour and visit West Virginia University , Lets Go Mountaineer's :), 151166=the backyard brawl is when wvu plays it's biggest rival, pitt. however, 2012 may be the last year for the famous backyard brawl. with both teams switching divisions it is unknown if the games will continue between the two teams., 9410=Learn from my mistakes! I did not decide on WVU until late, as a matter of fact I was set on attending West Virginia Wesleyan College until financial aid fell through I had to re-evaluate my situation. In July I transitioned to WVU. My advice is to apply early and commit early. This will allow you the greatest opportunity to capitalize on all WVU has to offer. Believe me, being the last to schedule and waiting for them to make a room for you is no fun. You will end up with 8am classes and classes at 9pm, you will live in Evansdale and have all your classes downtown. It\u2019s been a hectic first semester, one that you can avoid by committing early., 704435=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 678161=Nestled in the hills of north central West Virginia, WVU is a land-grant university that has served the state since 1867. Despite having a population of over 30,000 students, one can still feel the tie associated with a small school while still living in a modern, urban area. A very diverse social and cultural atmosphere blends with academics that provide opportunities beyond what one can imagine, harboring an environment of creativity while fostering a future of success., 503150=Some traditions: PRT cram, football games, diversity week, couch burning (considering the $1000 fine, this isn't a good idea), etc. Great locations: stadium, coliseum, woodburn circle, free-speech area, etc.}",

I can assure you that at West Virginia University you will never be bored. There are so many clubs and athletic activities to become involved in. Tips for prospective students Before going to WVU be prepared to walk... a lot. Morgantown is very hilly and there are plenty of stairs. There's also not much parking so even if you end up bringing a car, you'll still find yourself on foot most of the time. Bang for the buck As an out of state student, WVU is expensive, but I feel that I am getting what I paid for as far as classes because I'm learning a lot. Am enjoying being here Morgantown is a great location. You get a great mix of seasons and the campus is absolutely",
