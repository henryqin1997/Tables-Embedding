A funny detail is\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the battery holder accommodating two coin cells and one plastic dummy battery! \u2022 Later models of the 2nd design corrected this flaw and shrinks the battery holder\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 down for two cells. \u2022 The 4th design looks nearly identical but uses different parts.
