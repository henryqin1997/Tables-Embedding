    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{51471=Returning back to the discussion of the modified letdown chambers described earlier, it has been surmised that the webs produced by such configurations may retain some of the tackiness theorized to benefit Gurley Hill Porosity for a longer period of time. In particular, it is believed that the bunched fibrils may actually hold some of the spin agent therein which causes the web to retain some tackiness for a longer period of time. As such, the dynamics of the solution passing through the letdown chamber may be one key method of obtaining high Gurley Hill Porosity Values. The dynamics are believed to center around the flow through the letdown chamber such that if smooth, continuous flow is established, the webs tend to be well fibrillated but have lower Gurley Hill Porosity. This action is more completely described in Patent Application No. 60/001626 by Franke et al. which is incorporated herein by reference., 52412=As the webs appeared to be made up of larger fibrils than are normally expected to provide suitable sheet product, the fibril size of the webs were quantitatively analyzed. The webs were opened up by hand and imaged using a microscopic lens. The image was digitized and computer analyzed to determine the mean fibril width and standard deviation. This process is based on similar techniques disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,810 to A. Ganesh Vaidyanathan dated 6 Dec. 1994 and which is hereby incorporated by reference. It should again be noted that the many of the larger fibrils were actually made up of smaller fibrils but were so tightly bunched together and have such short fibril length, it appeared and acted like a large fibril. Thus, the term \"apparent fibril size\" is used to describe or characterize the web. Moreover, the tight bunching and short fibril length (distance from tie point to tie point) effectively prevents any analysis on the constitution of the bunched fibrils. The data from this analysis is set forth in Table I at the end of this section., 65312=Sheet tensile properties are measured in a strip tensile test. A 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) wide sample is mounted in the clamps--set 5.0 inches (12.7 cm) apart--of a constant rate of extension tensile testing machine such as an Instron table model tester. A continuously increasing load is applied to the sample at a crosshead speed of 2.0 in/min (5.08 cm/min) until failure. Tensile strength is the break strength normalized for sample weight, i.e. (lbs/in)/(oz/yd2). Elongation to break is given in percentage of stretch prior to failure. The test generally follows ASTM D1682-64., 70533=Example 4 web and sheet was made in the pilot plant for the new system. The pilot plant mixed 20% (by weight) polyethylene in n-pentane spin agent and passed it through the letdown chamber at 1500 pressure and 175\ufffd C. temperature with an average speed of fluid through the letdown chamber of approximately one foot per second. The spin cell was closed at a pressure of 3.55 inches (gage) of water and a temperature approximately 50 to 55\ufffd C. The sheets are approximately 28 inches wide, about 1.7 oz./sq. yd. and made with six separate webs or with six spin stations. Example 4 was made with a one half letdown chamber of 2.7 inches in length and a diameter of 0.615 inches., 27438=The invention further relates to a sheet being defined as a nonwoven sheet product made of overlapping layers of flash spun fibers bonded together with at least heat and pressure, wherein the web comprises fibrils having a mean apparent fiber width of greater than 24 microns, a median apparent fiber width of greater than about 13.5 microns and wherein the fibers are spun from one or more orifices at less than 100 pounds per hour per orifice, and wherein the sheet product has a Gurley Hill Porosity Value of greater than 30 seconds. An additional nonwoven sheet product is set forth which is made of overlapping layers of flashspun fibers bonded together with at least heat and pressure, wherein the web comprises fibrils having a mean apparent fiber width of less than 25 microns, a median apparent fiber width of less than about 13.5 microns, such that the fibers are spun from one or more orifices at less than 100 pounds per hour per orifice, and wherein the sheet product has a Gurley Hill Porosity Value of less than 20 seconds. A further nonwoven sheet product is set forth which is made of a plurality of overlapping plexifilamentary film-fibril webs wherein the webs have openings between the fibrils and the openings have an average perimeter of at least 2650 microns, the sheet includes portions which have at least four separate overlapping web swaths and the Gurley Hill Porosity Value is at least 25 seconds. Another nonwoven sheet product is set forth which is made of a plurality of overlapping plexifilamentary film-fibril webs wherein the webs have openings between the fibrils and the openings have an average perimeter of less than 3300 microns, the sheet includes portions which have at least four separate overlapping web swaths and the Gurley Hill Porosity Value is less than 75 seconds., 60122=Each pixel is then characterized by a gray level value based on the intensity of light received by the sensor at that pixel. A series of textural features can be calculated from the digitized image in order to quantitatively describe the texture of the sheet. Such a set of features has been created and described for a variety of data sources by Robert M. Haralick et al., in his paper published in the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Vol. SMC-3, No. 6, pp 610-621 dated 1973, and the paper is hereby incorporated by reference., 22943=This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/003,723, filed Sept. 13, 1995., 68829=The hydrostatic head tester measures the resistance of the sheet to penetration by liquid water under a static load. A 7\ufffd7 in (17.78\ufffd17.78 cm) sample is mounted in a SDL 18 Shirley Hydrostatic Head Tester (manufactured by Shirley Developments Limited, Stockport, England). Water is pumped into the piping above the sample at 60+/-3 cm/min until three areas of the sample is penetrated by the water. The measured hydrostatic pressure is given in inches of water. The test generally follows ASTM D 583 (withdrawn from publication November, 1976)., 64168=The tensile properties of the plexifilamentary web or strand are determined using a constant rate of extension tensile testing machine such as an Instron table model tester. A six inch length sample is twisted and mounted in the clamps, set 2.0 in (5.08 cm) apart. The twist is applied under a 75 g load and varies with denier - 10 turns per inch (tpi) up to 360 denier, 9 tpi for 361-440 denier, 8 tpi for 441-570 denier, 7 tpi for 571-1059 denier, and 6 tpi at 1060 and above. A continuously increasing load is applied to the twisted strand at a crosshead speed of 2.0 in/min (5.08 cm/min) until failure. Tenacity is the break strength normalized for denier and is given as grams (force) per denier, g/denier (or dN/tex). Elongation is given as the percentage of stretch prior to failure., 55572=Once the sheets were bonded, further analysis was performed on the sheets. Such further analysis is based in part on analytical tools developed by A. Ganesh Vaidyanathan to automatically identify image features in a complex varying background as disclosed and set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,980 issued on 25 Jul. 1995 which is hereby incorporated by reference. The newly developed techniques characterize void structures within the sheet that seem to have relevance to the porosity of the sheet. The technique comprises cutting a sample of the sheet in a plane extending across the width of the sheet and a plane extending with the length of the sheet. The exposed cross sections of the samples are imaged using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM images are subsequently digitized using a commercial frame grabber. Void structures across the sheet cross section are identified and traced and several morphological measurements are made. A void is a portion within the cross sectional area of the sheet that is open or devoid of fiber., 64978=Denier is determined by measuring and cutting a known length while under load--250 g for four doubled strands. The sample strands are weighed and the denier calculated. Denier is the weight in grams per 9000 meters of length. (Tex is the weight in grams per 1000 meters of length)., 65942=Tear strength means Elmendorf tear strength and is a measure of the force required to propagate a tear cut in the fabric. The average force required to continue a tongue-type tear in a sheet is determined by measuring the work done in tearing it through a fixed distance. The tester consists of a sector-shaped pendulum carrying a clamp which is in alignment with a fixed clamp when the pendulum is in the raised starting position, with maximum potential energy. The specimen is fastened in the clamps and the tear is started by a slit cut in the specimen between the clamps. The pendulum is then released and the specimen is torn as the moving jaw moves away from the fixed jaw. Elmendorf tear strength is measured in accordance with TAPPI-T-414 om-88 and ASTM D 1424., 66763=Delamination of a sheet sample is measured using a constant rate of extension tensile testing machine such as an Instron table model tester. A 1.0 in (2.54 cm) by 8.0 in (20.32 cm) sample is delaminated approximately 1.25 in (3.18 cm) by inserting a pick into the cross-section of the sample to initiate a separation and delamination by hand. The delaminated sample faces are mounted in the clamps of the tester which are set 1.0 in (2.54 cm) apart. The tester is started and run at a cross-head speed of 5.0 in/min (5.08 cm/min). The computer starts picking up readings after the slack is removed in about 0.5 in of crosshead travel. The sample is delaminated for about 6 in (15.24 cm) during which 3000 readings are taken and averaged. The average delamination strength is given in lbs/in (kg/m). The test generally follows ASTM D 2724-87.}",
