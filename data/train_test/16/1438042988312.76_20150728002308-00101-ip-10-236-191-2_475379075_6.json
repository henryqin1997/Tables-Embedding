No. 317,092, filed Oct. 3, 1994,, 60601=A 2400 bps traffic channel uses one uplink and one downlink time slot each frame 86. A 4800 bps traffic channel uses two contiguous uplink and two contiguous downlink time slots each frame 86. The two contiguous uplink time slots must be in the same frequency access, and the two contiguous downlink time slots must be in the same frequency access. Uplink and downlink time slots associated with a particular channel need not be in the same frequency access., 28326=(7) Distributed Multi-Outlet Paging, Ser. No. 08/042,435, filed Apr. 5, 1993., 56710=The paging framing structure uses a four-level timing hierarchy. The highest level of this hierarchy is a 194.4 second (2160 frames) superframe 80. The superframe 80 comprises nine paging blocks 82 of 21.6 seconds (240 frames) each. Each block 82 comprises five groups 84 of 4.32 seconds (forty-eight frames). Finally, each group 84 comprises forty-eight 90 ms L-Band frames 86. The simplex message time slot 88 occupies 20.48 ms of the 90 ms L-Band frame 86. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill that the above-described timing hierarchy is merely exemplary and that many other variations are possible, depending upon the particular system requirement., 27383=(1) Satellite-Based Messaging System Transmitting During Guard Band of Satellite-Based Telephone System and Method of Operation Thereof, Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all modifications of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosed invention may be modified in numerous ways and may assume many embodiments other than the preferred form specifically set out and described above. In summary, the present invention provides an improved satellite-based, world-wide cellular messaging system. This system is compatible with a satellite-based, world-wide cellular telephone system, and it conserves battery resources in the satellites and pagers. Moreover, in this satellite-based, world-wide cellular messaging system the user capacity of individual cells can easily be reconfigured, so that paging capacity can be concentrated where it is most needed. Conclusion Finally, the process ends in block 180. Next, in box 179, at the time specified in the appropriate Block Header Message of the Acquisition Group corresponding to the cell in which the target pager is located, the system transmits the page message only to that cell, i.e. the one identified in box 175. Next, in box 177 information is transmitted to all page receivers within the region in the form of the Acquisition Group. This transmission may assume the form shown in FIG. 15, wherein a first Block Header Message is broadcast to all pagers within one cell of the region, then another Block Header Message is",
