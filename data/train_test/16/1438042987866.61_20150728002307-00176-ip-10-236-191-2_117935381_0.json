You can use Outlook 2010 Web App with Internet Explorer or many other browsers for UNIX, Apple Macintosh, or computers running Microsoft Windows. In this new 3 hour workshop we will start with the fundamentals: logging in, exploring the interface, composing and sending e-mail, receiving and replying to e-mail and basic search tools and printing. Advanced e-mail topics will include using and managing rules, inserting a signature, and customizing the application. We will work with contacts (adding, editing, deleting); and learn how to create a contact group. Next we will explore the calendar feature: viewing a calendar, scheduling appointments and meetings (including recurring), setting reminders, responding to a meeting request, and sharing calendars. Finally, we will see how easy it is to work in the Tasks window: adding and updating tasks (including recurring tasks), and marking tasks as complete.}",
