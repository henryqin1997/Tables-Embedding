In addition to amplification, the signal typically has to be transcoded, and transdecoded, e.g., by the LTP (Long Term Prediction) or RPE (Regular Pulse Excitation) or LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) method. The GSM system has typically utilized a combination of these, i.e. an RPE-LTP-LPC method, described, e.g., in The GSM System for Mobile Communications, by M. Mouly and M. B. Pautet, 1992, 49 rue Louise Bruneau, Palaiseau F-91120, p. 155-162. A more detailed description of the methods can be found in GSM 06.10, January 1990 , GSM Full Rate Speech Transcoding, ETSI, 93 p. These coding methods handle drastic amplitude variations and instances of exceeding of an allowable amplitude range occurring in the signal to be encoded so that the subscriber receiving the signal and thus hearing the voice experiences distortion and strong interferences in the voice. This is a major problem particularly in the GSM system, where the signal to the subscriber is amplified in order that the transmitted signal heard by the subscriber will have a higher strength.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The drawings and the description related to them are only intended to illustrate the idea of the invention. In their details, the transcoder, transdecoder or the methods for adjusting the output signal of a transcoding unit and transdecoding unit may vary within the scope of the claims. Even though the invention has been described above mainly with reference to a mobile radio system, the invention is equally applicable in other radio telephone systems. The level monitoring means TU of block U operates in the following way, method 2: If AU is negative, i.e. attenuates the signal, AU'=AU, which means that the value of AU' is not changed. If AU is positive, the TU reads the sample value of each signal SU2, and adjusts AU' in the following way. The counter PAU is incremented by one at uniform intervals. If the reading of PAU is at least equal to PHU, AU' is incremented by SPU, and the PAU is set to zero. Further, the TU is allowed to adjust the value of AU' at uniform intervals; the interval between the adjustments is selected to be 20 ms or a multiple of 20 ms, as the frequency of occurrence of the frame transmitting the RPE-LTP-LPC signal is 20 ms. During 20 ms, 160 samples of signal SU2 are handled. The TU reads all of the 160 \ufffd n samples of signal SU2' at uniform intervals. SU2' is",
