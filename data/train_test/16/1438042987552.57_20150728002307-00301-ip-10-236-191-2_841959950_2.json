In 1998, the sudden drop in the European and Brazilian currencies took the price of Argentine exports to a very high level. But the rigid nature of \u201cpegged exchange rate\u201d didn\u2019t allow the government to reduce the interest rate in order to control the situation., 23314=Default in 2001, 68994=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 22927=By late 2001, unemployment rate soared to almost 20%. Moreover, the peso witnessed increasing outflow on higher demand for dollar. In order to handle the situation, the government imposed limitations on withdrawals from banks to not more than 1000 pesos/dollar. This policy faced an extreme round of protests which forced the President Fernando de la R\u00faa to resign., 20577=Last month, Argentina defaulted for the second time in 13 years on failure of debt payments to the \u201cvulture fund\u201d bondholders. This resulted due to the decade-long legal battle between Elliot Management and the Argentine government. The dollar pegging policy taken by the Argentine government in 1991, holds the key to this default., 21351=Argentina faced certain acute economic problems between 1975 and 1990. These include hyperinflation, discouraging GDP growth, lack of adequate capital investment and low level of confidence on the government and the central bank. The country also experienced about eight crises related to its currency. The government chose to peg Argentine Peso against the U.S. dollar to address these issues., 22469=The government was forced to curtail the wages in order to reduce cost. This however led to higher unemployment rate and a decline in tax receipts. As a result, the deficit increased at an alarming rate and the government opted for raising public debt by issuing bonds. Reportedly, the volume of public debt escalated from 29.5% of GDP in 1993 to almost 50.3% in 1999., 24432=As a result, Argentina faced its second default after it has been forced to terminate the interest payment of $539 million to the bondholders. In June, the country deposited the money with The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK - Analyst Report), Argentina\u2019s trustee bank for its disputed bonds., 14926=by Zacks Equity Research \u00a0\u00a0Published on August 18, 2014 |, 21810=Initially the pegging policy was proven to be fruitful for the economy. As a result of this policy, inflation came down to almost 3.4% in 1994 from about 3000% in 1989. The GDP grew at almost 8% per year from 1991 to 1995. Moreover, the volume of foreign investment increased during this period and the export jumped., 69055=At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors.

Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year.
