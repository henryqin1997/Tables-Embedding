I have NEVER, in any sport, seen a team come back more times in a single game.This team is something special. This is GMU in the Final Four and also VCU. We've all been so caught up in predicting the number of wins we've missed the FACT that this team is a special composition of very, very determined men.Repeat: there is something special about the Nats in 2011. Zimm and Werth went 2 for 14 combined, and the team scratched out the most amazing win in baseball in 2011.The Washington Nationals will be in the playoffs in 2011., 230042=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

Still, I suspect he's not making $600,000/a., 215777=JaneB said\u2026 We won in the 14th in AZ. We can do it in Chicago.And may I say, these white Sox fans are behaving a lot like Phillies phans. June 25, 2011 12:40 AM No kidding. When we left the stadium we were concerned for our safety. We were heckled but no violence so it wasn't like Phillie phans as there would have been a fight as we had on Nats jerseys and caps.}",
