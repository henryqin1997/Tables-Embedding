What we've discovered is that everyone plays casual games. Grandma and Grandpa are playing games. The kids are playing. And mom and dad are playing. This is the case in Japan, Germany, and in the US. Essentially, there is no real demographic for game play. Game purchasing, on the other hand, skews heavily female and that's true globally. In the US, game purchases are skewing about 65% female.
