The weather is usually warm and there always seem to be lots of Sharks fans who make the journey. This past weekend there were several hundred people rockin\u2019 team jerseys at Jobbing.com Arena. If you happen to make the trip be sure to also walk over to the University of Phoenix stadium across the street from the rink. It\u2019s the home of the NFL Arizona Cardinals. San Jose native Pat Tillman, who lost his life in 2004 in a friendly fire incident in Afghanistan, played for the Cardinals. They retired his number and also named the plaza surrounding the stadium, Pat Tillman Freedom Plaza. There\u2019s a bronze statue in the plaza that is fantastic and a fitting tribute to such a unique and patriotic man.}",
