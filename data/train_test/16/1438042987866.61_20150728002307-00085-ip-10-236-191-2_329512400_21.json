    "textBeforeTable": "My guess is unlike film studios that are really stuck with a model that goes through theatrical distribution and takes a signification amount of the profit away, if we were to go to an audience and say 'We have this great hour and a half of linear video that we'd like to make available to you at a $20 or $30 price point,' you'd have the biggest opening weekend of any film ever. Within the next five years, you are likely to see us do that. It might be in a partnership with somebody or alone, but there will be a time where we'll capitalize on the relationship we have with our audience; deliver them something that is really extraordinary and let them consume it directly through us instead of theatrical distribution. If we were to deliver a film digitally this way, I'd say an extremely high percentage would then go to the theater and watch it again. IGN reports on some comments made by Activision CEO Bobby Kotick to attendees of a Bank of America Merrill Lynch Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference about the idea that they could remove the cut-scenes from a game like StarCraft II and market them as a commercial movie. If that's not startling enough, then wait for the price point he mentioned, as he envisions selling such a \"movie\" for $20.00-$30.00. He",
