            "I did not stay in the dorms, but I did stay on one of the on-campus apartments. It was brand new and beautiful living arrangements.",
            "The major I chose can be very challenging, yet I feel like I am learning a great deal. All the courses I have taken, the professors seem to be challenging, yet they all really try to help you.",
            "Prepare to study hard and try to do all of your work ahead of time. The easiest way to stay on top of things is to do your work immediately after class. It is much easier when everything is still fresh in your mind.",
            "ETSU is a very clean and beautiful campus. All the professors I have had were very nice, friendly, and really seem to care about their students."

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students ETSU is a great campus for anybody. It's a good size. It's close to EVERYTHING! Everyone there is so friendly and helpful. It really doesn't take long to get into the groove of ETSU. It'll feel like home in no time. Tips for prospective students Some tips for students: Definitely take a tour of the campus. Try to get a feel for it before you decide that's where you want to live for the next 1 - 4 years. Ask questions! There's never a stupid question; and people are always eager to help you out! Bang for the buck Compared to a LOT of colleges I was looking at, ETSU was definitely the cheapest. And I feel that I'm getting a wonderful education. Am enjoying being here ETSU always has something going on! Our calender is loaded with events! There's something to do almost every single day. There's tons of restaurants and places to shop within ten minutes from campus. And the people are just great to be around! Am learning a lot All the teachers I've had so far really take the time to help you",
