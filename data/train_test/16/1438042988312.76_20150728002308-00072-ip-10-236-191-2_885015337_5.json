Merrill founder of the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm, saw an opportunity to consolidate the West Coast grocery industry. Towards this end, he purchased the 322-store Safeway chain of W.R.H. Weldon, who wished to exit retailing and concentrate on wholesale. Then, in June 1926, Merrill offered Skaggs either $7\u00a0million outright or $1.5\u00a0million plus 30,000 shares in the merged firm. Skaggs took the latter.[8] On July 1, 1926, Safeway merged with the 673 stores from Skaggs United Stores of Idaho and Skaggs Cash Stores of California. On completion of the Skaggs/Safeway merger, M.\u00a0B.\u00a0Skaggs became the Chief Executive of the business.[9] Two years later, M.B. listed Safeway on the New York Stock Exchange.

Merrill temporarily left Merrill Lynch to help manage Safeway. At the time of the merger, the company was headquartered in Reno, Nevada.

A five for one split in 1928 brought the price down to under $50. Over the next few years, Charles Merrill, with financing supplied by Merrill Lynch, then began aggressively acquiring numerous regional grocery store chains for Safeway in a rollup strategy. Early acquisitions included significant parts of Piggly Wiggly chain as part of the breakup of that company by Merrill Lynch and Wall Street., 59056=In 1999, the Safeway chain began selling gasoline at some of its new stores.

Magowan managed Safeway for the next 13 years\u2014presiding over the dramatic decline of the firm in terms of store numbers, 58107=In the late 1990s, Safeway began to again aggressively acquire regional chains, including Randall's Food Markets in Texas, Carrs in Alaska, and Dominick's in Illinois. The buyout of Randall's marked Safeway's return to Texas ten years after the original stores in Houston were sold to AppleTree and several Dallas stores were sold to Tom Thumb, which was later acquired by Randall's. In 1997, after being a minority owner since 1988, Safeway exercised its option to acquire full control of Vons in Southern California., 44463=In 1961, the company sold its New York operations to Finast.[16] In 1963, Safeway again opened stores in Hawaii, having exited this market in 1934.[17] They had leased one store in Culver City to animator/filmmaker Don Bluth, who used it as a theater until 1967., 61189=In July 2007, the company stock rose on speculation that Sears Holdings Corporation was seeking to purchasing Safeway.[23], 44088=Also in 1959, the firm also opened the first \"marina-style\" store on the Marina in San Francisco.

The move will bolster its presence in Western Canada, where Safeway was predominant. Sobeys has not yet determined whether it will maintain the Safeway brand, or convert its locations to the Sobeys banner.[26] The sale ended Safeway's presence in Canada., 65840=In October 2013, Safeway announced that it would cease operating Dominick's stores in the Chicago area by early 2014.[27][28] The announcement spurred its competitors to seek employees and desirable store locations they could purchase.[29] One location would remain open in Bannockburn, Illinois until January 25, 2014.[30], 80633=At the end of 2004, there were 142 \"Lifestyle\" format stores in the United States and Canada, with plans to open or remodel another 300 stores with this type of theme the following year. \"Lifestyle\" format stores have seen significantly higher average weekly sales than their other stores. By the end of 2006, shares were up, proving this rebranding campaign had a major impact on sale figures., 59891=In 2001, Safeway acquired the family-owned Genuardi's chain, with locations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Safeway also created the subsidiary Blackhawk Network, a prepaid and payments network, a card-based financial solutions company, and a provider of third-party prepaid cards., 47297=Following a hostile takeover bid from corporate raiders Herbert and Robert Haft, the chain was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) acting as a white knight in 1986. With the assistance of KKR, the company was taken private and assumed tremendous debt. To pay off this debt, the company began selling off a large number of its operating divisions., 100310=In 2008, Greenpeace started ranking America\u2019s major supermarket chains on their seafood sustainability practices because, according to Phil Radford, Greenpeace U.S. CEO, \"three quarters of global fish stocks are suffering from overfishing,[49] and 90% of top marine predators are already gone.\"[50][51] Criteria included the number of threatened fish species supermarkets sold, their seafood purchasing policies, and ocean legislation policies they supported.[52] Greenpeace annual Carting Away the Oceans (CATO) report ranks supermarkets on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being least sustainable with seafood policies and 10 being the most sustainable with seafood policies. Safeway ranked second best (7.1 out of 10) on the 2013 CATO Report by ensuring that its store brand of canned tuna was sustainably fished and by lobbying for science-based ocean conservation policies.[53], 87576=Safeway Medallion logo, 1946., 67927=On January 30, 2015, the merger between Safeway and Albertsons was finalized.[33], 99346=In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Christensen Farms, a pork supplier to Safeway, Walmart, Costco, Kroger, and Kmart.[46] Before the public release of Mercy For Animals' investigation at Christensen Farms, Safeway announced they would begin requiring pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.[47][48], 56023=Many stores in the Eastern Division were also closed or sold in the 1987-89 timeframe, including many recent additions in the DelMarVa Eastern Shore area., 83504=In 1963, Safeway developed the Super S format\u2014which combined a general merchandise and drug store and a new Safeway supermarket in the same building. The stores shared a common entrance, but operated as separate businesses with their own checkstands. The first outlet opened in Anchorage, Alaska.

Safeway sold the remaining stores in 1971.[42], 94865=The Safeway ATM Network, run for Safeway by Cardtronics, operates in Colorado, Oregon, Wyoming and Washington.

The firm ultimately failed against entrenched competition in both these markets., 45479=In 1977, Safeway management instituted a program to fight counterfeit $100 bills by, among other things, telling employees that bills that lacked the words \"In God We Trust\" were counterfeit. Because Safeway had not sufficiently investigated the history of $100 bills, it was unaware that some bills still in circulation did not have the phrase. Eventually, an innocent shopper was incorrectly reported to Oakland, California police for passing a \"counterfeit\" bill. he was arrested and strip-searched before Oakland police contacted the Treasury Department and realized the error. The 1981 jury verdict of joint and several liability for $45,000 against Safeway Stores and the City of Oakland was upheld in full by the Supreme Court of California on December 26, 1986.[18], 14377=Safeway, Inc. is an American supermarket chain that was acquired by private equity investors led by Cerberus Capital Management in January 2015. The new merged company which includes the Albertsons supermarket chain has more than 2,200 stores and over 250,000 employees[2] which makes it the second largest supermarket chain in North America, after The Kroger Company, which has 2,625 stores.[3] Safeway's primary base of operations is in the western and central United States,[4] with some stores located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Eastern Seaboard.

The chain, which operated as two separate businesses, Skaggs Cash Stores and Skaggs United Stores, grew quickly, and Skaggs enlisted the help of his five brothers to help grow the network of stores. M.B.'s business strategy, to give his customers value and to expand by keeping a narrow profit margin, proved spectacularly successful. By 1926, he had opened 428 Skaggs stores in 10 states.
