Back then, the 200-day was around 390, and today it's at 496.32. The SOX is also well above its 21-day and 50-day SMAs at 541.45 and 534.20, respectively., 14603=The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX), which has 30 components, has set eight consecutive multiyear intraday highs and is up 5.3% so far in 2014. RF Micro and TriQuint are not components of the SOX., 14117=The weekly chart for the SOX (563.36) is positive but overbought with its five-week modified moving average at 543.92 and its 200-week SMA at 415.05. Notice how the 200-week SMA provided a longer-term reversion to the mean since the semiconductor bubble popped in early-2000. Since then, the 200-week SMA has been tested or crossed in nine of the last 13 years.}",
