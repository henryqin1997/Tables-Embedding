            "Dorm's are alright for the most part. You want to try and get into the apartments on campus, but for freshman you're out of luck unless you're an athlete.",
            "The academic rigor is pretty high. The professors expect quality work. There is no slacking here.",
            "Be prepared to work hard to achieve what you want. Campbell offers a lot of help for you to succeed, but you have to be motivated.",

All of which started in the fall of 2013/ spring 2014., 380364=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 288835=Campbell hosts many activities for students, such as trips to amusement parks and movie theaters, as well as on-campus activities like pumpkin carving in October or traveling magicians in the auditorium. The Campus Activity Board plans events and sends out a calendar for students. The movie nights on Fridays in the auditorium are fun., 264724=Greek life starts fall of 2013. Greek is coming to the Creek!, 141304=Campbell's 2013-2014 school year is it's first year with Greek Life. They have added 2 sororities and 2 fraternities., 9734=Be a good well rounded student. This school is getting bigger and better. It is a good school now but with the Physician Assistant major available starting the 2010-2011 academic year-this school will be getting more prestigious and harder to get in over the next upcoming years. Also I was reading this on the Campbell website that after each student took this National Survey of Student Engagement- more than 92% said their college experience was excellent or good!, 318505=They're installing the Greek Life in the Fall of 2013., 17377=New students will now have a freshman seminar starting 2011-2012 school year. They'll have guest speakers consisting of faculty and current students. They'll learn things about Campbell that us current students had to experience first since no one told us.}",

I'm a science major, and the science departments at Campbell are great. The business, law, and educations majors don't feel left out either. Campbell is great for well-rounded education seeking students. Tips for prospective students Campbell University is a great four-year private institution. It has five different graduate schools, including Divinity, Pharmacy, Education, Business, and Law. I have found my home as Campbell University for the next four years, I absolutely recommend the school. It's amazing.
