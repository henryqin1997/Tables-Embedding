    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I am a first-year student at DePauw and I just finished my first semester a few days ago. Everything about DePauw is very personal and the class sizes are amazingly small. Each student has the opportunity to get personal attention and instruction from the professors upon request. The professors have office hours during the day and are willing to help anyone who comes in and asks for help. The classes can be difficult, but the liberal arts education is very rewarding. The majority of DePauw's campus is greek (the students join sororities & fraternities) but there are also many students who decide not to and are independent. There is not a large divide between the two groups and you don't have to go greek just to fit in. I came here planning to stay independent but after a semester of being here, I'm considering joining a minority sorority. Once I got to campus and learned more about greek life, I thought I may enjoy it. DePauw also has very good housing options. After your first year, you aren't required to live in a dorm. The university owns houses and duplexes on campus that cost the same as the dorms. They are very nice places to live with a group of friends. They all have full kitchens and bathrooms and are very nice and up to date. DePauw also has a very beautiful campus although it is small. It is very well",
