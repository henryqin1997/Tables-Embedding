            "Well the food offered in the cafeteria is great. They have a good variety of foods and it is not to expensive. There also have healthy food and snacks. I give this college a 10 on the food i eat there everyday i went there for class.",
            "They do not have dorms it is a commuters college. Cant give a rating on dorms because they don't offer them but its a great college.",
            "Strictness is something that all the professor have in one way or another however if you follow the rules and respect them you should not have an issue. Hardness depends on us as individually if you study than its easy, if you don't then your in for a ride. We are all adults and therefore we all should know how to behave.",
            "The first thing to do is to see the counselling department to help you plan out your for classes in the best way for you. Use all the resources offer to you they are there for you. Always go to your professors for help.",
            "I personally think it is a great college most of the professors will do everything they can to help us strive. They also have many different resources that are helpful. It is a clean and beautiful campus."

    "textAfterTable": "Saki from Folsom, CA 10/12/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 5 out of 5 people found this review useful. 2 of 52 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Folsom Lake College is a great campus for those students that have a burning desire to transfer from an acknowledged campus to a 4-year institution. It is a great campus to get all of the general education requirements out of the way at a fraction of the cost that a tradition 4-year institution would cost. Tips for prospective students One thing that I would urge prospective students to do is to watch deadlines like a hawk and do everything as early as possible. With the state budget being late and education being a lower priority than it should be, competition for a seat in any class is tough. So if you have even the slightest notion that you are going to attend this campus, get done with your assessment test early and speak with a counselor as soon as possible. Bang for the buck",
