    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{16055=Telecommunication systems such as telephone systems have become increasingly sophisticated and are providing a broader and broader range of services. Most of these services are provided singly with relatively little interaction. For example, a typical customer service package might include capabilities for abbreviated dialing, call forwarding, add on call service, and voice mail. Usually, these services are utilized one at a time and are generally under the control of the called customer. AT&T's DEFINITY\ufffd system has partially solved some of these problems through the provision of a feature called \"call vectors.\" Call vectors are a flexible programming language for specifying conditions and reaction to conditions that are encountered in processing telephone calls. Call vectors are described in PINNACLE\ufffd Automatic Call Distributor, Call Vectoring Guide, Publication AT&T 475-550-120, Issue 2.00, November 1993, published by AT&T Corp. However, the call vectoring language lacks the facilities required for greater generality. In present telecommunications systems, especially telephone systems, there is no economical way of providing pre-planned, highly flexible call control where the service is planned by the called customer and its invocation is largely under the control of the calling customer., 27984=If digit=3, Route to 1234, 27014=The prompt step causes the quoted announcement to be provided to the caller. The two \"if\" statements indicate the actions to be performed based on the number received from the caller. If the caller keys 2, then the call is to be transferred to \"voice mail,\" a destination previously defined in the call vector program. If the digit is 3, then the call is to be routed to extension 1234 (the extension of the switchboard). Finally, if the customer has keyed 1, or has not keyed anything, then the call enters queue 1 to queue for the next available agent.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the above description is only of one preferred embodiment of the invention. Numerous other arrangements may be devised by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. The invention is thus limited only as defied in the accompanying claims. Next, test 455 is used because the announcement offers the caller the option to record his or her order in a voice mail system. If the caller starts to record (action block 457) and subsequently an agent becomes available (action block 459), the call is bridged to the agent (action block 460) who can listen to the order message and simply leave it alone or interact with the customer. If the caller chooses to wait in order to talk to an agent (block 461), subsequently if an agent becomes available (test 463, positive output), the caller is connected to the agent (action block 465). If the agent does not become available, test 467 is used to determine if the delay is becoming excessive. If not, block 461 is reentered and the caller waits some more, possibly while receiving an additional announcement. If the delay is becoming excessive, action block 415 is reentered and the computer retranslates to decide on an alternative routing in view of the excessive delay. If the level of busyness of team A as determined in action block 437 is not so high",
