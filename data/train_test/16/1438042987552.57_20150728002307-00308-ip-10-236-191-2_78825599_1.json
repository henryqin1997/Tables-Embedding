The tournament consisted of two groups, Open A for the players rated above 2300 FIDE and Open B for the players rated U2200. Players rated between 2200-2300 could choose the group in which they would prefer to compete. Both groups were played as nine-round Swiss tournaments, with time controls of 90 min for the whole game + 30 sec increment per move. The top prize in Open A was 2200 Euros, first place in Open B was awarded 500 Euros. Here are the top final standings of the event.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{10908=As you can see the untitled Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov, who is a computer programmer, produced a remarkable result, playing 470 points above his nominal (and highest ever) FIDE rating of 2227. Here for the record are his individual results in the Zadar Open, which include wins against grandmasters Bojan Kurajica, Robert Zelcic, Zdenko Kozul and Ivan Saric., 19752=The headline reads: \"Genius or crook? Check Bulgarian chess player stripped to see whether he is using cheating chip!\" And the intro paragraph: \"Ivanov is 25 years old and has a job as a programmer. Everybody is watching him, but he is not doing anything that raises suspicion that he might be receiving signals during the game.\" You can read the full article (in Croatian) here., 52375=Enjoy the high points of Norway Chess 2015 and FIDE GP Khanty-Mansyisk with high-class annotations and \u201cRound-up-shows\u201d with Daniel King (video). 14 opening articles with lots of new ideas. Training sessions from the opening trap to pawn endings!, 20859=There were 36 competitors at the tournament, including 16 grandmasters, five International Masters, and ten FIDE masters. According to the rating, the Bulgarian without any chess ranking was supposed to be an easy rival, but surprisingly started winning game after a game. In the first round he managed to defeat Croatian masters Bojan Kurajica, Robert Zelcic and Zdenko Kozul. \"After the eighth round there were suspicions that Ivanov has some electronic tools to help him, and in my capacity of a judge I decided to make a move in line with the FIDE rules,\" Stanislav Maroja, the chairperson of the chess union in Zadar District told daily newspaper Jutarnji List. But nothing was found on Ivanov, a 26-year-old computer programmer., 22795=Knowledgeable sources though the Bulgarian was cheating. However, they were wondering why he would take part in a tournament, which costs a couple of thousands of euro, while the cheating equipment, which can be integrated into contact lenses, for instance, costs thousands of Euros more. The suspicions about Ivanov\u2019s cheating were based on the fact that when the organisers stopped the broadcasting of the round before the last one, when Ivanov played vs Predoevic, the Bulgarian lost the game. Croatian grandmaster Zlatko Klaric said that Ivanov was cheating, because he was already accused of this at chess competitions in Bulgaria and Serbia. \u201cIvanov is chess programmer, who since mid-2011 until now had won only one rating point, while at the Zadar tournament he won 60. He made moves like a computer, which was obvious in the game vs Jovanovic,\u201d Klaric remarked. \u201cTechnologies are so developed now that theoretically, since the games were aired live, Ivanov\u2019s friends in the neighbouring room, from Sofia, or even from the Antarctic, could have sent him hints for his moves through chips, which could have been placed under the skin, in the ear, or in the teeth,\u201d Klaric added., 30069=Anti-cheating: the fifteen minute debate continues 29.06.2011 \u2013 Our recent reply to stern criticism leveled against us in the Dutch magazine New in Chess resulted, unsurprisingly, in a large number of letters from our readers, many quite effusive. But we decided not to publish any until at least one turned up supporting the views of our NiC critic. Six weeks went by until it at last came, authored by the critic himself. Now we can publish your letters., 48502=7/30/2015 \u2013 Did you ever play against an International Master?

There you can also download the games in a single file, and perhaps check them for correlation with chess engine moves. That can be done automatically with the Let's Check funtion of Fritz 13 and Houdini., 25104=We would be interested to know if anyone finds suspicious correlation of Ivanov's moves with that of a chess engine, e.g. Houdini. Especially in view of the very sharp, tactical games Ivanov played, successfully, against strong GM opposition, this could be a fairly important task. The Let's Check feature of Fritz 13 can display the Engine/Game Correlation, as it did in the French cheating scandal., 19118=The meteoric progress in this event led a number of players to sound alarm signals, and the organisers conducted what has been called a \"strip search\" of the Bulgarian player \u2013 which naturally drew the attention of main stream media in Croatia. Jutarnji List described it less sensationally: Ivanov was asked to take off his shirt, empty his pockets and submit his pen for inspection. Nothing was found. But is spite of that the story was out. Here are three reports from Croatia:, 22137=IFocus reports: \"A huge scandal burst out at the international chess tournament in the Croatian city of Zadar, after the organisers decided to undress Bulgarian chess player Borislav Ivanov to the skin, because they thought he had implanted chips, which tell him what moves to make. Everyone was looking at him but he did not reveal any evidence of using illegal help; he did not even have headphones, but all his moves were astonishing. \u201cIt is not true that we made him strip naked. He himself took off his t-shirt, while we emptied his pockets,\u201d said Chief Oraniser Stanislav Maroja., 20409=The Croatian Times article goes on to say that Borislav Ivanov was stripped and had his clothing searched after judges decided he must have a hidden aid telling him what moves to make after he beat much better ranked chess players., 29213=Anti-cheating: the fifteen minute broadcast delay 13.05.2011 \u2013 For five years we have been trying to get FIDE to implement a 15-minute delay in the Internet broadcast of important games \u2013 to make organised cheating harder. A chess journalist has now pointed out a fatal flaw in the plan: it would force chess journalists to walk many yards to find out the current status of the games. Damn \u2013 and we thought it was such a good idea! What is your opinion?}",
