    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Option: use pressure transducer for interface pressure mapping of wound site and automate control and monitor pressures, flow, etc. Subcuticular (subepidermal) sutures avoid conflict with rayon strip and need for early suture removal, or pressure on skin sutures beneath compressive black sponge. Clinical trial confirmation: Closure of surgical site in upper chest area in patient with severe healing problems showed excellent results and rapid wound healing. Duration: several (e.g., up to three) weeks. Phase 3: remove overdrape and FTC.2; leave underdrape and rayon strip in place; visually observe wound healing progress; transparency desirable. Duration: approximately three days, i.e. days 3-6 after operation. Phase 2: Remove active suction by cutting off (elbow) connector and leave FTC.2 in place. Released from suction, FTC.2 expands against the overdrape and exerts positive pressure differential on the operation site. May maintain continued mild compression throughout Phase 2; residual drainage function through rayon strip and into FTC.2 provides continued drying of suture line. Deep drain tubes remain in place during Phase 2 for active deep drainage. Duration: approximately 2-3 days, i.e. effective time for active drainage from incision/stitch line to cease and for suture line to dry and heal. Phase 1: deep drainage (drain tube(s)), active or passive; active suction applied to surface PUE foam (placed on top of surgical incision,",
