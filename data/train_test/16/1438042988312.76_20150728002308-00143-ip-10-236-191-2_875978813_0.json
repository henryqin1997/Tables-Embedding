    "textBeforeTable": "About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Champion colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Blizzard Champion plastic - it is Champion plastic with thousands of micro bubbles incorporated into it resulting in weights as low as 130 grams. It provides almost the same flight characteristics and superior durability as Champion models in heavier weights. They fly farther with less effort. Discs weighing less than 140 grams float in water. Speed 12, Glide 5, Turn -1, Fade 3 It is a great choice for maximum distance, long hyzers, headwind drives, and for intermediate to advanced players looking for a stable wind fighting distance disc. 21.2 cm The Innova Blizzard Champion Destroyer is a distance driver that is stable to overstable. It is a very fast golf disc with significant glide. Faster than the Wraith and with a little more high and low speed stability. Can handle headwinds and throws with off axis torque. The Star Destroyer is the first Speed 12 disc Innova released. Initial reviews compared it to a faster TeeRex. A great disc for sidearm throwers and those with lots of power. Not for beginners.",
    "textAfterTable": "\"My long time sidearm favorite has to be the Destroyer. It gives me such confidence. I get great distance, dependable fade, and a big skip/flare at the end. The Destroyer is also my go to driver for shots uphill.\" - Debbie Scott \"The Destroyer is the choice of an overwhelming number of top pros for precision control with maximum distance. It is easier to throw accurately at maximum power than any disc on the market. \" - Christian Dietrich \"The Destroyer is a very consistent distance driver that is very overstable when new. It is easily the farthest flying disc in my bag.\" - Ricky Wysocki If you are looking for a disc that has more Fade, try the XCaliber more Turn, try the Wahoo more Glide, try the Wahoo \u00a0 Other Speed 12 discs include the TeeDevil, Tern, Wahoo and XCaliber Write a review Rating: Bad \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Good Your Name: Your Review:",
