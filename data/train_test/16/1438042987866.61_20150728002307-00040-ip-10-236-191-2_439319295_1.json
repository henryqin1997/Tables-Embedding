Winning the Super Bowl is a little different than winning meaningless playoff games. The point is, 4 playoff wins in 2 years does not erase a decade of mediocrity. Especially when the Jets would not have qualified one of those years had another team not laid down for them. There is a huge difference in playing bad teams versus teams that rest their guys and have no desire to win. The 2011 (8-5) Jets faced a couple of bad teams to end the season with the playoffs on the line and lost to both teams. Had it been another situation like 09, they probably would have made it. we have a QB we know we can win w/ if surrounded w/ the right cast, you have no idea about yours yet. 5th in playoff apps out of 16 teams, 4th in playoff wins. Buf: zero playoff apps Cle: 1 playoff app, 0 playoff wins Hou: 1 playoff app, 1 playoff win Mia: 2 playoff apps, ZERO playoff wins Jax: 2 playoff apps, 1 playoff win Oak: 2 playoff apps, 3 playoff wins.
