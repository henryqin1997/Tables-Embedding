            "Cal State East Bay is great for people who are interested in one-on-one time with your teachers. The classes are small and provide you the opportunity to have a more personal relationship with students and teachers. It is a great school for personal relationships among faculty, staff, and students."

Am enjoying being here I am truly enjoying it here at CSUEB. I live on campus, so I have had the chance to get to know many students, and become friends with some great people. I joined a sorority, and have gone to all the events the school has held. I've even joined up for the Orientation team this summer to help show students what a great school it is! GET INVOLVED! Believe me, it's worth all the time spent. Am learning a lot I have learned a lot in the 10 weeks that I have attended so far. The class sizes are nice, and I haven;t had much trouble getting the classes that I want. I have done well my first quarter, and I think I owe credit to CSUEB for that, Login to rate or flag the reviews Elmer from San Leandro, CA 07/18/2009 Reviewer",
