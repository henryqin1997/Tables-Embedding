Although it is not the state capital, it is the largest city in the State of Texas. The city was founded on the banks of the Buffalo Bayou and named after former Texas governor, Sam Houston, who was instrumental in bringing Texas into the union. Houston enjoys a humid subtropical climate. Showers and afternoon thunderstorms are common in summer time, but Houston is lucky to avoid the swarms of tornadoes that plague the rest of Texas. As of 2012, the city had a population of just over 2 million. This translates to a population density of 3,300 people, similar to Denver, Colorado or San Diego, California. The cost of living in Houston is approximately 20 percent less than that of New York City, with a Consumer Price Index of $79.99., 4095=As the Baby Boomer generation of individuals born between 1945 and 1965 reaches retirement age, the senior population is growing rapidly.
