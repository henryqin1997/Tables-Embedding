            "for the most part they do a good job of making you feel safe. if you are out late at night at at the library studing till three in the morning and do not have a ride back they will come and drive you back and make sure you make it safe",

            "the foood is okay if you catch it on a good day . sometimes its the samething and you get tired of it. they need to have more places to pick to eat. cino and hicks is not enough and hicks closes at eight. most people get hungry later at night",

The beach is very close by and if you have a car, you can hang out at Hunterdon State Park Beach or Garden City Beach. There is a club on campus for everyone and Greek life is active. If you are into the arts, Brookgreen Gardens offers a student discount and there are many Arts and Crafts festivals held on campus and nearby. The Farmer's Market also comes to campus. See my blog for more info at http://coastaladmissions.blogspot.com/2014/10/debunking-freshman-myths.html?view=mosaic., 83787=Many activities, something for everyone. Check out my blog at http://coastaladmissions.blogspot.com/2014/10/debunking-freshman-myths.html?view=mosaic, 280414=I just transferred to Coastal Carolina University in the Fall 2012 and I find it to be a great school. The teachers and faculty here are very helpful with any questions. I reccommend this school, especially because its close to the beach!, 161507=I will be attending in the fall of 2012. It's a great choice for those that live local and want to stay home for another year., 387156=Try to live close to the school and walk or take a shuttle, unless you have an 8 o'clock class you will probably be fighting for parking., 11960=Very Good. There are plenty of different food options. Also, different places to eat on campus. On different days they have different specials such as cajun, soul food, chinese, and etc. But, some things stay constant like pizza, fries, subs, salads, and more., 476101=We're building a movie theater, estimated to be done in 2015. There will also be a game room and activity house. It's a giant student center., 363363=As you get into your major classes, they will become more challenging but also enjoyable. Good thing about it, the student to faculty ratio is 17:1 so you'll only have about 20 students in your upper classes., 492267=You has many choice to choose from. They're recently building new student housing for Freshmen. 2 have opened and two more are going to open Fall 2016. Coastal also offers on campus apartments, but its 0.5 miles away from campus. Shuttles come by daily. You're interactive within your area of living}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Personally it is an atmosphere where you can succeed. You can seek extra help from your professor, which involves you to establish relationship where he or she knows you on a first name basis. Whenever the semester comes to an end that professor knows that you have been seeking the necessary help to receive an outstanding grade. At CCU I have an extra help session with my professor, who is easy to reach in a 30-50 student classroom. Am learning a lot I am writing to inform you of the great things Coastal Carolina University has done for me. I'm sure many of people have mentioned how college will be some of the best years of one life, because that is what was told to me before I entered college. It wasn't until I set foot on the lovely campus of Coastal Carolina that I truly believed that this was going to be a great experience for me. First and foremost, the classroom setting at Coastal is phenomenal, for very important reasons. The class sizes are not too large, nor to small. It is a great opportunity to bond with classmates, and almost have a one on one with you and or your professor individually. Login to rate or flag",
