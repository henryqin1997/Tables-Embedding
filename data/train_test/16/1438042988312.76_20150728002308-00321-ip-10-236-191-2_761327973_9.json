In 1926 Norddeutscher Lloyd bought the stock majority on the L\u00fcbecker and the fleet was taken over., 13497=The Partenreederei* shipping company Horn was created by Heinrich Christian Horn. He had created a match factory in 1864 and in 1869 began to also trade in coals and coke. In 1879 he then bought the Schleischiffahrt which carried passengers and goods on the river Schlei., 13789=The establishment of the shipping company took place in 1882 in Schleswig and started with one ship the Stadt Schleswig. Only in 1888 after several difficult first years was there demand for a further ship. In 1905 there were 21 ships operating for the partenreederei.

Due to co-operation of many years in fruit transport with the American Del Monte group, at the beginning of the 1990's the Del Monte group also acquired a part of the Horn Line. The enterprise worked at first as a general contractor of the French Compagnie Generale Transatlantique in Germany., 14937=The Flensburger bought back one ship in 1920, the Irmgard Horn and sent it to the Caribbean.
