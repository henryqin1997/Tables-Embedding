In addition to huge savings throughout the store, the 2011 sale features two special promotions that allow you to win like never before. The Great Gift Pile challenges gamers to complete up to six objectives each day. Completion of each objective grants the chance to win a free game or discount coupons for select games available on Steam. If you don\u2019t win, no worries, you\u2019ll be given a piece of coal. But hold onto that coal! Why? Coal is the ticket to enter the Epic Holiday Giveaway. It\u2019s called Epic because the top prize is every game on Steam. The more coal you have, the better your chance of winning. Players may alternatively choose to magically mix their coal into something shiny and new by \u201ccrafting\u201d seven pieces into a gift from the Great Gift Pile. So this year receiving coal is a good thing. Didn\u2019t get what you want? Of course Steam allows you to trade coal and prizes with your friends. Further details on these events and information on how it\u2019s progressing may be found here. Complete information on all the savings, daily deals, featured publisher game packs, compilations and more may be found on www.steampowered.com.}",
