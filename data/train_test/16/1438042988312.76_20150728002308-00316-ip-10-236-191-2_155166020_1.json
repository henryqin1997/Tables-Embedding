    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{1492=He began the year in Lynchburg, Va., went to Zebulon, N.C., in late May and then finished in Louisville, Ky. It turned out that the increasing level of baseball wasn't the biggest challenge for the 2007 first-round pick., 1601=Devin Mesoraco got good at filling out change-of-address cards during the 2010 season.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{12372=Like many young backstops, Mesoraco still needs to improve on his receiving skills. Nuances like calling a game and dealing with the better stuff that comes from arms at the higher levels are still a work in progress. That's largely why he went to the Arizona Fall League after all of his travels in 2010. And while he was charged with 10 passed balls in 18 games, he thinks the work he did there should carry over as he's knocking on the door in Cincinnati., 22565=Pitcher of the Year -- Brad Boxberger Whether he stays in the rotation or finds a home in short relief, Boxberger will make adjustments and figure out Double-A hitters in 2011. He'll continue his 10.8 K/9 ratio and then some, all while limiting hits, be it in the rotation or closing games., 19471=7. Todd Frazier, 3B/OF: The 2007 supplemental first-rounder has always been a solid, if unspectacular, hitter on his way up the ladder, though he scuffled a bit in Triple-A in 2010. The real issue is finding a defensive home for him as he's largely blocked at third, outfield and at first, where he's also seen time. A future as a super-utility guy may be in the offing, where his offensive skills can be moved around from position to position., 14612=4. Billy Hamilton, 2B/SS: No. 3 on the Top 10 second-base prospect list, that's the position Hamilton will likely play more of as he hits full-season ball. He might be the fastest guy in the Minors and knows how to use his speed (48 steals in 69 games). He also knows he's a leadoff-type and has plate discipline way beyond his years. He could take the Class A Midwest League by storm in 2011., 18655=5. Yorman Rodriguez, OF: Everyone should make plans to go to Dayton in 2011 because there may not be a more dynamic duo than Hamilton and this teenage outfielder. He's got all the tools you could ask for, and he's just figuring out how to use them. When all is said and done, he could be the prototypical five-tool right fielder., 19945=8. Brad Boxberger, RHP: When Boxberger came out of the University of Southern California in 2009, there were questions about whether he'd be a starter or reliever long-term. Those still haven't been answered because he started well in the Carolina League but fell apart in Double-A as a reliever. He's got the power arm that might work well in short relief but the arsenal to be a starter if he can work out the kinks. He'll do that back in Double-A to start the year., 21720=Dave Sappelt, OF: A guy who earns MLB.com's organizational hitter of the year honors shouldn't be under the radar, but the 2008 ninth-rounder still is. He played at three levels in 2010, finished with an astounding .342/.395/.507 line along with 25 steals. Then he hit well in the Arizona Fall League and Venezuela. He's been impressing as a non-roster invitee in camp this spring and could knock on the door very soon., 13551=1. Aroldis Chapman, LHP: The No. 6 prospect on the Top 50 list, and No. 1 among all left-handed pitching prospects, Chapman is ready to bring his triple-digit fastball to the big leagues full-time. His plus slider complements the heater very well -- all that he needs to be a dominant reliever, his role in 2011 at the very least., 22911=Jonathan Mayo is a reporter for MLB.com and writes a blog, B3. Follow @JonathanMay oB3 on Twitter. This story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseball or its clubs., 21260=Matt Klinker, RHP: In 2009, Klinker pitched at three levels and seemed to get better as he went up the ladder. Last year, he started in Double-A, earning a promotion to Triple-A, where he hit a bit of a wall. Still, he topped the organization in wins and strikeouts while finishing sixth in ERA. Now 26, he did get a non-roster invite to camp and the 2007 15th-rounder will likely go back to Louisville, ready to help when called.}",

He could take the Class A Midwest League by storm in 2011. 3. Devin Mesoraco, C: He can hit for average and power, and his plus arm allows him to shut down a running game. He'll head to Triple-A to work on his overall catching game, but don't be surprised to see him in Cincinnati at some point this year. 2. Yonder Alonso, 1B: Finally healthy, Alonso (No. 5 among first base prospects) took off in the second half last year, hitting .335/.415/.561 after the All-Star break and his Futures Game appearance. There's a small roadblock at first base in Cincinnati, in the form of Joey Votto, so it remains to be seen how the Reds will find a place for Alonso's bat, which could be ready, in their lineup. 1.

Yasmani Grandal, C: Taken No. 12 overall in last June's Draft, Grandal got a big league deal and was in Major League camp for his first Spring Training. A natural leader behind the plate, he's a slightly better defender than Mesoraco all-around but not as good a hitter. He does have pretty good pop, though. Starting in the Class A California League, Grandal could move quickly, giving the Reds a very nice problem to have. 7.
