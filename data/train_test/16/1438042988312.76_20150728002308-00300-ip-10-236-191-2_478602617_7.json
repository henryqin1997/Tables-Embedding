By \u201cnucleic acid\u201d or \u201coligonucleotide\u201d or grammatical equivalents herein means at least two nucleotides covalently linked together. A nucleic acid of the present invention will generally contain phosphodiester bonds, although in some cases, as outlined below, nucleic acid analogs are included that may have alternate backbones, comprising, for example, phosphoramide (Beaucage, et al., Tetrahedron, 49(10):1925 (1993) and references therein; Letsinger, J.

Nucleic acids containing one or more carbocyclic sugars are also included within the definition of nucleic acids (see Jenkins, et al., Chem. Soc. Rev., (1995) pp. 169-176). Several nucleic acid analogs are described in Rawls, C & E News, Jun. 2, 1997, page 35. All of these references are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. These modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to facilitate the addition of additional moieties such as labels, or to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments. In addition, mixtures of naturally occurring nucleic acids and analogs can be made. Alternatively, mixtures of different nucleic acid analogs, and mixtures of naturally occuring nucleic acids and analogs may be made. The nucleic acids may be single stranded or double stranded, as specified, or contain portions of both double stranded or single stranded sequence. The nucleic acid may be DNA, both genomic and cDNA, RNA or a hybrid, where the nucleic acid contains any combination of deoxyribo- and ribo-nucleotides, and any combination of bases, including uracil, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, inosine, xathanine hypoxathanine, isocytosine, isoguanine, etc., 67323=In a preferred embodiment, foreign constructs comprising the IL-4 inducible \u03b5 promoter and the reporter gene are made. By \u201cforeign\u201d herein is meant that the fusion nucleic acids originates outside of the cells. That is, a recombinant nucleic acid is made that contains an exogeneous IL-4 inducible \u03b5 promoter and a reporter gene. Thus, in some circumstances, the cells will contain both exogeneous and endogeneous IL-4 inducible \u03b5 promoters. By \u201crecombinant nucleic acid\u201d herein is meant nucleic acid, originally formed in vitro, in general, by the manipulation of nucleic acid by endonucleases, in a form not normally found in nature. Thus an isolated nucleic acid, in a linear form, a nucleic acid containing components not normally joined, such as an IL-4 inducible promoter and a reporter gene, or an expression vector formed in vitro by ligating DNA molecules that are not normally joined, are all considered recombinant for the purposes of this invention. It is understood that once a recombinant nucleic acid is made and reintroduced into a host cell or organism, it will replicate non-recombinantly, i.e. using the in vivo cellular machinery of the host cell rather than in vitro manipulations; however, such nucleic acids, once produced recombinantly, although subsequently replicated non-recombinantly, are still considered recombinant for the purposes of the invention. In this embodiment, any cells that express an IL-4 receptor that transduces the IL-4 signal to the nucleus and alters transcription can be used. Suitable cells include, but are not limited to, human cells and cell lines that show IL-4/13 inducible production of germline \u03b5 transcripts, including, but not limited to, DND39 (see Watanabe, supra), MC-116, (Kumar, et al., \u201cHuman BCGF-12kD Functions as an Autocrine Growth Factor in Transformed B Cells,\u201d Eur Cytokine Netw 1(2):109 (1990)), CA-46 (Wang, et al., \u201cUCN-01: A Potent Abrogator of G2 Checkpoint Function in Cancer Cells with Dirupted p53,\u201d J Natl Cancer Inst 88:956 (1996))., 65175=Preferred protease cleavage sites include, but are not limited to, the 2a site (Ryan et al., J.

See e.g. Marston, F. A. O. (1986) Biol. Chem. J. 240, 1-12., 145132=Each screen will start with production of the primary retrovirus peptide library, as is generally shown in FIG. 7. This is generally done as outlined in PCT US97/01019 and PCT US97/01048, both of which are expressly incorporated by reference. In general, this is done as follows. On day 1, the Phoenix cells are seeded in 10 cm plates at 5\ufffd106 cells in 6 ml (DMEM+10% FBS+Pen/Strep) per plate the day before transfection. Day 2: allow all reagents to reach room temperature 30 min. before starting. Add 50 mM chloroquine at 8 \u03bcl/plate (50 \u03bcM final) before preparing the transfection solution. Mix CaPO4 reagents in 15 ml polypropylene tube: per plate: 10 \u03bcg DNA, 122 \u03bcl 2M CaCl2, 876 \u03bcl H2O, 1.0 ml 2\ufffdHBS. Add 2\ufffdHBS and depress the expulsion button completely to bubble air through the mix for 10 secs. Immediately add mixture gently dropwise to plate. Incubate 3-8 hours. Remove medium and replace with 6.0 ml DMEM-medium. Day 3: Change medium again to 6.0 mls of medium optimal for the cells to be infected. Move to 32\ufffd C. either in the morning or afternoon depending on the Phoenix cell confluency and whether you will infect at 48 or 72 hrs after transfection. Day 4 or 5: Collect virus supernatant from transfected plates (6.0 ml) into 50 ml tubes and add protamine sulfate to a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml. Pass through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. Count target cells and distribute 107 cells per 10 cm plate transfected to 50 ml tubes and pellet 5 min. Resuspend each pellet of target cells in virus supernatant and transfer to a 6 well plate at 1.0-1.2 ml per well. Seal plate with parafilm and centrifuge at RT for 30-90 min. at 2500 RPM. Remove parafilm and incubate plate over night at 37\ufffd C. Day 5: Collect and pellet each well of target cells. Resuspend in 3 ml medium and transfer back to the same 6well plate. Infection can be repeated by refeeding the Phoenix cells with 6 ml fresh medium and reinfecting the same cells again up to 3 times to increase % of cells infected (for instance at 48, 56, and 72 hours). Day 7 or Day 8: At 48 to 72 hrs. post infection, target cells are ready to analyze for expression., 59046=In a preferred embodiment, chimeric Fas receptor genes are made. The exact combination will depend on the cell type used and the receptors normally produced by these cells. For example, when using human cells or cell lines, a non-human extracellular domain and a human cytosolic domain are preferred, to prevent endogeneous induction of the death gene. For example, a preferred embodiment utilizes human cells, a murine extracellular Fas receptor domain and a human cytosolic domain, such that the endogeneous human Fas ligand will not activate the murine domain. Alternatively, human extracellular domains may be used when the cells used do not endogeneously produce the ligand; for example, the human EPO extracellular domain may be used when the cells do not endogeneously produce EPO.

Suitable retroviral packaging system cell lines include, but are not limited to, the Bing and BOSC23 cell lines described in WO 94/19478; Soneoka et al., Nucleic Acid Res. 23(4):628 (1995); Finer et al., Blood 83:43 (1994); Pheonix packaging lines such as PhiNX-eco and PhiNX-ampho, described below; 292T+gag-pol and retrovirus envelope; PA317; and cell lines outlined in Markowitz et al., Virology 167:400 (1988), Markowitz et al., J. Virol. 62:1120 (1988), Li et al., PNAS USA 93:11658 (1996), Kinsella et al., Human Gene Therapy 7:1405 (1996), all of which are incorporated by reference. Preferred systems include PhiNX-eco and PhiNX-ampho or similar cell lines, disclosed in PCT US97/01019., 42924=The present invention provides compositions and methods useful in screening for modulators, particularly inhibitors, of the production of IgE antibodies. In particular, assay methodologies are provided that are amenable to high-throughput screening strategies, such that large numbers of potential drugs may be screened rapidly and efficiently. Generally, traditional treatments for IgE suppression are based on regulation of the system after IgE has been made, for example using anti-IgE antibodies or anti-histamines, to modulate the IgE-mediated response resulting in mast cell degranulation. In some cases, drugs are known that generally downregulate IgE production or that inhibit switching but not induction of germline transcripts (see for example Loh et al., J. Allerg. Clin. Immunol. 97(5):1141 (1996))., 128848=Suitable transcription activator domains include, but are not limited to, transcriptional activator domains from GAL4 (amino acids 1-147; see Fields et al., Nature 340:245 (1989), and Gill et al., PNAS USA 87:2127 (1990)), GCN4 (from S. cerevisiae, Hope et al., Cell 46:885 (1986)), ARD1 (from S. cerevisiae, Thukral et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:2360 (1989)), the human estrogen receptor (Kumar et al., Cell 51:941 (1987)), VP16 (Triezenberg et al., Genes Dev. 2(6):718-729 (1988)), and B42 (Gyuris et al, Cell 1993), and NF-kB p65, derivatives thereof which are functionally similar., 106569=In a preferred embodiment, the fusion partner includes a linker or tethering sequence, as generally described in PCT US 97/01019, that can allow the candidate agents to interact with potential targets unhindered. For example, when the candidate bioactive agent is a peptide, useful linkers include glycine-serile polymers (including, for example, (GS)n(GSGGS)n (SEQ ID NO:18) and (GGGS)n (SEQ ID NO:19), where n is an integer of at least one), glycine-alanine polymers, alanine-serine polymers, and other flexible linkers such as the tether for the shaker potassium channel, and a large variety of other flexible linkers, as will be appreciated by those in the art. Glycine-serine polymers are preferred since both of these amino acids are relatively unstructured, and therefore may be able to serve as a neutral tether between components. Secondly, serine is hydrophilic and therefore able to solubilize what could be a globular glycine chain. Third, similar chains have been shown to be effective in joining subunits of recombinant proteins such as single chain antibodies., 52211=In a preferred embodiment, the reporter gene is a death gene that provides a nucleic acid that encodes a protein that causes the cells to die. Death genes fall into two basic categories: death genes that encode death proteins that require a death ligand to kill the cells, and death genes that encode death proteins that kill cells as a result of high expression within the cell, and do not require the addition of any death ligand. It is preferable that cell death requires a two-step process: the expression of the death gene and induction of the death phenotype with a signal or ligand, such that the cells may be grown up expressing the death gene, and then induced to die. A number of death genes/ligand pairs are known, including, but not limited to, the Fas receptor and Fas ligand (Bodmer, et al., \u201cCharacterization of Fas,\u201d J Biol Chem 272(30):18827-18833 (Jul. 25, 1997); muFAS, Gonzalez-Cuadrado, et al., \u201cAgonistic anti-Fas Antibodies Induce Glomerular Cell Apoptosis in Mice In Vivo,\u201d Kidney Int 51(6): 1739-1746 (June 1997); Muruva, et al., Hum Gene Ther, 8(8):955 (May 1997)), (or anti-Fas receptor antibodies); p450 and cyclophosphamide (Chen, et al., \u201cPotentiation of Cytochrome P450/Cyclophosphamide-Based Cancer Gene Therapy By Coexpression of the P450 Reductase Gene,\u201d Cancer Res 57(21):4830-4837 (Nov. 1, 1997)); thymidine kinase and gangcylovir (Stone, R., \u201cMolecular \u2018Surgery\u2019 For Brain Tumors,\u201d 256(5063):1513 (Jun. 12, 1992)), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and TNF. Alternatively, the death gene need not require a ligand, and death results from high expression of the gene; for example, the overexpression of a number of programmed cell death (PCD) proteins are known to cause cell death, including, but not limited to, caspases, bax, TRADD, FADD, SCK, MEK, etc., 71801=Alternatively, and preferably, the selection of the \u201cknock ins\u201d are done by FACS on the basis of the incorporation of a reporter gene. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, a first homologous recombination event is done to put a first reporter gene, such as GFP, into at least one allele of the cell genome. Preferably, this is a cell type that exhibits IL-4 inducible production of at least germline \u03b5 transcripts, so that the cells may be tested by IL-4 production for reporter gene expression. Suitable cells include, but are not limited to, human cells and cell lines that show IL-4/13 inducible production of germline \u03b5 transcripts, including, but not limited to, DND39 (see Watanabe, supra), MC-116, (Kumar, et al., \u201cHuman BCGF-12kD Functions as an autocrine Growth Factor in Transformed B Cells,\u201d Eur Cytokine Netw 1(2):109 (1990)), CA-46 (Wang, et al., \u201cUCN-01 :A Potent Abrogator of G2 Checkpoint Function in Cancer Cells with Dirupted p53,\u201d J Natl Cancer Inst 88:956 (1996)). As is noted herein, the ability of MC-116 and CA-46 cells to produce germline \u03b5 transcripts upon IL-4/13 induction was not known prior to the present invention. Thus, preferred embodiments provide MC-116 and/or CA-46 cells comprising recombinant nucleic acid reporter constructs are outlined herein., 28528=This Application is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/076,624, filed May 12, 1998., 122331=A particularly well suited retroviral transfection system is described in Mann et al., supra: Pear et al., PNAS USA 90(18):8392-6 (1993); Kitamura et al., PNAS USA 92:9146-9150 (1995); Kinsella et al., Human Gene Therapy 7:1405-1413; Hofmann et al., PNAS USA 93:5185-5190; Choate et al., Human Gene Therapy 7:2247 (1996); WO 94/19478; PCT US97/01019, and references cited therein, all of which are incorporated by reference., 118267=Suitable vectors will depend on the host cells used. For use of the system in yeast, suitable vectors are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, pHisi-1 and pLacZi (Clonetech Cat #K1603-1) (Li, et al., \u201cIsolation of ORC6, A Component of the Yeast Origin of Recognition Complex By a One-Hybrid System,\u201d Science 262:1870-1873 (1993); Liu, et al. \u201cIdentifying DNA-Binding Sites and Analyzing DNA-Binding Domains Using a Yeast Selection System,\u201d In: Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 5:125-137 (1993), Luo, et al., \u201cCloning and Analysis of DNA-Binding Proteins By Yeast One-Hybrid and One-Two-Hybrid Systems,\u201d Biotechniques 20:564-568 (1996), and Strubin, et al., \u201cOBF-1, A Novel B Cell-Specific Coactivator That Stimulates Immunoglobin Promoter Activity Through Association with Octamer-Binding Proteins,\u201d Cell 80:497-506 (1995)). Yeast expression systems are well known in the art, and include expression vectors for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans and C. maltosa, Hansenula polymorpha, Kluyveromyces fragilis and K. lactis, Pichia guillerimondii and P. pastoris, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Yarrowia lipolytica. Preferred promoter sequences for expression in yeast include the inducible GAL1,10 promoter, the promoters from alcohol dehydrogenase, enolase, glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, and the acid phosphatase gene. Yeast selectable markers include ADE2, HIS4, LEU2, TRP1, and ALG7, which confers resistance to tunicamycin; the neomycin phosphotransferase gene, which confers resistance to G418; and the CUP1 gene, which allows yeast to grow in the presence of copper ions., 95151=In a preferred embodiment, the presentation structure is a coiled-coil structure, allowing the presentation of the randomized peptide on an exterior loop. See, for example, Myszka et al., Biochem. 33:2362-2373 (1994), hereby incorporated by reference). Using this system investigators have isolated peptides capable of high affinity interaction with the appropriate target. In general, coiled-coil structures allow for between 6 to 20 randomized positions., 84002=In a preferred embodiment, a library of different candidate bioactive agents are used. Preferably, the library should provide a sufficiently structurally diverse population of randomized agents to effect a probabilistically sufficient range of diversity to allow binding to a particular target. Accordingly, an interaction library should be large enough so that at least one of its members will have a structure that gives it affinity for the target. Although it is difficult to gauge the required absolute size of an interaction library, nature provides a hint with the immune response: a diversity of 107-108 different antibodies provides at least one combination with sufficient affinity to interact with most potential antigens faced by an organism. Published in vitro selection techniques have also shown that a library size of 107 to 108 is sufficient to find structures with affinity for the target. A library of all combinations of a peptide 7 to 20 amino acids in length, such as generally proposed herein, has the potential to code for 207 (109) to 2020. Thus, with libraries of 107 to 108 different molecules the present methods allow a \u201cworking\u201d subset of a theoretically complete interaction library for 7 amino acids, and a subset of shapes for the 2020 library. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, at least 106, preferably at least 107, more preferably at least 108 and most preferably at least 109 different sequences are simultaneously analyzed in the subject methods. Preferred methods maximize library size and diversity., 99818=In a preferred embodiment, the targeting sequence is a nuclear localization signal (NLS). NLSs are generally short, positively charged (basic) domains that serve to direct the entire protein in which they occur to the cell's nucleus. Numerous NLS amino acid sequences have been reported including single basic NLSs such as that of the SV40 (monkey virus) large T Antigen (Pro Lys Lys Lys Mg Lys Val (SEQ ID NO: 12)), Kalderon (1984), et al., Cell, 39:499-509; the human retinoic acid receptor-\u03b2 nuclear localization signal (ARRRRP (SEQ ID) NO:13)); NF\u03baB p50 (EEVQRKRQKL (SEQ ID NO:14); Ghosh et al., Cell 62:1019 (1990); NF\u03baB p65 (EEKRKRTYE (SEQ ID NO: 15); Nolan et al., Cell 64:961 (1991), and others (see for example Boulikas, J. Cell. Biochem. 55(1):32-58 (1994), hereby incorporated by reference) and double basic NLSs exemplified by that of the Xenopus (African clawed toad) protein, nucleoplasmin (Ala Val Lys Mg Pro Ala Ala Thr Lys Lys Ala (My Gin Ala Lys Lys Lys Lys Leu Asp (SEQ ID NO:16)), Dingwall, et al., Cell, 30:449-458, 1982 and Dingwall, et al., J. Cell Biol., 107:641-849; 1988). Numerous localization studies have demonstrated that NLSs incorporated in synthetic peptides or grafted onto reporter proteins not normally targeted to the cell nucleus cause these peptides and reporter proteins to be concentrated in the nucleus. See, for example, Dmgwall, and Laskey; Ann, Rev. Cell Biol., 2:367-390, 1986; Bonnerot, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84:6795-6799, 1987; Galileo, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:458-462, 1990., 54067=As will be appreciated by those in the art, the use of the death genes in the manner described herein, particularly in two-step applications, allows general and high-throughput screening for inhibitors of other promoters, in addition to the IL-4 inducible \u03b5 promoters described herein. Thus, the present invention provides fusion nucleic acids comprising a promoter of interest operably linked to a death gene for use in screening methods. The promoter of interest can be either a constitutive promoter or an inducible promoter, such as the IL-4 inducible \u03b5 promoter. As will be appreciated by those in the art, any number of possible promoters could be used. Suitable promoters of interest include, but are not limited to, inducible promoters such as IL-4 \u03b5 promoter, promoters that are induced by cytokines or growth factors such as the interferon responsive factors 1 to 4, NFkB (Fiering, et al., \u201cSingle Cell Assay of a Transcription Factor Reveals a Threshold in Transcription Activated By Signals Emanating From the T-Cell Antigen Receptor,\u201d Genes Dev 4(10):1823-1834 (October 1990)), etc. When inducible promoters are used in this embodiment, suitable cell types are those that can be induced by the appropriate inducer, as will be appreciated by those in the art., 112645=In a preferred embodiment, the presence or absence of the reporter gene is determined using a fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS). In general, the expression of the reporter gene comprising a label (or allowing the use of a label) is optimized to allow for efficient enrichment by FACS. Thus, for example, in general, 10 to 1000 fluores per sorting event are needed; i.e. per cell, with from about 100 to 1000 being preferred, and from 500 to 1000 being especially preferred. This can be accomplished by amplifying the signal per reporter gene, i.e. have each second label comprise multiple fluores, or by having a high density of reporter genes per cell; or a combination of both., 51425=In a preferred embodiment, the reporter gene is a cell cycle gene, that is, a gene that causes alterations in the cell cycle. For example, p21 protein its ligand (a collection of three proteins; see Harper, et al., \u201cThe p21 Cdk-Interacting Protein Cip1 Is a Potent Inhibitor of G1 Cyclin-Dependent Kinases,\u201d Cell 75:805-816 (Nov. 19, 1993)), which does not cause death, but causes cell-cycle arrest, such that cells containing inhibited IL-4 inducible promoters grow out much more quickly, allowing detection on this basis. As will be appreciated by those in the art, it is also possible to configure the system such that the cells containing the inhibited IL-4 inducible promoters do not grow out, and thus can be selected on this basis as well., 47843=In a preferred embodiment, the reporter gene encodes a protein that can be used as a direct label, i.e. a detection gene, for sorting the cells, i.e. for cell enrichment by FACS. In this embodiment, the protein product of the reporter gene itself can serve to distinguish cells that are expressing the reporter gene. In this embodiment, suitable reporter genes include those encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP; Chalfie, et al., \u201cGreen Fluorescent Protein as a Marker for Gene Expression,\u201d Science 263(5148):802-805 (Feb. 11, 1994); and EGFP; Clontech\u2014Genbank Accession Number U55762), blue fluorescent protein (BFP; 1. Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc. 1801 de Maisonneuve Blvd. West, 8th Floor, Montreal (Quebec) Canada H3H 1J9; 2. Stauber, R. H. Biotechniques 24(3):462-471 (1998); 3. Heim, R. and Tsien, R. Y. Curr. Biol. 6:178-182 (1996)), enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP; 1. Clontech Laboratories, Inc., 1020 East Meadow Circle, Palo Alto, Calif. 94303), luciferase (Ichiki, et al.), and \u03b2-galactosidase (Nolan, et al., \u201cFluorescence-Activated Cell Analysis and Sorting of Viable Mammalian Cells Based on Beta-D-galactosidase Activity After Transduction of Escherichia coli LacZ,\u201d Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 85(8):2603-2607 (April 1988))., 64225=In a preferred embodiment, when two reporter genes are used, they are fused together in such a way as to only require a single promoter, and thus some way of functionally separating the two genes is preferred. This can be done on the RNA level or the protein level. Preferred embodiments utilize either IRES sites (which allows the translation of two different genes on a single transcript (Kim, et al., \u201cConstruction of a Bifunctional mRNA in the Mouse By Using the Internal Ribosomal Entry Site of the Encephalomycarditis Virus,\u201d Molecular and Cellular Biology 12(8):3636-3643 (August 1992) and McBratney, et al., \u201cThe Sequence Context of the Initiation Codon in the Encephalomycarditis Virus Leader Modulates Efficiency of Internal Translation Initiation,\u201d Current Opinion in Cell Biology 5:961-965 (1993)), or a protease cleavage site (which cleaves a protein translation product into two proteins)., 69983=In a preferred embodiment, the exogeneous constructs, which may be in the form of an expression vector, are added as retroviral constructs, using techniques generally described in PCT US97/01019 and PCT US97/01048, both of which are expressly incorporated by reference, and the examples., 138132=In a preferred embodiment, the bioactive agent is resynthesized and reintroduced into the target cells, to verify the effect. This may be done using retroviruses, or alternatively using fusions to the HIV-1 Tat protein, and analogs and related proteins, which allows very high uptake into target cells. See for example, Fawell et al., PNAS USA 91:664 (1994); Frankel et al., Cell 55:1189 (1988); Savion et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256:1149 (1981); Derossi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:10444 (1994); and Baldin et al., EMBO J. 9:1511 (1990), all of which are incorporated by reference. Other techniques known in the art may be used as well., 122788=Any number of suitable retroviral vectors may be used. Preferred retroviral vectors include a vector based on the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) (see Hawley et al., Gene Therapy 1:136 (1994)) and a modified MFG virus (Rivere et al., Genetics 92:6733 (1995)), and pBABE (see PCT US97/01019, incorporated by reference). Particularly preferred vectors are shown in FIG. 11., 86692=In a preferred embodiment, the candidate bioactive agents are either nucleic acids or proteins (proteins in this context includes proteins, oligopeptides, and peptides) that are introduced into the host cells using retroviral vectors, as is generally outlined in PCT US97/01019 and PCT US97/01048, both of which are expressly incorporated by reference. Generally, a library of retroviral vectors is made using retroviral packaging cell lines that are helper-defective and are capable of producing all the necessary trans proteins, including gag, pol and env, and RNA molecules that have in cis the \u03c8 packaging signal. Briefly, the library is generated in a retrovirus DNA construct backbone; standard oligonucleotide synthesis is done to generate either the candidate agent or nucleic acid encoding a protein, for example a random peptide, using techniques well known in the art. After generation of the DNA library, the library is cloned into a first primer. The first primer serves as a \u201ccassette\u201d, which is inserted into the retroviral construct. The first primer generally contains a number of elements, including for example, the required regulatory sequences (e.g. translation, transcription, promoters, etc), fusion partners, restriction endonuclease (cloning and subcloning) sites, stop codons (preferably in all three frames), regions of complementarity for second strand priming (preferably at the end of the stop codon region as minor deletions or insertions may occur in the random region), etc.}",
