    "textAfterTable": "A.J.'s Chase scenario A.J. Allmendinger needs a win and movement up the points to nab the tie-breaker. He is 11 points behind Denny Hamlin, who currently holds the last wild-card spot. Complete clinch scenarios Allmendinger, who comes into Richmond 13th in the Sprint Cup standings and smack in the middle of a complex Chase for the Sprint Cup wild-card qualifying format, already has proven he can contend here. In his past two Richmond starts, he's finished eighth in this event a year ago and seventh this past May. Those finishes mark his consistent improvement on the fast, .75-mile oval since he made his debut in the spring of 2007. But in the confusing scenario, the bottom line is simple: Allmendinger has to record his first career win Saturday night to score the coveted spot in the Chase. Ironically, Allmendinger's Richard Petty Motorsports teammate, Marcos Ambrose, scored his first career victory four races ago at Watkins Glen, and if Ambrose wins Saturday night he'll get the Chase spot (assuming that victory vaults him into the top 20 in points; he's currently in 21st, seven points behind No. 20 Paul Menard). \"Yeah, it is pretty simple -- we have to win and get a little bit of help,\" Allmendinger said. \"We don't have to worry about everyone else and where they're at, points-wise, until you cross the finish",
