Even the least successful of the twelve, Trend Micro Internet Security 2010, detected 83.3 percent. Of course, detecting a threat doesn't always mean successfully preventing the attack. The top scorer for actual malware blocking (the more important test) was PC Tools Internet Security 2010, at 94.8 percent. CA Internet Security 2010 brought up the rear with 73.5 percent. Here are the full results:, 38926=The second chart, showing successful blocking of threats, is naturally the more important of the two; detection without successful blocking isn't so useful.
