    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{32471=Early in the race the field of declared contenders was often described as having a first tier of six potential winners (the \"big six\") most commonly cited as consisting of Scott Brison, St\u00e9phane Dion, Ken Dryden, Michael Ignatieff, Gerard Kennedy and Bob Rae.[11][12] By August 2006 however most news articles cited the top-tier of consisting of only three, or four potential winners most commonly cited as St\u00e9phane Dion, Michael Ignatieff, and Bob Rae,[13][14][15] but also occasionally including Gerard Kennedy.[15][16][17], 101301=Hedy Fry entered the race on May 4 and withdrew on September 25 to endorse Bob Rae.[citation needed], 19847=Though Martin initially intended to remain the official leader until the party chose his permanent replacement, the former Prime Minister announced on March 16, 2006 that his resignation would take effect the following weekend, once the Liberal Party executive set the date of the convention. According to media reports, Martin made his decision to end speculation that he may lead the Liberals into the next election, should the Harper government fall in the following few months.[1], 63042=Michael Ignatieff is a public intellectual, who has worked as a teacher, writer/journalist and politician. For most of his professional life Ignatieff lectured and wrote outside Canada; first in the United Kingdom at Cambridge University from 1978\u20131984, then in London as a journalist and writer until 2000 when he was named director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy[42] at Harvard University. His 1993 novel, Scar Tissue was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Upon his return to Canada in 2005, he became a visiting professor at the University of Toronto, and in the 2006 federal election campaign he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as MP for Etobicoke\u2014Lakeshore. Ignatieff is a staunch supporter of interventionism, and was in favour of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, despite the conflict's relative unpopularity in Canada, and recently in the United States. Some media see Ignatieff as belonging to the right-wing of the Liberal Party because of his positions on foreign affairs. However, he has taken a centre-left position on most domestic social policies., 10262=After four ballots, former cabinet minister and dark horse candidate St\u00e9phane Dion won the leadership on December 2, 2006., 36468=According to an opinion poll[20] of Liberal party members by the Globe and Mail, conducted from September 12\u201318, Michael Ignatieff enjoyed a slim lead over the pack with 19% support. The remaining candidates' support was calculated at: 17% for Bob Rae, 13% for St\u00e9phane Dion, 9% for Gerard Kennedy, 9% for Ken Dryden, 3% for Scott Brison, 2% for Joe Volpe, 1% for Martha Hall Findlay, and less than 1% for Hedy Fry. The poll found that 27% of party members did not know or were undecided about their choice. The poll appeared to show a potential second-ballot weakness for Ignatieff: 12% selected him as their second choice, compared to 23% for Rae and 17% for Dion. The accuracy of the poll was questioned by some, since it was taken based on membership lists provided by Brison, Dryden and Dion., 27260=The unofficial Liberal Party tradition was to alternate between francophone and anglophone leaders, a tradition informally known as alternance. With St\u00e9phane Dion as the only francophone candidate in the current race, however, this tradition would have been broken by the 2006 race if any candidate other than Dion had won. However, the principle of alternance was not widely cited as a specific issue in this leadership campaign \u2014 throughout the campaign, Dion was considered an \"underdog\" candidate with at best an outside chance of emerging as the eventual victor. Although polls consistently showed him as a popular second choice of delegates committed to other candidates, Dion's status as a Quebecer was widely considered a handicap, with conventional wisdom suggesting that the party was unlikely to turn to its third consecutive leader from Quebec., 34971=In May 2006, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported that the then-eleven candidates were tested for bilingualism certificates by University of Ottawa professor H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Knoerr. Seven received passing scores: Bob Rae and Michael Ignatieff both received top scores, while St\u00e9phane Dion (who was tested on his English fluency), Joe Volpe, Martha Hall Findlay, Gerard Kennedy and Maurizio Bevilacqua also were graded as bilingual. (Bevilacqua later dropped out of the race.) The remaining candidates all failed the test, whereby each candidate was asked the same four questions and graded based on their syntax, vocabulary, and grammar. Hedy Fry (who also withdrew) did not finish the interview. The newspaper initially errantly reported that Kennedy and Bevilacqua had failed to meet fluency requirements in French, but later retracted this statement.[19], 47634=Former Liberal House Leader Don Boudria[30] serves as Dion's Campaign Chair. Paul Martin's BC Lieutenant Mark Marissen is his National Campaign Director.[31] One-time Progressive Conservative leadership aspirant David Orchard also announced his support of Dion.[32] Additional high profile supporters include the leader of the Saskatchewan Liberal Party David Karwacki,[33] Jamie Elmhirst, the President of the British Columbia wing of the Party,[34] Adam Campbell, the President of the Alberta wing of the Party,[35] former Green Party of Canada deputy leader Tom Manley,[36] former Prime Minister Paul Martin's Chief of Staff Tim Murphy,[37] Herb Metcalfe, former John Manley Campaign Chair, and Marc-Boris Saint-Maurice the co-founder and former leader of the Marijuana Party of Canada.[38] Former Justice minister Allan Rock endorsed Dion on December 1. Eighth-place Martha Hall Findlay was eliminated on the first ballot and endorsed Dion, and fourth-place Gerard Kennedy withdrew and supported Dion after the second ballot., 80733=Bob Rae was the Ontario New Democratic Party Premier of Ontario from 1990 to 1995 and was a federal NDP MP in the House of Commons from 1978 to 1982. Since leaving electoral politics, Rae has worked on a number of contentious issues for the federal government, most notably the Air India disaster; has worked in international relations advising on constitutional issues and has conducted a study for the Ontario government on post-secondary education. Rae joined the Liberal Party in April 2006 (he had been a Liberal in the 1960s) before launching his campaign that month and is running as a centrist.[53] In a speech to the Canadian Club of Winnipeg on March 13, 2006, Rae expressed his interest in uniting the 'progressive' forces of Canada in order to regain a majority government in the Canadian House of Commons. \"There's a progressive record that's shared by a majority of Canadians, but so far, we have not succeeded in becoming a majority in the House of Commons, so we must think a bit about how that can happen.\", 102119=John Godfrey announced his entry into the race on March 19, 2006 and withdrew from the race on April 12, before becoming an official candidate, citing health reasons.[67] On October 20, he endorsed Bob Rae.[68], 74605=Gerard Kennedy was until April 5, 2006 the Minister of Education in the Ontario provincial government of Dalton McGuinty. Kennedy was a key player in rebuilding the Ontario Liberal Party and bringing it to government in 2003. As Education Minister, he is widely viewed as having restored faith in the public education system after years of growing support for private schools. He resigned from cabinet on April 5 in order to enter this leadership race.[48] He was the runner-up in the 1996 Ontario Liberal leadership election, having finished in first place on the first four ballots, he was defeated by McGuinty on the fifth and final ballot. He is viewed by many in the media as being on the left wing of the party.[49], 76401=Kennedy is backed by Senator Terry Mercer, former national director of the federal Liberal Party. He also enjoys the support of former Premier of Prince Edward Island Keith Milligan and former Premier of New Brunswick Ray Frenette. While former cabinet minister Joe Fontana is still supporting Kennedy, he has since resigned his seat in the House of Commons to run for Mayor of London.[50] On 25 November, the Globe and Mail reported that Justin Trudeau had declared his support for Kennedy's leadership bid.[51], 6858=The Liberal Party of Canada leadership election of 2006 was prompted by outgoing Prime Minister Paul Martin's announcement that he would not lead the Liberal Party of Canada into another election, following his party's defeat in the 2006 federal election in Canada. The party's biennial convention, already scheduled to occur from November 29 to December 1, 2006 in Montreal's Palais des congr\u00e8s, was followed by the party's leadership convention at the same venue occurring December 2 to December 3, 2006. As the winner, St\u00e9phane Dion led the Liberal Party into the 2008 federal election., 110636=As of November 27, 2006, 23:53 EDT., 37470=A poll[21] of Liberal party members in Ontario and Quebec by EKOS Research Associates for the Toronto Star and La Presse, conducted from September 17\u201324, showed similar results, with Rae and Ignatieff supported by 25% each, Dion by 17% and Kennedy by 16%. Rae and Dion again had strong support for second choice at 27% each, compared with 19% for Ignatieff., 29094=As the possibility of a 2006 Liberal leadership convention emerged during the midpoint of the election campaign, most media speculation focused on the surfeit of potential candidates poised to replace Martin. Some optimistically billed this convention as being most likely to provide a broad field of skilled contenders not seen since the 1968 convention that included Pierre Trudeau, Robert Winters, Paul Martin, Sr., John Turner, Joe Greene, Mitchell Sharp and Allan MacEachen. Such speculation seemed rooted in the assumption that high profile members of the Chr\u00e9tien cabinet that had elected not to challenge the Martin juggernaut in 2003 (most commonly enumerated as John Manley, Allan Rock, Brian Tobin and Martin Cauchon)would return to federal politics, along with 2003 runner-up Sheila Copps and Martin's own presumptive heir Frank McKenna, prompting a balanced matchup between multiple household names., 91339=Joe Volpe was Minister of Citizenship and Immigration under Martin. He announced his candidacy on April 21, 2006. A former schoolteacher, he was elected to the House of Commons in 1988. His top priorities will include reinvigorating the party to get it back \"on a professional keel.\" He will aim to \"make it a good corporate institution that it's been and the nation-building institution that it has always proved to be.\" Volpe's main campaign themes are expected to include, making education and training a higher priority and improving the system for accommodating immigrants, planks that draw on his cabinet experience as human-resources minister and immigration minister., 59866=Martha Hall Findlay, a Toronto lawyer, was the first candidate to officially declare she would run for the leadership when she did so on February 8, 2006 [15]. She has previously run as a Liberal candidate in the 2004 election, losing to Belinda Stronach in the district of Newmarket\u2014Aurora. When Stronach crossed the floor in 2005, Hall Findlay ceded her Liberal nomination for the riding to Stronach. Hall Findlay, 45, is fluently bilingual and has worked as the principal of her own management and legal consultancy organization, The General Counsel Group, which works primarily in the high-tech and telecommunications fields in Canada and Europe. On March 17, 2008, Hall Findlay was elected to serve the Toronto constituency of Willowdale as Member of Parliament., 43077=Former New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna, considered the leading contender until he announced he was not running in the race, had donated $3000 to Brison's campaign in August and formally endorsed Brison on November 30.[26][27], 9776=The convention date was approximately three years after the 2003 convention, in which Paul Martin was selected after years of conflict between his faction of the party and that of outgoing Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien., 100433=Maurizio Bevilacqua formally declared his candidacy on April 19 and withdrew from the race on August 14 to endorse Bob Rae.[citation needed], 41177=Scott Brison is the MP for Kings\u2014Hants and was Minister of Public Works and Government Services under Martin. He had previously been a Progressive Conservative MP (since 1997) and had run for the leadership of the PC Party. Brison crossed the floor to join the Liberals shortly after the creation of the Conservative Party of Canada. An openly gay former investment banker, Brison is a fiscal moderate and social progressive. He stood for the leadership of the PC Party on a platform of Employment Insurance reform, more private involvement in healthcare, integrated defense strategy with the US, and socially liberal policies. His 2006 Liberal leadership platform emphasises the candidate as a \"defender of the environment, business innovation and socially progressive values.\"[25], 56104=Ken Dryden was Social Development minister under Martin. A former star goaltender for the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, Dryden was elected in 2004 as a star candidate for the Liberals. He was instrumental in putting forward a child care strategy during the Martin government. Dryden, who has written a book about the public education system, stressed the importance of improving the education system in order to keep Canada competitive. \"Learning is at the core of our future\u2014for a person, a society, an economy, a country,\" Dryden said. \"Learning is our only real security, our only real opportunity, and this program, years in the hoping, was the first big step towards truly lifelong learning.\" He also said Canada's unique, multi-ethnic mix needs to be held up as an example to the world., 92333=Volpe ran into trouble on June 2 when it was revealed that his campaign had received $5,400 in donations from each of three children under the age of 15. All of whom were children of executives of the pharmaceutical company Apotex.[59] The donations were later returned. This situation led to the creation of the satirical Web site Youth for Volpe.[60] Subsequently Sukh Dhaliwal and Yasmin Ratansi left the Volpe campaign to support Michael Ignatieff., 46014=St\u00e9phane Dion was Intergovernmental Affairs minister under Chr\u00e9tien, Environment minister under Martin. Before entering federal politics by his 1996 appointment to cabinet followed shortly by his election to parliament from Saint-Laurent\u2014Cartierville, Dion was a professor of political science and noted federalist commentator. Dion is noted for his vocal opposition to Quebec sovereigntism and his support for such measures as the Clarity Act. He was considered a Chr\u00e9tien loyalist who nonetheless worked well with the Martin camp. Dion announced his candidacy on April 7.[29], 34501=In October 2006, the Toronto Star reported that the campaigns of Gerard Kennedy and St\u00e9phane Dion were holding talks about a potential alliance. The paper speculated that this alliance would be likely to win as their combined delegates would surpass both Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae.[18], 21159=The date and rules of the convention were decided upon by the Liberal Party National Executive during its meeting on March 18\u201319, 2006.[2], 17182=On February 1, 2006, outgoing Prime Minister Paul Martin announced that he would like to continue as leader of the Liberal Party until his successor was chosen but that he would not serve as Leader of the Opposition. [13] Later that day, the 103-member Liberal caucus selected Bill Graham, Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre and the outgoing Minister of National Defence, as Leader of the Opposition and interim parliamentary leader in the House of Commons. (The caucus was soon reduced to 102 members when David Emerson crossed the floor to join the Conservatives.) Graham named Lucienne Robillard, member for Westmount\u2014Ville-Marie and the outgoing Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, as his deputy leader.[14] Alberta Senator Dan Hays, outgoing speaker of the Canadian Senate, was chosen as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate., 103974=The first three days of the Convention, November 29 to December 1, constituted the biennial convention of the Liberal Party of Canada. As such, delegates cast their ballot for party executive positions as well as the new leader. They also engaged in plenary workshops and other meetings associated with biennial conventions., 93427=Following the candidate speeches on December 1, Volpe announced his support for Bob Rae's candidacy. Volpe withdrew after the first ballot results were announced., 28174=The party also had another tradition of selecting a leader from among the ministers in the previous leader's Cabinet. Since Mackenzie King succeeded Wilfrid Laurier in 1919, every Liberal leader had served in the previous leader's Cabinet. Laurier himself had served in the Cabinet of Alexander Mackenzie, the first Liberal leader, though the leader who directly preceded Laurier, Edward Blake, never served as prime minister, making him the only historical Liberal leader to date who never served in that capacity. Blake is also the only Liberal leader, other than Mackenzie King, who had never served in the Cabinet of a previous Liberal leader., 84572=Rae is supported by former senior Chr\u00e9tien aides such as Eddie Goldenberg and John Rae (who is Bob Rae's older brother) as well as senior Ontario provincial Liberals such as provincial finance minister Greg Sorbara and provincial health minister and Deputy Premier George Smitherman. On May 12, Rae was endorsed by longtime Trudeau cabinet stalwart Allan MacEachen.[55] Former leadership contenders Maurizio Bevilacqua, Carolyn Bennett and Hedy Fry withdrew from the campaign to throw their support to Rae, with Bevilacqua becoming National Co-Chair for the campaign and Chief Advisor on Economic Policy.[56] Susan Kadis, the former Toronto co-chair of Ignatieff's campaign, endorsed Rae on October 27. Former Finance Minister Ralph Goodale endorsed Rae on November 28.[57] Scott Brison and Joe Volpe withdrew after the first ballot to support Rae, as did Ken Dryden after being knocked off on the second ballot. Bob Rae was knocked off the third ballot, and encouraged his delegates to choose the candidate that best suits their personal beliefs. He refused to comment on who he decided to vote for., 21408=The party constitution required that a convention be held within a year of the leader's resignation and that the party's biennial convention be held by March 2007. The leadership convention also served as the party's regular policy convention, so there was debate and voting on policy resolutions and an election for the party's executive., 99704=Carolyn Bennett announced her entry into the race on April 24, 2006 and withdrew from the race on September 15 to endorse Bob Rae.[66], 20442=Bill Graham was given the full-fledged role of interim leader (rather than just interim parliamentary leader) by the National Executive on March 18, 2006. Interim leaders are traditionally expected to be neutral in leadership races and are typically individuals who are not expected to be candidates themselves., 24296=The deadline for candidates to enter the race was September 30.[4], 21760=Selection of delegates by riding associations and party clubs occurred on the weekend of September 29 to October 1. Only those who have purchased or renewed their party membership by July 4, 2006 were eligible to vote. Approximately 850 ex officio delegates who automatically gained the right to attend the convention by virtue of being a Liberal Member of Parliament, recent candidate, Senator, etc. The Liberal Aboriginal Peoples\u2019 Commission was entitled to send a delegation that is in proportion to the percentage of the Canadian population that is Aboriginal. All delegates, except those with ex officio status and those who won election as independent delegates, were bound to a particular candidate on the first ballot, but all delegates were free to vote as they wished on subsequent ballots.}",
