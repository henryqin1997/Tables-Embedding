However there is this thing where the desk clerk has to see your ID when you enter the building because of a girl being murdered back in 2006. The windows do not open all the way because of a guy was on mushrooms and jumped out of his window from the 20th (or so) floor. It's a pain sometimes but it's also easy to get used to and forget all about it. The upperclassmen dorms are the best., 555545=I will attend dorm life in the Fall 2013., 46914=Don't cruise through General Ed. classes. The more you know of English, History, Geography, Psychology, Sociology, and other cultures, the more well-rounded you will be in your chosen field of work. The most important class you can take is English: being able to express yourself and write with confidence and good grammar., 585829=GO TO STUDENT ACTIVITIES. WKU has a rich history in sports. Big Red, WKU's mascot, has found his way into college bowl games in football, March Madness in basketball, and conference championships in Softball, Baseball, Swimming, Track, and Cross Country. If it wasn't enough that WKU keeps winning championships, the student body continues to support them every step of the way. Every game, the entire student body will pour into the arena, dressed in red, singing the Western fight song. You shouldn't ever have to leave campus to find something fun. Western's campus is always buzzing with opportunity., 722316=Get involved! After attending the ATP Freshmen Orientation there in late March, I realized there are so many activities, especially in the realm of intermural sports. Even if you're not on a varsity team of some kind, you can still get involved in the sport or program you love by starting a club or joining one that already exists., 763703=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 161986=The food is alright. This fall 2012 we are supposed to get a panda express and Starbucks! We also have a subway and down the road there is McDonald's, Taco-bell, sonic and things in that area., 571341=Campus life is really awesome here at the hill. We have football games that all the students get into for free. Just this past year, I got to see Phillip Phillips in concert and I get to see Andy Grammar in concert in a few weeks. This campus is always bouncing with oppurtunities and there is always something to do., 474977=This university has brought a world of new exploration to mine. I'm living in Madrid after the abroad program I took in 2010 and I'm teaching English as well as a wedding photographer., 68225=I graduated in 1990 with an associate degree of science, nursing. The time I have had to reflect on my education at western was it is one of the best colleges in Kentucky. I was very fortunate to have been a student at Western.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The faculty at WKU are highly skilled and most are personable with their students. It's obvious that they want to share their knowledge and they do this on a personal level by encouraging in-class discussions and questions. They let you know on the first day of classes of the easiest way to reach them, should you need anything throughout the semester. Then they make sure to respond to your calls or emails so all of your questions will be answered. Many times they suggest meeting one-on-one during an office appointment, so you can go over all your inquiries.
