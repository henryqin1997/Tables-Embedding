No tests sounds great but teachers and students aren't held accountable and kids have a hard time transiitoning to other schools. I found that the same hands on experiental trips can be gained at free charter schools and the cost for the same trip is about half of what The Logan School charges.}",

    "textAfterTable": "See student ethnicities Community ratings & reviews (2 years ago) Logan provides a phenomenal education for gifted self-directed learners. The environment is one of independence safety responsibility and respect. Children learn how to take charge and be accountable for their work and their behavior. Expectations are rigorous. Perhaps the most significant takeaways for us after seven years at the school are the critical thinking skills our child has learned the confidence our child has in her abilities the self-evaluation skills she has gained and the resilience she has attained learning that even when she does not succeed she can persist improve and soar higher next time. Also great opportunities for the performing arts in upper grades decent language instruction and increasing physical education opportunities. The student environment is challenging and supportive of each other with very little bullying (that is never tolerated when it occurs). (3 years ago) I went here for 6 years and it was a wonderful school for me. The teachers are great and i got a challenging education.",
