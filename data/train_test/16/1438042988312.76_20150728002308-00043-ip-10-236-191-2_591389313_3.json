You can read here for more information about MobyRank. 100 ArcadeRetro Spirit Games Rastan has a real adventure quality about it and it draws you into its world, urging you to progress further to discover the next environment and do battle with new beasts. It is an incredibly playable game with tight controls, satisfying melee combat, and exciting stages to explore. For me, it sits alongside such arcade classics as Shinobi, Rolling Thunder, Sunset Riders, Toki, Robocop and Ghost 'N Goblins as shining examples of action 2D platformers. Rastan still holds up perfectly well today and is an absolute must-play for anyone who enjoys 2D sidescrolling action, especially those with a penchant for anything based in a fantasy world. read review 100 SEGA Master SystemThe Video Game Critic This game is similar to Legendary",
