            "Even though Wash U is located very near to St. Louis, it remains one of the safest campuses. There is a network of campus police constantly patrolling the campus in their vehicles at night to keep an eye out for mischief. There are also emergency lights scattered everywhere on campus, which have a button you can press if you ever feel in danger, and a cop will be there within a minute. Although I've never heard of any student ever needing to use those.",
            "I was a part of the women's basketball program there last year, and it was an experience I will never forget. Even though the football culture there is not big, the basketball culture certainly is: the women's and men's teams are both very successful, with the women's team winning four or five national championships in a row in the past decade. A wide variety of religious clubs and other organizations appeal to all students.",
            "Students who were raised in a rather sheltered community would do well to attend here because it would greatly expand their ideas about the world. People from all backgrounds go to Wash U, and it is so beneficial to learn other people's stories in order to enhance yours for the future. Also, it is a great place for students with a wide variety of interests, because all of Wash U's fields of study are so critically acclaimed that, whichever major you choose in the end, you will find success in it.",
            "While Wash U is an extremely expensive school, they are very generous with their financial aid: almost everyone I know received some sort of financial help, whether it was a partial scholarship, a two-thirds scholarship (what I received), or full tuition scholarship. More importantly, the things you get to experience at Wash U are worth the money: I learned so much about different cultures and interests by going to this institution, since I was surrounded by people who weren't all like me. Moreover, all of the things I listed above, like the dorm life and the quality of food, further support my belief that Wash U has great bang for its buck.",
            "I mentioned the Loop above: students often go there on Friday or Saturday nights to enjoy a night out at a restaurant with their friends, or for a treat at Fro Yo. In addition, students often attend Cardinals games in the fall and spring at Busch Stadium. Next to campus is also Forest Park, which holds the St. Louis Art Museum and the St. Louis Zoo. I've heard the Botanical Gardens are a must-see, as well as, of course, the St. Louis Arch. Lastly, a ten to fifteen minute ride on the MetroLink train will get you to the Galleria, a huge mall with all of the stores you could possibly want, as well as chain restaurants, like Maggiano's, PF Changs, Cheesecake Factory, Five Guys, and Panera (and there's a food court inside).",
            "Wash U was recently ranked the nation's top university for food lovers by the Daily Meal. It has a wide variety of places to choose from on-campus to eat, and each of those places offers a vast assortment of types of food to choose from: Italian, American, Mexican, Greek, Asian, Indian, as well as Kosher food, sandwich and wrap stations, several coffee and pastry bakeries, and a miniature grocery store. Off campus, there are a few wonderful cafes nearby, and a 15-minute walk will get you to The Loop, which has a variety of chain restaurants (Chipotle, Noodles, Panera, Ben and Jerrys, etc.) and local ones, including a delicious Fro Yo place.",
            "You only have to visit Wash U to know why I chose to give the dorms 5 stars. Apparently, our dorms are ranked second in the country. Of course, there are some older dorms, but most of the freshman dorms are very comfortable, especially the modern style. As a big fan of modern style, I highly recommend choosing it, because a housekeeper cleans your bathroom twice a week, you get tempur-pedic mattresses, the closet is huge (for all of you clothing-lovers) and the room itself was bigger than my bedroom at home.",
            "Just like any other college, of course, you can enroll in all easy classes and achieve a 4.0 without doing much work. But the kind of students that attend Wash U are not the kind that look for the easy way out. Students always load up their class schedule in order to explore all different kinds of subjects; for example, an art student took an architecture studio--one of the most demanding courses at Wash U--as an elective because she was interested in it and thought it would be fun.",
            "Make sure you don't spend your entire freshman year in the library. The people I've met at Wash U are some of the nicest, most welcoming people I've ever encountered, and it would be a shame for you not to escape the confines of your favorite study space and experience college the way it's meant to be experienced. Finally, don't be afraid to explore all of your interests: Wash U offers so many opportunities for you to do this, and after all, college is really the only time for you to try everything to figure out what you really love.",
            "Wash U, as it is called, offers students unique opportunities that, I believe, no other college can. It truly has an international, or a global, community: you get to interact with some of the best minds from across the nation, as well as outside of the U.S. (some international students on my freshman year floor were from Paraguay, China, and Japan). Lastly, Wash U is known to its students as the U.S.'s best-kept secret, for Wash U is certainly on or near the level of Ivy League Colleges and well-known universities--such as Duke, Vanderbilt, and Notre Dame--but is far less well-known, making it a hot-spot for the diverse and creative minds who are more interested in the process of learning itself than on the perks and superficial bonuses that may come with attending a more well-known university."

Whether it is going out to shop or eat on the Delmar Loop or going to a Rams or Blues game, there is always something to do in St. Louis if you're looking in the right places. Also, there is a great concert and movie scene right near campus. However, for the majority of the time, most people tend to hang out on or around campus with friends., 148824=Ten minutes down the road is Delmar Boulevard, loving known as The Loop. Here are a multitude of restaurants that easily fit the budget of a college student along with a thrift shop, record store, book store, several clothing stores, and a movie theater. Forest Park is also the campus's front yard and is home to events such as Ballon Glow (a hot air ballon festival) and several free attractions such as the Zoo, Art Museum, and History Museum. Also WashU provides metro passes to the students allowing for fun trips to the Mall, downtown to Busch Stadium for a baseball game, or to Central West End for some exploration., 273755=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 222706=The campus is insanely awesome with sweet dorms. The people are super friendly, and the campus is very safe with a police headquarters right near the dorms. Saint Louis is really great and Delmar Blvd. is only a short distance away from the school., 194416=There are too many options for food on-campus, and the Delmar Loop, a short walk from campus, is replete with dining options and trendy boutiques., 200693=Wash U is located next to Del Mar Loop, one of America's top streets for entertainment and dining., 139660=Within walking distance from school is the Delmar Loop, which has many shops, restaurants, art galleries, and bars in addition to a hotel, a movie theatre, and a 24/7 bowling alley., 252792=Get involved, don't be afraid to jump into things. I know a great hang out place is Del Mar, so there's lots to do around there., 102809=Located fairly close to campus is the Delmar Loop, a street with dozens of restaurants and stores. Most people go looping with their friends at least once every week, and it is very safe and inviting and fun. Other options are all the campus-sponsored events, or going to Forest Park and the free museums and free zoo., 254774=I was dragged against my will to this school by my mother, who thought it would be a good fit. Once I got to campus, I loved the atmosphere, the campus was beautiful, and the community seemed both collaborative and competitive. The wait for their decision is long, but hopefully worth it. (I submitted my application in November and will not hear from them until April)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Being a private school, the expenses are higher than most schools. However, I do think the university does a decent job at handing out scholarships, loans and grants based both on merit and need. And the education you receive is top notch with a lot of great resources and activities around, which somewhat accounts for the higher price you pay. Am enjoying being here It is great to be around other motivated students that work hard and also love helping their peers. There are countless groups, clubs and other various activities going on campus all the time. There is something here for everyone. The campus is beautiful and has many conveniences. Campus is also very safe; even late at night, there is no need to worry. It is in a nice part of town too, with a lot to do nearby. I really don't have one complaint about the environment at Wash U. Am learning a lot Wash U is a challenging school, with numerous possibilities. Since it's not a large school, class size is generally smaller, which creates a great learning environment. The handful of large lecture style classes are still very effective, often with a lab or small section to aid your learning. All the",
