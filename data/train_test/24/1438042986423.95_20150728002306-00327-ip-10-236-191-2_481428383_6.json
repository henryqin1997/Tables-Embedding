Thus, the second flap 107B is then pulled across the container 63-2 from the second wall 92-2 over the first flap 107A toward and to the first, opposite wall 91-2. This pulling bends a second side 163B (FIG. 38) of the transition section 163 that is attached to the second flap 107B. In response, such second side 163B folds over the first flap 107A. The same procedure results in a tuck 185B (not shown) at the corner 103-2., 251154=For a desired three to one safety rating of the third embodiment, the twelve ton load results in a twenty four thousand pound rated load. Thus, the total of the rated vertical lifting forces 74 applied to each of the eighteen strap ends 115 is 1333 pounds. With each strap 108-3 having a rated capacity of 6500 pounds, and eighteen strap ends 115 receiving the vertical lifting forces 74, the nine straps 108-3 are at least 1.6 times stronger than required to provide the three to one safety ratio., 69411=This application is a continuation-in-part application based on parent application Ser. No. 08/971,051 filed Nov. 14, 1997, by Aldon E. Beale for Lift-Liner Apparatus and Methods Relating To Lift-Liner Apparatus., 136591=Applicant's studies also indicate that efficient transport is promoted by having lift-liner straps connected to the load-carrying container in a manner that assures an even, or uniform, distribution of lifting forces to the bottom of the container. In comparison, Applicant's studies also considered slings, such as the sling described in the Department of Energy Hoisting and Rigging Manual, Apr., 1993, Section 8.3.9. There, a Synthetic-Web Sling is described as including straight-pull configurations. Maximum safe working loads (capacities) of single basket hitch (vertical leg) configurations are given for Nylon web slings, including a 3,200 pound capacity for each one inch of width of such slings. Up to twelve inch wide slings having a capacity of 38,400 pounds are shown. Such Section of the Manual does not, however, describe or suggest joining such slings with containers or lift-liners, or other structures for lifting bulk materials. Also, such Section of the Manual does not appreciate the importance Applicant places on such joining of straps to the container to assure application of the vertical lifting forces uniformly across the entire area of the bottom of the container, and thus uniformly to the load resting on the bottom of the container, nor the ease of use of the lift-liner resulting from the joining of the straps to the container to assure such uniform application of the vertical lifting forces. Further, the slings described in the Manual are designed for reuse, and as such, are very expensive and subject to rigorous regulations.}",

The embodiments disclosed are intended to describe the best modes known of practicing the invention and to enable those skilled in the art to use such invention in such or other embodiments. It is intended that the appended claims define the invention and be interpreted so as to include alternative embodiments to the extent permitted by the prior art. The placing of the loaded and lifted container-lifter 63 depends on whether further transport is next, or whether the storage cell is the next location for the container-lifter 62. If the container-lifter 62 has just been loaded at a remediation site, for example, and the site is not rail-served, the container-lifter 62 would be placed in a dump truck or a semi-trailer truck depending on the room available. If the site is rail-served, the container-lifter 62 would be placed in the gondola car 53 shown in FIG. 1A. With the lift-liner 62 vertically aligned with the top opening of the car 53 or the truck 136, the crane 66 or fork lift truck 67 lowers the lift grid 58, and hence the loaded lift-liner 62, until the bottom 106 rests on the floor of the vehicle. The loops 114 of the straps 108 are then removed from the connectors 73 of the",
