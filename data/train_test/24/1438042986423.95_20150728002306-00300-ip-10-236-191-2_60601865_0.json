Readmission rates focus on whether patients were hospitalized again within 30 days. Death rates and rates of readmission show whether a hospital is doing its best to prevent complications, teach patients at discharge, and ensure patients make a smooth transition to their home or other setting. The rates, per 1,000 patients, are based on people with Medicare who are 65 and older and take into account how sick patients were upon initial hospitalization.
