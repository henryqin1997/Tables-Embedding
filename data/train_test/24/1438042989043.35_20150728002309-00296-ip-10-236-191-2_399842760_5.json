Showing Report this Comment I will take this later today, but for this reason, please be reasonable when you say what might have happened had the battle not gone the way it did. The problem with this debate is that I can say \"if the others had won the Earth would have been taken over by aliens!\" in every round and I'd win because you couldn't refute me. Voters who vote in this debate will have to exercise their own judgement, which is problematic given that votes are supposed to be reflections of the debater's intelligence, not the voter's. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of faith in the intelligence of voters. larztheloser 2 years ago Posted by Report this Comment You have nothing to fear",
    "textAfterTable": "Reasons for voting decision: As battles (including and commentary analysis goes) I give rounds 1, 4 & 5 to Pro though I like Con's format much better in rounds 1-4. Especially round 3. Conduct to Pro as well because of Con's slight deviations from the rules. Good debate!
