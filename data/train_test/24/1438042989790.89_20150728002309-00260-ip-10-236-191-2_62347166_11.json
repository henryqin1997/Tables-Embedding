Dr. Allan of Forres has given, in his MS. Thesis deposited in the library of the Edinburgh University, the following account of some experiments, which he tried during his travels in the years 1830 to 1832 on the East Coast of Madagascar. 'To ascertain the rise and progress of the coral family, and fix the number of species met with at Foul Point (lat. 17\u00b0 40\u2032), twenty species of coral were taken off the reef and planted apart on a sand-bank three feet deep at low water. Each portion weighed ten pounds, and was kept in its place by stakes. Similar quantities were placed in a clump and secured as the rest. This was done in December 1830. In July following, each detached mass was nearly level with the sea at low-water, quite immovable, and several feet long, stretching, like the parent reef, in the line of the coast-current from north to south. The masses accumulated in a clump were found equally increased, but some of the species in such unequal ratios as to be growing over each other.'1 The loss of Dr. Allan's magnificent collection by, 369744=THE LOW OR PAUMOTU ARCHIPELAGO.\u2014This group consists of about 80 atolls: it would be quite superfluous to refer to descriptions of each. In D'Urville and Lottin's chart, one island (Wolchonsky) is written with a capital letter, signifying, as explained in a former chapter, that it is a high island; but this must be a mistake, as the original chart by Bellinghausen shows that it is a true atoll. Captain Beechey says of the 32 groups which he examined (of the greater number of which I have seen beautiful MS. charts in the Admiralty), that 29 now contain lagoons, and he believes the other three originally did so. Bellinghausen (see an account of this Russian voyage, in the Biblioth. des Voyages, 1834, p. 443) says that the 17 islands which he discovered resembled each other in structure, and he has given charts on a large scale of all of them. Kotzebue has given plans of several; Cook and Bligh mention others; a few were seen during the voyage of the Beagle; and notices of other atolls are scattered through several publications. The Act\u0153on group in this archipelago has lately been discovered (Geograph. Journ., vol. vii. p. 454); it consists of three small and low islets, one of which has a lagoon. Another lagoon-island has been discovered (Naut. Mag. 1839, p. 770), in 22\u00b0 4\u2032 S. and 136\u00b0 20\u2032 W. Dana, in his work on Corals and Coral Islands, gives a full account of this archipelago. Towards the S.E. there are some islands of a different nature: Elizabeth Island is described by Beechey (p. 46, 4to. edit.) as fringed by reefs, at the distance of between two and three hundred yards; coloured red. Pitcairn Island, in the immediate neighbourhood, according to the same authority, has no reefs of any kind,, 385410=not coloured.\u2014Rearson, or Grand Duke Alexander's (10\u00b0 S., 161\u00b0 W.): an atoll, of which a plan is given by Bellinghausen; blue.\u2014Souvoroff Islands (13\u00b0 S, 163\u00b0 W.): Admiral Krusenstern, in the most obliging manner, obtained for me an account of these islands from Admiral Lazareff, who discovered them. They consist of five very low islands of coral formation, two of which are connected by a reef, with deep water close to it. They do not surround a lagoon, but are so placed that a line drawn through them includes an oval space, part of which is shallow; these islets, therefore, probably once (as is the case with some of the islands in the Caroline Archipelago) formeda single atoll; but I have not coloured them.\u2014Danger Island (10\u00b0 S., 166\u00b0 W.): described as low by Commodore Byron, and more lately surveyed by Bellinghausen; it is a small atoll with three islets on it; blue.\u2014Clarence Island (9\u00b0 S., 172\u00b0 W.): discovered in the Pandora (G. Hamilton's Voyage, p. 75): it is said, 'In running along the land, we saw several canoes crossing the lagoons;' as this island is in the close vicinity of other low islands, and as it is said that the natives make reservoirs of water in old cocoa-nut trees (which shows the nature of the land), I have no doubt it is an atoll, and have coloured it blue.\u2014York Island (8\u00b0 S., 172\u00b0 W.) is described by Commodore Byron (chap. x. of his Voyage) as an atoll; blue.\u2014Sydney Island (4\u00b0 S., 172\u00b0 W.) is about three miles in diameter, with its interior occupied by a lagoon (Captain Tromelin, Annal. Marit. 1829, p. 297); coloured blue.\u2014Hull Island is situated 60 miles to the west of Sydney Island, and is described by Wilkes (U. S. Exploring Expedition, vol. iii., p. 369) as a lagoon-island; coloured blue.\u2014Ph\u0153nix Island (4\u00b0 S., 171\u00b0 W.) is nearly circular, low, sandy, not more than two miles in diameter, and very steep outside (Tromelin Annal. Marit. 1829, p. 297): it may be inferred that this island originally contained a lagoon, but I have not coloured it.\u2014New Nantucket (0\u00b0 15\u2032 N., 174\u00b0 W.): from the French chart it must be a low island; I can find nothing more about it, or, 395379=Beveridge Reef, 20\u00b0 S., 167\u00b0 W., is described in the Naut. Mag. (May 1833, p. 442) as ten miles long in a N. and S. line, and eight wide; 'in the inside of the reef, there appears deep water;' there is a passage near the S.W. corner: this therefore seems to be a submerged atoll, and is coloured blue., 380727=as it lies so near Atiu, it has been unavoidably coloured red.\u2014Rarotonga: Mr. Williams informs me that this is a lofty basaltic island, with an attached reef; coloured red.\u2014There are three other islands, Rourouti, Roxburgh, and Hull, of which I have not been able to obtain any account, and have left them uncoloured. Hull Island, in the French chart, is written with small letters as being low.\u2014Mangaia: height about 300 feet; 'the surrounding reef joins the shore' (Williams's Narrative, p. 18); coloured red.\u2014Rimetara: Mr. Williams informs me that the reef is rather close to the shore; but, from information given me by Mr. Ellis, the reef does not appear to be quite so closely attached to it as in the foregoing cases: the island is about 300 feet high (Naut. Mag. 1839, p. 738); coloured red.\u2014Rurutu: Mr. Williams and Mr. Ellis inform me that this island has an attached reef; coloured red. It is described by Cook under the name of Oheteroa: he says it is not surrounded like the neighbouring islands, by a reef; but he must mean a distant reef.\u2014Toubouai: in Cook's chart (Second Voyage, vol. ii. p. 2) the reef is laid down in a part at the distance of one mile, and in another part at the distance of two miles from the shore; Mr. Ellis (Polynes. Res. vol. iii. p. 381) says the low land round the base of the island is very extensive; and this gentleman informs me that the water within the reef appears deep; coloured blue.\u2014Raivaivai, or Vivitao: Mr. Williams informs me that the reef is here distant from the shore; Mr. Ellis, however, says that this is certainly not the case on one side of the island; and he believes that the water within the reef is not deep; hence I have left it uncoloured.\u2014Lancaster Reef, described in Naut. Mag. 1833 (p. 693), as an extensive crescent-formed coral-reef, has not been coloured.\u2014Rapa, or Oparree: from the accounts given of it by Ellis and Vancouver, there does not appear to be any reef\u2014I. de Bass is an adjoining island, of which I cannot find any account.\u2014Kemin Island: Krusenstern seems hardly to know its position, and gives no further particulars., 340740=1 Travels in Ceylon, p. 13. This madreporitic formation is mentioned by M. Cordier in his report to the Institute (May 4, 1839) on the voyage of the Chevrette, as one of immense extent, and belonging to the latest tertiary period., 388162=Christmas Island (2\u00b0 N., 157\u00b0 W.): Captain Cook, in his Third Voyage (vol. ii. chap. x.), has given a detailed account of this atoll. The breadth of the islets on the reef is unusually great, and the sea near it does not deepen so suddenly as is generally the case. It has more lately been visited by Mr. F. D. Bennett (Geograph. Journ. vol. vii. p. 226); and he assures me that it is low and of coral formation: I particularly mention this, because it is engraved with a capital letter, signifying a high island, in D'Urville and Lottin's chart. Mr. Couthouy, also, has given some account of it (Remarks, p. 46) from the Hawaiian Spectator; he believes it has lately undergone a small elevation, but his evidence does not appear to me satisfactory; the deepest part of the lagoon is said to be only ten feet; nevertheless, I have coloured it blue.\u2014Fanning Island (4\u00b0 N., 158\u00b0 W.), according to Captain Tromelin, (Ann. Maritim. 1829, p. 283), is an atoll: his account, as observed by Krusenstern, differs from that given in Fanning's Voyage (p. 224), which, however, is far from clear; coloured blue.\u2014Washington Island (4\u00b0 N., 159\u00b0 W.) is engraved as a low island in D'Urville's chart, but is described by Fanning (p. 226) as having a much greater elevation than Fanning Island, and hence I presume it is not an atoll; not coloured.\u2014Palmyra Island (6\u00b0 N., 162\u00b0 W.) is an atoll divided into two parts (Krusenstern's Mem. Suppl. p. 50, also Fanning's Voyage, p. 233); blue.\u2014Smyth's, or Johnston's Islands (17\u00b0 N., 170\u00b0 W.): Captain Smyth, R.N., has had the kindness to inform me that they consist of two very low small islands, with a dangerous reef off the east end of them; Captain, 131110=1 The foregoing details are taken chiefly from Flinders' Voyage to Terra Australis, vol. ii. p. 88; but these have been corrected by the account given by Prof. Jukes, Narrative of the Voyage of the Fly, vol. i. 1847, chap. xiii., 465790=INDIAN OCEAN.\u2014South Keeling atoll has been specially described in my first chapter. Nine miles north of it lies North Keeling, a very small atoll, surveyed by the Beagle, the lagoon of which is dry at low water.\u2014Christmas Island, lying to the east, is a high island, without, as I have been informed, any reef.\u2014CEYLON: a space of about 80 miles in length on the south-western and southern shores of these islands has been described by Mr. Twynam (Naut. Mag. 1836, pp. 365 and 518); and parts appear to be regularly fringed by coral-reefs, which extend from a quarter to half a mile from the shore. These reefs are in places breached, and afford safe anchorage for the small trading craft. Outside, the sea gradually deepens; there is 40 fathoms about six miles off shore: I have coloured these reefs red. In the published charts of Ceylon, reefs also appear to fringe several parts of the south-eastern shores, coloured red.\u2014At Venloos Bay the shore is likewise fringed. North of Trincomalee there are also reefs of the same character. The sea off the northern part of Ceylon is exceedingly shallow; and therefore I have not coloured the reefs which partially fringe portions of the shores, and the adjoining islets, as well as the Indian promontory of Madura., 424082=visited by Lutk\u00e9, is described and figured by Mr. Bennett (United Service Journal, Jan. 1832) as an atoll. All the before-mentioned islands have been coloured blue. It must, however, be stated that between Nalan and Pouynip\u00e8te, the three McAskill Islands rise to a height of from 40 to 100 feet, and consist, according to Dana (Corals and Coral Islands, p. 306), of coral-rock; whether they are encircled or fringed by coral-reefs does not seem to be known., 160769=1 The mean temperature of the surface sea from observations made by the direction of Captain FitzRoy on the shores of the Galapagos Islands, between the 16th of September and the 20th of October, 1835, was 68\u00b0 Fahr. The lowest temperature observed was 58\u00b0 .5 at the S.W. end of Albemarle Island; and on the west coast of this island, it was several times 62\u00b0 and 63\u00b0. The mean temperature of the sea in the Low Archipelago of atolls, and near Tahiti, from similar observations made on board the Beagle, was (although further from the equator) 77\u00b0 .5, the lowest any day being 76\u00b0 .5. Therefore we have here a difference of 9\u00b0 .5 in mean temperature, and 18\u00b0 in extremes; a difference doubtless quite sufficient to affect the distribution of organic beings in the two areas., 244748=considerable changes have taken place recently in some of the atolls in the Low Archipelago, appears certain from the case of Matilda Island given in the last chapter. With respect to Whitsunday and Gloucester Islands in this same group, we must either attribute great inaccuracy to their discoverer, the famous circumnavigator Wallis, or believe that they have undergone a considerable change in the period of fifty-nine years between his voyage and that of Captain Beechey's. Whitsunday Island is described by Wallis as 'about four miles long, and three wide,' now it is only one mile and a-half long. The appearance of Gloucester Island, in Captain Beechey's words,1 'has been accurately described by its discoverer, but its present form and extent differ materially.' Blenheim reef in the Chagos group, consists of a water-washed annular reef thirteen miles in circumference, surrounding a lagoon ten fathoms deep; on its surface there are a few worn patches of conglomerate coral-rock of about the size of hovels; and these Captain Moresby considers as being, without doubt, the last remnants of islets; so that here an atoll has been converted into an atoll-formed reef. The inhabitants of the Maldiva Archipelago, as long ago as 1605, declared, 'that the high tides and violent currents were always diminishing the number of the islands:'2 and I have already shown, on the authority of Captain Moresby, that, 314939=I have described certain appearances, which seem directly to show that the surface subsided there during the late earthquakes. In the Caroline Archipelago, the island of Pouynip\u00e8te (Plate I. fig. 7), from being encircled by a great barrier-reef, must have subsided, in accordance with our theory; and in the New South Wales Lit. Advert. Feb. 1835, there is an account of this island, (subsequently confirmed by Mr. Campbell,) in which it is said, 'At the N.E. end, at a place called Tamen, there are ruins of a town, now only accessible by boats, the waves reaching to the steps of the houses.' Hence it would appear that the island must have subsided since these houses were built. Mr. Hales also states, from information acquired during the U. S. Exploring Expedition, that certain buildings on this island are now in the water: 'what were once paths are now passages for canoes, and when the walls are broken down the water enters the enclosures.'1 Vanikoro, according to the Chevalier Dillon, is often violently shaken by earthquakes, and there, the unusual depth of the channel between the shore and the reef, the wall-like structure on the inner side of the reef, the small quantity of low alluvial land at the foot of the mountains, and the almost entire absence of islets on the reef, all seem to show that this island has not remained long at its present level.2 At the Society Archipelago, on the other hand,, 557881=MOHAMMED and MOHAMMEDANISM: Lectures delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, in February and March 1874. By R. BOSWORTH SMITH, M.A. Crown 8vo. 6s., 2858=THE FIRST EDITION of this book appeared in 1842, and since then only one important work on the same subject has appeared, namely, in 1872, by Professor Dana, on Corals and Coral-Reefs. In this work he justly says that I have not laid sufficient weight on the mean temperature of the sea, in determining the distribution of coral-reefs; but neither a low temperature nor the presence of mud-banks accounts, as it appears to me, for the absence of coral-reefs throughout certain areas; and we must look to some more recondite cause. Professor Dana, also, insists that volcanic action prevents the growth of coral-reefs much more effectually than I had supposed; but how the heat or poisonous exhalations from a volcano, 520029=FLORIDA.\u2014An account of the reefs on this coast, together with references to various authorities, will be found in Professor Dana's work on Corals and Coral Islands, 1872, p. 204., 32062=1 A brief account of my views on coral formations, now published in my Journal of Researches, was read May 31, 1837, before the Geological Society, and an abstract has appeared in the Proceedings., 190690=3 Voyage Round the World, vol. i. 1843. p. 369., 322210=1 Voyage Round the World, vol. i. 1843, p. 382., 426349=generally the case, I have little doubt that the reefs of the Pelew islands ought to be ranked in the barrier class, and I have coloured them pale blue. In Lieut. Elmer's chart there is a horse-shoe-formed shoal, 13 miles N.W. of Pelew, with 15 fathoms within the reef, and some dry banks on it; coloured dark blue.\u2014Spanish, Martires, Sanserot, Pulo Anna and Mariere Islands are not coloured, because I know nothing about them, excepting that according to Krusenstern, the second, third, and fourth mentioned, are low, placed on coral-reefs, and therefore perhaps include a lagoon; but Pulo Mariere is a little higher. Since the above remarks were written Prof. Semper has published an interesting article (Zeitschr. f. Wissensch. Zoologie. Bd. xiii. 1863, p. 558) on these islands. He states that the southern islands consist of coral-rock, upraised to the height of from 400 to 500 feet; and some of them, before their upheaval, seem to have existed as atolls. They are now merely fringed by living reefs. The northern islands are volcanic, deeply indented by bays, and are fronted by barrier-reefs. To the north there are three true atolls. Prof. Semper doubts whether the whole group has subsided, partly from the fact of the southern islands being formed of upraised coral-rock; but there seems to me no improbability in their having originally subsided, then having been upraised (probably at the time when the volcanic rocks to the north were erupted), and again having subsided. The existence of atolls and barrier-reefs in close proximity is manifestly not opposed to my views. On the other hand, the presence of reefs fringing the southern islands is opposed to my views, as such reefs generally indicate that the land has either long remained stationary, or has been upraised. It must, however, be borne in mind (as remarked in our sixth chapter) that when the land is prolonged beneath the sea in an extremely steep slope, reefs formed there during subsidence will remain closely attached to the shore, and will be undistinguishable from fringing-reefs. Now we know that the, 5712=The late Professor Jukes, in his account of the voyage of H.M.S. Fly, published in 1847, devoted a chapter to the Barrier-Reefs of Australia, and thus concludes: 'After seeing much of the Great Barrier-reefs, and reflecting much upon them, and trying if it were possible by any means to evade the conclusions to which Mr. Darwin has come, I cannot help adding that his hypothesis is perfectly satisfactory to my mind, and rises beyond a mere hypothesis into the true theory of coral-reefs.', 396735=origin of this latter reef, which might have been mistaken for a barrier-reef, has already been attempted to be explained, when giving the proofs of the recent elevation of this island.\u2014In Cook's charts the little outlying island of Eoaigee is represented as fringed; coloured red.\u2014Eoua: I cannot make out from Captain Cook's charts and descriptions, that this island has any reef, although the bottom of the neighbouring sea seems to be covered with corals, and the island itself is formed of coral-rock. Forster, however, distinctly (Observations, p. 14) classes it with the high islands having reefs, but it certainly is not encircled by a barrier-reef, and the younger Forster (Voyage, vol. i. p. 426) says, that 'a bed of coral rocks surrounded the coast towards the landing-place.' I have therefore classed it with the fringed islands, and coloured it red. Dana also shows (Corals and Coral Islands, p. 337) that most of the islands of this group are formed of upraised coral-rock. The several islands lying N.W. of Tongatabou, namely Anamouka, Komango, Kotou, Lefouga, Foa, &c., are seen in Captain Cook's chart to be fringed by reefs, and several of them are connected together. From the various statements in the first volume of Cook's Third Voyage, and especially in Chapters IV. and VI., it appears that these reefs are of coral, and certainly do not belong to the barrier class; coloured red.\u2014Toufoa and Kao, forming the western part of the group, according to Forster, have no reefs; the former is an active volcano.\u2014Vavao: there is a chart of this singularly-formed island, by Espinoza: according to Mr. Williams it consists of coral-rock: the Chevalier Dillon informs me that it is not fringed; not coloured. Nor are the islands of Latte and Amargura coloured, for I have not seen plans of them on a large scale, and I do not know whether they are fringed: Amargura is said (Athen\u00e6um, 1848, p. 40) to have been lately in violent eruption., 190341=1 Corals and Coral Islands, 1872, p. 193. See also Mr. Couthouy's pamphlet above referred to., 316417=1 Professor Dana also concludes from these facts that the island subsiding; see Corals and Coral Islands, 1872, p. 330., 410904=SANTA-CRUZ GROUP.\u2014Vanikoro (Fig. 1, Plate I.) offers a striking example of a barrier-reef: it was first described by the Chevalier Dillon, in his Voyage, and was surveyed in the Astrolabe; coloured pale blue.\u2014Tikopia and Fataka Islands appear, from the descriptions of Dillon and D'Urville, to have no reefs: Anouda is a low, flat island, surrounded by cliffs, (Astrolabe. Hydrog. and Krusenstern Mem. vol. ii. p. 432); these are uncoloured.\u2014Toupoua (Otooboa of Dillon) is stated by Captain Tromelin (Annales Marit. 1829, p. 289) to be almost entirely included in a reef, lying at the distance of two miles from the shore. There is a space of three miles without any reef, which, although indented with bays, offers no anchorage from the extreme depth of the water close to the shore: Captain Dillon also speaks of the reefs fronting this island; coloured blue.\u2014Santa Cruz: I have carefully examined the works of Carteret, Dentrecasteaux, Wilson, and Tromelin, and I cannot discover any mention of reefs on its shores; left uncoloured.\u2014Tinakoro is a constantly active volcano without reefs.\u2014Mendana Isles (mentioned by Dillon under the name of Mammee, &c.) are said by Krusenstern to be low, and intertwined with reefs. I do not believe they include a lagoon; I have left them uncoloured.\u2014Duff's Islands compose a small group directed in a N.W. and S.E. band; they are described by Wilson (p. 296, Miss.

They rise abruptly from the sea, and Captain King found no bottom with 170 fathoms close to them. Three of them are crescent-shaped; 'a third oval reef of the same group is entirely submerged' (Lyell, Principles of Geolog, book iii. chap. xviii.); coloured blue.\u2014Scott's Reefs, lying north of Rowley Shoals, are briefly described by Captain Wickham (Naut. Mag., 1841, p. 440) as of great size, of a circular form, and 'with smooth water within, forming probably a lagoon of great extent.' There is a break on the western side, where there probably is an entrance: the water is very deep off these reefs; coloured blue., 431143=BONIN OR ARZOBISPO GROUP.\u2014Peel Island has been examined by Captain Beechey, to whose kindness I am much indebted for giving me information regarding it: 'at Port Lloyd there is a great deal of coral; and the inner harbour is entirely formed by coral-reefs, which extend outside the port along the coast.' Captain Beechey, in another part of his letter to me, alludes to the reefs fringing the island in all directions; but at the same time it must be observed that the surf washes the volcanic rocks of the coast in the greater part of its circumference. This island has certainly been elevated at least 50 feet within the recent period (see Journal of Geolog. Soc. 1855, p. 532). I do not know whether the other islands of the archipelago are fringed; I have coloured Peel island red.\u2014Grampus Island, to the eastward, does not appear (Meare's Voyage, p. 95) to have any reefs, nor does Rosario Island (from Lutk\u00e9's chart), which lies to the westward. Respecting the few other islands in this part of the sea, namely the Sulphur Islands, with an active volcano, and those lying between Bonin and Japan (situated near the extreme limit in latitude at which reefs can grow), I have not been able to find any clear account., 213681=1 Corals and Coral Islands, 1872, p. 116., 401960=Independence Island, 10\u00b0 S., 179\u00b0 E., is described by Mr. G. Bennett (United Service Journ. 1831, part ii. p. 197) as a low island of coral formation; it is small, and does not appear to contain a lagoon, although an opening through the reef is referred to. A lagoon probably once existed, and has since been filled up; left uncoloured., 456056=investigated with so much success the Natural History of the Phillippines, informs me that a length of about three miles of the shore northward of Point St. Jago is fringed by a reef; as are (Horsburgh, vol. ii. p. 437) the Three Friars off Silanguin Bay. Between Point Capones and Playa Honda, the coast is 'lined by a coral-reef, stretching out nearly a mile in some places' (Horsburgh); and Mr. Cuming visited some fringing-reefs on other parts of the coast, namely, near Puebla, Iba, and Mansinglor. In the neighbourhood of Solon-solon Bay, the shore is lined (Horsburgh, vol.ii. p. 439) by coral-reefs, stretching out a great way: there are also reefs about the islets off Solamague; and as I am informed by Mr. Cuming, near St. Catalina, and a little north of it. The same gentleman informs me that there are reefs on the S.E. point of this island in front of Samar, extending from Malalabon to Bulusan. These appear to be the principal fringing-reefs on the coasts of Luzon; and they have all been coloured red. Mr. Cuming informs me that none of them have deep water within; although it appears from Horsburgh that some few extend to a considerable distance from the land. Within the Phillippine Archipelago, the shores of the islands do not appear to be commonly fringed, with the exception of the S. shore of Masbate, and nearly the whole of Bohol; which are both coloured red. On the S. shore of Magindanao, Bunwoot Island is surrounded (according to Forrest, Voyage, p. 253) by a coral-reef, which in the chart appears one of the fringing class. With respect to the eastern coasts of the archipelago, I have not been able to obtain any account. Prof. Semper has recently published a notice (Zeitschr. f. Wissensch. Zoologie, Bd. xiii. 1863, p. 558) respecting the coral-reefs of this archipelago. It appears that some of them come under the class of barrier-reefs; but as I have not seen a chart on a large scale, and know nothing about the depth of the water outside the reefs, nor about the slope of the encircled land, I cannot judge whether they properly come under the barrier class., 419448=appear to be fronted by distant reefs rising abruptly from the sea, and within some of which, there is reason to believe that the water is deep. I have therefore little doubt that they belong to the barrier class. In the southern part of the group, we have Elisabeth Island, which is surrounded by a reef at the distance of a mile; and two miles eastward of it (Krusenstern, Append. 1835, p. 42) there is a little island containing a lagoon. Near here, also, lies Circular Reef (Horsburgh Direct. vol. i. p. 691, 4th edit.), 'three or four miles in diameter, having deep water inside with an opening at the N.N.W. part, and on the outside steep to.' I have from these data, coloured the group pale blue, and Circular Reef dark blue.\u2014The Anachorites, Echequier, and Hermites consist of innumerable low islands of coral formation, which probably are atolls; but not being able to ascertain this, I have not coloured them, nor Durour Island, which is described by Carteret as low., 564691=ILLUSTRATIONS of the ZOOLOGY of SOUTH AFRICA; comprising all the new species of Quadrapeds, Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes, obtained during the Expedition fitted out by 'The Cape of Good Hope Association for Exploring Central Africa,' in the Years 1834, 1835, and 1836, with Letterpress Descriptions, and a Summary of African Zoology.

Towards the mouth, however, where the water is rather deeper, the islands of Ormuz and Larrack, appear so regularly fringed, that I have coloured them red. There are certainly no atolls in the Persian Gulf. The shores of Immaum, and of the promontory forming the southern headland of the Persian Gulf, seem to be without reefs. The whole S.W. part of Arabia Felix, except one or two small patches, and the shores of Socotra appear from the charts and the memoir of Captain Haines (Geograph. Journ. 1839, p. 125) to be without reefs. I believe there are no extensive coral-reefs on any part of the coasts of India, except on the low promontory of Madura (as already mentioned) in front of Ceylon., 318741=2 Corals and Coral Islands, 1872, pp. 199, 345.

Kolff's Voyage in 1825, translated by Mr. W. Earl from the Dutch.\u2014Lette has 'reefs extending along shore at the distance of half a mile from the land.'\u2014Moa has reefs on the S.W. part.\u2014Lakor has a reef lining its shore; these islands are coloured red.\u2014Still more eastward, Luan, differently from the last-mentioned islands, has an extensive reef; it is steep outside, and within there is a depth of 12 feet; from these facts, it is impossible to decide to which class this island belongs.\u2014Kissa, off the point of Timor, has its 'shore fronted by a reef, steep too on the outer side, over which small proahs can go at the time of high water;' coloured red.\u2014Timor: most of the points, and some considerable spaces of the northern shore, are seen, 230058=flourish at a very limited depth,\u2014and secondly, that throughout areas of vast dimensions, none of the coral-reefs and coral-islets rise to a greater height above the level of the sea than that attained by matter thrown up by the waves and winds. I do not make this latter statement vaguely; I have carefully sought for descriptions of every island in the inter-tropical seas; and my task has been in some degree facilitated by a map of the Pacific, corrected in 1834 by MM. D'Urville and Lottin, in which the low islands are distinguished from the high ones (even from those much less than a hundred feet in height) by being written without a capital letter.1 I have also ascertained, chiefly from the writings of Cook, Kotzebue, Bellinghausen, Duperrey, Beechey, and Lutk\u00e9 regarding the Pacific; and from Moresby2 with respect to the Indian Ocean, that in the following cases the term 'low island' strictly means land of the height commonly attained by matter thrown up by the winds and the waves of an open sea.

Berghaus marks four active volcanos actually within the Friendly group; but I do not now on what authority; I may mention that Maurelle describes Latte as having a burnt-up appearance; I have marked only Toofoa and Armagura. South of the New Hebrides lies Matthews Rock, which is described as an active crater in the voyage of the Astrolabe. Between it and the volcano on the eastern side of New Zealand lies Brimstone Island, which from the high temperature of the water in the crater may be ranked as active (Berghaus Vorbemerk, II. Lief. S. 56). Malte Brun, vol. xii. p. 231, says that there is a volcano near Port St. Vincent, in New Caledonia: I believe this to be an error, arising from smoke seen on the opposite coast by Cook (2nd voyage, vol. ii. p. 23), which smoke went out at night. The Mariana Islands, especially the northern ones, contain many craters (see Freycinet's Hydrog. Descript.) which are not active. Von Buch, however, states (p. 462) on the authority of La Peyrouse, that there are no less than seven volcanos between these islands and Japan. Gemelli Careri (Churchill's Collect. vol. iv. p. 458) says there are two active volcanos in lat. 23\u00b0 30\u2032 and in lat. 24\u00b0; but I have not coloured them. From the statements in Beechey's Voyage (p. 518, 4to edit.) I have coloured one in the northern part of the Bonin group. M. S. Julien has clearly made out from Chinese manuscripts not very ancient (Comptes Rendus, 1840, p. 832), that there are two active volcanos on the eastern side of Formosa. In the map appended to the first edition I marked on active volcano in Torres Straits, and gave my authority; but Mr. Jukes informs me that there certainly is no volcano there; a wooded island on fire having been mistaken for one. Mr. M'Clelland (Report of Committee for Investigating Goal in India, p. 39) has shown that the volcanic band which passes through Barren Island must be extended northwards. It appears by an old chart, that Cheduba was once an active volcano (see also Silliman's North American Journal, vol. xxxviii. p. 385). In Berghaus' Phys. Atlas, 1840 (No. 7 of Geological Part) a volcano on the coast of Pondicherry is said to have burst forth in 1757. Ordinaire (Hist. Nat. des Volcans, p. 218) says that there is one at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, but I have not coloured it, as he gives no particulars. A volcano in Amsterdam, or St. Paul's, in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, has been seen (Naut. Mag. 1838, p. 842) in action. Dr. J. Allan, of Forres, informs me in a letter, that when he was at Joanna, he saw flames at night,, 333281=Still proceeding westward we come to the New Hebrides. On these islands, Mr. G. Bennett (author of Wanderings in New South Wales) informs me that he found much coral at a great altitude, which he considered of recent origin. The Loyalty Islands are situated west of the New Hebrides, and not far from New Caledonia; and one of these islands has been clearly shown by the Rev. W. B. Clarke (Journal of Geolog. Soc. 1847, p. 61) to consist wholly of coral-rock, and to have been raised within a recent period by at least two distinct elevations to the height of 250 feet. The shores are now fringed by reefs.

The names have been altered into English, and the longitude has been reduced to that of Greenwich. The colours were first laid down on accurate charts, on a large scale. The data, on which the volcanos historically known to have been in action, have been marked with vermilion, were given in a note to the last chapter. I will commence my description on the eastern side of the map, and will describe each group of islands consecutively, proceeding westward across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and ending with the West Indies., 2509=1874, 408009=Rock, an active volcano, someway south of the group (of which a plan is given in Atlas of the Astrolabe's Voyage) does not appear to have reefs of any kind about it.\u2014Annatom, the southernmost of the Hebrides: from a rough woodcut given in the United Service Journal (1831, part iii. p. 190), accompanying a paper by Mr. Bennett, it appears that the shore is fringed; coloured red.\u2014Tanna: Forster, in his Observations (p. 22), says Tanna has on its shores coral-rock and madrepores; and the younger Forster, in his account (vol. ii. p. 269), speaking of the harbour, says the whole S.E. side consists of coral-reefs, which are overflowed at high water: part of the southern shore in Cook's chart is represented as fringed; coloured red.\u2014Immer is described (United Service Journ. 1831, part iii. p. 192) by Mr. Bennett as being of moderate elevation, with cliffs appearing like sandstone; coral grows in patches on its shore, but I have not coloured it; and I mention these facts because Immer might have been thought, from Forster's classification (Observations, p. 14), to have been a low island, or even an atoll.\u2014Erromango Island: Cook (Second Voyage, vol. ii. p. 45, 4to. edit.) speaks of rocks everywhere lining the coast, and the natives offered to haul his boat over the breakers to the sandy beach: Mr. Bennett, in a letter to the editor of the Singapore Chron., alludes to the reefs on its shores. It may, I think, be safely inferred from these passages that the shore is fringed in parts by coral-reefs; coloured red.\u2014Sandwich Island: the east coast is said (Cook's Second Voyage, vol. ii. p.41) to be low, and to be guarded by a chain of breakers. In the accompanying chart it is seen to be fringed by a reef; coloured red.\u2014Mallicollo: Forster speaks of the reef-bounded shore: the reef is about 30 yards wide, and so shallow that a boat cannot pass over it. Forster, also, (Observat. p. 23,) says that the rocks of the sea-shore consist of madrepore. In the plan of Sandwich harbour, the headlands are represented as fringed; coloured red.\u2014Aurora and Pentecost Islands, according to Bougainville, apparently have no reefs; nor has the, 339074=3 Notices of the East Indian Arch., Singapore, 1828, [p. 6, and Append. p. 43., 242906=be apparent would be, the water sometimes encroaching slowly on the land, and the land again recovering by the accumulation of detritus its former extent, and perhaps sometimes the conversion of an atoll with coral islets on it, into a bare or into a sunken annular reef. Such changes would naturally take place at the periods when the sea rose above its usual limits during a gale of more than ordinary strength; and the effects of the two causes would be hardly distinguishable. In Kotzebue's Voyage there are accounts of islands, both in the Caroline and Marshall Archipelagoes, which have been partly washed away during hurricanes; and Kadu, the native who was on board one of the Russian vessels, said 'he saw the sea at Radack rise to the feet of the cocoa-nut trees; but it was conjured in time.'1 A storm lately entirely swept away two of the Caroline Islands and converted them into shoals; it also partly destroyed two other islands.2 According to a tradition which was communicated to Captain FitzRoy, it is believed in the Low Archipelago, that the arrival of the first ship caused a great inundation which destroyed many lives. Mr. Stutchbury relates that in 1825, the western side of Chain Atoll in the same group, was completely devastated by a hurricane, and not less than 300 lives lost: 'in this instance it was evident, even to the natives, that the hurricane alone was not sufficient to account for the violent agitation of the ocean.'3 That, 488478=RED SEA.\u2014My information is chiefly derived from the admirable charts published by the East India Company in 1836, from personal communication with Captain Moresby, one of the surveyors, and from the excellent memoir, 'Ueber die Natur der Corallen-B\u00e4nken des Rothen Meeres,' by Ehrenberg. The plains immediately bordering the Red Sea seem to consist chiefly of a sedimentary formation of the newer tertiary period. The shore is, with the exception of a few parts, fringed by coral-reefs. The water is generally profoundly deep close to the shore; but this fact, which has attracted the attention of most voyagers, seems to have no necessary connection with the presence of reefs; for Captain Moresby particularly observed that, in lat. 24\u00b0 10\u2032 on the eastern side, there is a piece of coast with very deep water close to it, without any reefs, but not differing in any other respect from the usual coast line. The most remarkable feature in the Red Sea is the chain of submerged banks, reefs, and islands, lying some way from the shore, chiefly on the eastern side; the space within being deep enough to admit safe navigation in small vessels. The banks are generally of an oval form, and some miles in width; but some of them are very long in proportion, 77=RECORD: Darwin, C. R. 1874. The structure and distribution of coral reefs. 2d ed.

According to Captain Carmichael (Hooker's Bot. Misc., vol. ii. p. 316), on one part of the coast there is a space of sixteen miles without a reef., 413645=AUSTRALIAN BARRIER-REEF.\u2014This great reef, which has already been described, has been coloured from the charts of Flinders and King. Jukes has given many details respecting it in the Voyage of H.M.S. Fly (vol. i. 1847, chap. xiii.). In the northern parts, an atoll-formed reef, lying outside the barrier, has been described by Bligh, and is coloured dark blue. In the space between Australia and New Caledonia, called by Flinders the Corallian Sea, there are numerous reefs. Of these, some are represented in Krusenstern's Atlas as having an atoll-like structure; namely, Bampton Shoal, Frederic, Vine or Horse-shoe, and Alert Reefs; these have been coloured dark blue., 372542=The SOCIETY ARCHIPELAGO is separated by a narrow space from the Low Archipelago; and in their parallel direction they manifest some relation to each other. I have already described the general character of the reefs of these encircled islands. In the atlas of the Coquille's Voyage there is a good general chart of the group, and separate plans of some of the islands. Tahiti, the largest island in the group, is almost surrounded, as seen in Cook's chart, by a reef from half a mile to a mile and a half from the shore, with from 10 to 30 fathoms within it. Some considerable submerged reefs, lying parallel to the shore, with a broad and deep space within, have lately been discovered on the N.E. coast of the island, (Naut. Mag. 1836, p. 264,) where none are laid down by Cook. At Eimeo the reef, 'which like a ring surrounds it, is in some places one or two miles distant from the shore, in others united to the beach' (Ellis, Polynesian Researches, vol. i. p. 18, 12mo. edit.). Cook found deep water (20 fathoms) in some of the harbours within the reef. Mr. Couthouy, however, states (Remarks, p. 45) that both at Tahiti and Eimeo, the space between the barrier-reef and the shore has been almost filled, 203644=1 Mr. Stutchbury (West of England Journal, No. I. p. 50) has described a specimen of Agaricia, 'weighing 2 lbs. 9 oz., which surrounds a species of oyster, whose age could not be more than two years, and yet is completely enveloped by this dense coral.' I presume that the oyster was living when the specimen was procured; otherwise the fact tells nothing. Mr. Stutchbury also mentions an anchor, which had become entirely encrusted with coral in fifty years; other cases, however, are recorded of anchors having long remained amidst coral-reefs without having become coated. The anchor of the Beagle, in 1832, after having been down exactly one month at Rio de Janeiro, was so thickly coated by two species of Tubularia, that large spaces of the iron were entirely concealed; the tufts of this horny zoophyte were between two and three inches in length. Spallanzani states (Travels, Eng. Translat. vol. iv. p. 313) that in the Mediterranean, the red coral of commerce is usually dredged every ten years, during which time it grows to a height of one foot. It grows, however, at different rates in different places. It has been erroneously attempted to compute the rate of growth of a reef, from the fact mentioned by Captain Beechey of the Chama gigas being embedded in coral rock. But it should be remembered, that some species of this genus invariably live, both whilst young and old, in cavities, which the animal has the power of enlarging with its growth. I saw many of these shells thus embedded in the outer 'flat' of Keeling atoll, which is composed of dead rock; and therefore the cavities in this case had no relation whatever to the growth of coral. M. Lesson, also, speaking of this shell (Partie Zoolog., Voyage de la Coquille), has remarked, 'que constamment ses valves \u00e9taient engag\u00e9s compl\u00e8tement dans la masse des Madrepores.', 412923=NEW CALEDONIA.\u2014The great barrier-reefs on the shores of this island have already been described (Fig. 5, Plate II.). They have been visited by Labillardi\u00e8re, Cook, and the northern point by D'Urville; this latter part so closely resembles an atoll that I have coloured it dark blue. The Loyalty group is situated to the east of New Caledonia; some at least of the islands are formed of upraised coral-rock, and are fringed with living reefs; see Rev. W. B. Clarke, in Journal of Geolog. Soc. 1847, p. 61; coloured red. North of this group there are some extensive low reefs (called Astrolabe and Beaupr\u00e9), which do not seem to be atoll-formed: these are left uncoloured., 566604=ILLUSTRATIONS of DISSECTIONS.

It is apparently of large size, and extends in a N.W. and S.E. line: very few islets have been formed on it. The lagoon seems to be shallow; at least, the deepest part which was surveyed was only three fathoms. Mr. Couthouy (Remarks, p. 38) describes this island under the name of Ocean Island. Considerable doubts should be entertained regarding the nature of a reef of this kind, with a very shallow lagoon, and standing far from any other atoll, on account of the possibility of a crater or flat bank of rock lying at the proper depth beneath the surface of the water, having afforded a foundation for a ring-formed coral-reef. I have, however, thought myself compelled, from its large size and symmetrical outline, to colour it blue. Some information and references are given by Dana (Corals and Coral Islands, p. 324, 365) with respect to the reefs and islets extending for 2,000 miles in a N.W. line from Hawaii., 569212=Citation: John van Wyhe, editor. 2002-.

The group consists (with the exception of two little islands which probably have had their lagoon filled up) of a double row of 23 large and well-characterized atolls, from the examination of which Chamisso drew up his well-known account of coral formations. I include in this group Gaspar-Rico, or Cornwallis Island, which is described by Chamisso (Kotzebue's First Voyage, vol. iii. p. 179) 'as a low sickle-formed group, with mould only on the windward side.' Gaspard Island is considered by some geographers as a distinct island lying N.E. of the group, but it is not entered in the chart by Krusenstern; left uncoloured. In the S.W. part of this group lies Baring Island, of which little is known (see Krusenstern's Appendix, 1835, p. 149). I have left it uncoloured; but Boston Island I have coloured blue, as it is described (ibid.) as consisting of 14 small islands, which, no doubt, inclose a lagoon, as represented in a chart in the Coquille's Atlas.\u2014Two islands, Aur Kawen and Gaspar Rico, are written in the French chart with capital letters; but this is an error, for from the account given by Chamisso in Kotzebue's First Voyage, they are certainly low.

Williams, corroborating the above remarks on the antiquity of certain individual corals, namely, that at Upolu, one of the Navigator islands, 'particular elumps of coral are known to the fishermen by name, derived from either some particular configuration or tradition attached to them, and handed down from time immemorial.', 61722=ments cast on the beach, is certainly very surprising, even on the view that it is the office of occasional gales to pile up fragments, and of the daily tides to wear them away. On the western side, also, of the atoll, where I have described a bed of sand and fragments with trees growing out of it, in front of an old beach, it struck both Lieut. Sulivan and myself, from the manner in which the trees were being washed down, that the surf had lately recommenced an attack on this line of coast. Appearances indicating a slight encroachment of the water on the land, are plainer within the lagoon: I noticed in several places, both on its windward and leeward shores, old cocoa-nut trees falling with their roots undermined, and the rotten stumps of others on the beach, where the inhabitants assured us the cocoa-nut could not now grow. Capt. FitzRoy pointed out to me, near the settlement, the foundation posts of a shed, now washed by every tide, but which the inhabitants stated, had seven years before stood above high water-mark. In the calm waters of the lagoon, directly connected with a great, and therefore stable ocean, it seems very improbable that a change in the currents, sufficiently great to cause the water to eat into the land on all sides, should have taken place within a limited period. From these considerations I inferred, that probably the atoll had lately subsided to a small amount; and this inference was strengthened by the circumstance, that in 1834, two years before our visit, the island had been shaken by a severe earthquake, and by two slighter ones during, 336365=4 P.

Nelson, in his excellent memoir in the Geological Transactions (vol. ii. p. 105), alludes to the rocky points mentioned by Kotzebue, and infers that they consist of Serpul\u00e6, which compose incrusting masses on the reefs of Bermudas, as they likewise do on a sandstone-bar off the coast of Brazil, as described by me in the London Phil. Journal, Oct. 1841. I have added my description as a short supplement to the present volume. These masses of Serpul\u00e6 hold the same position, relatively to the action of the sea, with the Nullipor\u00e6 on the coral-reefs in the Indian and Pacific oceans., 440573=N.W. COAST OF AUSTRALIA.\u2014It appears, in Captain King's Sailing Directions (Narrative of Survey, vol. ii. pp. 325 to 369), that there are many extensive coral-reefs skirting, often at considerable distances, the N.W. shores, and encompassing the small adjoining islets. Deep water, in no instance, is represented in the charts between these reefs and the land; and, therefore, they probably belong to the fringing class. But as they extend far into the sea, which is generally shallow, even in places where the land seems to be somewhat precipitous, I have not coloured them. Houtman's Abrolhos (lat. 28\u00b0 S. on west coast) have lately been surveyed by Captain Wickham (as described in Naut. Mag. 1841, p. 511): they lie on the edge of a steeply-shelving bank, which extends about 30 miles seaward, along the whole line of coast. The two southern reefs, or islands, enclose a lagoon-like space of water, varying in depth from 5 to 15 fathoms, and in one spot with 23 fathoms. The greater part of the land has been formed on their inland sides, by the accumulation of fragments of corals; the seaward face consisting of nearly bare ledges of rock. Some of the specimens, brought home by Captain Wickham, contained fragments of marine shells, but others did not; and these closely resembled a formation at King George's Sound, principally due to the action of the wind on calcareous dust, which I have described in my work on Volcanic Islands. From the extreme irregularity of these reefs with their lagoons,, 244495=2 M.

The southern shore of the island is narrowly fringed by a reef; if the engraver had carried this reef entirely round both islands, this figure would have served (by leaving out in imagination the barrier-reef) as a good specimen of an abruptly-sided island, surrounded by a reef of the fringing class.
