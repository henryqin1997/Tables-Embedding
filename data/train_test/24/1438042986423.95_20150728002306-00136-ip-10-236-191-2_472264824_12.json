FIGS. 22A and 22B together show Microsoft\u2122 Knowledge Base Article ID No. 815759. This particular article describes a problem in which public folder hierarchy messages are stuck in outgoing queues in an Exchange\u2122 2000 server. The article identifies, under the \u201cSYMPTOMS\u201d heading, two particular warning or information messages that may be logged in the application log. The articles also indicates, under the \u201cCAUSE\u201d heading, that the issue may occur when the \u201cEveryone\u201d group is explicitly denied permissions on both of two listed objects.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although a meta-application has been disclosed in the context of certain embodiments and examples, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the invention extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof. Further, as will be recognized from the foregoing, the disclosed meta-application embodies a multitude of distinct inventions, many of which can be practiced separately and independently of others. Accordingly, the invention is not intended to be limited by the specific disclosures of preferred embodiments herein. The RCA module 41 first considers an outbound message queue object as the root-cause candidate, and tests the objects upon which the outbound message queue object depends. These objects are the network interface of the server and the inbound message queue object of the public folder server. The meta-application 20 conducts unit tests for the outbound message queue and the inbound message queue. Suppose both unit tests fail. The RCA module 41 then considers the inbound message queue object as the root-cause candidate and tests the objects upon which the inbound message queue depends. One of these objects is the public folder object. Suppose the public folder's unit test fails. The RCA module 41 now considers the public folder object as the root-cause candidate. Finally, the RCA module 41 tests the objects upon which the public folder object depends. In this example, suppose all",
