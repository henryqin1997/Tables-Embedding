It will, however, be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. The present invention is intended to be limited, therefore only by the claims presented below. For the purposes of explanation, embodiments of the present invention have been described with respect to accessing information in a virtual table in memory. However, in alternative embodiments, the techniques described herein may be applied to numerous types of known data structures in memory, such as arrays of pointers, doubly-linked lists, etc. Thus, the present invention is not limited to any particular type of memory data structure or database management system environment. When a user specifies a key value, e.g., a session ID value, the linked list 600 is traversed from the head 603 of the linked list until the session ID value specified by the user is found in column 602 by following the pointers in column 601 whose contents specify the memory address of logically related rows. At that point, the search is completed and the DBMS process fetches the data from the linked list at the current row. If the session ID is not found, eventually the linked list is traversed until a row",
