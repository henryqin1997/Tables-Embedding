Therefore results cannot be validly compared to the standardized test results prior to 2002, which serves as the baseline for comparison with results from future test administrations. All TerraNova scores are reported in percentiles - not percentages. A percentile is a measure of comparison that ranks one score against the scores of all other test takers. For example, a 75 percentile score means that 75 percent of all other test takers nationally scored below and 25 percent scored above that score. The national average is always the 50%ile. Note: Comparison of district data from year to year may not be valid due to redistricting of schools.
