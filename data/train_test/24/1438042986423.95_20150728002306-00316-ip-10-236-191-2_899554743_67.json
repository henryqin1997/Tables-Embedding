            "There are stations with alarms across the campus and the main part of campus is lit up. However, there are parts of campus that are unlit and i have herd of at least four people getting mugged this year. There is most likely more but they do very well on keeping issues like these quiet. The ones I know about are only from participating in the student government.",
            "Greek life is huge on the mizzou campus.",
            "There is an endless amout of clubs on campus and ost are good about keeping you informed.",
            "This is a great school for those who wish to participate in greek life.",
            "7 Traditions of Mizzou 1. climb the dome of Jesse hall, which is 105 feet tall. The best way to approach this is to climb the rain spout instead of using the latter- but beware of cameras and alarms! 2.explore the tunnels that run from the power plant to Schlundt Hall and the Chemistry Building. Another tunnel runs from the basement of Jesse Hall to Switzler Hall. The best way to achieve this is to find a man hole that is covered by grates, but beware of the alarm system. 3.kiss the 50-yard line at Faurot field that is named after coach Don Faurot. In order to do this you need to figure out how to get through the locked gate, but rumor has it that there are silent motion sensors on the field. 4.Streaking across the Quad is the fourth tradition. The only way to approach this to build up the courage and to not look back. 5.ride the tiger in Tiger Plaza. The tiger is roughly around 11 feet tall. When climbing the tiger, it is best to have someone help you up. You can get extra points for having more people on the tiger at one time. 6.swim in Brady Foundation located in Tiger Plaza as well. Just putting your toes in the foundation doesn\u2019t count you must go all in. If you extra points then you can swim laps in it. 7.scream \u201cI love Mizzou\u201d in Speaker Circle. This tradition will help you embrace your First Amendment rights. The louder the better, and make sure to show your Mizzou pride especially right before a KU game. WARNING: only #5 and #7 are legal!",
            "You get what you pay for. If you are wishing to go to another university the professors will most likely be better but they also cost more. ON the other hand it may cost 2X as much as a local college but the experience is a lot better than that of a community college",
            "The campus is never short for planning activities. Although most of the student population does not attend. A huge attraction here is the rec center ,but don't let that be the deciding factor on the school. Most students will only go at the beginning of the school year, before spring break, and before summer.",
            "The first few weeks you will think the food is excellent, but after awhile the food options become monotonous and the options that they are serving will rarely match up with the menu posted. Also, if your a vegetarian its every man for himself; most of your meals will end up being carrots and a dinner roll.",
            "The dorms rooms are small but that is to be expected with any college. Alot of the dorms have a problem with the water tasting funny and i believe this is due to the calcium build up on the pipes so bring a water filter.",
            "For every one good teacher hear there is 40 bad teachers. All the teachers know the subject well but they are horrible at communicating it to the student.",
            "Make sure you ask current students before choosing a professor or even looking on sites online like www.ratemyprofessor.com . This could be the difference between you passing and failing a class.",
            "Mizzou is a good college for those who don't mind paying the extra dollar or those who can handle the big campus. The teacher's are lacking a bit so don't always expect what you learn in class to be the exam. Rely on teaching yourself from your textbook."

Read this guide before you buy textbooks: http://www.brainofjt.com/2014/01/textbook-trick-save-money.html It could save you thousands of dollars to use the method provided. 2. Many of the courses, especially in the business school, have exams with questions directly from the book rather than lecture. To succeed in those courses you'll need to 3. Get involved with people who actually care about your well-being. As a beginning college student, you'll run into a lot of college students who want you do talk and act like them. Usually that involves compromising your morals. Instead, places such as the BSU or Baptist Student Union will love to have you come in and be a part of everything that goes on there., 615686=Everyone in the dorms are nice and the dorm quality is outstanding. Also going to have lots of dorms remodeled coming 2013., 598196=Mizzou is great for every type of student, really. It is large enough to be able to sneak through in you are more introverted or leave school with 1000 friends (and not just 1000 added Facebook friends)., 632447=Especially if you're in-state, Mizzou is definitely well worth what you pay for your education. If you're out-of-state, Missouri is the easiest state to earn in-state status--just earn $2000 and have a residence in Missouri (e.g. your residence hall or apartment)., 210814=mu has many dinning halls for students. they offer many kinds of food. since 2011, mu open a new place, called student center dining. it offers many choices like pizza, burgers, drinks and sushi. it is so convenient and so nice. in addition, student can buy meal plan for the dining halls, so the average price of each meal is about 8 dollars., 881463=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 41613=Downtown Columbia has plenty of great restaurants, bars, etc. True/False Film Festival every year in late February / early March., 713718=I will be attending this school in August and I am very excited. I have done research and heard so much great things about this school. That has helped me make my choice to attend here, this school will help farther me education., 400948=There are a lot of traditions at Mizzou. In August before classes begin the freshman assemble for Tiger Walk where they walk through the Columns toward Jesse Hall. Tiger Walk is symbolic of a student's entrance into the University of Missouri. When students graduate they walk through the columns away from Jesse Hall. This is Tiger Prowl and is symbolic of students becoming Mizzou alumni. There are seven traditions all students are supposed to do before they graduate: climb the dome of Jesse Hall, explore the tunnels, kiss the 50-yard line on Faurot Field, streak across the Quad, ride the tiger in Tiger Plaza, swim in Brady Fountain, and yell I love Mizzou! in Speakers Circle. I forewarn anyone that wants to attempt these that some of them are illegal., 731801=Classes definitely get harder as you go up. Don't think everything will be like your 1000-level days.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students anyone who has good study and organization skills, keeps up on grades and easily works with their instructors. Tips for prospective students if you go to this school, don't walk in and get pulled in by all the frills and thrills that the school offers. stay focused on your work, study, and then, if you have time, work in extra stuff that you can do on times when you have a gap between classes. don't forget, find scholarships and loans that you can use to pay for tuition and other costs. when looking at loans make sure it can be easily payed off later, you don't want it hanging over your head long after your out of school. find local jobs that can be easily worked into your school schedule and work for classes, my suggestion would be, if you like working with kids, adventure club. adventure club staff is predominantly college students and works great with any class schedule. finally, don't overload yourself with tons of extras and credit hours just because it says in your degree qualifications, this is only recommended for the students who want to get out quickly and are able to take the load. but don't let all of this bum you out, have fun when it's appropriate and find good friends that can help you through",
