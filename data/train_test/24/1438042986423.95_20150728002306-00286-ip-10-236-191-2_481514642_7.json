For example and as would be apparent to one skilled in the art, many of the process block operations can be re-ordered to be performed before, after, or substantially concurrent with other operations. Also, many different forms of data structures could be used in various embodiments. The invention as described herein contemplates all such embodiments as may come within the scope of the following claims and equivalents thereof. illustrates a flow diagram of one embodiment of a process of a destination node manipulating packets in accordance with a barrier state of the packets and destination node. Other processes, such as receiving packets and processing and propagating barrier requests are not included in this process, but are rather being performed concurrently in one embodiment. Processing begins at process block 950, and proceeds to process block 952 where the current barrier state of the destination node is initialized. Next, in process block 954, the barrier state of a received packet is identified. Next, as determined in process block 956, if the barrier states of the destination node and the received packet are the same, then processing",
