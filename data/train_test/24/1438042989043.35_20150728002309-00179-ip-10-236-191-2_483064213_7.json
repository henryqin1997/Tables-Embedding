It will be understood, of course, that this disclosure is in many respects, only illustrative. Changes may be made in details, particularly in matters of shape, size and arrangement of parts without exceeding the scope of the invention. For example, in one embodiment of the invention the lever arm 13 could be connected to the front crosspiece assembly 19 rather than the rear crosspiece assembly 18. Further, the lever arm 13 could be attached to the lower body restraint in an embodiment where the individual's upper body is constrained while his lower body is permitted, while resisted by the dynamometer 11, to move by contraction of his back muscles. The scope of the invention is defined in the language in which the appended claims are expressed, and is not limited to the embodiments described above. Once the test is completed, the strap latches 45 and the front crosspiece assembly 19 may be removed so that the individual may easily disengage from the machine 10. The machine 10 can then be tipped on its back to engage the wheels 57 and 58 with the floor so that the machine 10 can be rolled about freely from one location to another. Since the dynamometer lever arm 13 is centrally located with respect to the rear crosspiece assembly 18, twisting moments on the",
