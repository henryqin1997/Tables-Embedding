    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{54716=According to the above-described disclosure made in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 55-1827, the concentration of a solution by using the reverse osmosis membrane has been described. The thesis of this disclosure lies in that the temperature of the liquid on the concentrating side of the reverse osmosis membrane is made higher than that of the permeated liquid. As a result, the osmotic pressure depending upon the temperature difference is generated between the concentrating side of the membrane and the permeated side of the same (positive osmotic pressure acts from the concentrating side to the permeated side). Consequently, the pressure to be applied to the concentrating side is lowered. In this case, the degree of concentration can be raised if the pressure level to be applied is the same as that in a case where no temperature difference is given. As described above, the method according to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 55-1827 is characterized in that the temperature is made different between the liquid on the concentrating side and the permeated liquid., 27754=On the other hand, an apparatus capable of obtaining fresh water from sea water has been disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 55-31459. According to this disclosure, sea water, the salinity level of which is about 35,000 ppm, is passed through a high pressure reverse osmosis membrane module so as to supply desalted water to a low pressure reverse osmosis membrane module., 53168=There has been disclosed a reverse osmosis treatment method in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 55-1827 which is characterized in that the temperature of rich liquid (liquid to be treated) is made higher than that of thin liquid (permeated liquid) in a case where liquid to be treated is treated by the reverse osmosis membrane., 56427=Both the above-described conventional methods are the same as the present invention in terms of the technological object of reducing the difference in the osmotic pressure between the concentrating side of the reverse osmosis membrane and the permeated side of the same. However, the present invention is different from the invention disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 55-1827 which utilizes osmotic Pressure depending upon temperature differences. In addition, the present invention is different from the invention disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 49-134567 in which liquid possessing an osmotic pressure higher than the permeated liquid is forcibly introduced into the permeated side of the membrane. The present invention utilizes the characteristics of the low pressure reverse osmosis membrane so as to reduce the difference in the osmotic pressure and thereby realize a high degree of concentration., 30456=The system disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 55-31459 is a system for obtaining fresh water from sea water. Therefore, the degree of concentration which can be achieved at the time of concentrating water is relatively low compared to that which may be obtained by the present invention. What is even worse, concentrated water is abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described in its preferred form, it is to be understood that the present invention may be changed or modified without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed. (c) The present invention can be adapted to treat various solutions such as, various salt solutions, effluents from plating processes (recovery by concentrating useful metal), drain containing organic matter, fruit juice, and saccaroliquid which are the subjects to be treated by the reverse osmosis membrane. (b) In addition to the energy saving, if the method according to the present invention is adapted to concentrate fruit juice, a satisfactory retention ratio of the aromatic component of fruit juice can be realized in comparison to the evaporation method. (a) According to the method of the present invention, a high density liquid, which has been able to be treated by the evaporation method, can be concentrated depending upon the type of liquid to be treated. Therefore, energy required to complete the concentration can be saved. However, since a limit is present in the degree of concentration achieved according to the present invention, the evaporation method must be employed if a further concentration is desired. However, also energy can be saved in the above-described case because the quantity of evaporation is reduced by a degree which corresponds to the increase in the quantity of concentration by means of the reverse osmosis membrane.",
