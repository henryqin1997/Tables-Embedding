No. 07/775,046, filed Oct. 11, 1991, now abandoned., 52631=The tubing, due to the surrounding support provided by the housing walls that define channel 20, is capable of withstanding fluid pressures of greater than 1000 psi. Thus the device may be used for example, to handle pressures of 300-400 psi where a contrast media is to be injected rapidly from a syringe, and pressures up to 1,050 psi when used with a contrast media injector. High injection pressure is required in such an application so that the contrast media is rapidly totally injected and thus it is not dispersed. The pressure is needed to overcome the flow resistance of the relatively long path it must travel to reach the point in the body for the intended fluoroscopic medical observation.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be understood the foregoing disclosure and description of the invention and alternative constructions are illustrative and explanatory thereof, and various changes in the size, shape and materials, as well as in the details of the illustrated constructions may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. For the syringe-actuated aspect of the invention, to obtain some of the advantages, it is possible to employ other two-part rotary valve constructions, such as two relatively rotatable disks each having an aperture which through rotation of the disks line up to define the passage and through opposite rotation move out of alignment to close the passage. Also, the embodiments described use either right-handed or left-handed threads to join the distal and proximal body members of the closure device and cause slight axial movement as the compression member moves in opening or closing the tube. The means of joinder and movement between the distal and proximal body members could also be found in other rotatable connections to give the same type of operation, some in which there is no axial advance at all, so the closure device, in certain aspects, is not limited to threaded surfaces for joining the component members. In conclusion, in its more general aspects the invention can be embodied in many forms too numerous to attempt to mention, as will be understood by the person skilled in the art. As examples only,",
