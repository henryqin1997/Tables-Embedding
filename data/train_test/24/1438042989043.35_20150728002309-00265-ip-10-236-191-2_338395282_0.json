It was just before the British Invasion in the states but in London back then the Stones were known as Mick Jagger and the Rollin\u2019 Stones with Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Dick Taylor on bass and future Kinks drummer Mick Avory. I was in junior high in London then, and I remember that the Stones were the bad boys, the Teddy Boy thug version of the band we all adored, The Beatles. Still, they persevered and now, 50 years later, no one has moves like Jagger\u2014or ever will. Or, as the man himself said, \u201cA good thing never ends.\u201d To commemorate the great Stones, tell us your favorite Stones song, contemplate the wisdom of Mick (Oh, you can't always get what you want/But if you try sometimes/You just might find /You get what you need) and check out these five things you may not know:, 9706=\u2022\u00a0The 1967 Rolling Stones single \u201cWe Love You\u201d features John Lennon and Paul McCartney on back-up vocals.}",
