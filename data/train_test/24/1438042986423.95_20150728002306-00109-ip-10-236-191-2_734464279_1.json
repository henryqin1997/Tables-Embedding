Riggott was a stalwart of the Boro defence after he joined from Derby in 2001, but has failed to make an impact in the first team for the last couple of seasons under Gareth Southgate. The 27 year old will help bolster a Potters' defence that has been leaking too many goals compared to a traditional Pulis tight back four but that has been compensated by a free scoring attack. Whilst we would not expect either Griffin, Cort or Shawcross to have to make way for Riggott, there's now doubt that extra cover in defence will benefit the squad should we get any suspensions or injuries in the final run in. The club have also revealed that the planned loan move of keeper, Carlo Nash to Stoke has had to be put on hold after Wigan's Chris Kirkland picked up a knock in training. Pulis is still hopefully of the deal finally going through some time next week., 18745=Time: 1:27PM, 11738=Bachmann moves to Ross County on loan (Tuesday July 28 2015), 10346=Stoke could break transfer record for Yarmolenko (Sunday July 19 2015)}",
