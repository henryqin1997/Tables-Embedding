            "Campus Safety is its own department in PLU. They will send texts and emails to everyone on campus if there is an emergency. If you lose something, or something is stolen, they will try to find out who did it, but that doesn't mean that they will always be able to get your items back or find the person responsible. There are cameras on campus, so that they can monitor different areas, mainly different parking lots so that they can tell who is coming on campus, and are friendly.",
            "I can't say this enough: join a club and go on activities. If you can't find any activity that you like on campus, make a new club that does what you do like. The application process is fairly simple, and PLU will try to get your club started with an advisor. Activities that your club does then are up to you, with your advisor giving recommendations to try to make your club the best it can be.",
            "PLU offers many different scholarships and grants. These can be need or merit based, and they will try their hardest to make it such that the financial aid package covers the whole cost of tuition with these scholarships, grants, work studies, and loans. Of course, you can choose to accept these or not based on outside financial aid.",
            "For fun, join a club or go on a trek with Outdoor Recreation. Most weekends will have something going on. All that you need to do is sign up for activities",
            "PLU has a great kitchen staff. I have many food allergies, and the kitchen made sure that they had all the allergens in foods marked to try to prevent anybody from eating anything that they were allergic to. If you have any questions about something in anything that they make, just ask and they will tell you what they put in it.",
            "There are residence halls on campus to fit almost anyone. This means that it is likely that your top pick for the residence hall will be one that matches your personality the best, with the number of residents and the way the residents act. Sometimes it isn't perfect, but the RAs and RD will always try to help make your experience the best one you can have.",
            "PLU is a university first. The students are the priority, with teachers trying to make sure that each student gets the attention that they need to succeed. If you need help, they are always there to try to guide you through problems, and will try to work with you to help make up work if you end up getting sick or have an emergency.",
            "Make sure you apply to your colleges early. Don't wait until the last minute, because then you might rush through your application, and miss some important pieces needed by the college to give you the best financial aid package that they can.",
            "Pacific Lutheran University (PLU) is a private university that has a welcoming atmosphere and fits many different personalities. The main focus is the academics, of course, but then there are many different clubs and organizations out there for people to join. There is always some event going on with these clubs and organizations, from concerts in Lagerquist Hall in the Mary Baker Russell Music Building to leaving campus for a day on the water or on Mt. Rainier."

I am also very active in the Crossfit Community and entered the crossfit open in 2013. HIking, biking, and any other physical activity are appealing to me., 92263=I only was given the opportunity to live in the dorms during the January term at PLU but it was probably the best time of my life. For the most part, the dorms are very relaxed and quiet hours are respected. They aren't that new but they are much bigger rooms than other universities I've visited., 206720=PLU is pretty quirky, so I probably won't remember all of the quirks. If you visit, throw a rock across the bricks in Red Square; some sections are hollow underneath, and the rock makes a xylophone sound as it skitters across the square. Also spin the big rusty metal statues! Look for the diorama of the giant slug in Rieke, the science building. If you visit in February, you may be able to attend an annual performance of the Vagina Monologues, and look for a performance any time of the year by one of our excellent a cappella singing groups., 291436=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Also, private universities like PLU look very expensive on the surface, but they give many more grants and other financial aid opportunities than the public universities do.

Also, know what you want from a school. If you want a great economics program or sports team...you might want to look elsewhere. But if you want to actually participate in sports, or lead a",
