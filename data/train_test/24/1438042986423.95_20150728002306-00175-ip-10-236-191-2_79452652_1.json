However a shoulder injury forced him home early and ruled him out for three months. Following replacement appearances against Fiji and Australia, he returned to England's starting XV for their defeat to South Africa and their famous win over the All Blacks. He retained the jersey for the 2013 Six Nations and started every game apart from the win over Italy., 9140=Come the 2011 World Cup, Youngs was an injury doubt going into the tournament but he timed his return to action to perfection as he scored the winning try against Argentina in their first match of the competition. Youngs kept the scrum-half berth for the remainder of the tournament but was unable to prevent England from crashing out at the quarter-finals stage., 8090=Son of former England international Nick Youngs, Ben has played at the Tigers since an early age. When he took his bow for them in 2007, Youngs was the youngest player to turn out in the Premiership., 9538=In the 2011-12 season back at Leicester, Youngs was struggling to find his usual sensational form and although he started both of England's opening matches in the 2012 Six Nations, he was forced to be content with a spot on the bench for the final three matches in the tournament., 8324=Scintillating form behind a dominant Leicester Tigers pack projected him to the accolade of Land Rover Discovery of the Year 2009-10 and a try-scoring first start for England in the 21-20 win over Australia at Sydney in June 2010, five months after his Saxons' debut against Ireland. A dummy and a dynamic dash from line out ball won by Tom Croft launched him to the line.}",
