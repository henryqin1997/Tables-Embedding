Indeed when you exclude artifacts, it doesn't avoid ivy to search for the module itself, and to resolve the dependencies of the module. But you can also exclude the whole module, which means that the module will not be downloaded at all, and so its own dependencies will not be resolved. For sure, this is usually done to exclude not a direct dependency but an indirect one. To exclude a whole module, you just have to not specify any artifact name, type and ext in your exclude rule. For instance:   Note that exclusion is always done AFTER inclusion has been done.  include feature). The same principle concerning configuration as for include applies to this exclude feature (see the  even if configuration does not a good separation of published artifacts It enables to restrict the artifacts required, by excluding artifacts being published by the dependency or any of its transitive dependencies, This feature gives you more control on",
