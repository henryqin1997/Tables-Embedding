    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{52182=An embodiment of the invention is a system that provides customers with multiple instantly accessible electronic IPGs. The multiple IPG system enables users to view TV programs and schedule information in each IPG. Preferably, each IPG comprises a Grid Guide, a Channel Guide, and a Theme Guide. Each IPG receives, stores, and displays program titles and information and share some of the information with other IPGs. The format and some features of an IPG are described in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/120,488, filed on Jul., 21, 1998 and entitled \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DISPLAYING AND RECORDING CONTROL INTERFACE WITH TELEVISION PROGRAMS, VIDEO, ADVERTISING INFORMATION AND PROGRAM SCHEDULING INFORMATION\u201d the disclosures of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth herein in its entirety., 45338=This application claims priority to the following applications: provisional Application No. 60/094,564, filed Jul. 29, 1998, entitled \u201cInteractive Program Guide Product Definition\u201d; Provisional Application No. 60/123,294, filed Mar. 4, 1999, entitled \u201cElectronic Program Guide System and Methods for Displaying Programs and Advertising\u201d; and provisional Application No. 60/135,004, filed May 20, 1999, entitled \u201cMultiple Interactive Program Guides.\u201d The above-identified applications being incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein., 105510=A show title includes a moving Time Column. The moving Time Column graphically represents how much of the show is over. It is a column, because the shading is vertical. Its height is constant and its width expands from left to right. When the user displays a Grid Guide that includes the current half-hour, any portion of the show title that precedes the current minute is displayed in a darker variant of its Theme Color. For example, if the current time is 8:17 pm and the user is displaying a system page with a screen time of 8:00 pm, the moving Time Column will shade roughly half of the first half-hour of show titles, so that the background color for movies will be a darker red up until the current time, the background color for sports a darker green, and the background color for all other shows a darker blue. When the cursor is on a show that begins before current time, that portion of the cursor to the left of current time will also be shaded a darker shade of yellow., 77765=All of the multiple IPGs are capable of supporting the features of VCHIP Plus+ described in a co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/221,615 (\u201cVCHIP PLUS; PARENTAL CONTROL APPARATUS AND METHOD\u201d), filed Dec. 28, 1998, the disclosures of which is incorporated herein by reference, as if fully stated here, for all purposes., 46682=Later EPGs provided improvements in viewer EPG interaction and also provided a Picture-In-Guide (\u201cPIG\u201d) display of the TV program simultaneous with the display of the EPG. International Application No. PCT/US95/11173 (International Publication No. WO 96/07270), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, illustrates such an improvement. However, each of these IPGs requires a set-top box or a computer. Thus, in a household with several TV sets, several set-top boxes are needed. This increases the cost of having multiple TV sets in a house. Additionally, different users with different TV watching tastes and habits do not have the flexibility of customizing an IPG to their needs. Furthermore, it is difficult and time-consuming for parents to exercise parental control over several IPGs that are not related to and do not communicate with each other., 79550=Each IPG requests that the user provide certain profile information. Some of the information provided by the user are specific to the set-top box and the same for all the IPG such as: the user's zip code; TV, cable, and satellite services to which the user subscribes; the length of said subscriptions. Other information is specific to each user or each TV set such as the type of TV; the age of the TV; the user's top favorite channels; the user's favorite types of programs; and the times during which the user is most likely to watch TV. If the user declines to provide this information, each IPG attempts to \u201clearn\u201d the information as described in a co-pending patent application Ser. No. 09/120,488 (\u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DISPLAYING AND RECORDING CONTROL INTERFACE WITH TELEVISION PROGRAMS, VIDEO, ADVERTISING INFORMATION AND PROGRAM SCHEDULING INFORMATION\u201d), filed Jul. 21, 1998, the disclosures of which is incorporated herein by reference, as if fully stated here, for all purposes.}",
