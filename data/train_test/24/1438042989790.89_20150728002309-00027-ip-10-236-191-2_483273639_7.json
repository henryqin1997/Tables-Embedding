In some instances, features of the invention can be employed without a corresponding use of other features, without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth. Therefore, many modifications can be made to adapt a particular configuration or method disclosed, without departing from the essential scope and spirit of the present invention. It is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed, but that the invention will include all embodiments and equivalents falling within the scope of the claims. For example, instead of a CPU, one or more PLDs 408 can control the logical operations of the system. In an embodiment, PLD 408 acts as a reconfigurable processor, which can be reprogrammed as needed to handle a particular computing task. Alternately, programmable logic device 408 can itself include an embedded microprocessor. Memory unit 404 can be a random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), fixed or flexible disk media, PC Card flash disk memory, tape, or any other storage means, or any combination of these storage means. Processing unit 402 can direct data to an appropriate system component for processing or storage, execute a program stored in memory 404 or receive and transmit data via I/O unit 406,",
