            "The strongest I've seen! The greek community is HUGE at KSU and I'm very proud to have been apart of it! Rush, if you don't like it, you don't have to join, but my bet is you'll love it!",
            "The hardest thing to do when you're a frightened freshman is to venture out and get involved but do it and you won't regret it! KSU has a club for literally everything!",
            "All types!",
            "Campus is beautiful and there is always something going on. A must see is the Harry Potter room in Hale, you'll feel like you're at Hogwarts.",
            "I loved the time I spent at KSU but it is expensive and something to keep in mind if you intend on paying for college yourself. I held a part time job for my duration and still have loans to pay back.",
            "KSU has a TON of clubs! GET INVOLVED and go greek!",
            "It's dorm food, don't get too excited. The strong complex has the best dining center! Full salad bar was on my menu everyday",
            "LOVED IT! It was a wonderful experience that I would not trade for anything. Always a ton of activities planned for your floor and always ton of people to hang out with.",
            "It is a D1 school, expect it to be difficult but know your professors are always willing to help! Compared to other Elementary Ed. programs I would consider K-States to be one of the more difficult but one of the most thorough.",
            "Save Save Save. college tuition is expensive and there is always unexpected expenses. Meet with your adviser every semester! They are great and make sure you graduate on time!",
            "Great school, I've enjoyed my four years here in the college of education. Ranked very high nationally in most degree programs, including the college of ed. Professors cannot be beat!"

Homecoming, 44802=Scholarships are available for pretty much every activity that you're willing to get involved in (including Physics club), but you have to make sure to specifically mention the groups that you're involved in when you meet with your financial aid advisor. Make sure to pay the dorm down-payment, which is either $400 or $500 and is due around the same time that you fill out the housing contract, as early as you can. Waiting until May (when you're planning on moving into dorms in August) can result in you being placed in temporary housing, which means you are stuck wherever housing is available and then you'll receive an email anywhere from three days to four months after moving telling you that you have two days to pack and move everything to another room. Freshman year is generally the best time to take the off-the-wall classes, because once you get into your major specific classes, depending on your field of study, you could run into a bit of a time crunch. Should you have any difficulty with learning material for a specific class, K-State offers free tutoring to students throughout the day at the dining centers. More information can be found online or at the entrances to the dining halls. It is possible to learn a ton, take demanding classes, have a strong GPA, and still have a social life, you just have to be willing to put in the effort and not be afraid to ask for help when you need it., 711722=Make sure to apply for admission early. Fill out the admission and scholarship application before November 1st and take the ACT before your senior year. Also, visit campus on specialized student days. The campus isn't too big and everyone is very friendly., 296967=No matter what your major is or is going to be, get to know the students and professors in your classes and don't be afraid to ask for help. That's what office hours are for. There are a ton of tutoring opportunities available for almost every subject. You just have to utilize them. And no matter how cold it is outside in December, go to class!, 816308=The campus safety at Kansas State University is one of the best. At night there are police that patrol the campus, and there are emergency phone call booths on every side walk. It is so safe at KSU that I have left my car running in the parking lot to warm it up when it's cold outside. Is there crime, yes, but nothing major. The biggest crime that happens on campus is somebody's bicycle was stolen because they did not lock it up. Even at 4 o'clock in the morning there are always students walking back from a late night study session or finishing a project. If feel extremely safe when I am on campus at K-State., 579381=There are so many safety precautions in place; even at 3:00 in the morning I feel safe on campus., 883641=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students Get involved! Meeting new people is part of the college experience and it also helps to make connections for a future job down the road. Also, stay in the Dorms at least one year. Everyone there is usually new and wanting to make friends. The Dorms also have several activities to do. Bang for the buck Paying tuition is never fun but compared to other universities around the country k-state is pretty reasonably priced and the experience and people you meet are worth every penny. Am enjoying being here I",
