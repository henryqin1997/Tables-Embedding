            "Campus was safe. No problem at all. Security is everywhere. The school is located in a very wealthy part of manhattan so its as safe as it gets!",
            "None",
            "Clubs met on Wednesdays. They had alot of activities for students. I was very impressed. You would catch me at the music club producing/networking/and songwriting with artists. Definatley join the clubs in the school for great networking opportunties and also a way to make plenty of friends.",
            "Outgoing, Love the city life, Fast paced life, Music/Fashion/Entertainment. Students who know what they want out of New York City. When you come to the city know exactley what you want and what you came there for and you will be incredibly successful.",
            "I used to go to SOHO every day which is a trendy fashion area on canal street. I was into music and fashion so I was always out there networking and trying to meet anybody who I could to advance my career.",
            "PERFECT! This is the best thing about this school. Its very affordable!",
            "I came with no friends from out of state completley on my own. I am into music so I joined the music club and networked and made plenty of friends. Theres also soo much to do in New York that this is probably the best location in NYC for having fun because BMCC is right in the middle of manhattan.",
            "Food is good. Decently priced and convenienty located. Only problem for me was they didnt take debit cards so I had to pay cash so I preferred to just run to food spots in the area.",
            "There are no dorms at this school.",
            "Depends on the professor. Id have to say the academics were very strong and challenging. I learned alot at this school from the professors because I used ratemyprofessor.com to pick the right teachers. A few bad teachers here and there but in general things were good as long as I used ratemyprofessor to confirm the teachers history.",
            "Come here take your classes. Use ratemyprofessor.com to check teachers because some are horrable. Dont graduate from BMCC unless you have a strong GPA. if your GPA is under 3.0 just transfer out elseware because it will be difficult to raise it depending on how many more classes you need to graduate. And just remember that the school completley deserts you after you graduate. Your on your own. They dont help you get a job, get into other schools, get internships. NOTHING. So make sure to go out and explore New York city and find your opportunities for yourself just using BMCC as a educational reference only.",
            "Affordable education....But absolutley no support from college after graduation. After you graduate they kick you to the curb. They take your ID and force you to have to pay for a alumni ID card. Also you have to pay for any other CUNY transfer applications. They have absolutley no career placement service for graduates unless you pay for it. I cant even get into the school without paying and I am an alumni. I think that is rediculous. The only benefit that I recieved is very affordable education. based on (in-state) rates"

I've had some very lenient teachers and also very thorough teachers. Study hard and make every effort to get the grade you want and deserve. I was admitted into NYU for the fall 2012, though I worked very hard I had some really great professors., 182523=This is the best part of this school it's price cannot get any better , I pay about $1900 and I am taking 14 credits which makes me a full-time student at the moment. Most folks start off by paying $20000 and up for each semester and are inundated by debt once they graduate, here that is not case , you will be debt free by the time you get your degree., 315149=Affordable compared to most of the schools in the city. Small classes 20:1. You always know what classes you need to take.}",

Students with children. Anyone needing a variety of times for classes. Weekend and night students. Tips for prospective students Try and get involved in anything you can. There are so many different clubs that you can join.
