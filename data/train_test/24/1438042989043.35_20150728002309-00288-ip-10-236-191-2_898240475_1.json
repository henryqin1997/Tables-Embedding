Everyone with an account here should also have a wiki account with a home page that provides basic contact information. 1.3 Accounts on haskell.org This machine is used mainly for the wiki and to host projects - anyone is welcome to create a home page for their project here. You can also install services here as long as they don't overwhelm haskell.org and are of interest to the Haskell community. If you need a repository, that is usually done at darcs.haskell.org (or cvs.haskell.org). 1.2 Services on haskell.org Mark Wogahn works for workstation support at Yale. If you have questions about how the machine is administered you can ask him. If you need something done differently, go through John. John Peterson handles most of the requests for haskell.org services. He can usually answer any questions you have. Email him if you would like an account. Here are the people that you should contact if you need something on haskell.org: This machine lives at Yale University and maintained by Yale's Workstation Support people. They provide OS patches, backups, and Internet connectivity. Paul Hudak generously provides the funding that keeps this machine going. 1.1 Contacts at Haskell.org Haskell.org is a resource for the entire",
