Start the scholarship application early because there is a lot to do on it and the priority deadline is December 1. This year I had to write three, two paragraph maximum essays, and obtain two letters of recommendation, one academic and one personal., 26452=There are so many things to do at this school! The residence halls hold programs every week, the clubs on campus are very active, and the school holds many events as well. One event, Muddy Mayhem, takes place every October. The event is a mud obstacle course that is physically challenging and rewarding. The Health and Physical Education (HPE) Department has taken it over and it is easily my favorite event. Other events have been a hypnotist, concerts by Jason Derulo and 3Oh!3, A huge zipline challenge, facepainting, balloon artists, the March of Dimes, an on campus garden, Trunk or Treat, Homecoming Week, and many more. There is always something to do if you know where to look, and I definitely give this school credit for offering fun, safe activities., 3618=The current president of UAH, Dave Williams, has a goal to increase the enrolled students by roughly 1500 in the next year. This is causing tuition rates to rise, meal plans to be mandatory, and on-campus housing for both freshman and sophomores to be mandatory as well. While these alterations are pushing some students away, others are looking past the current changes as hope for future students at the university. With the completion of the new dormitory in the Fall of 2010, on campus living is becoming safer, easier, and more fun.}",

Tips for prospective students One main thing to keep in mind when attending this university is the career field you plan on entering. The Huntsville area is number one in the South for aerodynamics and space engineering. The opportunity to get co-ops and internships as an engineer, biologist, teacher, or mathematician are extremely high as the university is so close to the second largest research park in the nation.
