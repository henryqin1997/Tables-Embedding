            "Western is great for students who want a rigorous course load as well as for students who would rather not work as hard. It all depends on the courses you select. For a student who picks courses like I do (challenging ones), I'd say that Western has a chill social atmosphere and a rigorous and creative academic perspective. Mostly, this is a school for youthful, energetic, and liberally intellectual minds.",
            "Get to know your professors! Sit towards the front and answer questions in class so they know that you're keeping up with the reading. Make sure to impress professors that are teaching a course that is integral to your major, because you never know if that professor will be able to pull some strings for you in the future.",
            "This school is relatively inexpensive compared to other universities, especially if you live in state. The problem is that we just had budget cuts, so I would recommend that prospective students keep track of the cost of this school's tuition and other expenses. The same is probably true for a lot of schools in Washington and across the country. Overall though, I feel as though my finances are VERY manageable here. I never feel strapped for cash. That being said, I must also let you know that I spend most of my money on important stuff like food, and I cut most other expenses.",
            "Bellingham is absolutely beautiful. The view from the Viking Commons dining hall is breathtaking. The entire campus is paved in brick and it lies in the middle of a forest. The atmosphere is friendly and trusting, and everyone's willing to help one another out. Vikings ride bicycles and longboards and wear woolen sweaters and moccasins. We're pretty much in British Columbia, so be prepared for cold winters :) The professors and administrators are patient and know what they're talking about. George Mariz, the head of the honors program, is a sweet guy and an excellent instructor. He is the advisor for honors students, so if you have any questions just Google him and you can find his contact info!",
            "If you're looking into Western's Honor's Program, this review will probably be helpful for you! If not, you might still get something out of it :) My name's Hannah and I'm working towards multiple degrees in neuroscience and biology, chemistry, biochemistry, or psychology. Let me start this by saying that I was blown away at the difference between high school and this university. The professors here care so much more than my previous instructors. If you don't understand something and you need extra help, they will go out of their ways just to make it clearer for you. The learning isn't just text book based, either. My life experience has grown tremendously since I started going to classes here. Western is all about being green. No, I mean really. Other institutions say that they're green, but they ain't got nothin' on Western! Throwing away recyclable stuff is pretty much a sin here. Classes for honors students cap at about 25 students, so the likelihood of being overlooked is minimized. Even in non-honors classes and lectures, there are fewer students than in other, larger universities. I do have one course with about 400 students, but it's an elective course. Also, I feel over 9,000X more educated since I arrived here."

If you can think of a possible club that doesn't already exist, all it takes if 4 friends and a quick application., 695294=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 502302=Along with all of the activities and clubs constantly going on around campus, there are a ton of things to do around town. There is an area of town called Fairhaven where there are a ton of different little shops to go to as well as Boulevard Park to relax and goof off at. You can buy books, crafts, or even make your own piece of art at Creativity. In the downtown area, we have theaters (movies and plays), an imporv theater (where Ryan Stiles sometimes appears) and if you are 21 or over, this is where the bar an club scene is located. Also around town we have a mall where the discount movie theater is located, as well as the Value Village and Spirit Halloween store in October. There is also a location on Lake Watcom where you can rent Kayaks, sail boats, and wind surfers for really cheap., 362253=Apply early! Preferably before November 1st. Your application is like a place holder for housing. The earlier you submit it, the closer to the front you are in line for housing choices.}",

Despite it's reputation as a granola or hippy school, Western has one of the most diverse campuses in the state. A lot of people here are very athletic and enjoy running up to Mt. Baker to ski or snowboard in the winter, but just as many enjoy biking or hiking on any of the area trails. Also, with Bellingham Bay, the San Juan Islands, and Seattle such a short distance away, there's always something to do! Western is a very accepting community and it seems almost impossible not to fit in here! Tips for prospective students While at Western, don't be afraid to try new things! There is an information fair each fall a couple of days before school starts and all the clubs and various student organizations turn out to connect to students",
