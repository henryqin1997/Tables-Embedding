            "Very safe, easy to find help with the blue light system and friendly people.",
            "Pretty prevalent on campus, I myself a, in a fraternity and i have a great time. Always something to do on the weekends, usually 3 nights a week. Many huge campus charity events are run on campus by greek life. it's honestly a great time, not really much else to say about it",
            "Literally a club for everything. Anything you can image, its like rule 34 but with clubs.",
            "Definitely for students who enjoy an academic challenge. However, that is not to say that if you are into a social scene you won't find it. We aren't all bookworms.",
            "There is a triathlon that every student will attempt to complete before they graduate involving interesting activities to say the least. You will hear all about it if you plan on attending the school",
            "Expensive out of state, but the opportunities are endless. With a name like William and Mary behind you, you will have a distinct advantage over other competitors. This is a really good school if you want to be able to fulfill any career goals while being able to have a full social life",
            "Lots of stuff, There are club teams for most major sports. About 30% of the campus is involved in greek life, which incedentally is also where 90% of the parites stem from. Mainly house parties although now the bar scene is definitely improving. Tons of clubs ranging from surfing, to martial arts, to massage club(kinda wierd but if you're into it I won't knock it) Its easy to hang out on campus, the large quad , the sunken gardens, is a great place to chill, maybe toss the ball around. The gym has available indoor soccer courts and it is easy to rent tennis rackets or even hockey sticks to play with on campus. There are running trails and bike paths. the ollege sports teams...not too great, get hammered and its a blast.",
            "The food is mediocre most of the year. You'll find that when there are events or visiting days quality definitely increases. However, this year the food quality is supposed to increase along with the new renovations to the cafeteria.",
            "Pretty solid, met a lot of good friends there, they're dorms sooo they aren't large rooms. But it is comfortable living with clean common areas and a good environment to meet with people from other dorms as well.",
            "Tough, i never studied in highschool, never did my homework and ended up with above a 4.0. Here i study my butt off, at least 12 hours a week. The classes are manageable, but here you definitely have to put i a lot of work to get anything out of it.",
            "If you want to meet new people be proactive. STUDY, this is not a warning that should be blown off. Also, look around for interesting classes, the biggest mistake you can make is isolating yourself while there are a multitude of options;",
            "Excellent academic environment, with a relatively prevalent Greek life. There is a place for everyone, the only requirement is that you do well in school; other than that the world is your oyster."

It was what convinced me about William and Mary- I hadn't been too impressed on the tours or other visits, but they had really good programs at their admitted students day and they gave me a much better understanding of what William and Mary is really like. for people who decide to go: Visit the Cohen Career Center your freshman year and definitely sign up for the various listservs that the Center offers. Make an appointment to get advice on your resume, or to look in to possible internship/ job opportunities, even if you aren't interested in applying for any yet. Make yourself known there and start that relationship with them, because they'll end up offering you opportunities you might not have known to even look for otherwise. Be thoughtful when answering the questions about the dorm you'll live in. Your freshman hall is really what makes the difference between a good freshman year and an invaluable freshman year. Buy a cider mug from the Bake Shop on dog (duke of Gloucester) street in January. For $11 you get free cider, soda, coffee, ice cream (possibly more...) for an entire year, so if you buy it in January you'll have it for two semesters instead of one. Orientation is not at all what college is actually like, but bear with the sleep deprivation and awkward mixers because it definitely keeps you from being homesick and will prove to have been a worthwhile experience by the end of the week., 61150=i am vp of club tennis and it is amazing and awesome and marvelous i've met some of my best friends through the club, and i know many people have similar experiences with other sports clubs. we got fourth place in sectionals and are going to nationals in april., 10732=Complete an optional submission - it can be anything! I submitted a DVD of a short film that I had completed during my time at the 2007 Virginia Summer Governor's School for the Humanities. It required no extra effort on my part except burning another DVD. I know other people who submitted essays written for other college applications. This is your chance to stand out!, 68263=11 sororities and around 18 fraternities, around 30% of the student body is in a Greek organization. A great way to meet people, greek organizations have special housing and lots of events. New fraternity houses will open in fall 2013., 436786=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 429749=I stayed in the dorms here for crew camp during the summer of 2013, and while the dorms are just basic college dorms, everyone on your hall will bond., 304170=The dorms on campus are average. Definitely nothing special, but not terrible either. Remember, this college is over 300 years old. Some of the buildings aren't exactly high tech. Great roommates and suitemates will make things 1000 time better., 4727=As a prospective, I had been told of the sporadic weather that Williamsburg was blessed with, but I had not planned accordingly. The end of August was scorchingly hot, especially without an A/C unit in my room. The random downpours were also quite inconvenient for getting to class, as I had failed to bring both an umbrella and waterproof shoes. I ended up wearing flipflops in the rain and went to the study lounge whenever it got too hot. Just a thought: bring an umbrella and a fan/air conditioning unit., 276431=Some of the dorms are old; after all, the College has been around since 1693. However, at least for me, the community on my freshman hall made up for it. Furthermore, some of the dorms have sinks in the rooms which may not seem like a big deal, but when you don't have to go to the hall bathroom to brush your teeth, you'll be thanking me., 18932=Learning is a relative term- it is said that it is impossible to stop learning. This is especially true at William and Mary. Learning isn't limited to the classroom. Walking from one\u2019s dorm room to the cafeteria, a William and Mary student can learn about the history of America by passing various colonial buildings. For example, the Brafferton Building, built in 1723 was one of the first Indian schools and it is right in the middle of William and Mary campus. Students are constantly in a learning environment - whether in an academic building or in a freshman dorm. Students learn how to become adults, to test their limits, and to grow intellectually., 318656=There are three dining halls on campus, but plenty of other chains that do not take meal plan money. The food at the dining halls is not spectacular, but it is not that bad either. Starting with the Class of 2016, students will be required to have meal plans (which can only be used at the three dining halls) until they graduate., 273851=My favorite annual tradition is the Yule Log Ceremony. Every year before finals in December, the campus community gathers at the Wren Chapel (another tradition: every student should have a class in Wren before they graduate!) and shares all of the different holiday traditions (Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Diwali, etc.). Santa Claus (who looks suspiciously like President Reveley...) also turns up. Then, everyone burns a sprig of holly in the Great Chapel to symbolize the end of worries for the year (and especially finals). It's just a really great tradition that brings the entire campus together., 128524=The College of William & Mary is a great college with an incredible student atmosphere. The College offers a plethora of clubs and other opportunities to meet people and do fun things. Finally, the College is filled with many traditions and history stretching back all the way to 1693.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The professors at WM have what's called office hours, which is time dedicated to helping students who decide to visit. The average size of classes is small, so professors are able to spend time with you if you want to. For instance, I missed a class because I was ill, and my professor practically repeated his lecture for me. Mind you, professors have their own papers and research going on and are thus not always free, but if you have a will to learn and are having a little trouble, professors at WM are definitely willing to help.

Thus the College is great for students who want",
