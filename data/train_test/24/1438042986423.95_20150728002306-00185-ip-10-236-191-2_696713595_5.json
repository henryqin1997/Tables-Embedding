This means that the main contact for media accreditation will be the National Paralympic Committees (NPCs), who will have a broader scope of responsibility in facilitating the accreditation process for national media agencies and individuals. The aim of this increased involvement by NPCs is to enhance the media coverage of the Paralympics, which is more limited in a rather centralized system. The IPC expects around 3,500 media representatives to be accredited for the Paralympic Games in Beijing., 136214=Over $430 million has been invested to prepare Qingdao for the sailing events at the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games and the sailing committee has worked hard to ensure that the city, and the sport, will receive a long-term return., 264371=Media interested in coming to the Paralympic Games in 2008, should contact the NPC of their country for further accreditation information., 264527=The IPC and BOCOG will support and monitor the accreditation process.

    "textAfterTable": "Venue The three sailing events of the 2008 Paralympic Games will be held in the coastal city of Qingdao, China, approximately 800 kilometres southeast of Beijing. The purpose-built Qingdao Olympic Sailing Centre will host the Paralympic Sailing Competition. Qingdao Olympic Sailing Centre The Qingdao Olympic Sailing Centre is located on Fushan Bay, just a short bus ride or 20-minute walk from the centre of Qingdao city. The venue was formerly the Beihai Shipyard, which has been relocated to Haixi Bay in the Huangdao District of Qingdao at the cost of over US $230 million. Together with the construction work, this brought the total cost of the project to US $436 million, although all of this investment is set to be recouped through plans to utilize the venue after the Games. Click here to find out more about the venue. About Qingdao Qingdao, also known as Tsingtao, lies along China's east coast at the south of the Shandong Peninsula, approximately 800 km southeast of Beijing.
