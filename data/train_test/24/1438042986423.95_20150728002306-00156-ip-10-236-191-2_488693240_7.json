    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{21587=To provide a higher resolution of artery wall images, Kandarpa et al. investigated the feasibility of a miniature endoluminal magnetic resonance (MR) detection coil (i.e., rf receiving coil) for imaging mural and perimural anatomy of small tubular structures. J. Vascular and Interventional Radiology 1993, 4:419-27. The authors concluded that, with further development, such a detection coil may be useful for studying atherosclerosis and for providing imaging guidance during endoluminal MR interventions. In vivo tracking and accurate placement of catheters equipped with miniature rf coils is described in AJR 1995, 164:1265-70. However, use of catheters equipped with miniature rf coils as described in these publications still requires positioning the patient in conventional large specialized MRI magnets. This environment can result in deficient images because the various orientations of the rf coil, e.g., in an artery, will not be positioned always colinearly with the rf excitation field. Also, very large gradients are needed with external .o slashed. gradients to get sufficient spatial resolution., 23638=U.S. Pat. No. 4,350,955 describes means for producing a homogeneous magnetic field remote from the source of the field, wherein two equal field sources are arranged axially so that their fields oppose, producing a region near the plane perpendicular to the axis midway between the sources where the radial component of the field goes through a maximum. A region of relative radial field Br homogeneity may be found near the maximum. See also, J. Mag. Resonance 1980, 41:400-5; J. Mag. Resonance 1980, 41:406-10; J. Mag. Resonance 1980, 41:411-21. Thus, two coils having opposing polarity are positioned axially in a spaced relationship to produce a relatively homogeneous toroidal magnet field region in a plane between the magnets and perpendicular to the axis of cylindrical symmetry.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets The MRI probes of the present invention can also be used for NMR spectroscopy. The invention has been described in detail with reference to preferred embodiments thereof. However, it will be appreciated that, upon consideration of the present specification and drawings, those skilled in the art may make modifications and improvements within the spirit and scope of this invention as defined by the claims. For example, where permanent magnets are described for the primary magnets, it is well known to substitute electromagnets to obtain the same or similar magnetic fields. To change the z position of the excited annular ring, the MRI probe is physically moved in the axial direction, e.g., by moving the catheter in which the probe is encapsulated along an artery or passageway. To image a different annular ring centered about a different value of r, the value r' where the extremum is located is changed. This can be accomplished by providing a cylindrical solenoidal coil around the primary magnet similar to that illustrated in FIG. 6a. The solenoidal coil is excited to create a field component in the region of interest, the field decaying inversely with r. By adding or subtracting this field to the Bo field produced by the primary magnet, the position of the extremum can be moved along the radius. After an annular ring of material is selected or excited, a polypole field, also called a PERL field",
