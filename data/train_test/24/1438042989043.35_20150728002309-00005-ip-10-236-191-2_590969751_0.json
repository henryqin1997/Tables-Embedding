He scored three top-10s and proved to the racing community that he could still find the front of the pack. The 2013 season got off to a disappointing start with three 20-something results, but he has rebounded unequivocally in the past two weeks. A fourth at Bristol might have been attributed to that being a drivers\u2019 track where his previous success gave him an advantage, but last week\u2019s fifth at Auto Club showed a potent combination of horsepower, handling, and heart., 77767=Brad Keselowski does not typically get off to a strong start, but his career is short enough that this trend is not yet well-entrenched. In three full-time seasons plus an abbreviated rookie year, he is the polar opposite of Earnhardt with 60 percent of his top-10s coming during the fall. Winning the 2013 championship kick-started this season, however, and he came out of the gates strong with four consecutive top-fives. Last week at Auto Club, a blown engine sent him to the back of pack to start the race and a speeding penalty midway through the event dug too deep a hole for this team to keep their streak alive. That could stall their momentum, but drivers have selective memories and Keselowski is liable to pick back up where he left off at Bristol Motor Speedway., 75540=There have been several pleasant surprises in the first five weeks of the season, some bitter disappointments, and drama that threatens to have a dire impact on fantasy rosters. Rivalries that carried over from the end of 2012 and new conflicts could conceivably make the short tracks of Martinsville Speedway and Richmond International Raceway more unpredictable than ever. The ever-present threat of the \"Big One\" at Talladega looms large on the horizon and the current stretch of six races before the all-star break in May be pivotal in one\u2019s fantasy season., 76816=There are a few drivers who would prefer to head straight to Martinsville and keep their momentum alive rather than take the week off for Easter. Dale Earnhardt Jr. is foremost of these. Last week\u2019s runner-up finish at Auto Club Speedway not only gave him the points lead and extended his current top-10 streak to six races, it solidified the best start to a season in 14 years of full-time competition. While 2013 has been exceptional, the trend on Earnhardt has been precisely that he gets off to strong starts. During his career, Earnhardt\u2019s average finish in the first half of a season is more than three positions better than he experiences at the end and he scores nearly 60 percent of his top-10s in the spring. With momentum on his side, he is a place-and-hold driver., 64446=March 26, 2013, Dan Beaver, NASCAR.com}",
