A Club Industry's Fitness Business Pro survey of 199 fitness facility owners and managers revealed that 46 percent of owners plan to expand their facilities this year either through acquisitions, expansion of an existing building or opening of a new location (for more details on this study, read \u201cGo Fish,\u201d the 2007 State of the Industry Report on page 32)., 16965=Western Athletic Clubs, which opens new clubs every few years, will break ground on the Carlsbad location in 2007 with completion scheduled for the end of 2008., 9894=The largest health club chains look for ways to boost revenue and membership in 2007 through new programming, services and expansion., 16032=\u201cWe will look to possibly build in areas where we have a larger presence, but not much will happen in the short term,\u201d he says, noting 2007 expansion will be similar to 2006 efforts. Instead, the company, which has more than 400 owned and franchised clubs, will invest in cosmetic upgrades at its top performing clubs in major U.S. cities., 19222=Bally launched its Meet Your Potential campaign in 2006 to show how real people can get real results from 30 days of exercise. The campaign followed the weight loss and muscle gain of seven participants from 30-year-old new parents looking to lose baby weight to a woman trying to fit into a strapless bridesmaid dress. On the company's Web site, potential members can read their success stories, create a personalized fitness plan and print a pass for a free, two-week membership. This year, the company plans to develop different versions of this campaign, air weekly fitness segments on I-Village Live, an NBC show, and partner with the Discovery Health National Body Challenge., 23063=The Wellbridge Co. also plans to expand its personal training and Pilates programming in 2007, says Masloski of Wellbridge., 13177=The editors of Club Industry's Fitness Business Pro asked five of the biggest revenue-generating club companies (based on our 2006 Top 100 club list, which is published each July) about their plans for expansion, renovation and programming; membership pricing; marketing; technology; and their key initiatives for 2007. Although some were reluctant to share their business plans and, therefore, only shared pieces of information, most were open about their goals., 14412=However, expansion plans are varied for each of the club companies. Although The Wellbridge Co., Denver, would not reveal any specific expansion plans except that the company was renewing its focus on the club management side of the company, JoAnna Masloski, director of marketing for the company, says Wellbridge expects 5 percent in capital improvements and a projected $70 million in revenue. Wellbridge decreased from 32 owned and seven managed clubs in 2005 to 16 owned and four managed in 2007., 18021=To capture more of the Baby Boomer market, Western Athletic Clubs will roll out an alternative and traditional medical division within each of its clubs in 2007. The alternative medicine division will include everything from chiropractic services to acupuncture. The clubs will also partner with existing providers in the local community to offer more traditional medical services., 21443=Each January, new members crowd fitness facilities to keep their health-related resolutions. TSI is targeting people who made healthy New Year's resolutions by launching its Rock the Scales challenge, a free nutrition and fitness program for members.}",

In an age when most fitness facilities are competing with at least one of these big players, knowing where the competition is going can be a guide for other clubs \u2014 guiding them to either follow suit or to go in a completely different direction. \u201cOur emphasis is on the service and value they receive rather than on the sale itself,\u201d Hoeffer says. \u201cThat's a big difference from some of the sales models that are out there.\u201d Hoeffer of Western Athletic Clubs was the only one to reveal that the club company, which has 30,000 memberships and will celebrate its 30th anniversary this year, plans to hold its membership pricing this year.
