May he be known from then on as \"6-gun Wang\" instead of \"6 run Wang.\", 43545=who gets a september callup? Does Maerrero get one? he his killing it right now in AAA and has been consistent all year. if he gets a callup, does he play everyday(he can only play 1b) and what happens to Morse(back to full time left field?) and Nix? Same thing goes with Lombardozzi-what happens to Desi or Spinner. Also Antonelli has been somewhat consistent all season. does he get a callup. I know Davey talked about wanting to see Peacock and Milone but Peocock has not yet adjusted to tripple A, does he still get a callup. On a side note, just saw lombardozzi and he has a slight facial resemblance to Espinosa., 56333=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

This is his 1st year at this level and he has maintained the same level of OBP. Some hitters are more patient and some less but the bottom line is he gets on base a lot and his BABIP is a ridiculously low .247 which means that he has been extremely unlucky.Of course this is just my opinion and I could be wrong but I stand by my earlier prediction that Norris will be a solid above average major league catcher. August 8, 2011 5:34 PM ____________________________JD, How can you say he has maintained the same level of OBP?Norris was .235/.419 in Potomac last year. This year at Harrisburg .212/.373 That is regression and on the batting average of 23 points and 46 points on his OBP. That is approx a 10% drop in both. You have to progress to stay viable in the Minor Leagues. When you look at a high OBP player like Komatsu who also carries a decent batting average, that is viable.Baseball America and ESPN has removed Norris from Top 100 Prospects., 38268=Rain out official. Day game on Thursday at 2:20 pm., 12812=I have to guess Nix's achilles is still giving him fits. He hasn't started since August 4th and went 0-4 with 2 Ks.I'm really high on Wang throwing a simulated first inning. Davey has had a quick hook lately with our starters. I wonder if he'll start warming someone up 3rd time through even if Wang is looking good., 17124=Feel Wood said\u2026 There's no point to calling Marrero up to find out if he can hit at the major league level in order to increase his trade value. He wouldn't get enough ABs in September to establish it one way or the other. His trade value is what it is. Also, if they don't call him up they don't burn one of his option years \u2013 and having one more available option might make him more attractive in trade. August 8, 2011 3:57 PM _________________________I believe September callup doesn't affect your available options. Maybe Mark can set that straight. Marrero is on the 40 man and should be a lock I would think for callup. I don't think he will get a lot of work but keep in mind that AAA will be over by the time he is called up., 68596=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC.

I say Bernadina, Marrero and Lombo. 3rd catcher of Pudge/Flores.Stammen, Mock, Milone for pitchers with Martis as a long shot. August 8, 2011 3:41 PM _____________________________I agree with your position players and I think Martis has been one of the hottest pitchers between AA and AAA in the last month. Just seems outside of Milone that the pitcher names are just retreads. Stammen, Mock, Martin, etc., 1840=NATIONALS at CUBS Where: Wrigley Field Gametime: 8:05 p.m. TV: MASN Radio: WJFK (106.7 FM), WFED (1500 AM), XM 187 Weather: Mostly cloudy, 77 degrees, Wind 7 mph in from CF}",
