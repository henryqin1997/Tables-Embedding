    "textBeforeTable": "WILSON'S STATISTICS Wilson saved a game for John Lackey in Oakland, blocking a pitch in the dirt that would have given the A's the winning run. He also excelled behind the plate in a late-game role in Boston in mid-September. Wilson is 1-for-5, a double, with a sacrifice in six at-bats. His catcher's ERA of 3.00, in a relatively small sample, is even better than those of Mathis (3.99) and Napoli (4.86). Wilson, who maintained contact with Adenhart's family, is familiar with the Angels' pitchers, having caught them in Spring Training and also for 24 innings in three separate stints this season. \"If I imagined how Nick would have left his locker, that's how it would have looked,\" Wilson said. \"That was one of the first things I noticed. It's nice to see the guys are keeping his legacy going. It means a lot to his family that the guys keep it going.\" Adenhart's locker has been maintained as it was when he departed late on the night of April 8. \"Whether it's Nick saying, `Check me out' or whatever, it definitely helps to go out there,\" Wilson said. Wilson then paid a private tribute to the wall in center field, where Adenhart's image, throwing a pitch, is etched. Wilson would revisit it on the night the Angels clinched",
    "textAfterTable": "\"If you don't like Bobby Wilson,\" Lackey said, \"there's something wrong with you. He's a great guy.\" With Wilson available to replace Mathis, Napoli can be withheld for late-game pinch-hitting opportunities. \"Bobby's come a long way,\" Scioscia said of the Dunedin, Fla., native who played at Seminole High School with former Angels first baseman Casey Kotchman. \"He's a terrific receiver -- good hands, good mind back there, strong, accurate arm that can control a running game. \"He's worked very hard to turn himself into a Major League catcher. I wouldn't hesitate to use him.\" Wilson was drafted in the 48th round of the 2002 First-Year Player Draft and signed by Tom Kotchman, Casey's dad. Not many players taken that late make it to the big leagues. Here clearly is a committed athlete, forging on in the memory of a best buddy. Lyle Spencer is a reporter for MLB.com.
