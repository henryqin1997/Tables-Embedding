            "i would say that campus is pretty safe, although i have heard of some things happening around here. the campus police will escort you back to your dorm or your car if it's later at night. there are these blue emergency posts throughout campus as well that you can press the button if there is an emergency. the campus police also patrol campus later at night. i have never had an issue with safety before, but it has not been unheard of. i have actually heard before that this is one of the safer campuses compared to a lot of other schools.",
            "greek life isn't that big here, but it does exist! plenty of people get involved, but there are not official houses and there are not a lot of parties all the time. most of the time you will here about the greeks from seeing them out during u hour holding some kind of event for fundraising or awareness of something. the people involved in greek life are very involved on campus.",
            "there are so many things to do with clubs! there are so many to choose from in the first place, from your major's club to the pride club to the sports clubs to the leadership clubs to the christian club to the rose float. it's hard to not get overwhelmed with all the choices. each of the clubs will hold events during the u hour and many do off campus activities that are really fun! it's hard to not get involved here!",
            "anyone who isn't real big on greek life or a big partier (it's very small here), and anyone who wants to study engineering, architecture or animal science. this school has so many opportunities to get involved within your major! and coming from a pre-vet major, the classes offered are really good and you get so much hands on experience! hence cal poly's motto, learn by doing. if you are a student who really wants to focus more of school and your future, this is really a great school.",
            "the rose float is a huge part of cal poly's traditions. every year students build a float for the rose parade, and most of the time they receive awards for it (1st place, people's favorite, etc)! there is also the kellogg arabian horse stables on campus. yes, the horses actually live on campus, and they are bred and shown in various horse shows. also, the rose garden and the japanese garden on campus are big places to go and study or hang out. there is a lot of interesting things that kellogg did here on campus.",
            "things are expensive on campus(food especially). parking passes are also really expensive. they don't offer all the classes at the same time, which makes it difficult to graduate in time if you don't take a class in time. compared to slo and other csu's and uc's though, it isn't that expensive. the school does offer you aid if you have applied for financial aid (fafsa). i do believe that i am getting a good education and that most of the professors here are quality, but it still is expensive to attend here (but what school isn't anymore?). you get a lot of hands on experience in class (they offer plenty of labs, but seem to offer a lot less lectures), and it is really helpful when you are applying for jobs and internships to have that experience already. this school is still affordable despite the rising costs.",
            "there isn't a lot to actually do around campus. they have events on campus such as plays, and clubs will hold various events throughout the week too. for people who live on campus, the housing staff puts on different kinds of events to help with stress or just to get out of your room and meet some of the other people in the building. they have an art walk every so often in downtown pomona, and there is plenty of shopping in walnut, west covina, and san dimas. you are 30 minutes or so from disneyland (i would recommend a season pass!), and you are about an hour (maybe less) from magic mountain. hollywood and la are not too far either. there are buses that have routes to places like walnut and west covina, but having a car or knowing someone with a car makes it much easier to get off campus.",
            "i have heard that the food at the dining commons is pretty good, but i haven't eaten there often enough to say how good or bad it may be. there are plenty of other places on campus to eat (panda express, taco bell, round table, sushi, subway, starbucks, denny's and a few campus markets). there is also the farm store across from the campus that has really good food! it is pricey if you don't live on campus though.",
            "the dorms are really fun, especially if you are a more outgoing person. the dorms are pretty old and outdated though. most people living in the dorms are friendly, and every keeps their doors open for people to stop by and just hang out. in the suites though, it's a little more anti-social, but you do have a much better living space! you have a small kitchenette and a bathroom that you share with only one roommate. the kitchen is very nice, especially if you like to cook instead of always eating somewhere on campus. there are study rooms in both the dorm buildings and the suites. laundry is also $1.75 per load (wash & dry).",
            "i would say that the classes offered here can be very difficult. that is, if the subject matter is new to you, you aren't interested in the subject, or you have a very difficult professor (thick accent, doesn't curve the grades, etc). i really enjoy most of my classes, but it is a lot of extra work you have to put in (some say 2-3 hours for every 1 hour you're in class). most people do not graduate in 4 years, but rather 5-7. it's difficult (but not impossible) to take 18+ units every quarter. the quarter system is great. i love having only 10 weeks of classes at a time (3 quarters in each year), although it goes by very fast and you can't slack off.",
            "try to know what you want to major in! you can become part of the 4 year pledge that guarantees that you will graduate in 4 years. i would recommend living on campus your first year as well, and also try to get involved in at least one club (even if it's just the one from your major). also, use the resources they offer here! most are free, and can be very helpful when you're struggling with a subject or you need help practicing for a job interview.",
            "the campus is beautiful and there are so many helpful students and staff (and plus all of the student programs they offer!). there are plenty of ways to get involved on campus through clubs or greek life or even a job on campus. the academics are a little harder (i'm a pre-vet major), but i can honestly say that i look forward to every class that i get to take here!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{178558=I am an African American, and being here made me realize that I am really one of less than 1000 Black students attending this school. It was a major culture shock to see no one in my class look like me, and it is still something I am not used to yet. My advice for other Black students would be to find other black students on campus. Everyone is in the same situation you are in so you don't have to feel alone. Don't only hang out with your specific race, but make sure you can count on them to understand how you're feeling., 322749=Dorm doesn't cost as much as other universities. Can even live in a single dorm for 12000 bucks a year. Also there are buses and shuttles if you don't have a car. And there is many places to see and love., 174124=If you commute, it's roughly $2000 per quarter, and if you dorm, roughly $5000. That's really good, considering that there are so many other schools that are much more expensive, but have the same quality of education. Cal Poly churns out brilliant students and many of them do get hired in their industry because this school has so many great programs. So a top-notch quality education, with a high guarantee for being hired because of the great programs, at only $2000-5000? Why not?, 826105=In comparison to UCs and Out of State Schools the Cal-State Tuition is Very well priced. I'm a commuter, so I don't pay for rent or dorms making my tuition especially low. I think I pay right around $2000 a quarter for Tuition, which comes out to about $6000 a year if you don't do Summer Session. Summer classes tend to be Very expensive because the government doesn't fund us well for Summer Classes. Books are reasonable, if you rent. Rent from anyone, Amazon, Chegg you name it. It's always cheaper than the on campus Book Store. Personally I'm not a believer in the big-name college. So just in general, I'd like to think I'm getting the same education that my friends that are going to UC's are, but at a cheaper price. Also CPP is California PolyTECHnic University at Pomona, which means we're all about hands-on education. For example, as a Hospitality Major one of my classes is working at the on campus restaurant or hotel for a quarter. I'm also required to have 800+ hours of Professional Work Experience in order to get my degree. Cal Poly also hosts job fairs, their own Career Center and an online job board to help you with your resume or set you up with different job opportunities. So if you look at it that way, I think we're just as good as any UC. It's also not about What school you go to it's about what you Do there... That's the big idea., 135358=Though Pomona isn't the safest city in the area ironically I feel really safe on campus. Taking a night class for the first time and getting out between 9:00-9:30 pm I was shocked to see how many students were still on campus. The great thing about having classes after 5:30 pm is that students are able to park in the faculty parking lots which is much closer to the classrooms making it much safer for the students., 702814=Poly Nights, clubs, campus sports, game rooms and looking forward to the 3 level recreation center which will be completed in 2014. Also the Rose Bowl Float is a big event on campus., 665296=Tuition has been steadily rising since I have been enrolled in Cal Poly Pomona and my friend, a junior, has told me that the total tuition for one quarter used to be less than $1000 when he was a freshman...whereas now it is over $2000. Lots of services are included in tuition fees, such as access to the wellness center, but most students don't take advantage of such services anyway. The only consolation for blowing away all of one's money on expensive textbooks, tuition, parking permits, etc. is that the money is going into a college degree., 884390=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 84694=It really is money efficient, tuition is about 2200 for a full time quarter but you take as many classes as you want to (within limits of 20 credits). So you can get done fast and efficiently., 760121=The Bronco Student Center is meant for students to relax and enjoy in between class. This is where our gym is located along with our games room and study rooms as well. There is also about 4 different food places. Opening in Fall 2014 we will have a recreational center that will several other things to do for fun on campus.}",

Also Cal Poly is very affordable at a tuition cost of around $4000 a year. Tips for prospective students Get involved with student organizations and clubs, they will make your college experience full and enjoyable with over 300 clubs, you can find one that suits you, if you cannot find one that is right for you, there is an option of creating it yourself. The dorms are pricey, cramped and old; it maybe better if you were to rent a house nearby with a group of friends or only dorm the first year. EOP is a great program, if you are low income, just read the requirements and check a box when you are applying it gives you some grant money each year, and opens up more a lot",
