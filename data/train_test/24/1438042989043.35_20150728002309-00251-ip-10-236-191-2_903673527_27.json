            "Ponding--on your birthday (or half-birthday, depending on the time of year) your friends are bound to toss you into St. John's Pond to celebrate.",
            "The river is a great source of fun on campus--all students have access to kayaks, sail boats, paddle boards, and windsurfers as well as the college's private beach. There is a general cook out culture on the weekends. The school also does a great job bringing comedians and concerts to campus and providing regular transportation to DC, Baltimore, and even NYC for concerts, plays, guest lecturers, and shopping.",
            "The food at St. Mary's is fantastic, and provides a ton of variety. The Great Room is particularly kind to students with dietary restrictions--they cater to students with severe allergies, those who are gluten free, and there are always tons of vegan/vegetarian options.",
            "A combination of the lack of Greek Life and a population of about 2000 students combine to create a uniquely friendly atmosphere on campus. The dorm options are varied (traditional residence halls, suites, and townhouses), but they all share one thing in common--everyone's doors are always open. People are always popping by, introducing each other, and building relationships that transcend the usual barriers like athletics, majors, and extracurricular interests.",
            "SMCM professors are all notable members of their particular field--it always catches me off guard how well published my professors are. They chose to work way down in southern Maryland because they are passionate about teaching. The small class lend themselves to interesting and productive conversations, but they also mean students can't hide. It is always abundantly clear who is and is not prepared for class, so it's important to develop good study habits early.",
            "Come visit--other reviews haven't exaggerated the beauty and uniqueness of this nearly 175 year old campus nestled on the banks of the St. Mary's river. Take advantage of the Admission's Office's offer of an interview, tour, and dinner with a faculty member. By meeting actual members of the community you'll discover how passionate and enthusiastic everyone actually is about what they do and, more importantly, where they do it",
            "St. Mary's College of Maryland takes its status as the state of Maryland's Public Honors College very seriously. The students, staff, and faculty work together to build a living-learning community that encourages broadening our horizons, working hard, and living well. We are united by our love of the campus, our respect for each other, and our enthusiasm for whatever we happen to be passionate about."

Ponding is where your friends take you, on your birthday, and throw you into the large pond on campus. You're not a true student if you haven't been ponded. May Day, well, you'll have to come here to find out what it is, but I assure you it is worth it., 32250=So many clubs so many clubs. Join one or make one. We're on the water, so kayaking is always available late spring and early/late summer and (september-october until it gets cold). Windsurfing also there, sailing is a Must. And just swimming around in the water itself is perfect on a hot sunny day. The outdoor adventure club has outings practically every week with good weather of course. We've been to places like Snowshoe mountain (for skiing), White water rafting, cave and mountain hiking and the list goes on. the fee for all of this is mostly always under $200.00 and normally the prices drop significantly the more people go. for the hiking trips it's under $50.00 Don't have alot of homework for the weekend? go to cole cinema, go see a free movie showing. Want a laugh? a comedian always comes like every weekend down to St. Mary's. go with some friends. Don't like the latter? Parties are always on campus and off campus. It's not hard to find at all. Mostly for on-campus, go to WC. Since the newly installed Pub, yes Pub. If you and your friends want a late night snack or just to hang out on weekends, go there and get some awesome nachos., 177069=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 132507=A combination of the lack of Greek Life and a population of about 2000 students combine to create a uniquely friendly atmosphere on campus.

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students SMCM has a reputation as a school for weird kids, but it's increasingly becoming a school that has something for everyone. Lacrosse, rugby, frisbee, and partying are all definitely rising in popularity, but at the same time clubs such as fencing and Safe House-- which sponsors weekly nerf wars!-- and events like Humans vs Zombies definitely keep it weird. If you want to fit in you'll quickly find others like you, and therefore I would say that SMCM is for any students hoping to succeed and have fun who has the dedication to find like-minded students. Tips for prospective students Definitely come on a visit to campus if you can find the time, but don't let your impression of campus be all that makes your decision. Try to visit South Campus and the boat house at all possible-- that's where you'll realize how truly beautiful it is. When you're applying, creativity is hugely rewarded-- students have been known to be accepted who have terrible grades but killer essays, and thinking outside the box will get you noticed. Bang for the buck St. Mary's is one of the more expensive public schools, but it's also an entire school-wide honors program. Out-of-state tuition may be a bit much, but I can't",
