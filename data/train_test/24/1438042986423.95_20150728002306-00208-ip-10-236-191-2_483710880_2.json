The chart below uses 2010 data and shows the percentage of pitches thrown to each corner: I am fascinated by pitches on the corners. Commanding pitches to the corners, especially the outside corner, can make it very difficult on a hitter (as Max Marchi showed us in 2009). I\u2019m defining \u201ccorner\u201d to be greater than 0.7 feet from the center of the plate and equal to or less than one foot from the center of the plate (the rulebook edge of the strikezone is 0.83 feet from the center of the plate).

How about the inside corner against righties?",
