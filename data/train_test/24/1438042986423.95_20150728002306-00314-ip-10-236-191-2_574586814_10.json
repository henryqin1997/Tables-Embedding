            "There is a manga that I read forever ago that I am having a hard time remember what it was. I cant remember much about it but I do remember there was a part in it where the main character was in some sort of game or contest thing where he had to get a certain number of rings to pass. He got enough but gave them to another character so they could pass too. So in order to get more he played this game where the man hosting the game brought him to a room full of stuff and told him there where three of the rings he needed hidden somewhere in the room. But it was a trick because no one had found any yet. The main character guy stops the man before shutting the door, and tells him that the rings are actually in the doorknob and he wins all three rings. I know this isn't the greatest thing to go off of but if anyone knows what manga its from I would really be grateful. Also it's probably a manga about games, mystery or psychological themes. I know the main character is a guy that wins these games by outsmarting other people.",
