The 18-year-old signed a professional contract at Arsenal in August 2010 and spent the majority of last season on loan at League 1 promotion chasers Huddersfield Town. Afobe impressed sufficiently for the Terriers to extend the initial month loan deal until the end of the season. The pacey forward impressed playing wide in a three upfront system scoring 8 goals in 21 starts in all competitions. In total Afobe played 36 games for Huddersfield before returning to Arsenal this season where he has featured only for the youth and reserve teams there. With the Hornets looking to boost their attacking options, particularly with some pace, we feel with the help of other sources, this deal could be one to keep an eye on as the window draws to a close. Along with Hornets, other good clubs are also rumoured to be in for the Arsenal paceman. To find out if this or other deals happen over the closing stages of January stay tuned in to Vital Watford or follow us on twitter @VitalWatford, 15716=Date:Sunday January 29 2012, 15671=Time: 1:53PM, 10467=Done Deal: Berghuis Becomes Tenth Summer Additon (Monday July 27 2015), 9451=The Supporters Summit - Watford (Wednesday July 8 2015)}",
