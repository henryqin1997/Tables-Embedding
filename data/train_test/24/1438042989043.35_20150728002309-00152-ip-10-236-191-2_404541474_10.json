Also, as far as higher ISO differences between the two resolutions, I know people say M size is better, but when I resize both M and L size to 1600 x 1200 I cant see a difference, even at ISO 3200- they look almost exactly alike, it's just that L size seems to retain highlights better than M size for some reason (at DR 400). NR should be set to Low and Sharpening to Soft., 6601=Basically I did L size DR 400 ISO 3200 vs M size DR 400 ISO 3200 NR Low Sharpening Soft and found that L size DR 400 held highlights better and there was virtually no noise difference when both were resized to 1600 x 1200 (which matches the dot pitch of 7.5 x 10 prints.)}",
