The deformed red blood cells prevented adequate drug delivery to tumor cells, Cohen, Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol., 5, pp. 175-179 (1981)., 42273=Rats fed a calcium-oxalate lithogenic diet including sodium pyruvate were reported to develop fewer urinary calculi (stones) than control rats not given sodium pyruvate, Ogawa et al., Hinyokika Kiyo, 32, pp. 1341-1347 (1986)., 46019=The addition of sodium pyruvate to bacterial and yeast systems has been reported to inhibit hydrogen peroxide production, enhance growth, and protect the systems against the toxicity of reactive oxygen intermediates. The unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids contained within chicken fat enhanced membrane repair and reduced cytotoxicity. The antioxidants glutathione and thioglycollate reduced the injury induced by oxygen radical species, Martin, Ph.D. thesis, (1987-89)., 140086=Boiled candy lozenges may also be prepared from non-fermentable sugars such as sorbitol, mannitol, and hydrogenated corn syrup. Typical hydrogenated corn syrups are Lycasin, a commercially available product manufactured by Roquette Corporation, and Hystar, a commercially available product manufactured by Lonza, Inc. The candy lozenges may contain up to about 95% sorbitol, a mixture of sorbitol and mannitol in a ratio from about 9.5:0.5 up to about 7.5:2.5, and hydrogenated corn syrup up to about 55%, by weight of the solid syrup component., 115307=In another form of the invention, the therapeutic wound healing composition is incorporated into a non-oral topical vehicle which may be in the form of a cream, gel, foam, ointment, spray, and the like. Typical non-toxic non-oral topical vehicles known in the pharmaceutical arts may be used in the present invention. The preferred non-oral topical vehicles are water and pharmaceutically acceptable water-miscible organic solvents such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, glycerin, and the like, and mixtures of these solvents. Water-alcohol mixtures are particularly preferred and are generally employed in a weight ratio from about 1:1 to about 20:1, preferably from about 3:1 to about 20:1, and most preferably from about 3:1 to about 10:1, respectively., 30807=This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/053,922 filed Apr. 26, 1993; which was a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 07/663,500 filed Mar. 1, 1991, both now abandoned., 120325=In another form of the invention, the therapeutic wound healing composition is incorporated into an oral topical vehicle which may be in the form of a mouthwash, rinse, oral spray, suspension, dental gel, and the like. Typical non-toxic oral vehicles known in the pharmaceutical arts may be used in the present invention. The preferred oral vehicles are water, ethanol, and water-ethanol mixtures. The water-ethanol mixtures are generally employed in a weight ratio from about 1:1 to about 20:1, preferably from about 3:1 to about 20:1, and most preferably from about 3:1 to about 10:1, respectively. The pH value of the oral vehicle is generally from about 4 to about 7, and preferably from about 5 to about 6.5. An oral topical vehicle having a pH value below about 4 is generally irritating to the oral cavity and an oral vehicle having a pH value greater than about 7 generally results in an unpleasant mouth feel., 38345=U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,166, issued to Veech, discloses an electrolyte solution which comprises a mixture of L-lactate and pyruvate in a ratio from 20:1 to 1:1, respectively, or a mixture of D-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, in a ratio from 6:1 to 0.5:1, respectively., 36485=U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,920,835, 3,984,556, and 3,988,470, all issued to Van Scott et al., disclose methods for treating ache, dandruff, and palmar keratosis, respectively, which consist of applying to the affected area a topical composition comprising from about 1% to about 20% of a lower aliphatic compound containing from two to six carbon atoms selected from the group consisting of Alpha-hydroxyacids, Alpha-ketoacids and esters thereof, and 3-hydroxybutryic acid in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The aliphatic compounds include pyruvic acid and lactic acid., 40598=Primary cultures of heterotopic tracheal transplant exposed in vivo to 7, 12-dimethyl-benz(a)anthracene were reported to be successfully maintained in enrichment medium supplemented with sodium pyruvate along with cultures of interleukin-2 stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes, and plasmacytomas and hybridomas, pig embryos, and human blastocysts, Shacter, J. Immunol. Methods, 99, pp. 259-270 (1987), Marchok et al., Cancer Res., 37, pp. 1811-1821 (1977), Davis, J. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl., 33, pp. 115-124 (1985), Okamoto et al., No To Shinkei, 38, pp. 593-598 (1986), Cohen et al., J. In Vitro Fert. Embryo Transfer, 2, pp. 59-64 (1985)., 151816=Chewable therapeutic candy is prepared by procedures similar to those used to make soft confectionery. In a typical procedure, a boiled sugar-corn syrup blend is formed to which is added a frappe mixture. The boiled sugar-corn syrup blend may be prepared from sugar and corn syrup blended in parts by weight ratio of about 90:10 to about 10:90. The sugar-corn syrup blend is heated to temperatures above about 120\ufffd C. to remove water and to form a molten mass. The frappe is generally prepared from gelatin, egg albumin, milk proteins such as casein, and vegetable proteins such as soy protein, and the like, which is added to a gelatin solution and rapidly mixed at ambient temperature to form an aerated sponge like mass. The frappe is then added to the molten candy mass and mixed until homogeneous at temperatures between about 65\ufffd C. and about 120\ufffd C.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes In summary, these studies show that there are several components necessary to prepare an effective formulation to enhance wound healing: (1) enhance the activity of the epithelial cells within the outer layer of the skin so that re-epithelialization occurs at a rapid and efficient manner; (2) stimulate the activity of the inflammatory and immune cells that come into the lower part of the skin, the dermis, in the early portion of the wound healing process; (3) prepare a stable formulation that is compatible with the Betafectin\u2122 and the wound healing composition combination with live yeast cell derivative. The mice that were infected with S. aureus and not treated with any agents were sacrificed at day 3, since the infection was not treated with antibiotics and remained purelent. The histology of tissue isolated from wounds that were treated with formulations of Betafectin\u2122, Preparation H\u2122, and wound healing composition or neosporin and wound healing composition, did not appear to differ with any of the treatments except for the presence of polymorphonuclear cells within the dermis, where in normal uninfected tissue, the predominant cell type was monocytes and lymphocytes. The combination of Betafectin\u2122 and Preparation H\u2122 wound healing composition stimulated both an increase in wound healing within the lower portion of the wound, within the dermal layer, as well as stimulated the re-epithelialization of the outer layer of the wound. These two activities resulted in a rapidly healed",
