KAREN W. | 03/23/2015 Read Full Review Loved it !! Beautiful condo facing the gulf. It was VERY clean and had nice towels. The decor is a bit old fashioned and flea market but we weren't there for the decor. Two plastic chairs on small balcony with 2 small tables. Couldnt really fit more than 2 people on balcony.The bed is SUPER high and I needed a stool to get on it..lol. All",
