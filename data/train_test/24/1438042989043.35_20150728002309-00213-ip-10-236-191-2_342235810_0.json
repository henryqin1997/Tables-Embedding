Large hotel/apartments squeezed into a relatively small area giving relatively little room for general amenity space. The pool is uninviting and the dining area functional and stuffy. Breakfast quite good but done to budget in that fruit juice is invariably water melon. Water melon invariably makes up the most of the fresh fruit. Cornflakes is the only cereal with, if you're lucky, some muesli mixed in. Eggs are given special attention and are good. Indian breakfast varies but is sometimes very good. The main Railway line runs close by with frequent trains which, like the rest of mobile India, in obsessed with sounding their horn! Annoying at night. Passing traffic often hoots to say hello to the guard etc. Getting attention to necessary repairs took some doing involving the proprietor! The apartment we had was scruffy with shabby furniture and tiles missing off bathroom walls; it looked as though it was being refurbished but not yet complete! However the staff are very pleasant and try to be helpful. Not sure I'd go back though., 98196=February 12, 2015, 94429=February 18, 2015, 76968=May 2, 2015, 84677=March 21, 2015, 73252=June 8, 2015, 90289=February 27, 2015, 86558=March 13, 2015, 71425=July 14, 2015, 82846=April 7, 2015, 79019=April 30, 2015, 80865=April 9, 2015}",
