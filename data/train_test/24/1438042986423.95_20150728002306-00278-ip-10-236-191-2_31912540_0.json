It had been a paid event, but there was no such event in 2008 as the 2007 event was not well enough attended. In 2009, we decided to try something different, and make the event free! Naturally, interest was high, and at the conference (held at Microsoft\u2019s Victoria Street offices) we had over 100 delegates each day, and had to wait-list another 100+. Because of the fantastic interest, and the general good reception to the first event, we have decided to hold a second conference in October, offering first choice to those wait-listed at the March event.}",

The conference is free, but of course the cost of accommodation and meals, outside of the lunch and coffees provided during the event, are the delegate\u2019s responsibility. This applies to the presenters as well, we are not subsidised by Microsoft or anyone else (of course, if any corporation wishes to do so \u2026) , we bear our own costs. We like these events; we like the socialising and meeting Excel colleagues that we may know virtually but have not yet met in person, and of course, talking Excel over a beer in the evening is no bad thing. Conferences are great opportunities for like minded saddos like us to get together and talk about the things our partners just pretend to be interested in. Microsoft have very generously provided a room with all of the presentation facilities needed, and provide coffee and lunch on both days. This support from Microsoft is what makes it",
