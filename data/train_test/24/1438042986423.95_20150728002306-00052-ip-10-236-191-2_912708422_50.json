Login to rate or flag the reviews Christina from Pomona, CA 01/02/2012 Reviewer is A current student here. 2 out of 2 people found this review useful. 3 of 53 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Citrus is great for all types of students, for what they offer says it all. They offer free tutoring to help in the areas that need a little more support for more understanding. When having to ask questions there are no judging remarks. No questions are viewed as too dumb or not being smart enough. Filling out the admission paper work to go to school says to you that you want more in life, and to the faculty members to get ready for a future someone. Every class I take I often wonder who am I Sitting next to. I feel students should take every opportunity to learn who everyone is and be optimistic about life.",
