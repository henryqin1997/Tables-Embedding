            "Fruit vender is right in front of the school building. They and fresh, crunchy, and cheap!",
            "There are so many things to enjoy! You may find all kinds of clubs and events at Hunter. Outside? Hey, you are in the middle of the city and the Central Park is only three blocks away!!",
            "You can get pizza, fries, and Asian foods at the Cafeteria. However, It's too expensive with its moderate taste. If you are not that busy you might prefer to get out of school and go to a deli or restaurant around the school.",
            "Dorm is in Downtown so you need to travel by transportation like subways or buses. Since it is located in the city, the price is very high. No wonder why most of Hunter students live off cheaper boroughs like Bronx, Queens, or Brooklyn.",
            "Of course it depends on what you study. Nursing program along with Biology courses at Hunter are ridiculously steep. So students in the field are the hardest. But generally, the School has a good atmosphere for studying and you can find anyone doing assignment, discussing everywhere at school.",
            "Hunter recently got a great amount of donation and had renovated its library and computer labs. They are very well organized and convenient. Other than school facilities, you can easily access to great cafes and restaurants nearby school.",
            "Hunter College is placed in the center of Manhattan where the diverse ethnic groups around the world attend to. The school has cutting-edge facilities and most professors are very organized. I can't complain about the school overall!"

I have a GPA over 3.5 and I consider my education and courses taken at Hunter College to be very influential and inspiring., 256134=Come on, the cafeteria was actually closed in the 2012-2013 school year for rodent infestation., 276438=The professors are great and seem to thoroughly enjoy there work. The facilities are in a constant state of despair and the building itself is under major construction. Still the school has been standing since 1870 so a little mess here and there wont effect a student form enjoying their time., 228769=The club fair was Oct 24. The end of the semester is Dec 14. Get a clue. I spent my first two months lonely and with nothing to do., 464169=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 77094=This school is in the CUNY system so for students who live within NYC, tuition is only about $2700. This is a steal compared to other colleges and especially when Hunter is one of the top public schools in the country. Theres quality in getting a degree from Hunter at that price., 237605=Good for people who like the City life. Easy to get to, best for commuters though the nearest train is ALWAYS packed with people. Not to shabby for 2500 a semester.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students that do not mind traveling/commuting. Tips for prospective students Great location, subway is connected to Hunter. Bang for the buck $2,500 for one semester. Enough said. =) Am enjoying being here Before I came to Hunter, I heard many stories such as CUNY students don't make as much friends as people who dorm. This is false. I made many friends here at Hunter. As long someone wants to be active and make friends, college, dorming or not dorming, will turn out fine for him/her. Am learning a lot Even though I've only been at Hunter College for a semester, I feel that that most of the professors making learning about a subject interesting. However, there are a few classes (the classes with 200+ people) that makes the student feel disconnected from the professor. I think those classes are introduction to ___ classes, so after getting through those classes, it should be fine. Login to rate or flag the reviews Rebecca from",
