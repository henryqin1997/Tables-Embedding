Like all schools the work is diifficult but there are upperclass tutors and teachers available to assist in any problems you may have. I cannot wait to begin in September., 32911=One good thing is that there is this mandatory break time; it's from 12:30-1:50. It's called Common Hour and during this time there are no classes so you get to hang out with friends, meet with professors if you have questions regarding your paper, join clubs, study notes for next class, etc.}",

I am a dance major at the school and I love the experience that I am getting. Along with all the great people I meet, I am able to further my knowledge in something I love doing. The campus is also an ideal size for me as well as the location. If you're looking for a smaller campus with a homey feel then post is for you.
