Feel bad after the glowing review i had given back in June I think. I have moved on the the Castelli Volata Full-Zip Jersey - Short Sleeve and it is a much better fit, have worn it for about 10 rides over 60 miles and it fits really nice. sorry but I have to change my overall rating to two stars. I do wear it for shorter rides only now. I will still be a Castelli guy, I own at least 6 and this is the only one I have trouble with., 34804=One of the reviewer mentioned the terrible fit and he was spot on - I am 5.11 and usually M w/ US and M-L w/ EU brands, so I decided for the L. The jersey runs too small for the chest but baggy for the torso. The feel is awful - itchy hard plastic style. I would look over it wasn't it for the 175gr on my scale as opposed to the advertised 91gr - an almost 100% deviation. That's worse than my 1990 climber jerseys. A clear return.}",

This jersey is available in six sizes from Small to XXX-Large and in the colors White/red/black, Black/yellow fluo/white, and Ocean/white/black. Castelli rounded out this jersey with a full-length Vislon zipper. The Vislon zipper's small teeth have a smooth, low profile, and the easy-grip zipper pull lets you quickly maximize your temperature regulation. Three standard back pockets stow that energy bar and wind shell. The Lightweight Lycra trim rounds out the jersey's bottom half to keep it from riding up when you drop a gear to push for the summit.
