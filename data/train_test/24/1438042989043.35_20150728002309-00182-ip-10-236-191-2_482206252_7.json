In the currently preferred embodiments, the concentration of the solution, dispersion or suspension of the organic material, or the organic adduct resin formed by the reaction of the polymer and crosslinker, typically is in the range of from about 0.5 to about 20% by weight. Typically, a polymer:crosslinker ratio in the range of from about 1:1 to about 3:1 (weight percent) will form crosslinked networks which will non-leachably retain the biocide and preferentially transfer the biocide to the microorganism upon contact as described herein. Solutions of the biocidal material typically comprising from about 0.005 to about 0.5% by weight can be used to impregnate the matrix with biocide., 50196=In a currently preferred embodiment, the polymeric material is polyhexamethylene biguanide, (PHMB), the crosslinking agent is N,N-bismethylenediglycidylaniline (BMDGA), and the silver salt is a silver halide, most preferably, silver iodide. In this embodiment, the coating is made by combining a solution of polyhexamethylene biguanide with a solution of the crosslinking agent, and reacting the mixture under conditions sufficient to form a non-crosslinked PHMB-BMDGA adduct. The ratio of PHMB to BMDGA preferably is in the range of from about 1:1 to 3:1 by weight. The PHMB-BMDGA mixture is heated to about 95\ufffd C. for about 2 hours in a closed reactor to form the adduct. The concentration of the resulting adduct resin preferably is in the range of from about 0.5 to about 20% by weight. The adduct resin solution is coated onto the desired substrate, and heated to a temperature sufficient to induce crosslinking between the adducts, thereby forming a crosslinked network or matrix. Temperatures sufficient for crosslinking typically are in the range of from about 70\ufffd C. to about 200\ufffd C. The resulting crosslinked network is then saturated with silver by immersing the coating for about two minutes in a silver iodide/potassium iodide solution. Silver solutions having a concentration of from about 0.005 to about 0.5% can be used for this step. The silver iodide forms reservoirs in the matrix, and becomes attached to the tentacles. Silver iodide has sufficient affinity for the PHMB polymer that it forms an insoluble complex that will not leach into ambient solutions or other materials in contact with the material, even at elevated temperatures. However, when a microorganism contacts the coating, the tentacles disrupt the microorganism's lipid bilayer membrane, thereby introducing the silver iodide into the microorganism. Silver iodide has greater affinity for certain proteins within the microorganism than for the PHMB-BMDGA matrix, and forms complexes with these proteins, that is, the silver is preferentially transferred from the coating to the microorganism. The silver accumulates to toxic levels in the microorganism and kills it. The silver iodide reservoirs within the matrix replenish the silver iodide on the tentacles lost to the microorganism by reestablishing the equilibrium for formation of the complex (AgI+PHMB\u20e1 PHMBAgI!)., 72815=The coating acts upon contact with the micro-organism, first intercalating into the cell membrane and second transferring the bio-toxic agent directly to the contacting organism. The following time to kill experiment was performed on polyethylene tubes with various diameters coated with the PHMB-BMDGA-silver coating described in Example 1. Coatings were applied as described in Example 2 for the contact lens cases. The tubes were inoculated with predetermined volumes of initial concentrations of up to 109 cfui/mL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC#9027) in PBS and incubated at 30\ufffd C. for 20 hours. At various time points tubes were sampled and the micro-organism was plated and counted. The treated tubes demonstrated significant antibacterial activity even when volume to surface ratios (S/V) exceeded 4:1. The results are shown in FIG. 3., 78568=Candida albicans (ATCC#1023 1)-105 cfu/mL in 168 hours, 64393=(b) 330 mL of the 20% PHMB. This solution was combined with 100 nl of a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution containing 66 grams of NaOH, 66 ml of water and 34 ml of ethanol. This mixture was added to a solution containing 40 grams of BMGDA, 120 ml of acetonitrile and 280 ml of ethanol. The resulting solution was heated at 95\ufffd C. for 2 hours forming the PHMB-BMDGA adduct. The solution was cooled and filtered as described above. The resulting adduct solution contained 10% by weight of PHMB:BMDGA adduct having a PHMB:BMDGA ratio of 1.5:1., 63766=(a) 312 mL of the 20% PHMB solution in ethanol was further diluted with 600 ml of ethanol. This solution was added to a solution of N,N-bismethylene diglycidylaniline) (BMDGA) (Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wis.) containing 37.60 grams of BMDGA dissolved in 119.9 ml of acetonitrile and 280.1 ml of ethanol. The resulting mixture was heated at 95\ufffd C. in a closed reactor for two hours, forming a PHMB-BMDGA adduct. The adduct solution was cooled and filtered (Scientific Grade 417 filter). The resulting adduct solution contained 10% by weight of PHMB:BMDGA adduct having a PHMB:BMDGA ratio of 1.5:1., 14465=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Those skilled in the art will be able to ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents of the specific embodiments of the invention described herein. These and all other equivalents are intended to be encompassed by the following claims. Equivalents Untreated and treated (as described in Example 2) surfaces were challenged with 106 cfu/mL of methicillin and neomycin resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC#33592). The micro-organism was suspended in phosphate buffered saline and were allowed to remain in contact with the surfaces. Within 20 hours, treated surfaces had no viable organisms, whereas the number of viable organisms on untreated surfaces remained unchanged. Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Example 12 The tubes were then washed and refilled with water. Eight days later, the untreated tubes still yielded 105 cfu/mL (resulting from the bio-film established during the first day of incubation) while the treated tubes yielded no micro-organisms. To determine efficacy against bio-film formation, polyurethane tubes coated as described in Example 2 and untreated tubes were challenged with a mixture of the following micro-organisms, incubated in a 1% synthetic growth medium at room temperature.: Pseudomonas Diminuta (ATCC#19146), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (ATCC#9027), Klebsiella Pneumoniae (ATCC#13 883), Bacillus cereus (ATCC#11778), Escherichia Coli (ATCC#8739), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC#6538). Within 24 hours, the micro-organisms in untreated tubes had grown from an initial concentration of 104 cfu/mL to an average of 3\ufffd105 cfu/mL. The treated tubes had no viable micro-organisms.
