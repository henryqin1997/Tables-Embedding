            "There is a Jamba Juice right in the middle of all the action at CLU. There is also The Caf, where you pay a certain fee and then eat however much you want. You can also order certain things with a touch screen when you don't see anything that you really want that is already made. If you are in the mood for a little bit better food, there is always The Centrum, which has a much more limited menu, but the food is better quality. And there's this really cool drink dispenser that has a whole bunch of different flavors of drinks like Coke and Powerade. If you're in a real rush, you can always grab a quick bite at the SUB or Mogan Market, which offer premade food items, such as sandwiches and salads.",
            "I am a commuter, but I often hang out in the dorms with friends who do live in them. There are rules about when there are quiet hours and those sorts of things, but other than the basic rules, it's pretty relaxed. And it's co-ed.",
            "Like any college, CLU of course has challenging courses. It all depends on how much time and effort you as a student put into your education. Hard work and studying really does pay off, and the professors can tell who works hard. They take this into consideration when giving final grades.",
            "The campus isn't very big, but there is a lot going on. Be sure to look around everywhere- where the flagpole is, lots of events take place and there are also lots of posters taped to the ground showing upcoming events as well.",
            "The student population is very diverse, and everyone is very accepting of one another. Class sizes are small, and for the most part the teachers are very kind and caring. Each student also is aided by a mentor that they are assigned their freshman year."

Professors here really care about your education and will get to know you on a personal level if you are willing. I have some of my professors numbers that are in my major and allow me to contact them if need be. The size of the classes are small with a ratio of about 17:1 (17 students to 1 professor)., 89404=there are many traditions that are unusual here, but one i think is the greatest is the undie run. mid to late october, everyone strips to their undies, gives the clothes they had on to charity, and then goes on a run around campus. it's all about the charity! there's a lot of cool locations that are around the campus, you just have to find them!, 172126=As of right now, our cafeteria is very sub-par. However, we do have a cafe called the Centrum, which is very convenient because you can get all kinds of food to go. We are in the process of building a new dining commons which is going to be VERY nice! It will be finished in 2015., 51305=Set in sunny Southern California where it is close to Malibu Beach, Six Flags, and Disneyland, as well as Downtown Hollywood. The student:professor ratio is generally 20:1 so the professors can offer one on one help and get to know the students' personalities and learning styles. Has extremely competitive Chemistry, Biology, and Communications programs with opportunities for internships at local hospitals and media companies in Hollywood., 162552=The food and dining is okay right now, however, in 2014 a new dinning commons is coming and it will all be updates and better., 52417=There is a cafe called the Centrum that does breakfast specialties, and provides salads, sandwiches, pizzas, and hamburgers for lunch and dinner. As of September 2014, there will be a brand new Cafeteria on campus with all kinds of food, and a coffee shop., 220302=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 126389=The dining options the school has now aren't horrible, but it does get redundant throughout the year. Cal Lu offers a traditional dining hall, Centrum (cafe style), Jamba Juice, Mogen Market (open 5pm-12am), and a small kiosk. Cal Lu is currently starting to rebuild a new two floor dining hall that is scheduled to be finished after summer 2014., 18155=California Lutheran can be expensive, but they are willing to help you. With numerous donors and out side sources I believe its over 85% of students that get some sort of financial aid. CLU already provides $19 million a year in financial aid to students, but in 2009-2010 it plans to increase the amount of scholarship money available to current students to help them meet educational expenses during the recession. source: http://www.callutheran.edu/news/news_detail.php?story_id=5453}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Somewhat conservative but creative! No drinking on campus by anyone, so don't come if you like to party with alcohol!! Great school for kids who like to travel abroad and who like mingling with their professors. Lots of just normal kids who are not there just to get ahead. Great school if you don't want to feel like a number! It has a very cohesive feel to it, like everyone enjoys being there. Tips for prospective students They like kids who are service-oriented (Boys Scouts, etc.) not just with high grades. Go to the interview, if you get invited, and share something great you have done to help your community. Bang for the buck I got a great scholarship and financial aid. They accommodated my parent's sudden loss of income with lots of help with finances! They go out of their way to help you afford the school. Am enjoying being here The staff and helpful upperclassmen were so helpful from day 1. They act like they want YOU on campus, not just your money!! They provide lots of support for freshman so they don't fail. You get a student and academic adviser to help you through the first year!",
