            "Greek life is pretty big here. I am in Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Greek life is a lot more than what the media makes it out to be: partying. It is an opportunity to increase your leadership skills as well as life skills that prepare you for the workforce and life after college.",
            "There are tons of clubs on campus. For example, I am a member of the Green Action Club. We have brought recycling to campus and work to make the campus more environmentally friendly. Other clubs include feminist club and the International Student Organization.",
            "Now that I am a senior, I am not as social as I used to be because I am more focused on my studies. But because the campus is small, it is a lot easier to go hangout with friends in their rooms. The ice rink has public skating sessions that are free to students (pay to rent skates, unless you have your own). It is also free to students to enter into all athletic events.",
            "After four years, I am not a big fan of Ritchie. The main entree has a cycle of a few weeks, and the other sections of the cafeteria stay the same the whole time. I wish there were MORE food options.",
            "This is college. People party. But don't feel like it is a requirement. There are roughly 1700 students here, and probably 500 or less actually party. Don't think that you need to get drunk all the time. The dorms are nice, but the apartments and theme houses are better. The dorms are really great freshman year for helping you get to know your classmates.",
            "Adrian College is definitely not the hardest college in the nation, but it is mentally challenging and pushes you to strive for excellence. After your general requirements, you can take more generalized classes for you career. Mind you, these classes are designed to make you not only intelligent, but intellectual as well. If you are not meant for something, these classes will let you know. I wanted to be a biochemist; I applied myself as hard as I could, but I was not cut out for it, so I was able to drop the major before getting to far into it.",
            "The tuition DOES increase every year, and it is NOT cheap. Adrian offers financial aid, but make sure that you participate in Campus Employment in order to apply some of your earnings to your tuition.",
            "Adrian college is a great liberal arts school where you are pushed to strive for excellence. It's mission statement includes five ribbons of excellence which cover the different aspects of learning in college it expects every student to cover. These ribbons are crucial abilities and aspects of intelligence and personality that every college graduate should have."

Each residence building requires entry via key or key card, and each dorm room has an individual lock. Campus Safety officers are trained intensively and are overseen by former police deputies and current reserve police officers. Their are also resident assistants in each hall to promote a safe environment.

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Athletes Hockey Players People who like cliques People who like UGG boots. Tips for prospective students Stay the night before you come here, and request a Freshmen hall like Davis, or Stevens. Don't let them tell you that is not available, everyone has a futon you can crash on. You will get the real experience that way. Bang for the buck They give WONDERFUL scholarships, however don't expect much. The living situations are awful, and you can never live off campus unless you win the housing lottery your senior year. The dorms are awful, and hardly fit to live in. The classrooms are just as bad, no air conditioning, and the heat is shabby. The only nice buildings house sporting events...go figure. Am enjoying being here I love the Greek Life, if you come here at least check it out. Everyone in my sorority is wonderful. Everyone in Greek Life are really connected. For as athletic as the school is, school spirit is NON-EXISTENT. Am learning a lot In coming to Adrian College be prepared to share the classroom with those who are more interested in Competition",
