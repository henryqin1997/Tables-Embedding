            "Search for plenty of scholarships and grants, and be prepared for an in depth, broad learning experience.",
            "Quite expensive, but definitely worth it. It is a very respectable school, with a great reputation and wonderful education and career opportunities.",
            "There are a lot of clubs to join, things to do, and places to go. Cafes are restaurants are located on campus, as well as a theater, volleyball court and basketball court next to dorms, and even the gym where their big games take place. Students get discounts and sometimes even free tickets to these games. Great architecture and a lot of space. It's like a city inside a city.",
            "Professors are very dedicated, and will stay to help with any questions. Classes are very small, and I hear the work is challenging and keeps you interested."

However, these precautions ensure the safety of all students. Although students of the opposite gender cannot spend the night, they do not have to leave until 2:00 a.m., which is pretty reasonable. We also have a zero-tolerance policy during finals week where no student is allowed to have their door open or be in the hallways; this ensures that all students can focus hard. We do our best to make sure that the majority of students are pleased., 153836=Xavier football: undefeated since 1973 Xavier basketball: unstoppable since, ever. ADP (we will be legends! One day... I promise), 138942=Xavier is a great school that has wonderful opportunities for everyone. Classes are small with one-on-one attention and a 12:1 student to faculty ratio. With the most up to date technology, students are sure that they are get a solid education that is worth their money., 293956=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
