Once, I was leaving the library at about 8 o'clock at night after a serious study session and I expected to be freaked out when going outside after dark, but the campus felt really safe. The lights made everything brighter and feel ok. We also have these pillars scattered around the campus that have a button in the middle.

The school is one of the cheapest forms of higher education in the Chicago land area. Recently it was ranked amongst the highest schools with the less amount of graduates leaving without debt. Am enjoying being here Student life at NEIU is complicated as the school is a commuter school. Needless to say many friendly people attended this university and there\u2019s always something to get involved in. Am learning a lot Northeastern Illinois University is filled with delightful professors that go beyond the basic expectations in helping student\u2019s succeed in their classes. All of my professors have flexible offer hours, and tutors are available free",
