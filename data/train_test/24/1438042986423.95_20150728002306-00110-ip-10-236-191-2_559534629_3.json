    "textAfterTable": "FAQs Q: How far in advance should I order my wrap? A: A: Please allow 9-16 business days for your Made-to-Measure wrap to arrive. Each wrap must be tailored before it can be shipped to you, so delivery times are slightly longer for these special items. For full details, see our shipping information Q: Can I return or cancel the wrap if I change my mind? A:Once we've begun tailoring, our fabrics and materials cannot be reused, and so a special cancellation and return policy applies to these special items. There is still flexibility to return or cancel in certain situations, but it's important to order carefully. See our Return and Cancelation Policy for full details. Q: Can I order this wrap in a different style/fabric/length? A:Each wrap is carefully tailored to match exactly what you see in the photos, and unfortunately we are unable to modify the style, length or material in any way. We hope our wide variety of styles, fabrics and color choices will enable to find exactly what you're looking for with no modifications needed. Q: Will my wrap exactly match the color I see on your website? A: A: There might be a slight difference between the actual wrap\u2019s color and what you see in",
