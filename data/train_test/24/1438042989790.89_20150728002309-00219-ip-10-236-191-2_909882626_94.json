            "I am currently in Gamma Zeta Alpha National Fraternity, Inc. I can honestly say that is by far one of the greatest decision I have made. Greek life is great here but only if you decide to make it great and put your self out there to socialize. Since the univeristy is in Los Angeles and there are several universities all over the city there getting to know other people comes easy and can help you out in the long run.",
            "Students who prefer more privacy because of the dorms.",
            "There are several things to do to have fun, but the only way you will be able to and know about what is going on around campus is if you get involved as much as possible. The university is five minutes away from down town and 20 minutes away from the beach if you have a car you will always have something to do.",
            "I will be honest and say that the food here is not good at all. I had the meal plan my freshman year and I did not like it at all. You only have a lunch and dinner meal and on weekends a morning brunch. If you miss it, you lose it basically. I would advice that one cooks at their apartment instead.",
            "Dorms here are great they are not typical university dorms with hallways but rather apartments. When i first attended CSULA it was the first thing I noticed it is just apartments with students living here its awesome.",
            "I am a current sophomore so I cannot say that classes are very difficult mostly because I am taking my under grad classes. As of right now my first year was fairly easy. The only thing I had a hard time getting used to was the quarter system, it goes by too fast!",
            "The campus is not big at all, which makes most classes fairly easy to find. The housing life is great mostly because the dorms here are not the typical dorms with hallways and cluttered rooms, but rather we have apartments. its great for those who prefer more privacy and would rather cook than to have the schools meal plan. The university itself has a very large body of commuting students, but since the past year I have been here student housing has been getting larger and gives it a better and more enjoyable life to campus. Overall I enjoy this school because it is in the middle of Los Angeles and there is always something to do on the weekends.",
            "Overall the campus is very small, but very close to where all the action happens in Los Angeles. There is always something to do, whether it is on campus, dorms, or an organization on campus having an event outside. Classes here are great I am a current sophomore and I have had no problem with getting every class I need, also professors are great. I would definitely rate this school a 9 based on classes and student life."

There are also some cool places like the Staple Center, shops, clubs, and more. For me, I realized that I like visiting but not living there but that's also because I'm not a big city person. But if you are, then you'll enjoy it all that it has to offer. Tips for prospective students If you decide to go here, make sure your financial aid is set. Make sure EVERYTHING is set: do your Promissory Note on FASFA Direct Loans, take the quiz on FASFA, and if you plan to live on campus, make sure you're on the plan where you pay every quarter and NOT every month. The housing department has three plans; 1, pay for the academic year, 2, pay quarterly, or 3, pay monthly. I did the monthly and so did the rest of my suite-mates; however, we should have paid quarterly. We all had troubles with our financial aid and by the time we got everything settled out, it was too late. Late fees became a daily reminder, especially for myself and I had to pay a lot of late fees. And when you have to deposit scholarship money to the cashier, you have to follow up on them because they are slow. I one time deposited a scholarship money and",
