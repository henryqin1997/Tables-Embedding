            "Cal State Fullerton is such a diverse campus that it is great for all types of students. I know they have a great sports program as well as a winning dance team so anybody interested in that should definitely apply to CSUF.",
            "For prospective students, just remember to focus on your schoolwork as well as maintaining a well-rounded resume. CSUF does not just look for GPA, but community service as well as involvement in your school.",
            "CSUF's tuition is so worth it compared to other CSU campus'. Your financial aid will cover all the costs, including books, unless you plan on living on campus.",
            "Clubs and organizations are always promoting events around campus, so you will always have a function to attend. There's usually free food at these events as well. I also love the fact that CSUF is nearby everything. For example, downtown Fullerton, the mall, Target, and the beach!",
            "I have only been in school for almost two months now, but I can definitely say that Cal State Fullerton has great faculty and staff that encourage their students to learn and engage inside the classroom. They are also pleased when you come into their office hours, even if it doesn't have to do with school work!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{966479=Many on campus places are good and there is nice variety on and off campus, but i must give this category two stars for unresolved issue that affects the students. The eatery that the campus requires students that dorm to eat at is called the Gastronome. The Gastronome currently has a food safety rating of a D and has had this rating since July of 2013. Making it mandatory to purchase a meal plan to at a facility that D is quite unacceptable., 312126=I'm not a student yet until the fall of 2012, but from what I've heard Cal State Fullerton's standards seems to be at a high level., 246244=Overall, I feel safe on this campus. We have campus police that patrols the campus. I can walk around at 3 o'clock in the morning and still feel safe., 419338=I have been accepted to California State University of Fullerton and plan on attending this fall of 2012. I have heard wonderful things about this campus and have had a great experiences with guidance from the counselors at the school so far! I will be majoring in Kinesiology and am excited because I heard they have an outstanding Kinesiology program at CSUF!, 719207=Get to school before 9:00 if you want to park., 279892=I have never lived on campus but I have friends who have. They say it is a great way to be more involved in school. Since this is a commuter school, those who live in the dorms have more chances of being more involved. New dorms opened in 2011-2012 term., 140352=I can't complain about a whole lot. Parking permits are $220 a semester, and trying to find a parking spot anywhere between 8:30-12:45 is a nightmare, good luck! I did get most of the classes that I wanted for the spring semester, except they are all at undesirable times. I can't wait to get priority registration; getting all of my classes will be a breeze! :), 49252=CSUF is fairly cheap compared to other schools. The state budget crisis for the 2009-2010 school year has however made the cost rise. Although it has been hectic registering for classes as well as paying for classes this year, I still feel like the education at this school is worth the money. Some people go to community colleges before a university, but I personally think that holds students back and it usually takes them 5 years to graduate. Going to CSUF straight out of high school is definitely worth the money., 465367=California State University, Fullerton is a very cozy campus with everything the college student needs. The student-professor ratio (in my classes) is about 24:1, which is excellent for those who need easier access to their professor. There is a variety of places to study on campus and as well as places to relax after a stressful day at in class., 368412=I believe the campus safety to be pretty good. I take at least one night class a semester and haven't felt unsafe walking a few blocks to my car between 9:30 and 10:00 at night., 805026=The underdog of the california colleges. May not be our first choices at first, but it is the right choice in the end., 337240=I have never dormed at Fullerton, but, I am considering this Fall 2012. Especially because I live a little far from the campus. But, I believe it will be worthed., 736044=A campus tradition is that during finals or tests, if you rub the fallen Statue of David's butt cheek you'll get good luck haha. I've done it and I got an A! Also there's snow day, in October they bring snow into the quad and you can go sledding. There's also the annual spring concert in may, last year we had Mike Posner and Hunter Hayes., 607466=Cal State Fullerton is the perfect school if you want to get involved. May your intentions be for social and friendships or if you want to volunteer or advocate., 1130577=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 643863=This school is expensive. The parking pass for one semester is $220. Tuition fees usually increase every semester and have doubled since I started in 2007., 697434=AMAZING! They just completed a new set of dorms in 2010 and they are beautiful and modern. The community is unrivaled. I met countless life long friends there and even my husband!, 660772=When I visited California State University, Fullerton in September 2012, I knew that I wanted this to be my future school. The resources that the schools provides to its students drew me in. I love the history of the campus, as well as its surroundings., 5103=Sign up for a Freshman Program after you get accepted, because you will receive priority registration for your first semester and help you adjust better your first semester because you are enrolled in a University 100 class with helpful professors, mentors, and CSUF staff. Sign up for the Finish in Four program around October of your first semester because that enables you to have priority registration during your 4 years at this institution. Having priority registration is a big deal because it's very difficult to get the classes you need with the budget cuts (they cut lots of classes). Also, look your professors up on RateMyProfessor.com because having a good professor makes a BIG difference., 660157=Unsure yet, but I will be living in the apartments on campus beginning in January 2013., 947501=My first semester as a returning transfer student at Cal State Fullerton was more than I could have asked for. I first attended CSUF as a freshman in 2006 and did not apply myself. This time I felt as though a new world of education had been opened up to me and I love it!}",
