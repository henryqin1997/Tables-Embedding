The nomadic tunesmith \u2014 he's lived in England, Scotland, Texas, and New Jersey \u2014 spent his formative years honing his skills on the guitar, violin, and piano, occasionally sitting in with friends' bands. He made a self-produced demo while working as an engineer at a local studio, and was discovered by a Calvin Klein marketing executive at a Jane's Addiction concert who wanted to offer Jelen a shot at a modeling career. Jelen declined, but piqued the interest of the now-revealed CEO of Fearless Management, Joseph Janus, with his enthusiasm for a career in music. Janus signed on as the young artist's manager and figured prominently in his signing with Madonna's Maverick Recording Company. Jelen released his debut, Give It All Away, in March 2004. The ecologically themed Ex-Sensitive arrived in 2007. The album had a decidedly more organic sound and pulled much of its inspiration from the pop music of the '60s and '70s.}",
