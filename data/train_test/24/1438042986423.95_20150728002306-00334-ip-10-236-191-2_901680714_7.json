            "I would say anyone! Being a liberal arts school, you have a lot of options to find the perfect major or minor. Simmons is also a diverse school and offers a lot of different clubs for anyone to join. If you like sports, Simmons has many teams that are always welcoming new teammates.",
            "Go to the accepted students day! It's a great way to meet other students you may be in classes with and meet some of the professors. Also come take a campus tour or plan an overnight to get a good feel for the school.",
            "Simmons really has a lot to offer and a lot of resources. When Simmons isn't offering the class you need, you can take a class at any of the other schools in the College of the Fenway consortium, which is extremely helpful. The career education center is also there to help you determine the type of career you want to pursue or even help with building your resume. The faculty, staff, and professors at Simmons really want to make sure you are getting the bang for your buck.",
            "I love being in Boston! It's such a great city full of excitement! Being on a small campus makes me forget that I'm living in a big city. There's always so much you can do! Being at Simmons gives you a great learning environment and a city full of resources.",
            "All of my professors have been extremely helpful and I have learned a lot from them. The professors are always there for help and they truly want to help you master the material. They also are always available outside of classes to discuss the course or even answer questions about majors and careers."

There is always someone on the residence campus. After 10:30, all the gates get closed except for the one by Simmons Hall. You tap into the buildings with your ID card. I have never had a problem with safety. (But remember to lock your doors).}",

    "textAfterTable": "01/10/2011 Reviewer is A current student here. 6 out of 6 people found this review useful. 2 of 46 Categories Comments Great for these types of students The all female classes make concentrating in class easier. It also makes the dorms very home-like and warm. We understand that we need a certain level of testosterone so there are always opportunities to get off campus and meet guys from the surrounding schools. (Tufts, Northeastern, Harvard, Berklee) Simmons is great for any girl who want to meet and learn with other ambitious women. Why overlook a school designed specifically to help women achieve? Tips for prospective students Visit the school and attend the prospective students days. They are geared toward introducing the school and the surrounding area. Half the battle when choosing a school is determining where you want to live and what you want to be doing in you free time. These days will lure you in to the area and from there it is clear how many opportunities there are to get off campus. I suggest applying to the honors program to anyone who has the academic standings required. Bang for the buck",
