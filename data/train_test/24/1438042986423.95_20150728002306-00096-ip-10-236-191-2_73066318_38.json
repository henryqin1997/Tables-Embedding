Table Descriptions This section lists the columns and public synonyms for the dynamic performance tables. For more information, see Oracle7 Server Utilities. Granting Access on Selected Tables If any user other than SYS wants to use Server Manager's MONITOR functions, that user needs access to one or more of the dynamic performance tables. For information on running UTLMONTR.SQL on your system, see your operating system specific Oracle documentation. Granting Access to All Tables The UTLMONTR.SQL script can be run to grant access to PUBLIC on all of the dynamic performance tables needed to view MONITOR displays. Access to the Dynamic Performance Tables After installation, only username SYS has access to the dynamic performance tables. However, access to these tables is required for any user needing to view the MONITOR displays available in command-line mode of Server Manager. Warning: Information about the dynamic performance tables is presented for completeness only; this information does not imply a commitment to support these tables in the future. Suggestion: Once the instance is started, the V$ views are accessible. The database does not have to be mounted or open. One important consequence of this fact is that the V$LOG view can be used to identify log files",
