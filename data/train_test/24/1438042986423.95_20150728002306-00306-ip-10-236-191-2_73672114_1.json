The suite\u00a0builds on Avast Internet Security with an automated software update tool, which can not only alert you to new updates, but download and install them as well. Another\u00a0big extra is a military-grade data shredder, which\u00a0can wipe important files, documents and other personal data, and ensure there's no chance they can be recovered. AccessAnywhere is the other premium feature, and allows you to access your PC over the internet. Installation is\u00a0simple and straightforward. Compatibility\u00a0seems\u00a0good, too, with the package running happily alongside\u00a0Norton Internet Security on our test PC. The\u00a0program interface is clean and very easy to use. Just click \"Smart Scan\" and\u00a0the suite\u00a0immediately runs a quick check for malware.
