He is definitely NOT going all in for 2012. If he were, Det would be in the bullpen and Greinke would be on the team, along with Shoppach.I just hope Tracy is in good condition and warmed up because let's not get injured again, ok?, 194052=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 20296=NL, Rizzo just won't give away prospects for rentals; he's all about building a team which contends every year not just this year so in that sense I agree that he's not all in. I don't think that this is just a 2012 thing. I think that this is part of Rizzo's and the rest of the brain trust's overall philosophy., 170514=Remember we swept the Giants and embarrassed their staff. That and fifty cents will get us a cup of coffee in October.BABIP. Learn, love it, know it. Wee Willie Keeler understood it, but baseball fans to this day tend not to\u2026. I am not saying BABIP is infallible but it tells the story quite often., 69560=swami\u2026 it would be great if the Nats could play in a best of 5 series so that the experience issue will be taken care of in 2013, 77305=Swami, Bryce has some sort of virus over the weekend and was vomitting. That could explain the pale and thin. But cookies would be good just in case.Let's hope last nights lackluster performance is in the rear view mirror. It will be interesting to see the Good Squad captain at 3B.Have to go look at the \"P\"/2013 season ticket email.. see how much this is going to set me back!GYFNG!!!, 181779=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

If he were, Det would be in the bullpen and Greinke would be on the team, along with ShoppachI agree and that is why I think Rizzzo is a great GM. I see an upside down the road by not making an impulsive mistake and giving away the future to win it all this season.What is under rated by most fans I think is the closeness in the club house for a 162 game season. I believe that teams that are a player away of being dominant will be at the top of any super free agent looking for an organization that is loyal to its players., 1899=PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES at WASHINGTON NATIONALS Where: Nationals Park Gametime: 7:05 p.m. EDT TV: MASN, MLB.tv Radio: WJFK (106.7 FM), WFED (1500 AM), XM 183 Weather: Scattered storms, 83 degrees, Wind 6 mph RF to LF, 22478=We will be lucky to see Ian in early September from the sound of things. DeRosa wasn't awesome last night so why the heck not try Tracy? If they're holding out Zimm the must have a good reason. It's not like they're trying to field an inferior team. Well, not \"Inferior\" but you know what I mean. GYFNG!, 158042=Down off the ledge. Mini offensive slump. Pitcher only gave up 3. Nats in first on August 1st. The sun will come up tomorrow and there will be another game, and then another, and then another., 38255=NL \u2014 I agree he's not \"all in for 2012,\" at least not in the conventional sense of selling the farm to try to win with rentals this year. (Seems like that's what the Dodgers are doing, and they aren't even in that good a position to do succeed.) And that's fine with me. I want a dynasty. I have no interest in expensive rentals that make the team worse in the mid-term.Maybe I'm too much of a lawyer, but there's a big difference between eschewing rentals and stupid trades and \"playing for next year,\" which would suggest that he's assuming that all the pieces will come together next year without spending or trading and so he'll just ride out whatever happens this year and not worry about it if we fall short. I don't think that's his view, or at least I hope it's not., 62278=Have any of our relievers been to the playoffs? Mike Gonzalez, maybe?Gorzo has come close \u2026 led the Pirates in a playoff chase for the Pirates in 2007 as their ace., 56222=I see Nats ladySwami, very well said, i have posted as well a few times that I do not think 2012 really should be the season that we expect to be world champs or even NL champs. we are ahead of schedule which is great, but it should not be accelerated if it could jeopardize the master plan.Say what you want about charlie Manuel but i think he was spot on when in April of 2011 he said the Nats will be a playoff team for the next decade beginning in either 2013 or 2014I know Peric feels you cease opportunity when you have it\u2026 I get that, but sometimes in doing so, what could have been a bright future could be in preril, 157264=Maybe we should give the two Zimmerman's and Desmond the whole of August off so that they are fresh for the Divisional Series\u2026., 58393=So in cheerier news \u2013 AK reports that Zim's shoulder continues to feel just great! And \u2013 everyone's favorite song \"Nuts about the Nats\" is apparently making a resurgence. Just in case there are any Philly fans in the house tonight, that should drive them away forever. Just about as cheesy as \" Hey Chicago , what do you say, Cubs are going to win today\",which they actually sing at the END of the game, despite using the future tense. I know, grammar police., 80916=Secret wasian man said: \"Now, I expect this team to be no better then 10 over .500 by Labor day. Injuries mounting up.\"What would make you say injuries are mounting up? Seems to be going in the other direction. Unless we hear that RZim's back or ALR's back are more serious than just the normal discomfort that a lot of ballplayers go through heading into August, they're not losing players, rather, they're getting players back from injuries. Tracy tonight, Werth soon, Desmond at some point in August (we hope) and Storen finding his stuff after missing the first half. They're losing Strasburg at some point in September, but they can afford to lose their no. 3 starter for the last 2 or 3 weeks.}",
