Will not notify perspective students in advance, if any problems arise with financial aid, admissions process. Students must take/pay for an 1101 course, to orient the student with college success. After taking an orientation to college all day presentation., 123454=If you are planning on taking the Wind Turbine Technician course at the Ingleside campus I would definitely recommend it. George Lister is a perfect teacher for learning all you need to know about the subject. Mrs. Trish is a great reference and teacher for the 1101 course. Everybody else that comes from the Harlingen campus and that you need to talk to on the phone are nice people., 9931=I am currently taking my basics here. I will be finished in May 2012, and from there I plan on transferring to a university that offers a major in business management., 107376=Stay on alert on your admissions process, financial aid and the 1101 course. Ask questions and continue to ask questions. Things function very slow and will not get done, unless you are pressuring lazy employees/staff., 132493=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
