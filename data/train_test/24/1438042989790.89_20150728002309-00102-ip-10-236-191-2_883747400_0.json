    "textBeforeTable": "About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Champion colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Champion plastic in general - it is more stable than all other plastics. It provides outstanding performance and durability. Champion golf discs retain original flight characteristics much longer and are distinguished by their clear or pearlescent colors. It is a great choice for headwinds, power players, big hyzers, flex shots, and stable sidearm shots. Speed 9, Glide 3, Turn 0, Fade 4 The Innova Champion Firebird is a distance driver that is overstable. It is one of Innova's most popular upwind drivers that works well into a headwind. The Firebird\u2019s combination of superior speed and stability make it possible to throw drives into the wind with confidence. An excellent disc golf disc for throwing long range flex shots. A favorite of sidearm and overhead throwers, too. This disc is designed for professional level players. Reviews (0) Description Write a review 0 reviews\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0",
    "textAfterTable": "\"If you need a disc to go left no matter what, this is the right disc for you. You can throw this disc as hard as you want and it will not flip over. It is my favorite disc for strong head winds and hyzer shots. This disc is also over-stable in all weights!\" - Paul McBeth \"Until recently I had never had a disc like the Firebird in my bag! I throw it hard and flat and it still fades hard at the end. It is my go to disc for certain situations and I am pretty sure it has saved me a million strokes! I also use it for getting out of trouble shots like a thumber, tomahawk, and a flick disc from an awkward stance. I love it.\" - Hannah Leatherman \"The Firebird is really fast and truly predictable. If it\u2019s windy and there is trouble around, I pull out my Firebird.\" - Steve Brinster \"The Firebird is probably the most used disc in my bag. I can pick a spot on the ground and land it there just about every time.\" - Will Schusterick If you are looking for a disc with more Fade, try the Monster more Turn, try the Viking more Glide, try the Thunderbird Other Speed 9 discs include the FL, Roadrunner, Sidewinder, Thunderbird, Valkyrie and Viking. For Comparison: The Innova FL is a distance driver that is straight",
