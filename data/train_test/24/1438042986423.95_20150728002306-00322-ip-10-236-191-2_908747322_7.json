Resident assistance is always available also. Clubs and Activities Ferrum does have a variety of Greek clubs, from national ones to local one too. There is an outdoor club for those who enjoy the outdoors. We also have a handful of sport teams and for those who don't want to be on an actual team we also have intramurals.
