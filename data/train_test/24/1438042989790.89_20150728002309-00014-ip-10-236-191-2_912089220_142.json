It was founded October 3rd, 1887, 346996=When you start getting into your majors your professors expect you to buckle down and do what you have to do. When a paper or an assignment is due by 11:59 by a certain day make sure you turn it in then. Unlike high school teachers professors here will not baby you, and will expect you to go by your syllabus to find out when things are due because you wont be told or reminded., 319970=The set- Right in front of Diamond & McGuinn and the H. Manning Efferson building. When ever some says I represent all FAMUans say Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University October 3rd, 1887. Whhatt??? in unison. It's crazy and it fills you with pride., 737073=The brand new co-ed dorms will be open and ready starting from the 2014-2015 school year. Weekly are room inspections making sure your room is tidy. Dorms have building wide movie nights and socials., 520432=We offer a service call the safe team which i really love, they run from 10:00 to 3am and if your walking anywhere on campus they'll come pick you up in a golf cart and take you where you need to go,its awesome., 130684=Florida A&M University, (FAMU) is considered highly among Historically Black Colleges/ Universities. In 1997, FAMU recieved the award of College of the Year, which was presented by the Princeton Review and Time Magazine. If you are interested in the fields of Pharmacy and Pharmeceutical Sciences, Business, Nursing, Engineering, Architecture, or Journalism and Graphic Design, know that Florida A&M is ranked profoundly in these areas amongst other schools in the nation., 61242=There is always something to do on campus. 2013 will be the return of the Marching 100. And that means more excitement for all Rattlers in Rattler Nation., 790924=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 275542=Florida A&M University has a very skewed image in the public media. Coming here you get a completely different experience then what is expected. FAMU is one of the nations top HBCUs but it's also way more than that. It is a university who prides themselves on the success of their students. Like every school there are students who come here just to play around. The majority of us who continue their education here at FAMU are dedicated to our studies. If you are ready to be part of something great and rich with history. You are ready to be a part of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, established 1887. When the dark clouds gather on the horizon, When thunder and lightening fill the sky ......... You must always remember that the RATTLERS WILL STRIKE, AND STRIKE AND STRIKE AGAIN!, 492570=Florida A&M is one of the best universities that has been establish since 1887. I wouldnt change a thing about it.}",
