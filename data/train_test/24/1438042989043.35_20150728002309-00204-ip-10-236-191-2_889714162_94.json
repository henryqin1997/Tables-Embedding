The school has even gotten recognized by President Obama in 2011 at a graduation ceremony. I found that to be very remarkable!, 207934=Miami Dade College has helped me a lot and I have only attended for one semester. I have learned and improved immensely in mathematics. I first scored into a remedial math class and Im currently about to start MAT1033. Their math lab is the best, the people there are always willing to go the extra mile to help you succeed., 969027=Miami Dade has it's usual clubs, SGA and cultural clubs, etc. In addition to those, in Spring 2012 Homestead Campus added a Journalism Club to the list. The Journalism Club writes articles for the local South Dade News Leader and is very interested in getting it's members published. It's a great club., 199780=Ok, college isn't cheap. People thinkn that Dade is cheap; however, it is reasonable for 4 classes at about 1200 (not books included). Sure other schools are charging a fortune for a class, but it is enough to at least get started and save up for other terms and transfering schools., 1081007=I have been a student with Miami Dade College since 1997. It has been a rough road but they haven't given up on me and I them. To say this unbiased they are a 8 out of 10.}",

Tips for prospective students Don't procrastinate, make your time at Miami-Dade everything your High School Academic Career wasn't and a great University will be waiting for you! Bang for the buck I believe my money is well spent at Miami-Dade. There is always something I can do. I don't have a car so when i'm at Miami-Dade I have to make sure I get things done. If I don't have homework or anything otherwise academic to do I can go to the library, or the gym, or even the swimming pool. It's a low key school and every dollar was well spent. Am enjoying being here I enjoy going",
