As shown in FIGS. 2A-2D, the illumination apparatus 1000 may generally comprise an optics module 200 that may be releasably secured to a heat dissipating element 300 via a releasable connection. As further depicted, the heat dissipating element 300 may comprise a plurality of radially projecting fins 310. The Figures also illustrate a lens cover 210 which may encapsulate and enclose other functional components of the optics module 200 there under.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34304=General LED light sources are well known in the art. LEDs are light sources based upon a semiconductor structure, specifically a diode structure, which emit incoherent light (which may be in the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared spectrum) when electrical current is passed through the semiconductor junction. One example of such a light source may include phosphors emitting white light. The original uses of LED light sources were in low-power applications such as indicator lights on instrumentation panels and the like. However, recent developments in LED technology have increased the output power and efficiency of LED sources so that it is now feasible for them to be utilized in traditional lighting applications previously reserved for incandescent, fluorescent, sodium, and known lighting technologies. Commercially available LED light sources surpassed incandescent light sources in terms of efficiency in or around 2002. More recently, commercially available LED light sources have exceeded fluorescent light sources in efficiency. Fluorescent light sources typically exhibit around 100 lumens per Watt (lm/W) efficiency; however LED light sources recently introduced into the market exhibit 130 lm/W efficiency, and there are other LED light sources available and currently under development which exhibit even greater efficiency. Since LEDs have the foregoing advantages, the LED lamp is expected to replace current conventional light bulb technology in the 21st century and become a new light source for illumination while concurrently providing other power-saving and environmentally friendly advantages., 39655=Attempts have been made to provide structures for removing heat from the semiconductor junction of LED lamps. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,226,189 (wherein heat produced is conducted to a heat dissipating device through a metal substrate and then conducted from the heat dissipating device to the light bulb base in an attempt to effectively disperse the heat via structures within the light bulb); U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2006/0050514 (wherein the base of a bulb is a passive heat sink fittable into a socket); and U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2006/0061997 (wherein an LED is clamped to a heat sink to permit the LED to be removable and replaceable, thereby making a serviceable LED assembly with an exchangeable LED). The inventions of U.S. Pat. No. 7,226,189 and U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2006/0050514 are directed at attempts to better conduct heat away from an LED semiconductor junction within an LED lamp via incorporation of heat conductive material within the LED lamp, however, neither reference discloses a means or additional structure to dissipate heat from the socket of the disclosed LED lamps. U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2006/0050514 discloses a means of clamping an LED circuit board to a heat sink but fails to disclose a heat sink independent from an optics module, wherein the optics module contains the driving circuit and a plurality of LEDs therein., 53064=The illumination apparatus 1000 of the present invention provides a long lasting, energy efficient light source. Additionally, the releasable connection between the optics module 200 and the heat dissipating element 300 allows for service and replacement of an optics module 200 as necessary, while the independent heat dissipating element 300 may remain behind and be re-used with a new or repaired optics module 200. By separating the optics module 200 and heat dissipating element 300, the user may conserve resources and replacement costs throughout the life cycle of such an illumination apparatus 1000 since the original heat dissipating element 300 may be continuously re-used.}",

While the above description contains much specificity, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of any embodiment, but as exemplifications of the presently preferred embodiments thereof. Many other ramifications and variations are possible within the teachings of the various embodiments. The present invention makes use of the currently available LED technology due to the significant benefits that such light sources provide including extremely long life, the ability to control output power and spectrum, and a significant reduction in the amount of electrical energy consumed for equivalent light output power. Many of the structures of the illumination apparatus may be fabricated from materials that are inexpensive and preferably comprise re-usable, recyclable, or replaceable components so as to require a minimum of new raw material and thus preserve limited natural resources. The illumination apparatus may further comprise an optics module containing a integral heat conducting element and an independent heat dissipating element, preferably wherein the integral heat conducting element is a component of an optics module that may be serviced and/or replaced separate and independent from the heat dissipating element so as to be environmentally friendly and lower overall maintenance and/or replacement costs for such inventive illumination apparatus. , the first electrical connector 292 of the optics module",
