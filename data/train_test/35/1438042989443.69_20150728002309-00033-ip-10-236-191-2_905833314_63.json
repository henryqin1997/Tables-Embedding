            "Adventurous, independent, and are willing to experience new cultures.",
            "The Tuscany campus is set in the middle of the city of Prato. There is a Cathedral, train station, many places to eat, and Italian culture everywhere.",
            "Being abroad gave me the opportunity to become closer to the professors. There were only thirty-four students that came abroad this semester and this made it easy to have more one on one opportunities with the professors. The classes are taught with passion, because every professor is passionate about what they are teaching and have had years of experience.",
            "The great thing about living in Europe is that the airfare is really cheap through RyanAir. During October break six of us went to Barcelona, Dublin, and Paris. It is also easy to hop on a train during the weekend and explore more of Italy. At Keller Platz they have nights where bands play and there is great music and dancing!",
            "The study abroad program in Tuscany, Italy set up a meal voucher system. We have eight different places to eat to choose from, and they serve a variety of foods. Some of the places serve the traditional Italian meals, and then some serve more food that is more American. The food in Italy is to die for!",
            "Living in Europe has opened my eyes to many new things, including the size of their rooms. When I first walked into my bedroom with my roommates I thought we were all going to pass out, because there are three beds stuffed into a room a little over half the size of a regular dorm room. Although it was shocking at first, I have adapted to my room and I absolutely love where I am living.",
            "The academic rigor is just what I was looking for in a school. The whole point of going to college is to learn about your passion. I have had days where there has been a lot of work that needs to be done and I have felt stressed, but then I learn from that and manage my time in a more sufficient manner.",
            "Study abroad! It is an amazing experience that will change you as a person and provide you with many opportunities.",
            "New Haven is the best choice for a school I could have possibly made!"

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck I was disappointed with the atmosphere however the classes and the professors are worth it. Am enjoying being here Okayy, this school makes it sound more interesting then it really is. The people are nice and the classes are good, however the campus is kinda boring. It is very small and right now a lot of construction. This is also not the best area to live in. There have been lock downs and such on campus, students have been robbed at gun point etc. There are campus police and they seem to do there best, and they will send out txt messages to students about what is currently going on. It is just an such an expensive school and financial aid people are horrible! I was very disappointed and its too much for me, since I am paying for it myself, I'd rather be somewhere where I'd be more excited about the school. Am learning a lot The professors are great!!!
