            "campus safety is excellent here. at night, there are at least 8 or 10 guys who do nothing but cruise around campus, and keep an eye on things. we also have, in every parking lot and public space, large blue lighted emergency phones. these large blue light poles aso have cameras, which are monitored 24/7. although i am not sure of the number of employees our safety and security has, i know they are always everywhere i go, anytime i go there.",
            "seems art students aren't really into greek life here, although i think there are a few greek groups here.",
            "lots of clubs and activities to do, such as quiddich, which rcad is the most recent (2011) champion, sga, volunteer services (something rcad is big on!) and a lot more.",
            "art, graphic design, illustration, motion graphics, interactive design, digital film (the biggest draw right now,) interior design, tv and movie productions students, sound design students, fine art students, and students how may be creative, but undecided.",
            "well, here, we have florida al around. we are on the northwestern edge of the everglades, where nature is abundant. we also have throughout the school year, excursions to do things like kayak the mangrove tunnels, explore the bayous, go on deep sea marine expeditions through mote marine, as well as the florida aquarium in tampa, which is only about an hours drive from here. also, rcad is opening the new smoa (sarasota museum of art) which used to be an old fashioned huge high school, where they will conduct classes, hold special shows, and draw in big name artists. we have sarasota international airport, or drive to tampa, one of the largest airports in the world.",
            "you just can't find a more involved, focused group of educators and staff than we have here. plus, you get career services for the rest of your life, where they will advise on portfolio decisions, will help you write a killer resume, and will assist you in finding a job no matter how long you've been out of college.",
            "sarasota may be a smaller town, but honestly, there is so much you can do here. from local night spots to the beaches, you will find plenty to to. heck, just on campus alone, every week you will have opportunities to go to gallery openings from great artists such a jmwturner, his work is showing here at the selby gallery this week. last month, we had henk pander, a legendary dutch artist, and the list goes on and on. we also have, almost every week, a private screening of movies before they are issued to the public. we also have had speakers such as steven spielberg, jeff katz (who's son attends here) to peter jackson, to elijah wood, who was here last week also, and martha stewart, and the list is endless! stars, directors, artists, musicians, interior designers, and more. the college just started building a new movie studio, with the help of two great hollywood directors involved, which has the agreement with many hollywood studios to bring movie projects here. it is state of the art, and every student is issued a macbook pro when they arrive, to keep the entire time you are here!",
            "the school itself has 3 good restaurants. one is a cafeteria style place, with excellent gourmet chef created dishes. the other is more of a cafe, with great sandwiches, hot meals, and starbucks coffee!! off campus, there are numerous good restaurants really close by: burger king, taco bell, and mcdonalds are all close by, and there are three great chinese places nearby, too. as well as a subway, an new fancy italian ($$) restaurant, and several independent gourmet places up and down us41.",
            "dorm life here is great. about 90% 0f the students live in the dorms their first or second year. but, with a little success, i see that many kids have earned enough money to actually live off campus by the junior or senior year. but stay close to school, because you will still have lots of extra curricular activities to do on campus and off.",
            "i won't hide the truth here. you will work harder than you ever have in your life. but, that's what you need to learn to do in order to be successful in such a competitive business. you'll find yourself creating miracles out of nothing, and learn how to do so in a responsible, environmentally friendly way!",
            "come to ringling in sunny florida, where you will learn that the starving artist is a thing of the past, and you will find your own personal path to success through learning the ins and outs of the business, from running a gallery to managing a movie to running your own business to working for a legendary company, this is the place to make it happen.",
            "immersion in fine art and all other arts related degrees. amazing guidance and leadership, along with the most amazing support staff any college could ever dream of having. opportunities abound for work, work study, gallery shows, sales, and scholarships and grants."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot As anyone who has heard of Ringling College of Art and Design will know, Ringling is one of the top colleges in the WORLD for artists and designers. Everyone at the school begins with the same curriculum-- basic studio classes such as drawing and 3D are required (however, next year the curriculum is changing, and many core classes will not be required anymore e.g. Film majors won't need to take drawing). These basic classes start everyone off at the same page. If you're someone like me, who hasn't had any formal art education before Ringling, you'll definitely be brought up to speed by professors who are high-quality, well-known professionals in their own fields. If you're a bit more experienced, there are plenty of school competitions and opportunities for you to stretch your creative muscle as well.
