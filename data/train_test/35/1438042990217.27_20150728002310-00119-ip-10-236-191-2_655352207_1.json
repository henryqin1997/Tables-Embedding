On the arrival day, after driving straight through from Texas, I was trying to get in a round on Monday mid morning. I was given a tee time nearly 2 1/2 hours later(13:20) and was told there is a chance going out early since I was by myself. After checked in I was told to wait and will be paged if spot available. I waited the entire time and watched multiple threesome groups went out without been given a chance to go with. Furthermore, I did not realize the sun goes down just before five pm. Needless to say I did not get to finish the round after waited",
