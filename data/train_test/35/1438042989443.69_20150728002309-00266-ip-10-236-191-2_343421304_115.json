Castability has always been a problem with clear intermediate sinking lines because there are no lubricants in the coating and the lines drag through the guides. RIO has solved the problem by incorporating proprietary lubricants into the running line coating that make the line slick. The running line is translucent green while the head is completely clear. With an intermediate sinking rate of 1.5 \u0096 2.0 inches per second (3.7 cm/s), the line is perfect for fishing subsurface and shallow shore lines. Ideal when stealth is required for wary,",

The line features a floating tropical coating with a 9.5 ft clear intermediate tip for deeper flats. The Clouser taper is perfect for casting into a fifteen-knot breeze. Sounds unbelievable, but this line will turn over a 12 ft - 15 ft leader in a strong wind. A 9 ft leader attached to the clear AquaLux tip gives you an effective 18 foot leader, which is stealthy enough for any wary fish. Your guide can still follow the fly at this length, while a totally clear line is really tough to track. Florida bonefish are normally found in deeper waters of two to four feet. With the 9.5 ft clear sinking AquaLux\u00ae intermediate tip, you will get your fly down to the bonefish. Available in a 7wt (WF-7-F/I) or 8wt (WF-8-F/I) on this reel.",
