On January 23, 1885, William Dempster Hoard launched the first edition of Hoard's Dairyman. This year, our 125th anniversary, we've asked world-renowned dairy artist Bonnie Mohr of Glencoe, Minn., to help us create an updated Foster Mothers of the Human Race painting. The original Foster Mothers print was created in 1957 followed by updates in 1963, 1991, and 1993 \u2014 all of which were painted by former Hoard's Dairyman Art Director James Baird.}",
