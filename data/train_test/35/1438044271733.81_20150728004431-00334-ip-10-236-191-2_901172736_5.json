            "Everyone. It's especially wonderful for those who need smaller class sizes to work better. The staff are very accommodating and understanding. I promise you will get an education here.",
            "Take a tour, sit in on a class and really get a feel for Edgewood. It's not for everyone, since it really is a small community. Make sure your tour guide takes you into Marshall Residence Hall - it's the best kept secret on Campus!",
            "It's expensive, there's no doubt about that. But they practically throw money at you, so you'll be able to afford going here. You get a lot with your tuition, and you're paying just a little bit more than you would to go to UW Madison, where you don't get some of the benefits you do here. Talk to your financial advisor about student employment opportunities on campus, scholarships and grants you can apply for and any other aid you can get.",
            "Being in the small community inside a big city is great. I know that the capitol/State Street is only a bus ride away if I want to enjoy the city life. If not, I can stay on campus in my dorm. They always have lots of activities going on here too. It's never boring and the people are great. You're guaranteed to have a fun time!",
            "The class sizes here are great. The teachers actually care about you and your education! The one on one attention is something you wont find in a larger school. For a small campus, they have plenty of class choices and limitless majors and minors."

Edgewood is very good at diversifying students. You get to meet an array of people with different backgrounds and learn about other cultures! The staff and students are friendly and amazingly helpful. I LOVE it here! Tips for prospective students Make sure you visit the campus first. Although I am in love with it, it is more of a campus that you either love of hate. It's pretty close-knit, you will get to know everyone. I would also suggest Regina hall to all you girls, it is really nice to have your own room! Bang for the buck Edgewood seems like an impossible school at first, but then you apply and realize that they give out a massive amount of scholarships! Make sure you apply for",
