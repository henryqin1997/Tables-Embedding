Summarizing the invention provides a compact packing system for a medical device that assists in unpacking itself. Using the packaging system according to the invention medical devices can be transported in less time at lower cost without the need for extra personnel and/or aiding means for unpacking the device. Using the packaging system 1 the mobile view station 15 is packed in a horizontal position supported by the frame 2 to which it is fastened by suitable fastening means 16. In the example shown the fastening means comprise a number of beams forming a casing that is preferably made of wood. The frame 2 is to be inserted in a box 6 for air transportation. However, in box 6 there is sufficient space left for the mobile C-arm stand 14 that can be placed on top of the packed mobile view station 15. The volume of the total packaging system is thus greatly reduced allowing the volume of the box 6 to be optimally used. Generally the blocking of the assisting means is optionally and may take place after the preparation of the assisting means. The unblocking of the assisting means then needs to be performed before",
