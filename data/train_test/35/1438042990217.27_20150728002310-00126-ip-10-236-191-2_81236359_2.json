You can add a range of additional peripherals to the Pi; the first section of this page covers setting up the Pi with the minimum number of peripherals to make sure that you can get it working. Additional peripherals are covered in the second section. You may have decided to buy a Raspberry Pi because you think it is great, it helps if you have an idea of what you want to do with it. You buy the board, but you will need some extra parts to be able to use it. Some of those parts you may have around so you can use them, some you might buy that others have given away or sold, and some you buy yourself. Consider what you buy; you might get very little benefit from an expensive item over a cheap one. Typical Hardware You Will Need Trouble Shooting - some things to check if things don't work as expected. Advanced Setup - for more extensive information on setting up. Beginners Guide - you are up and running, now what can you do? Basic Setup - for help with buying / selecting other hardware and",
    "textAfterTable": "IMPORTANT For USB devices other than a mouse and a simple wired keyboard (for USB devices drawing more than 100mA) a powered USB hub is strongly recommended. A technical discussion as to why can be found here. Specifically the RPI's built in USB hub is designed only for \"Single current unit\" USB devices. Note that when using Revision 2 (or later) boards the problem has been mitigated somewhat with the removal of the USB polyfuses, still due to the limited current the PI can provide to USB devices, due to its main polyfuse, its still recommended to use a hub for all USB peripherals requiring more than 100mA. Other, optional equipment includes: Case SD card reader - if you need to prepare your own SD card Power Supply Switch - if you want an easy way to cycle power Power Supply The unit uses a Micro USB connection to power itself (only the power pins are connected - so it will not transfer data over this connection). A standard modern phone charger with a micro-USB connector will do, but needs to produce at least 700mA at 5 volts. Check your power supply's ratings carefully, and beware cheap knock-offs!. Pi Supply offers a 5.25V (+-0.25v) 1500mA power supply, manufactured specially for the Raspberry Pi to account for voltage drop due to the high",
