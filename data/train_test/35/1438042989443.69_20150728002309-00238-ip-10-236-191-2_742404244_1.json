Ennis then brought the crowd to its feet with an 82-yard punt return for a touchdown with 9:38 left in the fourth quarter for a 48-14 Millville advantage., 48060=If there was any question whether it was Millville\u0092s night against the Mustangs, it was answered with 8:38 to go in the first half. Bolts quarterback Roberto Rivera rolled right and fired a pass that looked to be a surefire interception, but the ball deflected off a Mainland defensive back\u0092s hands and into the waiting arms of Millville wide receiver Kyreem Loatman for a 16-yard touchdown., 118145=Copyright \u00a9 2015 archive.thedailyjournal.com.
