Even though I don't live on campus, I am generally on campus from morning until like 10:00 PM because there are so many events/activities that go on throughout the week. It isn't too big and it isn't too small and all of my professors for my classes have done a great job teaching. I have also been able to connect with other Christians on campus through Intervarsity, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, BASIC Plus, BASIC, and Navigators. There are so many ministries and campus clubs/organizations that one can get involved in., 240390=Apply early, scholarship deadlines are early January., 393998=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Bang for the buck Out of Iowas three state schools it is the best. It has the smallest class sizes, so you don't get lost in a mix of hundreds of other student. Am enjoying being here There are lots of different clubs and activities you can get involved in. Almost every collage has there own club and living in Residence halls helps you meet a lot of people.
