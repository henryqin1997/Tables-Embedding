But thanks to a loyal fanbase and the never-give-up hustle of its players, 1A Cedar Key was able to give the 2A Indians more than it bargained before while achieving a team goal in the process., 43961=Copyright \u00a9 2015, 36081=Sills' deep three-pointer from the right wing cut Chiefland's lead to 38-30 with 3:34 remaining in the third quarter. That was as close as the Sharks would get until a bucket by Sills at the 3:13 mark of the fourth quarter made it 55-46.
