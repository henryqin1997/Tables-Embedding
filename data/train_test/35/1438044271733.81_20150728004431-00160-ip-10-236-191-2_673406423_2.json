    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Curios Forty Cup editions were disputed during its 85 years of existence, with 647 matches played and 2,163 goals scored. Only one country, Venezuela, has never hosted the Copa Am\u00e9rica, but they are scheduled to do so in 2005. However, Venezuela already can claim to having hosted the final play-off between Peru and Colombia in 1975. Argentina, on the other hand, is the country that organized it most often: 8 times. Argentina and Uruguay have attained the Cup most times, with 14 titles each. They are followed by Brazil with 6, Paraguay and Peru with 2, and Bolivia and Colombia with 1. In 2001, Colombia were not only crowned champion for the first time; they did not concede a single goal during the six matches, thus establishing a record in the Cup. Uruguay are unbeatable as home team, having played 38 Cup matches at home, all in Montevideo and never lost one, winning 31 and drawing 7. Uruguay can claim another extraordinary record: they have a positive head-to-head record against all other contenders, including Argentina and Brazil. The longest match in the history of the Copa Am\ufffdrica is the final between Brazil and Uruguay (1-0), disputed in 1919. It lasted 150 minutes, 90 of regular time and 2 extra times of 30 minutes each. The greatest score was attained in 1942 when Argentina defeated Ecuador by 12-0. The longest tournament was played in Brazil",
