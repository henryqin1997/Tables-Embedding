Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 98601=\"8:18 p.m. \u2014 Sweet Fancy Moses, what a beatdown the Nationals of Wainwright tonight.\"Sounds like somebody's really into RIP HAYWIRE., 31283=Gonat at 4:49, it is a may or may not. We will see in Sprung Training., 40181=Regarding Henry Rodriguez: Whether the bone chips contributed to his meltdown or not, let's all hope that the surgery and rehab process allows him to make a fresh start in either winter ball or at Spring Training. If the problems were physical, let's hope they get fixed and he comes back as a 100-MPH pitcher with better (he'll never have perfect) control. And even if the problems were more mental than physical, then the surgery/rehab could still give him the opportunity to do a complete mental/physical reset and resume his career. Because I, at least, still remember that incredible inning he threw against Atlanta last September and would love to see a return of that particular Mr. Rodriguez in 2013., 32000=Gonat said\u2026 MicheleS said\u2026 Henry had BONE chips removed! Well that explains alot August 31, 2012 4:43 PM ______________________________It may not explain anything. Many pitchers pitch through bone chips as it is painful and doesn't affect their accuracy or velocity. August 31, 2012 4:49 PM You may be right gonat, but if it were me, I might be thinking more about the pain than my release point during my follow through. Guess it depends on Hrod's pain tolerance., 20560=Sonny, probably didn't help his control and his velo started to drop a few MPH but doubtful that it was his problem in April and May.Could still be ready for Winter Ball., 24073=MicheleS said\u2026 Henry had BONE chips removed! Well that explains alot August 31, 2012 4:43 PM ______________________________It may not explain anything. Many pitchers pitch through bone chips as it is painful and doesn't affect their accuracy or velocity., 22075=MicheleS said\u2026 Xavier Nady is getting called up by the Giants. Anyone know what happened to Ankiel? August 31, 2012 3:51 PM _____________________________Ankiel is still getting paid by Ted Lerner and is sitting at home still waiting for the phone to ring.Personally I would take Ankiel over Nady. All a team would have to pay on either player is the prorated portion of the league minimum and Nats still pick up the remainder., 1271=On a team level, the Nationals could notch win No. 80 tonight. That would match last year's total, fall just one shy of the club record (set in the inaugural 2005 season) and just two shy of the first winning record by a D.C. ballclub since 1969., 43869=\"Because I \u2026 still remember that incredible inning \u2026 against Atlanta \u2026 and would love to see a return of that particular Mr. Rodriguez in 2013.\" That, my friend, is why you have a DVR: you can see it there, and only there, any time., 111758=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

If roster spot is needed, could be moved to 60 Day DL August 31, 2012 4:31 PM ________________________________Couldn't they move him to the 60 Day DL to move Zach Duke to the 40 man and call him up?, 80322=Looks like Davey is starting to get them stretched out for October.}",
