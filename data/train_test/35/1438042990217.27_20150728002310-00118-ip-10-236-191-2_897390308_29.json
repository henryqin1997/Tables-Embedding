            "VCU is located downtown in a big city which makes it an area susceptible to crime. So, yes, their is crime that happens near campus. But most cases of crime do not happen directly on the campus and we have a very good VCU police department as well as Richmond police department and a security escort service that will pick you up from anywhere around campus. Having two police departments constantly around and on campus and having the escort service definitely makes it to where students are and can be safe.",
            "VCU is definitely not a huge greek life school but their is greek life! Since VCU is so diverse I think that's why their isn't such a huge greek life society here. However, their are fraternities and sororities and they are known. They always have lots of activities and things going on on campus.",
            "The gym offers lots of sports activities such as intramural teams and rec sports as well as classes for yoga, swimming, cycling, etc. All of which are always happening and always fun. Their are lots of different clubs, if you can name it there's definitely a club for it. Their is also always fun things going on on campus. A lot of the time their is live performers or music and free food going on.",
            "VCU is great for anybody! Their is something here for everyone. I have visited many different colleges but none is as diverse as VCU as.",
            "None that I can think of.",
            "VCU is definitely worth the money. It's about average for a normal in state university tuition, definitely not above average. The money you spend actually goes into new school buildings, new professors, new books, etc. I know this because I have seen several new buildings being built in my time here. Absolutely worth it!",
            "One of the best things about VCU is its location. Located in the heart of a big city there's always something fun to do. There's lots of restaurants, shopping, museums, parks, the river, clubs, events. You can never be bored here like you could in a simple college town.",
            "VCU has added lots of yummy new places recently to add on to the other great choices they had. You name it, you can get it somewhere on campus with your campus money. Plus, their is a separate type of campus money for little restaurants on/right outside of campus that aren't a part of the actual dining plan. So you can use your VCU card to eat at places like Five Guys, Qdoba, Tropical Smoothie etc.",
            "No one wants to live in a small room with a stranger and share a bathroom with an entire hall of people for a year but VCU definitely helps make the best of it. VCU offers lots of suite style dorms that give more personal space and more private bathrooms where you share with 3-4 people as opposed to an entire hall. Dorms in general are a great way to meet new people and learn new things. Looking back on dorm life I'm glad I did it even though I absolutely did not want to when I was going into it.",
            "It all depends on the classes you take. Obviously if you sign up for a 400 level Biology class it's going to be more challenging than a 100 level art class. The professors are great and incredibly helpful so either way you should do fine!",
            "Learn the campus as well as the city! Their are so many fun things on and off of campus that I had no idea about until my third year. So many fun things to do in Richmond that will expand on what you learn in your classes.",
            "A very diverse, fun, and different school that isn't like your typical college campus as it is placed in the middle of a big city. VCU provides many different opportunities, that are easy to learn about, for all different people. Not only is it a fantastic place academic wise, but it is also a great place for college students to learn to branch out on their own."

Its our pride and joy and has always been since 1985., 1033473=If you want to feel safe, sign up for Crime Alert on your cellular device. The moment something goes down at VCU or any area around the campuses, the police are there to inform you what is going on and if the situation continues to be dangerous. Late at night you can witness many cops patrolling the area for any suspicious activity. There are phones places around campus with a bright flashing red light that can be used in emergency situations. Also, the VCU emergency contact number is easy to remember. It is simply the area code (828) and 1234., 231363=This is my first year at VCU as a Criminal Justice major and let me say for my first semester I have learned a tremendous amount! The professors are very involved and excited about the opportunity to pour their knowledge into the students. When I first came in August 2011 I kept telling myself that there is no way that a professor is going to have time and the patience to meet one on one with a student i needed out of a class of 200 plus students. I was completely wrong! For the first semester I have had the pleasure to meet with each one of my professors to discuss ways that would help me excel in the class. This helped me settle into the academic part of college much easier. I have learned about distant cultures in my human societies and globalization class that I had no idea existed. I have also had the chance to have many open discussions on many great books that have been written in my textual analysis class. I feel as if I have gained a great amount of knowledge in one semester. Virginia Commonwealth University prides itself on being there for the students and faculty and creating a unique learning experience. In VCU doing that I have learned a lot., 786904=The list could go on and on, but I'll list a few of my favorites: 1) Go to Carytown: an awesome area just a short bus ride away with many shops, restaurants, and events. 2) Go to Basketball games: VCU has an excellent Division 1 program, competing with the best in the country. Flip on CBS in March, and you'll see us shock the world! 3) Hang out in the Commons: There are places to eat, an underground games area, and even a theater playing recent hits every weekend., 295385=There is a new tradition that started in 2010 where during orientation, the new students touch the Ram Horns outside of Commons. After doing so, they make a wish., 71427=After visiting VCU the first few times, I felt like I still needed some more info on the schools abilities. After orientation however, I can comfortably say I'm going to get a good education here. The way the freshmen experience is designed revolves around acclimating students to the college experience, building fundamental skills that will see us through the next four years. The only reason I won't give a five star for this category is because I still need to find out first hand when classes start in August., 1070436=The food in the dining hall is great. There are chain restaurants, like Subway, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell or individual restaurants like Stir Crazy. All of them are delicious. If you don't want to eat on campus, Richmond has nothing but amazing restaurants. The entire street that Village is on smells incredible, I'm disappointed that I didn't get to eat there while I was on campus. By 1:00, there was a line out the door and down the street for Village, and I could certainly smell why., 581654=This is a great university located in the city of Richmond, VA. I have attended here since 2006 and its is been a great experience. I am currently working on my master degree., 702372=VCU is very well known for having the best student section when it comes to our Men's Basketball team. Our Men's Basketball team has made Final Four in 2011., 786191=We have a homecoming week from the 27th of January to the 2nd of February, but the oddest thing I have ever seen was the Nearly-Naked Mile., 415783=There are literally over 1000 clubs here, we have clubs for absolutely everything it will blow your mind. We even have a Quidditch club, you know from Harry Potter? Lol honestly, there's something here for everyone., 909259=The food is great for the most part. When you get on campus for the first time, youll want to try almost everything, and there are swipes you can use from your meal plan. After while, of course, you will get kindof tired of eating almost the same kind of foods all the time. If you're trying to eat healthy, there are some options to choose from, but there are mostly fast food places, like chick fil a, and pizza hut. There is also going to be a Taco bell coming soon to Monroe park campus Fall 2013, 948803=Shafer Dining center has GREAT options for everyone. Although the quality of the taste of the food isn't the best, all of the food items are fully cooked and don't break any health violations. And they have an all day cereal bar, which is always great if you don't like anything else. Along with Shafer, the Student Commons also has several dining options such as Chick-fil-A, an Asian-style Stir Fry, a Taco Bell, and even more to come in 2013. There are also amazing restaurants around the campus! Many of them being hole-in-the-wall places. And a lot of the joint restaurants actually take meal swipes on certain days -- such as IHOP., 11330=The area is so much fun! I am living in one of the dorms on campus, and if you decided that dorm life isn't for you, it's okay. However, it is much easier to live here and go to the midnight breakfasts in Safer Court Dining Center. Or to participate in the Ram Ex-Scream at 9:00PM, when all you have to do is cut through an ally (that's well lit) and you're there., 21383=VCU School of the Arts is ranked by U.S. News and World Report as both the 1st public college art program and the 4th overall in the United States. Since being here, I certainly see why. However, it is still one of the cheapest ones around. VCU's art program has challenged me more than even my AP art class did. I like the curriculum here, too. During freshman year all potential art majors are in Art Foundation and start off running. This semester I had two studio classes, an art projects class, an art history class, and another honors art class. Next semester will again be two studio classes, one art projects class, and an art history class. In March of freshman year we then declare our top three choices for our art concentration. By exposing students to this much art as freshman, we can better see where our interests and strengths lie. By the end of Spring Semester freshman year, we then know in which discipline we will be placed, determining which specific curriculum we will pursue for the rest of our time at VCU. This makes a lot of sense to me, as art is a field in which a person must be passionate and really like what he is doing. The toughness of the curriculum early on allows students to see if this is what one really want to do for the rest of his life. If not, then the switch to another major can be made early in the college career. Since VCU is a large university of over 32,000 students, it offers a wide variety of activities. Finally, with Richmond as one of the cultural centers of Virginia, something happens there all of the time. In short, VCU and Richmond: something for everybody! Just look!, 160376=Shafer Dining Court is the major hub for undergraduates that operates on a swipe system. The food is pretty good, and they do have variety throughout the week. However, please keep in mind that after a few years you will get bored of it! There are many many other options on campus, including Subway, Pizza Hut, Commons Grab and Go, Chick Filet, Cary Street Wraps, Bleacker Street, and Jonahs on the MCV Campus. You will definitely find your favorite spots on campus! Also, I have heard that there will be a Taco Bell and Burger King opening in the Fall 2013 semester, if that is something that makes you excited :)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I don't have to tell you that VCU is quite a large university. Especially within the first few years here, most of one's classes will be larger lecture classes. Even so, all the professors I've had have let it be known to the students that they're open for individual consulting as long the student is willing to make it happen. Like at any university, a VCU student will realize how to learn based mostly on their own capabilities. The professors will provide you with a firm foundation of the material but ultimately, it's in the students hands how far to excel with the material. What I love about the professors at VCU is that they are still there for students, despite the enormity of some of the classes.
