    "textBeforeTable": "Another way to save on rail tickets in Russia is to take advantage of the seasonal indexations of domestic rail tariff in Russia. The 2015 table ('kupe' and 'lux' carriages) looks like this: RZD also offers special price for tickets bought in advance (\"Plan in Advance\") for upper berths in 'kupe'. When buying tickets 45-31 days in advance passenger receives 30% discount (with trains departing between 12.01 \u2013 29.04 & 14.09 \u2013 23.12.2015) or 15% discount (departures 30.04 \u2013 07.05 & 10.05 \u2013 13.09.2015). However at the same time ticket purchase less than 10 days in advance will make the ticket more expensive (5-10%) Since 2013 Russian Railways (RZD) introduced new ticket fare scheme for rail journeys within Russia. In brief, early ticket purchase ensures cheaper price. So when potantial passenger buys ticket 60-45 days in advance (--> ticket sale start for Russian domestic tickets) he or she will pay the lowest possible fare. However passenger buying the same ticket on the day of departure will pay higher price compared to the standard base tariff. At the moment such \"dynamic\" price scheme works for couple dozen of major routes (e.g. Moscow-Saint Petersburg-Moscow, Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod-Moscow, Moscow-Voronezh-Moscow, Moscow-Smolensk-Moscow, Moscow-Adler-Moscow, Moscow-Ekaterinburg-Moscow, Moscow-Kazan-Moscow, Moscow-Kislovodsk-Moscow, Saint Petersburg-Nizhny Novgorod-Saint Petersburg, Saint Petersburg-Voronezh-Saint Petersburg, Vladivostok-Khabarovsk etc.) \u00a0 Discounts, special offers &",

For instance journey on one of the most popular travel routes from Moscow to Vladivostok on the well-known Russian train Rossija (#1/2) lasts 145 hours and 9259 km, while ticket for such experience in 'kupe' carriage costs around 20k rubles (~400 euro) one way, expensive isn't it? However there are some tricks on how it is possible to save money on such long distance travels in Russia. One is international train tickets for domestic Russian journeys, best deal here comes probably from Slovakia. Slovak Railwys (ZSSK) sell special CityStar ticket to Russia, which under certain conditions",
