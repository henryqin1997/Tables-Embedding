Mr. Blade reported these facts for the 1860 Slaveholder Schedule fro Troup County. The 1860 Census did not mention the names of African Americans unless they were Free. The 1860 for Troup County only had thirty-seven free Blacks listed. The 1860 Slave Schedule listed the names of the Slaveholders, but not the names of the slaves. This exhibit shows those Slaveholders to enable researchers to find evidence of an ancestor through the slaveholder data.\u00a0 By finding surname of the Slaveholder, a researcher may then examine the actual slave schedule for additional information gender and age of the slaves.",
