            "great bang for the buck! especially if you're a ca resident and on fa. i'm so glad i left private college to knock out ge here. the campus makes me feel like i'm at a university. love it!",
            "the planetarium is top notch. plenty of on-campus plays, clubs, etc. i understand the athletic facility is great too with a good pool but haven't checked it out personally.",
            "the dining room is modern, well lit, and huge. the cafeteria food offers a decent selection and most of the food is ok. plenty of hookups for computers and a lively student atmosphere.",
            "srjc is considered one of the top junior colleges in the country and much of the academics reflect that. attendance, reading, writing, and on-time assignments are mandatory if you expect good grades. not for slouchers. there are some adjunct teachers that aren't that good and are impossible to get good grades from, favorites, etc. check above site for advice.",
            "purchase your books online rather than the campus bookstore. i used amazon text books and directtextbook mostly. be sure to check out future instructors on www.ratemyprofessors.com. apply for fa early and keep checking back.",
            "i highly recommend this junior college. it is acknowledged as one of the best in the country and modern, if not advanced, curriculum has a good selection. state of the art facilities: technology, library, sciences, etc. the campus is gorgeous and looks like a 100 year old university."
