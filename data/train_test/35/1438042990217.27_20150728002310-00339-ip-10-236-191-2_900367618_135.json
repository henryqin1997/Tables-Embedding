Game days or days of remembrance: Purple out- all the students wear their JMU purples to support., 422003=The first week of the fall semester for freshman is a blast. It's called 1787 week and you learn so much. It's also the place where you meet many people who will be your friends for the year. There are tons of fun activities to do and things to see on top of the important matters. Football games are always fun to attend, but perhaps one of the best places to be is on the quad. It's a gorgeous environment, surrounded by the old bluestone buildings (well, they're actually gray but they are called bluestone). In December, there is a special Christmas tree lighting ceremony which is absolutely fabulous., 192845=At the University of James Madison, founded in 1908, I, Joshua Roach am being transformed and molded by the renewing of my mind every semester I enroll for courses at the mighty Madison. Focusing on Law, while majoring in Justice Studies, my american tools are sharpened in the class rooms of my minor, Political Science. Focusing on eighteenth century philosopher's such as Socrates, Thoreau, Aristotle, and Tolstoy. I try to model their efforts to society by volunteering in the elementary and middle schools, mentoring and tutoring high school students, public speaking for peace, planning and participating in vigils for the memory of 9/11, and participating in the James Madison University, Moot Court., 16654=Football games are full of traditions! Every time there is a touchdown the entire student section throws purple and gold streamers! It makes for a really cool effect. Also, our freshman orientation is probably one of the most amazing experiences every student has here. It's called 1787 and each freshman is assigned to a group that lives in their dorm and they go around and go to presentation and do fun activities. It's a really good way for everyone to make friends and really get to know the campus., 382855=1787 is a week long freshman year orientation where most schools have orientation for only a couple of days. FROG week is the best week ever!, 437336=Living freshman year in a dorm was my favorite year. I met a lot of people and everything on campus was easily accessible. My building didn't have air conditioning but it was tolerable for the year except when moving in during August., 436042=Speaking of best value, with the current state of the economy, it is pertinent that schools offer an education at an affordable price. JMU placed at No. 19 nationally in The Kiplinger 100, a listing of best values in public colleges \u00e2?? schools that deliver a stellar education at an affordable price \u00e2?? published in the February 2011 issue of Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine., 471475=During August 1787 orientation week, get to know your First Year Orientation Guides and use them for help and answers about the campus. Make sure you stay on top of classes and go to the library to study! It is a great place to stay focused and get work done early., 694269=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I started off with five luck-of-the-draw classes. They were all challenging and all required a lot of work but I never really had to push myself. However, my grades weren't the highest of any of my classes either. JMU has a great college atmosphere and you just have to be wary that it doesn't take away from your work ethic.

Students are challenged by the classes, and forced to really work for their grades. So if you're up to it, you'll receive a great education at a great school. Tips for prospective students Definitely tour the campus and get a feel for yourself.",
