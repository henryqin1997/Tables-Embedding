            "All students! there are many diffrent types of people that i have met while at Miami and all have enjoyed their time here.",
            "Study! don't let the glamour of Miami keep you from your studies! although uptown is fun don't go too much or your bank account will deplete quickly. Bring christmas lights for your room in the winter months! Comfortable shoes are a must. Some Classes can be a good 15 minute walk although by bike your time could be cut in half with ease. Enjoy your time here! my first semester has gone by way to quickly! Get involved with school activities their are plenty to choose from and its a great way to meet new people.",
            "Miami has a great learning program that really does focus on the students. The food is AMAZING and the dorms are kept in great shape along with the bathrooms. The campus is beautiful and has a nice green and lively atmosphere.",
            "Although Miami University has the nickname J-Crew U for its preppy appearal i have found that its not that prominant. There are still girls and guys that go to classes in pj's and in sweats. Although their is a good amount of people who dress up there are twice as many who don't. If you want to party there is always the option (just like any college you choose) however i feel that it isn't as focused on like at some other universities. There is always something to do! The rec is really nice and uptown is always a nice place to chill with friends. All the dorms also have nice common areas which are great for meeting people, especially at the begining of the year.",
            "All of the professors are very approachable after class and before, along with office hours they hold. If you aren't grasping a section well or just lost in general they work their best to help explain the subects. Review sessions taught by other students who have taken the class before are also available for free and can allow for another explination from someone other then a professor. I found this usefull when the method my professor used was not making sense to me. Miami has plenty of resourses such as the writing centers located in the new Farmer School of Business and King library."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{399283=Green Beer Day during the first week of March., 47589=Being at Miami, I have learned more than I expected. One reason being that every student is required to take Miami Plan courses, which contribute to Miami's liberal style of education. Not only have I learned more in college than I did high school, but the Miami Plan allows me to take a variety of different classes and learn things that I would not normally learn if I were to take classes that only pertained to my major/minor. For example, I took a southeast Asian art class fall semester 2010 and ended up learning about the different styles of art and along with the religions that go with them: Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. The second reason for my increased knowledge is quality of teaching that Miami provides. U.S. News rated Miami #2 in undergraduate teaching, meaning that the professors compare to those of some of the most prestigious schools in the country. In my experiences, the professors are a fantastic resource because they really focus on making sure that the students understand the information provided to them. Thus, I have been able to learn more in my classes and I feel vastly more educated than I did a year ago as a result of my professors being a great resource. What I love about Miami is how education can roll outside of the classroom. Miami offers undergraduate research, which is a very rare opportunity in undergraduate education. There are also seminars and guest speakers that visit Miami all the time. This past year, the Dalai Lama visited and spoke to students and other guests, which was extremely educational because I was able to learn things from a religious leader's perspective., 768648=On campus are various seals that you can NEVER step on or fail your exams, there is a sundial in the center of campus that you're supposed to rub before your exams to ensure you ace them, but the best (and maybe cutest) of all is the famous arch. On valentines day especially, it is said that if you kiss someone under the Upham Hall archway then you two will be happily in love forever. Needless to say, there is always a line there on February 14th. Then there is a somewhat shocking reality on campus, the sport of choice here is not football, basketball or the usual high school stars--it's hockey. Nationally ranked nearly every year, Miami Hockey is a very, very big deal. Every student waits in line for days before each home game to get tickets and cheer on the Redhawks., 445101=Being that it's an old school, Miami has many traditions. 1809, remember that. That's the year Miami was founded. Commit it to memory. DO NOT STEP ON THE SEAL. It doesn't matter if you fail your next exam or not. It's a matter of respect. So just don't. If you've found love at this school (and you might since our marriage rate is 33%) make sure to give your sweetheart a kiss under the Upham Arch at midnight and you'll be sure to tie the knot. Oh, and if your a male student living in Peabody Hall, watch out for Helen Peabody, or rather her ghost, she's not a fan of guys., 494559=If you want to know where you will be living prior to three weeks before move-in, I would suggest finding a roommate and not going random because they won't give out random roommates until the end of July., 819004=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 677076=Overall, the food is good, but by the end of second semester you never want to eat it again. Try the salads at Dividends in the Farmer School of Business-- they are my favorite! Also, Bell Tower and 1809 are good places to eat on campus with the meal plan! I try to avoid the all you can eat dining halls as much as possible., 504045=Our school was established in 1809, so there are many traditions on this campus. Take a tour, or look on the website to look at all the cool history we have.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Login to rate or flag the reviews Demitrios from Chicago, IL 11/08/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 12 out of 13 people found this review useful. 2 of 167 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students here are strikingly similar. There is a reason Miami is labeled J. Crew U. Almost all are upper-middle class and affluent, and a high percentage of the student population is caucasian. However, students are typically well-rounded, generally show support for Miami athletics, friendly and open-minded. I think anyone could fit in here. Tips for prospective students 1. Bringing a bike might be a good idea as it makes going uptown or even traveling to class more manageable. 2. Get involved early on--there are numerous organizations and clubs and it is a great way to meet people. 3. Explore the beautiful and scenic Ohio landscape surrounding the campus. 4. Don't expect a lot from the town--the university is the town. Bang for the buck As an out-of-state student,",
