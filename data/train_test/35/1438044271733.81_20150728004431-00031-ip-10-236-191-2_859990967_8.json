The specific VKA was given by the investigator based on local standard of practice. For all subjects randomized to receive VKA, the investigator assessed if a parenteral anticoagulant drug, particularly before cardioversion, was needed as bridging therapy with VKA as standard of care (until target INR was achieved). The duration depended on the cardioversion strategy. For subjects in the Direct Cardioversion Strategy, cardioversion was performed within 1-5 days after randomization. VKA was given for 1-5 days before it and for 42 days thereafter. Subjects in the Delayed Cardioversion Strategy received VKA for 21 (+4) to 56 (+4) days before cardioversion and for 42 days thereafter. The investigator assessed if long-term anticoagulation was warranted and treated the subject according to standard of care or not. Then subjects entered 30-day follow-up period. Vitamin K Antagonist (VKA) Subjects randomized to treatment with rivaroxaban received rivaroxaban 20 milligram (mg) orally once daily. Subjects with moderate renal impairment [i.e., Creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30 to 49 milliliter per minute (mL/min), inclusive] at screening received the adjusted dose of 15 mg once daily. The duration of the treatment period for a given subject depended on the cardioversion strategy. For subjects",
