    "textBeforeTable": "Table 36-2 Default Roles for a Framework Application Framework applications provide several default application roles that cannot be deleted (Table 36-2). 36.4.2.1.1 Default Application Roles Application roles and permissions defined within a Framework application are stored in its policy store and, consequently, only apply to the application and do not imply any other permissions within the WebCenter Portal domain or other domains. Enterprise roles are different; enterprise roles are stored within the application's identity store and do not imply any permissions within the application. Section 36.4.2.2.3, \"Understanding Enterprise Group Role Mapping\" Section 36.4.2.2.2, \"Discussion Server Role Mapping\" Section 36.4.2.2.1, \"Application Permissions\" Section 36.4.2.1.2, \"Custom Application Roles\" Section 36.4.2.1.1, \"Default Application Roles\" Application role assignment is the responsibility of the application administrator. Administrators can assign members a default application role or create additional, custom roles specific to their application. For more detail, see: 36.4.2.1 Understanding Application Roles Section 36.4.2.2, \"Understanding Application Permissions\" Section 36.4.2.1, \"Understanding Application Roles\" Application roles control the level of access a user has to resources and services in a Framework application. This section describes application roles and permissions and includes the following subsections: 36.4.2 Understanding Application Roles and Permissions",
    "textAfterTable": "36.4.2.1.2 Custom Application Roles Custom application roles (sometimes known as user-defined roles) are specific to your Framework application. When setting up the application, it is the administrator's job to identify which application roles are required, choose suitable role names, and define the responsibilities of each role. For example, an education environment might require roles such as Teacher, Student, and Guest. While roles such as Finance, Sales, Human Resources, and Support would be more appropriate for a corporate environment. To learn how to set up applications roles for users, see Section 36.4.4.1, \"Defining Application Roles.\" 36.4.2.2 Understanding Application Permissions Every application role has specific, defined capabilities known as permissions. These permissions allow individuals to perform specific actions within the application. Note that no permission, inherits privileges from other permissions. This section contains the following subsections: Section 36.4.2.2.1, \"Application Permissions\" Section 36.4.2.2.2, \"Discussion Server Role Mapping\" Section 36.4.2.2.3, \"Understanding Enterprise Group Role Mapping\" 36.4.2.2.1 Application Permissions Permissions are categorized as follows and listed individually in the Table 36-3: Application Mashup Styles Content Presenter Templates Skins Task Flows",
