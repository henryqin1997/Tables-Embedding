            "Whether you have had orange and blue running through your veins since before you were born, or you've recently decided to become a Gator, there is a place at UF for everyone. It is a school for hardworking students who want to learn and who want a great college experience simultaneously!",
            "Check out the different majors and programs UF offers before you sign up for classes so you know which classes you'll need. Do this especially if you are unsure of your major-you don't want to switch and end up behind in the program. Once you're here, take a day to explore campus and the bus system. The best way to learn where each bus goes is to get on one and ride the route. Look up class buildings before the first class, write the names down, and be sure to bring your map. Be aware of the resources available to students at UF. A good way to do this is to enroll in First Year Florida. If not, be prepared to do a lot of research on your own time. Use all resources available to you-office hours, tutoring, study groups, etc. and keep up with all your work. Classes at UF are tough, but good grades are possible with hard work. Get involved in different student groups-at least one related to your area of study, but don't limit yourself to that. UF has over 900 organizations-find one that fits you!",
            "Florida has the cheapest in-state tuition in the United States, and UF costs relatively little compared to most schools of the same quality. Most students are on Florida's Bright Futures Scholarship, and most also are on some sort of merit or need-based financial aid. Housing, food, and books are the biggest hidden costs.",
            "Gainesville has a lot to do for such a small town. Gator Athletic events are not only for the weekends-while Gator Football is on Saturdays during the fall, basketball takes place throughout the week during the winter, as does lacrosse, tennis, soccer, and other sports. There's also intramural teams that anyone can play on. UF offers free movies at the Reitz Union most nights, and there are several facilities for exercise and outdoor activities. Lake Wauberg, Ginnie Springs, and Ichetucknee are all popular destinations for water activities and cookouts. There's lots of great local restaurants to try and stores to peruse.",
            "I am a student in the College of Engineering and the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. Every undergraduate department of Gator Engineering is ranked in the top 10 in the nation-it's definitely the best school in Florida overall for engineering. Classes are tough, but professors and teaching assistants always make themselves available to help you, plus there is lots of free tutoring available on campus. UF is a research institution, so many of the professors that you have in class are participating in breakthrough research, and as a result, students can participate and learn about up-and-coming technologies. Also, UF brings many renowned guest speakers to campus every semester. While classes are necessary and informative, you learn the most from extracurricular experiences and research or internship positions."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors. Aim for an SAT and ACT score within their middle 50% (somewhere between a 1900 and 2100 for the SAT and 27-31 for the ACT) or better, and make sure to take many rigorous classes in high school. Also, show a passion for attending UF in your essays or elsewhere on your application., 582346=i guess we're safe... there's blue emergency lights scattered around the campus, a separate police dept for uf, and scan-card dorms, but rapings and suspects with guns have been reported to the students via email and text just in fall 2011. oh and some shots fired... but i haven't seen anything, which is good. just make smart choices. the person who got raped, got in the car for a ride to campus with an elderly male she didn't know., 613241=there is so much to do at the university of florida! in the reitz union there is a game room with a bowling alley which is always a lot of fun. uf also has gator nights every friday night, where students can go to the reitz union for free and partake in a bunch of activities including midnight breakfast. they also show movies in the reitz union on fridays. there are also about 1000 clubs at uf as well as multiple sororities and fraternities. lastly the gator nation is very big on football. there's nothing like being in the swamp cheering on the gators with your gator family., 911913=There are numerous blue light emergency posts everywhere on campus, and guarantee police assistance within 60 seconds of when the button was pushed. A free snap transportation service is provided, which gives students a ride anywhere on campus after 3:00 AM., 49808=UF is one of the top 50 universities in the US and a great education for a tuition of about $4000 a year and housing is about $2000 for each semester is an amazing deal. If you received Bright Futures you really only have to pay for housing (and of course books and food.) UF also has many research opportunities with top-rated professors available for undergraduates., 48916=Apply as early as possible, way before the November 1st deadline. The earlier you apply, the earlier you can apply for housing (if you are planning on living on campus.) I find that living on campus is really convenient, where you can literally wake up ten minutes before your class and still make it. Off campus has it's perks but it costs about the same as on campus housing and you have to take the bus (which are often times always late.) I suggest living on campus for at least your first year. Also, UF seems to emphasize this quite a lot but GET INVOLVED! Try something new! Get new experiences!, 820345=There are over 1000 student organizations, if we don't have the one you are looking for it is extremely easy to create one yourself., 611633=the university of florida has about 1000 clubs with everything from a quidditch team to clubs for intramural sports., 939581=Dorms are not my thing. I stayed in them and sharing a bathroom with many girls is not what I enjoy. A plus for dorms is that you can meet a lot of people and you are right on campus so classes will be closer, as long as your 7:30 class isn't on the opposite side of campus, you will be able to enjoy every second of sleep., 502966=The campus is gorgeous (besides the weather in August and September, but that's horrible everywhere in Florida)! For being such a large university, it's really easy to get involved in organizations., 322695=The French Fries is a favorite sculpture near the Marston Science Library done by artist John Henry that was placed on campus in February 1989. Though the actual name of the piece is Alachua, named for the county which the city of Gainesville calls home, it still remains a notorious landmark often referred to when giving directions to campus visitors and Freshman. Another popular sculpture around campus, The Potato, is located near Turlington Hall and serves as a popular meeting point. Krishna Lunch, a full vegetarian meal, is served daily in the Plaza of the Americas for dirt cheap, and it is delicious!, 246201=Home to almost 1000 campus organizations, UF offers something for every student that attends. From greek life to skydiving to intramurals, almost anything you can think of will probably exist at the University., 172699=Like I previously mentioned, there are almost 1000 clubs and just about anything you can think of. There are tons of intramural sports and workout facilities all over campus!}",

Also great for those who like getting involved and are very school spirited. Tips for prospective students Definitely get involved with whatever organization/group you can. It will help you get over the whole idea of being away from home. Make sure you study for classes and don't wait until the last minute cause you will regret it. I would recommend living on campus for the first year but not wasting your money on the meal plan. Bang for the buck One of the least expensive state schools in Florida and also one of the cheapest housing areas in",
