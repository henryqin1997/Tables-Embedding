The amount of equalization is typically from 3% to 20% of battery capacity as determined by the evaluation process described above. Ct =Cr +Cc =82.1719+19.9=102.0719 amp.-hrs. Cr =AED/SR=328.69/4=82.1719 amp.-hrs. AED=AEDR\ufffd2 v.=328.69 amp.-hrs. AEDR=Iav /Sbv =10.518/0.064=164.344 amp.-hrs./v. The microprocessor is programmed to detect the occurrence of n consecutive positive acceleration values following a negative acceleration value (where the value of n is, for example, 5). After n consecutive positive values have been detected, the microprocessor averages the last three values to determine the value of Sbv to be used in the battery evaluation. In the above example, five consecutive positive values occurred between 90 and 110 minutes, and the average of the last three values was 0.064 volt/hr2. The values of Iav and Cc in the above example were 10.518 amp. and 19.9 amp-hrs., respectively. Thus, the battery capacity was evaluated as follows: The voltage values in column 2 of the above table were sampled by the microprocessor at five-minute intervals. The slope values",
