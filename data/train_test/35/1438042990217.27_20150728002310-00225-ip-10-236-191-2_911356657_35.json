            "Dorm life is not bad, it can get loud on the weekends but it is always pretty quite when it needs to be. The rooms are a good size and are clean. A bit expensive though.",
            "The teachers have workable office hours around our schedules and there are always tutors there to help and the library is open till late.",
            "Study very hard and don't get into the major party scene.",
            "The campus is wonderful and very picturesque. The Chemistry Department is not the best but overall a great staff is there to help. The food is good and continues to get better."

Am enjoying being here Getting to know your professors and having them know you is great! Also the students are wonderful. Am learning a lot For me being a Music student I enjoying the small ratio of teacher to student. This allows me to expand my knowledge and grow as a musician.
