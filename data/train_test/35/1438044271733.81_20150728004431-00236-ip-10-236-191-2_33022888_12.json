Community services \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the area of industry covered by the decision \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are undoubtably underfunded. And most probably undervalued by the members of the public who have no need to access the services (which realistically is many of us). The really interesting thing about the decision of course was the finding by the panel that the industry is not simply underfunded due to public apathy or government stinginess, but also partly due to the gender makeup of the workforce. That is, that a significant reason for the paltry salaries in the industry is because most of the workforce is female. Gender inequality.
