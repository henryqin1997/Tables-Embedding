Agreed. I just don't understand why the photographer wouldn't simply say \"sorry, I'm not available that day, but I can recommend X Y Z photographer in the area\". Leave it at that. No reason, no complication. Why one would insist on hiring a photographer who obviously wouldnt perform his best is beyond me. mgblack74 wrote:",
