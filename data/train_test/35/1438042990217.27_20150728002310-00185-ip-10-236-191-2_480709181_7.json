    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. For example, above are described various alternative examples of different adjustable line locks. It is appreciated that various features of the line locks can be mixed and matched to form a variety of other alternatives. As such the described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. While the present invention has application to any need for securing a line, it is particularly advantages to surgical suture applications as a way to conveniently and reliable replace the need to tie suture knots. The advantage is even greater in arthroscopic and endoscopic applications, where sophisticated sliding knots followed by \u201cback-up\u201d knots must be tied outside of a cannula and slid into final position at an internal body site. The sophisticated sliding knots are difficult to tie, time consuming, and bulky. The present invention provides an easy to apply, quick to deliver, and low profile solution that will reliably maintain the desired suture tension. The present invention has particular relevance to surgery, and more particularly to tissue retention through the use",
