It's a custom melee set that you get from upgrading silver armor, +3 gold bars and 1500 souls., 17977=All ammo has a max stack of 2000, by request., 60249=Main WIP Thread (lots of back-history): http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/wip-the-story-of-red-cloud.81528/, 39732=Mana Crystals are now crafted with 2 fallen stars and 1000 Dark Souls at Demon Altars., 35333=Added Yorai's MP-only Serverside Saving & Commands (SSS) mod to the Optional Mods Folder. Highly recommended for use with Multiplayer, in case of unexpected crashes or disconnects. You can manually force a save with /save when needed, in addition to other great features. Link to official mod thread here: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/multiplayer-only-serverside-saving-commands.102254/, 48186=Jungle Wyvern now drops a set of Necro armor plus 2000 more Dark Souls., 45875=Reduced soul cost of Slime Talisman from 1000 souls to 200 souls., 34737=Added Anomaly0.01's amazing custom sandbox adventure map \"Elfheim: An Exploration Map\" to the Sandbox Maps folder. This is a MUST-PLAY with the Dark Souls (Sandbox Edition) mod turned on! It is truly a wonderful map with incredible art direction on-par with the style and quality of The Story of Red Cloud map (if no one minds me saying so). :) The map uses an open, no rules sand-box format and everything in the Dark Souls mod is accessible. Give it a try and share your impressions. A let's play of this map/mod combo would also be excellent. Go here to visit the map's official thread: http://www.terrariaonline.com/threads/elfheim-an-exploration-map.102894/}",
    "textBeforeTable": "First Previous Next Last 1.0.8.8 Increased the difficulty of some bosses on Normal, Hard and Evil modes. Reduced the difficulty of the final boss on Evil mode. Added a few \"sequence-breaking\" changes to the map, so that game progression is more linear where it should be. Updated the mod to tConfig v27.1, which includes the source files for those than want to recompile the mod for future updates or want to edit the mod for their own enjoyment. Other minor changes, including some item placement changes or additions in a couple spots, and opened up the first EoW arena. Also removed a couple hearts from the first two dungeons. Moved the 2 additional magic mirrors to different locations so they are not immediately available. Added the newest Dual Wielding mod which is crash-bug free. Hurray! Made spikes and hellstone brick do the same amount of damage as you gain more defense (thanks Yorai) so the 6th and final dungeon provides the intended difficulty. Added the Piggy Bank to most Save Points so that you have both the Piggy Bank and Safe to use for storage at most Save Points. Reduced the number of Greater Healing Potions across the map. Sharks no longer dro If you are playing with the Dark Souls (Digging Allowed) version of the mod, I highly recommend using",
