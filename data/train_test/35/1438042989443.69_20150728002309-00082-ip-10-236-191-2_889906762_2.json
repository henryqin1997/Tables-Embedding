    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{1846=Goaltending was the key component that kept the Ottawa Senators in the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoff conversation. Craig Anderson was a magician in between the pipes, leading the NHL in GAA for much of the season and making dazzling saves in high volumes over the course of the season. Because of their depth at the position, the Senators made a trade deadline move with the Tampa Bay Lightning to acquire young scoring threat Cory Conacher. They're hoping some young energy, paired with playoff veterans like Captain Daniel Alfredsson and Sergei Gonchar, will help the Senators defeat bitter national rival Montreal Canadiens. The cities are close together geographically and the fans despise the other franchise. This will be a tightly contested and bitter seven-game showdown. Can the Ottawa Senators continue to surprise the analysts and overcome injury to make a 2013 NHL Playoff run?}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{2068=3/18/15: The Ottawa Senators continued their remarkable late season push to get into the playoffs last week by dominating the Montreal Canadiens 5-2. The Sens opted against going with Andrew \"The Hamburglar\" Hammond versus the Boston Bruins, claiming that Craig Anderson gave them the best chance to win. That did not work out, so they went back to The Hamburglar against Montreal. Hammond has been outstanding since getting called up and has not lost a game in regulation. He became the first goalie since 1938 to allow two or less goals in his first nine starts and may be the starter going forward., 8316=1/7/15: The Ottawa Senators finished out the 2014 calendar year with an adequate 15-14-7 record, and a 5-3-2 record in their previous 10 games. While that is above .500, it is not nearly good enough to earn a playoff spot. The Senators have been good at home, posting an 8-4-4 record (somehow only playing 16 home games thus far), but have struggled on the road with a 7-10-3 mark. At some point, they have to play some home games, but not this week as they are in Colorado on Thursday and Arizona on Saturday. The good news is that both of those teams have struggled all season and it is a great chance to pick up four points., 4546=2/18/15: The Ottawa Senators continue to be the definition of average. Through 54 games, they sat at 22-22-10 with an even goal differential. That is not just balancing out of the season, it is ongoing, as they are 4-4-2 in their last 10 games. They have been slightly better at home, with 12 wins versus 9 losses (and five ties). Perhaps they can use that slight home ice advantage this week when the host the Montreal Canadiens tonight and the Florida Panthers on Saturday. The Senators then head to the West Coast for a road trip against some Pacific Division teams.}",
