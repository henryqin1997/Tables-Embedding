    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets From the foregoing description, it should be appreciated that a novel approach for the surgical treatment of glaucoma has been disclosed for reducing intraocular pressure. While the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, the description is illustrative of the invention and is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Various modifications and applications may occur to those who are skilled in the art, without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention, as described by the appended claims and their equivalents. . A pressure monitor 76A is installed at a suitable place adjacent to the fluid supplier source 76, wherein the pressure monitor 76A is sized and configured to monitor the sensing pressure at about the first fluid port 72. In operations, the applicator 3 is inserted through a small opening at the sclera 11 and advanced toward Schlemm's canal using an external visualization aid that is known to one skilled in the art. During the course of the stent delivery phase ab externo, the sensing pressure at the first fluid port 72 reflects the pressures of the sclera 11, Schlemm's canal 22, the trabecular meshwork 21, and the anterior chamber 20 in sequence. In one embodiment, when the sensing pressure continuously increases until reach a plateau at the anterior chamber, it is indicative that the stent is ready to be unloaded from the applicator 3. Appropriate fluids",
