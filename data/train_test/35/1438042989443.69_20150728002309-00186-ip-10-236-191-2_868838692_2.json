Nonetheless, hundreds of randonneurs turned out. And the randonneur division even featured racing, Ren\u00e9 Herse-sponsored Roger Baumann winning over Lheuillier in 52\u00a0hours 19\u00a0minutes.[6], 24812=Since 1991, the starting and finishing point has been in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, 22\u00a0km southwest of Paris., 59354=9 September, 22481=PBP was held every five years between 1956 and 1975, with more participants and less media coverage.[7] From 1948 until the 1980s, the randonneur event included a \"Challenge des Constructeurs\" for the bicycle maker with the three best-placed riders. Ren\u00e9 Herse won this \"Challenge\" every time from 1948 until 1971, and again in 1975. No other builder won the \"Challenge\" more than once.[8], 21222=Three years later, the 1951 event saw a record of 38\u00a0hours 55\u00a0minutes. This is unlikely to fall. It was the last time PBP was raced by professionals and from then on the course used smaller roads and more hills. Maurice Diot set this record. He won a sprint over breakaway companion Eduoard Muller after waiting for Muller to fix a puncture in Trappes, 22\u00a0km from the finish., 16120=The 1901 Paris-Brest was sponsored not only by Le Petit Journal but L'Auto-Velo, edited by Henri Desgrange. For the first time, professionals were segregated from the \"touriste-routier\" group (in which a 65-year-old finished in just over 200\u00a0hours). The newspapers organized a telegraph system to relay results to their Paris presses, and the public followed the exploits of Maurice Garin, who won in just over 52\u00a0hours over 112 other professionals., 23800=American Scott Dickson came third in 1979, though at just less than 49\u00a0hours he was four hours behind the winners. In 1983 he again came third, this time by only one hour. He won his first PBP in 1987 by breaking away in Brest, aided by a tailwind and a few strong riders from the \"touring\" group, which that year started many hours before the \"racing\" group. Dickson also won in 1991 and in 1995., 2378=Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris (PBP) is a long-distance cycling event. It was originally a 1200km bicycle race from Paris to Brest and back to Paris. It is one of the oldest bicycling events still regularly run (the oldest being the Catford CC Hill Climb[citation needed]). The last time it was run as a race was 1951. The next edition of PBP is scheduled from 16th August to 20th August 2015. The start of the ride is scheduled from the national velodrome situated in Saint Cyr-Ecole. Registration for the PBP opens on May 31st 2015, 20488=Owing to World War II, the 1941 PBP was postponed to 1948, when L'Equipe sponsored the event. Of 52 pros, Albert Hendrickx proved strongest, winning in a sprint over fellow Belgian Fran\u00e7ois Neuville., 18063=The 1921 PBP, following World War I, was small, with 43 professionals and 65 touriste-routiers. It was fought between Eug\u00e8ne Christophe and Lucien Mottiat, Mottiat finally prevailing in 55\u00a0hours 7\u00a0minutes., 16782=So many newspapers were sold that G\u00e9o Lef\u00e8vre at L'Auto suggested an even bigger race, the Tour de France. Under Henri Desgrange's leadership, the first Tour happened in 1903., 23449=The randonneur Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris has always allowed women to participate.[9] In 1975, Chantal de la Cruz and Nicole Chabriand lowered the women's time to 57\u00a0hours. In 1979, Suzy de Carvalho finished in 57h02m., 18742=In 1931, there was a change in the regulations. Proposed by Andr\u00e9 Griffe (president of the Union des Audax Cyclistes Parisiens), Desgrange (president of l'Auto) replaced the touriste-routier group by an Audax, where cyclists rode in groups of 10 at an average 20kmh (22.5kmh since 1961)., 17498=The next Paris-Brest was in 1911 and saw pack riding rather than solo breaks. Five riders stayed together until nearly the last control, Emile Georget finally pulling away from Ernest Paul to finish in 50\u00a0hours and 13\u00a0minutes., 24596=The 2007 Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris was the first poor weather event since 1987. It was the worst weather PBP riders had faced since 1956. 30.2% failed to finish. Normally the rate of non-finishers is around 15%., 7808=Participants must first complete a series of brevets (randonneuring events) within the same calendar year as PBP. The time frame is different for Australia and Oceania, so riders can qualify in summer. A series consists of 200\u00a0km, 300\u00a0km, 400\u00a0km and 600\u00a0km. Each can be replaced by a longer ride. Prior to 2007, the qualifying rides had to be completed from shortest to longest., 3448=In 1931 amateur cyclists were separated from professionals. There are two independent long distance bicycle tours. One is the brevet (also called randonn\u00e9e), in which cyclists ride individually. The goal is to make it within 90\u00a0hours, but with no competition. This is held every four years. The other is an audax where cyclists ride in a group, held every five years. So in 1931 there were three independent cycling events, sharing the same route., 55470=The Paris\u2013Brest, a French dessert made of choux pastry and a praline flavoured cream, with a circular shape representative of a tyre or wheel, was reportedly created in 1891 to commemorate the race.[10][dubious \u2013 discuss] It became popular with participants, partly because of its energy-giving high caloric value, and is now found in p\u00e2tisseries all over France.[11], 19521=The 1931 professional event saw victory by Australian Hubert Opperman with a sprint on the finish velodrome after his long solo breakaway was neutralized just outside Paris. Opperman's finishing time was a record 49\u00a0hours 21\u00a0minutes, despite constant rain. His diet included 12\u00a0pounds of celery, which he thought an important energy source (celery's energy content is minuscule, but it may have been a source of fluid and salt)., 24235=Susan Notorangelo set a women's record of 54\u00a0hours 40\u00a0minutes in 1983, but that was obliterated in 1995 when it fell to Brigitte Kerlouet 44\u00a0hours 14\u00a0minutes. American Melinda Lyon finished as first woman in 1999 and 2003. In 2007 the first woman was Christiane Thibault, and in 2011 it was Isabelle Esclangon, both from France., 23206=The Belgian former professional Herman de Munck came 5th in 66, first in 71, 75, 79 and 83. He was disqualified in 79, most believe unfairly. De Munck continues to place highly, finishing the 1999 PBP 109th place at the age of 60.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Professionals[edit] This is an extremely important aspect of randonneuring, where \"riders aim to complete the course within specified time limits, and receive equal recognition regardless of their finishing order.\". So there is no actual \"winner\" but a \"first place finisher\" Although the History of PBP website mentions that half a decade ago PBP started as a race, according to the official PBP website \"the organizers strongly feel that PBP is not a race\". Winners[edit] Since 1991, the starting and finishing point has been in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, 22\u00a0km southwest of Paris. The 2007 Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris was the first poor weather event since 1987. It was the worst weather PBP riders had faced since 1956. 30.2% failed to finish.
