Many questions in the NHANES 1999-2000 MCQ section are also contained in previous NHANES surveys allowing researchers to monitor health trends over time. The NHANES MCQ questionnaire segment is generally modeled on the \"Medical Conditions\" questionnaire section of the U.S. National Health Interview Survey. In accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Survey Integration Plan, a number of questions on health conditions are in fact identical to those used in the redesigned National Health Interview Survey adult and child core sections that started in 1997.}",
