            "This was one of Johnny Thompson's favorite press cameras. He was a White House Official Staff photographer through four administrations from Hoover through the Eisenhower years. He is shown at the right side of the photo at the left with King Edward VIII and Wallis Spencer (when they were the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, after his abdication.) holding the camera in his left hand. This is a Pre-1960 manufactured Graflex, with the side mounted external Kalart Rangefinder. The camera optics are Ektar Eastman Kodak made. This camera is very complete, and functional. Accessories include the battery powered Graflex synchronous flash unit with battery compartment and reflector for Sylvania P25 type flash bulbs. About a dozen unused bulbs are included. Also included is the Polaroid Land 545 film back and six large format two sided film carriers. The condition is near excellent throughout, except the usual signs of routine use. The case is metal reinforced fiber with robust handle, hinges, fittings, snaps, and corner bumpers. It has the original strap, with the buckle showing rust and needing some attention. The case measures approximately 17 by 8 by 10 inches. Here are a number of views of various pieces: Front closed Rear closed Left side Right side Main Optic lens and camera face.

            "This is a very rare US Navy BuOrd Gun Camera Mark VI Mod 3. The camera optics are Fairchild Aerial Corporation made. This exact gun camera was described in the Monday, Oct. 26, 1936 issue of TIME Magazine, the relevant portion is shown below. So advanced are Fairchild's aerial cameras that the company now has the field entirely to itself in the U. S., and its equipment is standard in the civil and military services of no less than 21 for eign lands. Eastman Kodak is quite content to supply film. One growing use for film is in Fairchild's machine-gun camera, an instrument for training combat pilots. It is built, mounted and operated like a machine gun except that a trigger squeeze shoots a number of frames on a 16 mm. cinema film instead of a burst of bullets. After a sham battle, the pilots can see, precisely, where shots would have gone had they been firing a real gun. If there is any argument as to who \"hit\" first, the question is instantly settled by the time recorded to a split second on the film. List price [in 1936! Ed.] of a machine-gun camera : $500. The condition is near excellent throughout, except the usual signs of routine military use and issue markings painted on the body. Here are a number of views of various pieces: Top of the top of the body, showing the data plate and maker marks Left side, showing the frame counter and interior lens Right side, Bottom side and barrel Main Optic lens. Close-up of the Grips and shutter trigger. Close-up showing the objectives and clarity of the mirrors These are the pintle mount and front and rear sights, shown front and rear.",
            "This is a very rare US Navy US/C-3 RCA MI-2558 clandestine submarine commando operations signaling device. The US/C-3 Infrared Signaling Telescope was designed for secure night-time signaling with shipboard infrared-filtered yardarm blinkers US/X-12 or signal searchlights and various beacons. The most common use was as an infrared beacon placed on a landing (or pick-up) site by an Underwater Demolition Team frogman (UDT) team to guide pick-up vessels to the site. The condition is near excellent throughout, except the usual signs of routine military use and issue markings painted on the body. It comes complete with the original fitted hard plastic protective case with instructions applied to the lid. The model number on the data plate is an early version, stamped as MI-2558. This was generally used for the 110 AC model, with MI-2558A and MI-2558F used for the battery powered models. As can be seen, this is the battery version. It uses 2 \"D\" cell (BA-30 or USN Type C) batteries (not included). The battery compartment shows no signs of corrosion. Here are a number of views of various pieces: Top of the eyepiece portion of the body, showing the data plate and maker marks Objective side, showing the interior lens and Schmidt-Cassegrain design Outside, Inside and Instructions on the hard black plastic",
            "This is a Stereoscopes Universal SV.3 cased, with two large spare mirrors and one small spare mirror. The binocular optics are Kershaw made. The applications of photogrammetry are widely spread. Principally, it is utilized for object interpretation (What is it? Type? Quality? Quantity) and object measurement (Where is it? Form? Size?). Aerial photogrammetry is mainly used to produce topographical or thematical maps and digital terrain models While taking the photographs, the airplane flies over a certain area in a meandering way, so that the whole area is covered by overlapping photographs. The overlapping part of each stereo pair can be viewed in 3D and consequently mapped in 3D The condition is near excellent throughout, except the leather carry handle is separated at one side and one of the spare small mirrors is not present. Here are a number of views of various pieces: Top of the wood case, showing the handle and data plate Case open, showing the instrument stowed Case open, the instrument removed. Spare mirrors can be seen in compartments. Close-up of the Kershaw optics from the eyepieces, showing part numbers.
