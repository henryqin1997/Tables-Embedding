Though it gave very little away in terms of real information, it did say, \"Hey folks! Stay tuned for a monumental announcement regarding a brand new, all original TR3 album and nationwide tour! Details to come soon!\" (note to Tim and friends: We're waiting!), 2780=On the road, Reynolds often performs in the name of charitable causes. Alongside Dave Matthews, he appeared on a 2008 album called \"Songs For Tibet,\" an initiative to support Tibet, Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso and to speak out against the human right violations allegedly committed against Tibet by China. Reynolds has also appeared at Farm Aid, and with Matthews, was one of the first musicians to embrace the concept of enabling fans to drive charitable contributions of their choice through his concerts., 2248=The Dave Matthews band went back on the road in North America beginning November 30, 2012 with back-to-back shows at the IZOD Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The final date before the holiday break was a show on December 22 at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. The tour picked up again in 2013, and currently has U.S. dates listed through September 8 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California., 4626=The aforementioned show took place August 9 at Sand Point Park, and was designed to raise awareness of Rotary's mission to provide education, better health, and water to those in need., 3176=Beyond DMB and a highly successful solo career, Reynolds' chance meeting with bass player Mick Vaughn and drummer Dan Martier eventually resulted in the resurrection of the electric TR3. The group has been touring ever since, and in 2009 released their first studio album, \"Radiance.\" The band also has an open taping policy, contending that no two concerts are alike., 4983=The talk of a new album followed TR3's February tour, which hit most of the Eastern shore from South Carolina to Massachusetts, and as far west as Illinois. When that trek wrapped up, Reynolds took a break before announcing his one and only solo show of the year at Titusville, Florida at a fundraiser for Rotary Club of Titusville.}",
