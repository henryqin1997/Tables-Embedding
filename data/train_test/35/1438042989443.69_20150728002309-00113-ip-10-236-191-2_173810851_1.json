It would be interesting to watch our new catcher in pitch framing. Notice the issue with strike calls on the outside to lefties (e.g., Harper). I think last night's call was more a function of everyone (except maybe Bryce) wanting to go home with a 14-2 game and COLD weather\u2013rather than a \"rookie\" strike zone. I wonder if there is anything a hitter can do to counter this optical illusion?pitch framinghttp://www.lookoutlanding.com/2012/8/14/3242786/jose-molina-jesus-montero-pitch-framing, 85612=Amanda Comack:Asked about Rendon this afternoon in San Francisco and whether or not he could possibly be a September call-up, Nationals manager Davey Johnson said \"he might be.\"\"Let's see how he finishes up,\" Johnson said. \"This is the year of the young guys all around baseball. He's another one who's right in that mold\u2026 (But) his main thing is just getting into playing shape.\"Johnson also added: \"As long as he's healthy that stroke of his will hunt on most levels.\", 58021=I still think that Rendon should earn it to be a September callup. I hope he crushes it in Harrisburg! By the way, the only reason Rendon is in the discussion is because he is on the 40 man as part of his draft signing negotiation., 50039=With all our catcher troubles, I never even heard of this guy.Ivany has been with the club since 2005. Never got above AA. They might be making him into a coach. We'll have to see., 152717=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images.

One has to acknowledge if it wasn't for AAA and AA year end call ups, these teams would have never been able to reward their fans with the rewards of victory., 55243=I agree with Peric as Davey has his own power. Rendon is already on the 40 man so it isn't a big deal to do it after September 1st., 63121=Does calling Rendon up in September start the clock on Super 2/Arb status? That could be a consideration \u2013 albeit a SMALL one.No, I don't think it affects it., 125181=Bottom line Natlady. They need the beast and his fielding and his bat more than they need Jayson and his fielding and his bat. And Davey needs to start thinking about resting Harper more \u2026 the fact he doesn't tells me that the other top hitting prospect, Anthony Rendon, will get added to the roster for the playoff run after September 1st., 57239=Does calling Rendon up in September start the clock on Super 2/Arb status?
