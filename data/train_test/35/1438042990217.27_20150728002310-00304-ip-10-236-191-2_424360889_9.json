Sensing a need to revive his career he left Kent at the end of 2011 and moved to Middlesex. But his form continued to be patchy, and in 2014 he regularly found himself left out of the side, as he averaged just 23.35 in the Championship. In three seasons at Lord's, Denly hit only two centuries in all formats of the game. After he was released, he opted to return to Kent to try and reinvigorate his career, hoping to rekindle a highly effective partnership with Rob Key. In the winter of 2014/15, Denly played domestic cricket for Brother Union in Bangladesh., 40322=NBC Denis Compton Award 2006, 32005=Joe Denly looked well placed to establish himself in England's ODI and T20 teams after deservedly earning an international call-up in 2009 - and many thought he might also break into the Test line-up. But five years on, with many top-order batsmen now ahead of him in the queue, those ideas seemed fanciful., 49122=The Cricket Monthly: Few Sri Lankans have been as widely adored.

He served notice of his considerable talent with three half centuries in three Under-19s Tests whilst touring India with England in 2005. He captained both Kent 2nd XI and the ECB Development of Excellence XI team, and scored his maiden first-class hundred against Cambridge University in 2006. Then the release of David Fulton opened up a place in the Kent top order, which Denly took with both hands during the first part of the 2007 season. His prolific form caught the eye of England's selectors and he was named in the England Lions side to face India., 33159=The 2008 summer again kept him in the frame, especially in one-day cricket, where he enjoyed an impressive T20 tournament. But it was in 2009, after averaging 51.85 in the Friends Provident Trophy, that Denly got his international call-up. He had his moments opening the batting, making half-centuries against Ireland and Australia. But he struggled for consistency and, like many before him, then suffered a lengthy domestic slump after being dropped from the international side., 40383=NBC Denis Compton Award 2007, 6882=Born March 16, 1986, Canterbury, Kent}",
