            "This may be WMU's most sell-able feature. There is a safety escort service that will take you home when it gets dark, Drive Safe Kalamazoo that offers free & nonjudgmental rides home from anywhere in Kalamazoo, and since so many students live off-campus, not much partying happens on campus, keeping campus safer.",
            "Extroverts, outgoing, open, laid back.",
            "Don't step on the W outside of the library! Also, go to Bronco Bash. It will connect you to RSOs.",
            "It is very hard to get involved if you don't have a car, or if you have classes after 4pm, both of which applied to me. Kalamazoo is a community full of fun entertainment, but without transportation, it is very hard to access. On campus, you need to connect to RSOs to get involved on a regular basis.",
            "I had a Bronco Gold meal plan, and I found it to be convenient. The cafeterias make an effort to keep a portion of their food consistent, and to change other parts, ensuring that there is always something you like. Different cafeterias sere different styles of food, which works as a positive and a negative. If you want to eat healthy, like me, there are some dining halls you just have to avoid. My only other complaint would be for mass-produced food in general; if you're sensitive to grease, you need to wipe some off before eating a lot of the food. Don't worry; they provide napkins.",
            "Dorm life, for me, was very poor. Granted, I was at band camp while people on my floor got to know each other. I felt very distant from, and sometimes afraid of, the people living around me. Many of my friends talked of smelling pot on their floors, and though the RA tried, quiet hours were not effectively enforced. As a warning to college kids in general: yes, people do sleep around, especially in dormitories. Overall, it was not the best of experiences, and nothing special.",
            "This depends on your major. Since I'm a music major in the honors college, taking about nine classes a semester, it's pretty rigorous for me. My roommate, a film and media studies major who had maybe four or five classes a week, routinely got bored and was not challenged by her classes. The academic rigor depends on the program the student is in, and how intently they wish to study for their classes. It is possible to brainlessly do busywork and do reasonably well, and it is also possible to get in-depth with classes and do very well. It's really up to the student.",
            "WMU is a very big school with a very, VERY present party culture. If you are shy or opposed to alcohol, I would avoid WMU. It is also very easy to get lost in the sea of numbers and 25,000-ish that is WMU. Talk to your professors to prevent this happening. Get involved, and do it early. This will get you around people similar to you, and find you friends, so you don't feel like an insignificant waste of life like I did.",
            "WMU is a big school, and depending on your program, your academic challenges and lifestyle will vary greatly. There is a very strong and thriving party culture. It is very hard to get noticed, and easy to get lost in the sea of 25000 students."

May be a little hot when you first get here. NO AC., 484718=There is so much. Go to sporting events is one way or participate in some of the Student Organizations. There are also numerous events that the Campus Activities Board puts together each year, including several a month. These events range from concerts to movies. Miller Auditorium also has great shows and concerts every year in which students get 50% of tickets. Students can exercise at the Rec Center or Ice Skate and Swim at Lawson. There is also always Bronco BASH in September., 28857=WMU has been name one of the top schools in 2011 already! You can look up facts about the school and they are all true. We have a great College of Aviation and also Business College. WMU is for someone that is sociable and if not you will turn into one. It's for a student that loves to be interactive. This is a place for someone that will represent their university with pride. If you have great heart and spirit come to WMU because it's always a great day to be a BRONCO!, 268577=There are vehicles starting at 9:00 that you can call to pick you up where ever you may be on campus and take you to the location you desire around the campus for your safety. Also there are 911 stands everywhere so that if you get in trouble you can always push the button and get help where ever you may need it., 4860=I'm a physics student, but I've found philosophy and chemistry to be strong areas in this college. I haven't experienced much in my one semester here, but Chem 1100, 1110, Philosophy of Science (honors), and music appreciation to be well worth while., 564162=One big tradition that we have here at Western is called Bronco Bash!! this happens every year during like the first week of September where all different types of school clubs/organizations as well as businesses , restaurants etc. comes on campus to promote their business and/or organizations and gives away a lot of FREE stuff!!, 52248=The overall tuition ranks fairly low compared to the rest of the public University's in Michigan. Last I checked it was 13th out of 15th in terms of the highest priced as of 2008 (1st being the most expensive). Also, it is ranked as one of the top public University's year after year according to US News. So, it really is a great deal, but my only complaint is that although tuition is low, living on campus is expensive with a lot of nickel and dime fees that can annoy you (parking passes, Wired internet fees, mini fridge rentals, etc.), however as a freshmen you don't have to live on campus, and is something to consider based on your financial situation., 900558=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students I wouldn't recommend the unlimited food plan, my roommate and I are having trouble justifying the cost of having it, and realistically the 3-a-day has been better. Also stay on the good side of the R.A.'s on campus, they'll become good friends to have later on. Bang for the buck Going here actually ended up being less than I had expected, the living conditions have been better than anticipated (good roommate helps), classes have been well put together and fulfilling, and I find that the food is good. Am enjoying being here Life here has been swell, I've only found myself complaining about the location of the Valley dorms and that the Gold Bus is usually full. Am learning a lot I have to say, I thought Gen. Ed's would be boring, but I have found one in each area that has kept my interest. I must say though if ever you get a chance to be in a class by Prof. Tim McGrew, do not pass up the opportunity. McGrew has been one of the best instructors I've had, ever.
