By this differential method, the precision obtained is of about 3 meters on an average and makes it possible to envisage the use of the GPS system as an aircraft landing assistance system. According to this differential method, the system comprises a fixed station which constitutes a reference for aircraft located in the vicinity of the said fixed station, within a radius of 100 kilometers for example. The fixed station has a receiver for positioning by satellite, which gives an estimate of the position of this fixed station, and computing means that give correction data representing the deviation between this estimate and a reference position, which may be the position of the fixed station identified on a map. After eliminating the essential part of the lag of the clock incorporated in the receiver of the fixed station, the distances observed for each satellite, called pseudo-distances, are compared with the exact differences calculated from the almanac data transmitted by the satellites and from the reference position. The result of these computations give correction data, used to compensate for most of the errors arising out of satellite ephemerides and out of uncertainties in the propagation of radio waves.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The invention is not restricted to the two embodiments described above. Many types of receivers for differential as well as non-differential positioning by satellite can be used to make the system of the invention. In all cases, an advantage of the on-board station is that it can be made using an MLS receiver and a receiver for differential positioning by satellite which are in standard use, or are going to come into standard use on aircraft. The fixed station does not require any complicated installation with directional antenna. This means that it can be speedily installed anywhere. It is therefore far less costly to install than an MLS fixed station. Furthermore, one and the same fixed station can be used for several neighboring strips, by transmitting distinct data packets for each strip on the same MLS channel, unlike the case of the MLS system where a separate fixed station is needed for each strip. It is also possible to transmit additional correction data in addition to corrections on pseudo-distances. This additional correction data would consist of corrections on the pseudo-speeds of the satellites with respect to the fixed station 1, the true pseudo-speeds being computed by the computing device 12 or 12' using almanac data from the satellites. Known algorithms make it possible to use these additional correction data to compute a corrected estimate of the aircraft position with greater precision. This second embodiment requires a",
