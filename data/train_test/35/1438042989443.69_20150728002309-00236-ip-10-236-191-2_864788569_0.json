    "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Echo Star colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Echo Star in general - it is a blend of high-tech recycled plastic with a minimum of 80% and up to 100% pre-consumer plastic. It provides nearly the same durability as other Innova premium plastics with a superior grip, even better grip than the already grippy Star plastic. Echo Star has great characteristics and it's environmentally friendly too.\u00a0 Speed 7, Glide 5, Turn 0, Fade 2 The Champion Teebird+ differs from the Teebird in that it is made from the Plus Mold. The angle of the rim under the disc was changed in that It angles outwards slightly more than the regular rim which is more of a 90\u00b0angle to the bottom of the disc. This slight angling of the rim allows a smoother release. Everything else is the same. There is a limited supply of The Plus Mold TeeBird. Try it before they are gone! 173-175 only It is a great choice as a utility driver, headwind driver, sidearm driver, for hyzer shots, flex shots, and thumbers.",
    "textAfterTable": "\"The TeeBird should be a staple of every golfer's bag. When new, it flies straight with a smooth hyzer finish. As it gets beat up it flies straight with very little deviation from its flight path.\" - Mike Solt If you are looking for a disc with more Glide, try the Mamba more Turn, try the Eagle more Fade, try the Banshee Other Speed 7,8 discs include the Archangel, Banshee, Dragon, Eagle and TL The Innova TeeBird-L fairway driver is straight. The TL is the brother of the reliable TeeBird (see below). The \u201cL\u201d stands for \u201cLess Overstable\u201d and \u201cLonger\u201d. This disc has the same great speed and glide as the TeeBird, but is straighter flying with less fade at the end of the flight. If you are looking for a straight flying maximum fairway driver, the TL is the answer. The TL+ combines The TL's neutral flight with the easy-release plus rim, making this an ideal disc for almost any fairway shot. Beginner friendly. 21.2 cm. It is a great choice for a first fairway driver, tight fairway driver, placement driver, turnover shots, and beginner disc golfers. The Innova TL+ differs from the TL in that it is made from the Plus Mold. The angle of the rim under the disc was changed in that It angles outwards slightly more than the regular rim which is more of a 90\u00b0angle to the bottom of the disc. This",
