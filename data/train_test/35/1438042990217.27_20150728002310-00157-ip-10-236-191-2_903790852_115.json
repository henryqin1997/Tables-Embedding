            "The campus police will escort you anywhere if you feel unsafe. I never here of anything ever really happening to cause fear.",
            "I am not in it, but they are very visible on campus.",
            "There are so many, even a quidditch club. Attend the fair held during orientation and the first two weeks of class to learn more about clubs.",
            "Extroverts, people who love to have a good time, and students who care about their future.",
            "Dressing really nice for football games is huge. I am talking dresses and wedges. It is crazy.",
            "There are many available scholarships. The lower cost of public universities is great because you can get an education without worrying how you will pay it off later.",
            "There are many fun events such as movies or laser tag in the Grove and different things like that on campus for entertainment. The Square is a popular place to shop, eat, and party if that is what you are into.",
            "There are limited options on campus which is expected, but do not feel the need to eat unhealthy foods just because they are more numerous. There are certain places to eat that offer healthier options too, along with the fast food cafeteria options.",
            "The Ridges which are Minor, Burns, and Pittman Halls are very nice to live in. Each room has its own bathroom, so you only have to share with your roommate.",
            "The standard of academic rigor here is very high, if you want it to be. Taking Honors and upper level courses will challenge you more than you could expect. If you want an Ivy League education without the price tag, you can get it here if you really want to.",
            "If possible, apply for the Honors College. It is one of the best in the nation, and it will challenge you academically. You will become a more well rounded individual by being a part of it.",
            "Ole Miss has a beautiful campus that is becoming increasingly eco-friendly. The education is great, and there are very highly qualified professors. There is something here for everyone."

The union is gross but the new Grill @ 1810 is wonderful., 422710=Basketball, football, softball, track/field, and more. Also, they have intramural sports as well. I do not know much about the clubs. Since, in this upcoming August this will be my freshman year., 175017=Great academics, legendary for social activities, and winner of most beautiful campus 2011. I can attest to all of these., 96932=rather big here. this year, the sororities had nearly 2000 girls rush. i suggest doing it because it is an experience, even if you decide not to join an organization., 192240=The Univeristy of Mississippi has a beautiful, very inviting campus. Everyone is welcoming, and I can not wait to attend! I am enrolled in the Honors College and can not wait to enjoy the experience in August, which I have heard is wonderful., 172329=The James Meredith statue celebrating the official integration of Ole Miss in 1962. It is also possible to walk in the underground tunnels that he had to walk in to get to class without being attacked. There's also the grove, which is infamous for tailgating and was ranked #1 in a national magazine. http://zing.olemiss.edu/national-magazine-ranks-um-no-1-for-college-tailgating/, 213436=I lived in the Residential College my Freshman year. This was the best possible dorm on campus. I did not have to share a room and only had to share my bathroom with one other person. There was a cafeteria, a gym, and a full-service kitchen available to me at all times. There are several types of rooms, including the typical 2-person dorm room with one bathroom, a 2-bedroom suite with 2 bedrooms and one bathroom, and a quad-suite containing 4 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a common area. The only down-side is the cost of the residential college. It was at least $1,000 extra a semester. You also have to obtain a minimum GPA of approximately 3.0. The traditional dorms on campus are double-occupancy with a communal bathroom on each floor. The majority of them are fairly old, but are very clean and kept up. There are two new dorms being built now. They should be available in the Fall of 2012. This is the beginning of an all-around renovation of the older buildings on campus. All of the dorms have multiple RA's on each floor that are ready and willing to assist you in any issue you may have--from being locked out to more personal issues. The RHA (Resident Housing Association) also hosts multiple events throughout the year to give students the opportunity to not only meet the people in their dorm, but to socialize with other students living on campus. Did I mention that they give free food and T-shirts at these events?! Overall, Ole Miss' Dorm life is very good. The majority of the students that live on campus enjoy it due to the accessibility as well as the affordability. Living off of campus in Oxford is very expensive due to the high-cost of rent, utlilties and gas to get to and from campus., 127772=Dorm life, in my case, is fun. The dorm I reside in is co-residential and it gives an awesome experience for freshman. The Residential College and the Luckyday Residential College are also co-residential and also some of the newest dorms here on campus since about 2007. Some of the other dorms are not co-residential, but are still up to par even though they are not as new. In July 2012, the new dorms being built will be ready for the new incoming freshman. They are in for very nice complexes., 224784=If you are an upcoming Freshman, I highly recommend the Summer Program in July. It is awesome and it allows you to take a couple classes while getting acclimated on campus and meeting other new students. It made the transition to college life in the fall so much easier!, 455599=I can't wait to attend I think this may be the best kept secret in Higher ED People make fun of the Admissions process but they are too stupid to know the they are controlled by the 1968 Federal Civil Rights Act so they are forced to be Liberal in there Admission standards but only the Brightest and Coolest really succeed. Are you Brave enough to Put Yourself to the TEST Most Beautiful Campus Sexiest Ladies Strongest and Top Notch Greek System in the Country And on top of that you get a really great education!, 538562=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 88191=Call admissions often! I applied in August but didn't get accepted because they lost my application! The application fee was processed, but they had no idea who I was. Because of this I didn't get accepted until late, and I missed all of my opportunities to apply for University Scholarships, 448=looking for a small school education, and a big school weekend atmosphere. the student teacher ratio, 17:1, is the size of Rhodes or Vanderbilt. The Grove on game day is the #1 place to tailgate, and you cant get that anywhere else. go visit! go rebs!, 142138=The Johnson Commons food is okay, but easily becomes tiresome. There are a variety of food options in the Student Union and more, such as a Papa John's, are slated to open in the Fall 2012 semester.}",
