    "textBeforeTable": "Meanwhile, EIDO tracks the MSCI Indonesia Investable Market Index, a free-float adjusted market capitalization weighted benchmark designed to measure the performance of equity securities in the top 99% by market capitalization of equity securities listed on stock exchanges in Indonesia. The fund is most heavily-weighted towards financial companies (27%) with large allocations also going towards industrial materials (16%), consumer services (14%) and consumer goods (13%) firms [see the complete sector breakdown]. In terms of market cap exposure, the fund consists of stocks that are almost entirely in the giant or large cap segments with just 10% of the fund going towards medium cap securities or smaller.\u00a0 In total, EIDO consists of 56 different companies, with the largest individual holdings in Astra International, Telekomunikasi, and Bank Central Asia. Index & Holdings IDX tracks the Market Vectors Indonesia Index, a benchmark that provides exposure to publicly traded companies that are domiciled and primarily listed in Indonesia, or that generate at least 50% of their revenues in Indonesia. Financial companies make up over one-fourth of the total holdings in IDX, with sizable allocations also going towards materials (15%), telecommunications (13%) and energy (12%) firms. IDX has fewer individual components than its iShares counterpart, with just 30 companies comprising the fund's holdings. Top companies include Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Astra International, and Bank Central Asia. In terms of market cap exposure, large and giant cap firms dominate the holdings, with less than 10% going to firms with a market capitalization of",
    "textAfterTable": "In total, the two funds have nine of the ten same top ten components with the only difference coming from IDX's allocation to Adaro Energy and EIDO's holdings in Unilever Indonesia. And although EIDO has nearly twice the number of individual components, both ETFs are top-heavy, with the top ten holdings accounting for approximately 60% of total assets. IDX doesn't have a single security that takes up more than 7.5%, while EIDO's top three holdings make close to one-third of the total assets [see Five Head-to-Head ETF Matchups to Keep an Eye On]. And from a sector perspective, the composition is similar as well -- at least at the top. Both Indonesia ETFs have heavy allocations to financials -- a common characteristic of many emerging markets funds, since banks are often among the largest publicly-traded companies in developing economies. From there, the allocations differ slightly, with EIDO heavier in consumer companies (discretionaries and staples combine to account for more than a quarter of assets) and IDX giving its second largest sector weighting to materials. Both Indonesia ETFs also make big allocations to telecom, primarily through Telekomunikasi Indonesia. In terms of expense ratios, the funds are pretty competitive, with EIDO charging 65 basis points compared to 68 for IDX. From a performance perspective, the funds have delivered near identical returns since EIDO launched in May of this year. Verdict Exposure to Indonesia is lacking in many of the most widely-held emerging markets ETFs on the market today; the country",
