            "It really depends on where you are living. Dutch Quad is, by far, one of the best places to live (especially Ten Broeck Hall, OR Tappan Hall on State Quad which is newly renovated). I have never lived on Alumni, the downtown campus, but it seems like an inconvenient commute without a car because the buses can be a bit unreliable.",

            "It's exceptional for the School of Business and for the East Asian Studies Department. Although it can be an on-going struggle to find one's comfort zone, I do not regret my decision to study here. I rate the University 7/10."

Because it is in the North, near Canada. Start bringing heavy winter jackets starting from October. April and May is the season for decent to humid weather conditions. It can get HOT. Do not expect snow days, unless the amount of snowfall accumulated is more than 6 inches or icy conditions occur. Be aware that roommates may not always be that friendly in the beginning. Do not succumb to peer pressure or group activities that do not engage your personality, you'll only hurt yourself in the end., 454069=The food is nothing special. There are 4 dining halls on the campus, one in each quadrant. These dining halls rotate the foods they serve daily and are open from around 7:30 am to 8:00 pm with the exception of one hall. I personally think closing the hall at 8:00 pm is a little to early but it's not entirely that bad. The campus center also has several dining options where you can get sub sandwiches, pizza slices, sushi, deli sandwiches, chinese, and mexican food depending on your meal plan. These places are open until 11:00 pm on weekdays so I always try to utilize these places to the best of my ability. The campus center food usually tastes better than the dining hall food. There is also a food market where you can purchase milk shakes, all sorts of beverages, freezer foods, dry foods like crackers, candy, and hot soup until late at night as well. The milk shakes are surprisingly good so I recommend trying those at least once. If you keep some snacks in your room for late a night, you shouldn't be too hungry most of the time.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Nyla from Salt Point, NY 07/24/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 24 out of 24 people found this review useful. 2 of 126 Categories Comments Great for these types of students Any one going for the sciences, political sciences, liberal arts, business, and almost anything else. It's a big school so it has most majors. Their undergrad science is good and the city gives you intern/research opportunities. And for political sciences, Albany is the capital region and has many government offices, buildings, and events. It has all sorts of personalities so I can't say what kind of people it would be good for. Those with high academic standing from high school would do well to join the honors college. It gives them the opportunity to get some wonderful classes, good housing, and other bonuses such as tickets to the school's preforming arts shows and the ability to borrow a book from the library for a full semester. Tips for prospective students Yes, it has a party reputation. No, you don't have to do that. There are lots of people to meet, and in general, I found you",
