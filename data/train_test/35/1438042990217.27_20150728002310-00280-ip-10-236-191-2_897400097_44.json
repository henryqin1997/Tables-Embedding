            "Elmhurst College has it's own security force. Each dorm floor has an RA (Residential Advisor) and the neighborhood is incredibly safe. My sister lived on campus for 2 years and never had any problems with her personal safety or the safety of her vehicle.",
            "I have not experienced this aspect of campus life as of today. I am told by others that there are many nationally affiliated fraternities and sororities on campus.",
            "No matter what your interests are there is something for you to get involved in on campus. Sports, Music, Theater, Green Activities, Greek Life, Religious organizations, ethnic organizations and the like.",
            "Elmhurst College is a great school for those seeking a quiet, supportive school to attend. The smaller campus equates to smaller class sizes, while offering a wide variety of courses. Excellent for those interested in the arts, sports, or medicine.",
            "The school has a Black Box Theater on campus and offers music and theatrical productions at that location. But there are smaller (and larger) venues located on campus. Check out the roost, for special happenings on campus.",
            "This is a highly regarded school with an excellent staff. It is located in a relatively safe environment.",
            "Elmhurst College offers a wide variety of free or low cost events on campus, including concerts, plays, sporting events and lectures. The town of Elmhurst IL has a movie theatre, a bowling alley, a fabulous library, a model railroader's club and a host of free events throughout the year. When you get tired of exploring the local business attractions, you can walk to the train and take it to downtown Chicago.",
            "The on campus food service offers a nice range of edibles. However, because this is a small college the selection is limited, prices are a bit on the high side and hours of operation are not really convenient to campus life. There is a wide variety of choices in town which is just blocks away.",
            "I am about to embark on my first experience with dorm life at Elmhurst College. I am blessed to have a sibling who attended this school, so I have some additional insight into the who, what , when , where and how of this campus. Being a small school, has no bearing on the comfortable accommodations for students living on campus.",
            "Elmhurst College offers a varied course selection from basic gen eds to challenging course studies. It is recognized for it's nursing school and has recently added a criminal justice curriculum. The school also offers an excellent music and theatre program as well as journalism.",
            "Off campus housing is available and if worked the right way, (private housing) can be VERY affordable. The college is located in a well established, low crime, family orientated neighborhood. Within walking distance to the trains (which are reliable and affordable to Chicago). If you plan to live on campus your freshman year, and have a bike, it would be advisable to bring it with you.",
            "This is a small school, but a well recognized school. Each of the meetings I have had with staff has been informative and welcoming , thus far. Beautiful, setting, religiously and ethnically diverse, with a great course selection ."

Take advantage of getting to choose your own schedule don't overwhelm yourself with too many classes. Also, Try taking four classes per semester and one during January or take the whole January month off., 188495=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 155205=This campus has many clubs and organizations that love getting new members. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. There are also many campus sponsored events. In 2012, the school brough FUN. here for a concert with discounted student tickets. The school is also very close to Chicago so there are many fun options in the city too., 46835=If there is one thing to brag about Elmhurst College, it's their faculty. Since my time here I have not had a problem with any of my professors. All the professor's are extremely helpful and are willing to set appointments with you if you are having a difficult time understanding the material. The typical ratio from professor to student is about 14:1. So if you are a more personal learner and are extremely nervous about attending to a huge lecture hall of about 300 students, Elmhurst College is where you need to be.}",
