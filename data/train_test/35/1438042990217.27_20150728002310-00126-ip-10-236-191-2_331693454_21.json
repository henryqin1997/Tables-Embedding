    "textBeforeTable": "The future of Terraria has been highly debated as of late, not just with the community, but for us as well. The last year has been a crazy ride! When I started on this game, I just had a few ideas of what I thought would make a fun game. I had no idea that it would receive so much attention. I want to thank all of you for supporting us and making this game's success possible. After a lot of internal debate, we have decided that it is time to move on. My wife and I are due to have another boy soon, and I want to spend some time getting to know him. I also want to spend the time recharging and bettering myself as both a programmer and game designer. I have learned a lot from working on Terraria and plan on using what I've learned, building upon it, and moving forward with another, even better project. However, we are still planning at least one more bug fix for Terraria. For those that haven't already heard, Finn \"Tiy\" Brice has moved on to form Chucklefish and is heavily at work on an exciting new game called \u201cStarbound\u201d. It's looking to be a lot of fun, so make sure to check it out if you haven't already! Thanks again for all your support, and I",
