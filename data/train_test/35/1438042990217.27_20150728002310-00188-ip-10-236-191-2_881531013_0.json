    "textAfterTable": "12 Songs Album Review Evoking images of sensitive '70s MOR, the pensive male singer/songwriter came into vogue as the millennium turned. Teitur (full name Teitur Lassen) came to prominence on the heels of this movement. Though he is often compared to John Mayer, Poetry & Aeroplanes is more otherworldly than most Mayer fare, possibly as a result of Teitur's cosmopolitan background (he left the Faroe Islands as a teenager and proceeded to spend little time on any one continent). Dramatic orchestrations fill out most of the material, leaving the few ballads that are relegated to guitar-and-vocals simplicity sounding like Dave Matthews without the hippie inclinations. [This edition was released in Germany.] ~ Brian O'Neill, Rovi Customer Reviews Pure poetry \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by davidblangstrup These songs are like finding a string of pearls in a pigsty... not that iTunes is one, that is, but it's soooo seldom you meet pure poetry like this - each song is a little pearl. From the Faroe Islands... just like Iceland these Islands are bubbling with creativity. And ah, it's so nice to hear a true singer/songwriter again",
