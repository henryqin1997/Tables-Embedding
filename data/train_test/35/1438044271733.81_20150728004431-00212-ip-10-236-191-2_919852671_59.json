            "I don't now much about Greek life, but I don't personally advise you join a Greek organization. You don't need them.",
            "We have everything from Ballroom to robot building to fencing, to RC planes to anime. We have lots of clubs and lots of wonderful people in all of them.",
            "Nerds, Geeks, and hard working students. We are a huge group of nerds. People who want to be engineers, pilots, and future government officials will fit right in here. We all are a little odd, but we are harmless.",
            "The spirit rock is where you can spray paint anything you want on it. It's kind of a tradition to make sure no one sees you, but it's not that important. The student union is important because a lot happens there. Just on the other side of the road from campus, is what we call the Dells. An up cropping of rock where you can climb, take a hike, bike, and enjoy yourself on limestone and granite.",
            "You have hard teachers that you will learn from. Yeah your paying $40k a year, but at least you know you have good teachers, and state of the art buildings to work in.",
            "There's a lot to do, if you like hiking, driving cross country, and playing video games. If you are really looking for excitement you can drive the hour and a half to Phoenix and enjoy the city life.",
            "Not the greatest food, but it's something to eat, and if your smart you can make it taste even better than before by using the condiments and such.",
            "It's kind of boring, but it's not bad, just... boring. There's not a lot going on, on campus, but you can always entertain yourself down at the student union!",
            "It's a very hard school, but you always learn what you need to learn.",
            "Work hard, and talk to your teachers. Never forget that you are here for an amazing degree. Go to tutors, and never give up. Ask for help when you need it.",
            "It's a very good school, if your willing to work hard. Small student body makes it easy to get in contact with your teachers. Wonderful student body, who really want to help you as well as themselves get through college."

They have mediocre food, but luck fully this upcoming fall 2012 semester SODEXO is taking over the campus dining and bringing in stores like Starbucks. I believe that the food should definitely be better this next upcoming semester., 298200=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 3100=Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott has a huge advantage when it comes to classroom learning. The university is fairly small, an estimated 1500 students total which provides a small faculty-student ratio. Many of my fellow peers who attend other universities dislike being known as a number in their huge auditorium classes and feel they don't learn as well because they cannot freely ask questions. At Embry-Riddle, not only do the professors know your name, but also assist in campus events and dine in the cafeteria amongst other students. Classrooms are course specific, so a math class will not take place in a physics or materials classroom. Professors also have a wide range of their own credible experience in the field, so students are given life experiences in addition to the course outline., 120443=A school that is primarily focused on aviation, with the two biggest majors being aerospace engineering and aeronautical science (pilots). It's a pretty small campus with only 1800 students, and small, manageable class sizes. Students seem to be more focused on their education here, as compared to having a social life or partying., 112304=I have attended the Accepted Students Reception. I cannot wait to visit the Prescott campus in April. I think Embry-Riddle is the one for me., 145422=Getting better, a new contractor for 2012 will bring changes to the campus food.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Embry Riddle is a great source of information for someone is aspiring to be an Aerospace Engineer. The class sizes are a little large sometimes for the major classes such as physics and the introduction to engineering. To make up for it, the teachers have open office hours where they will gladly lend a hand on anything that needs to be reexplained. I'm also part of the Army ROTC and they offer a lot of benefits to students. not only will they assist in your physical fitness, they offer mentorship for the cadets because they care for your grades as much as any employer would.
