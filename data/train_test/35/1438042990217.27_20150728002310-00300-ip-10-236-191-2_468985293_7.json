    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{44148=FIG. 16 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a conventional color filter 1000. The color filter 1000 includes a glass substrate 1001 and a black matrix (BM) 1002 formed on the glass substrate 1001 for blocking light passing through a gap between adjacent colored portions. The color filter 1000 further includes red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colored resin layers 1003. Each set of R, G and B resin layers 1003 corresponds to one pixel. An overcoat (OC) layer 1004 (about 0.5 \u03bcm to about 2.0 \u03bcm thick) of an acrylic resin or an epoxy resin is provided to cover the glass substrate 1001, the black matrix 1002 and the colored resin layers 1003. The overcoat layer 1004 is provided for (1) improving the flatness of the color filter 1000 so that an ITO film to be deposited thereon will be continuous without any disconnection and (2) protecting the colored resin surface so that the etchant used in an ITO etching process will not etch the colored resin layer. A transparent electrode 1005 of an indium tin oxide (ITO) film is further formed on the overcoat layer 1004. While the BM film 1002 is typically a metal chromium film about 100 nm to about 150 nm thick, a non-metal material is also being used recently (e.g., a photoresist type material in which carbon particles are dispersed in an acrylic photosensitive resin). A material obtained by coloring a resin with a dye or a pigment may be used for the colored resin layer 1003, and the thickness of the colored resin layer 1003 is typically about 1 \u03bcm to about 3 \u03bcm., 31852=For example, Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 6-301015 and Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 7-120728 disclose a so-called \u201cASM (Axially Symmetrically aligned Microcell) mode TN liquid crystal display device (hereinafter \u201cConventional Example 1\u201d) in which liquid crystal molecules are oriented in axial symmetry in each of liquid crystal regions which are partitioned from one another by a polymer wall. Typically, each liquid crystal region substantially surrounded by the polymer wall is corresponds to one pixel., 45826=The color filter 1000 as described above may be produced by first forming a photosensitive colored resin layer on a substrate and then. patterning the photosensitive colored resin by photolithography. For example, an RGB color filter can be produced by forming, exposing and developing a photosensitive colored resin layer three times using red (R), green (G) and blue (B) photosensitive resin materials, respectively. For example, the photosensitive colored resin layer may be formed by applying a liquid, in which a photosensitive colored resin material is diluted with a solvent, on a substrate by a spin-coating method, or the like, or by transferring a photosensitive colored resin material prepared in the form of a dry film onto a substrate. A color liquid crystal display device having a wide viewing angle characteristic can be obtained by producing the above-described ASM mode liquid crystal display device while using the color filter as described above.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the description as set forth herein, but rather that the claims be broadly construed. In such a liquid crystal display device, any variation in the thickness of the applied pillar-like protrusion polymer material is a variation in the cell gap. Therefore, a region with a thickness varied from a predetermined thickness is likely to have a poor viewing angle characteristic and a reduced light transmission, or the like, whereby it is difficult to obtain desirable display characteristics. Thus, the liquid crystal display device according to Comparative Example 1 requires the additional step of providing the pillar-like protrusions 7 a. Then, referring to FIG. 21F, the vertical alignment film 8 is formed on each of the substrate and the counter substrate, and the substrates are attached together. A liquid crystal material is injected into a gap between the substrates so as to form the liquid crystal region 9, thereby producing a liquid crystal cell. Then, referring to FIG. 21E, the pillar-like protrusions 7 a, which define the cell gap, are formed to be about 3.0 \u03bcm thick on the polymer walls 6. The cell gap is defined by the polymer walls",
