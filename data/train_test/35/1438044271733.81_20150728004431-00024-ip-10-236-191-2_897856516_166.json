            "Campus Safety is prominent, active, friendly, visible, and always willing to help. Some students have complained that officers are quite quick to give out MIP's however, and that they are constantly looking to bust parties.",
            "The Transitional Links has a tradition in which students are encouraged to walk from the uncompleted side to the completed side. The Transitional Link is a large blue statue of sorts that looks like a house, and is big enough fro students to walk though. It's said that walking from the uncompleted side to completed side is symbolic of your time at Grand Valley; you come here as a uncompleted student in a sense, and leave as a completed student when you are done.",
            "Professors learn your name and put personal investment in your learning. Class sizes are small, and really allows learning to grow. Also, there is a plethora of free help through-out campus, like free study groups, and free math, science, and English support centers. The university is consistently keeping up the grounds, and maintaining buildings, and even building several new ones! Educational opportunists are vast, and all of the programs are great.",
            "The campus is extremely active, and there are hundreds of organizations to join and get involved in. Joining club sports, hanging out in Kirkhof, in the resturants, in your dorm, catching a movie on campus, and attending the sporting events and playing sports yourself are some of the many things to do on campus. Grand Valley is by itself in terms of location; the university is the university, not joined to any major cities. However; that being said, Grand Valley also has prominent visibility in neighboring downtown Grand Rapids, which is just a fifteen-minute bus ride.",
            "Food is relatively good, although it can be a bit repetitive (seems to repeat on a calendar). The Connection on campus is by far one of the best places to eat on the Allendale Campus, as if offers more of a variety of food for students. Some of the older dining areas don't offer as much in terms of variety. The cafeteria at Fresh is great though, all you can eat for one meal, yes please!",
            "Although it would be nice to have Air Conditioning units in the original dorms, dorm life is amazing! I have met my best friend there, and going in blind was the reason for it. I met many people on my floor who I still keep in touch with today (three years later).The stories and experiences I've had from my dorm won't soon leave me; they helped mold my college experience. The dorms are well kept, and the Resident Assistants are constantly visible, running programs to help keep students engaged and active in the community.",
            "The professors do more than simply make you memorize a list of facts, and have you recite it verbatim back on an exam. The exams make you think, applying critical information learned from the semester to see what you have learned, and if you can apply the information you've learned into real-life situations. Requires dedication and studying! Take advantage of the free tutoring and study groups the Grand Valley has! It's a grade saver!",
            "Study hard! Get involved! Although it may seem daunting going to college, take an opportunity to join one of the hundreds of organizations on campus, and really get to know people and your professors!",
            "Grand Valley State University is consistently pushing the envelope, always making a path towards the future. Grand Valley puts the investment in its students, and you can see that in the professors, the new academic buildings, and the positive attitude on the campus (which is gorgeous). Grand Valley is simply amazing."

The crime that is committed is mainly theft., 159849=1. as a freshmen you will have to have at least a 14 meal pass. definately worth it, especially if you don't have a kitchen in your room. i will be a sophomore in fall of 2012 and still plan to have a pass for 5 meals a week. 2. great food and lots of variety. 3. flex dollars to spend anywhere are great!, 81402=grand valley has a women's chocolate party every january. we have a presidents ball to get dressed up and dance to. we have a ravine where you can go hiking and hang out by the grand river. this also offers enormous hills and we go trekking through them all times of the year and have scavenger hunts., 875806=Grand Valley has some excellent faculty, and be sure to take advantage of resources like office hours and the math lab. Campus can be hectic at times, and parking can be a hassle, but overall I am definitely satisfied with my choice to transfer to GVSU. I will be graduating in 2016, and may look into grad school with GVSU also., 443389=I feel very safe at Grand Valley, even at night when my night classes are done at 9:30. Grand Valley is a safe environment (probably because it is out in the middle of no where)., 425071=Compared to other public universities I feel happy for the quality per dollar. But it still is expensive, for a lower division/undergraduate course it is $412/credit. So a three credit trigonometry course is $1236., 629886=Grand Valley is a very clean, well organized college. It has everything I expected. From great academics, to a brand new library in 2013, and great dining and housing, Grand Valley is a one of a kind college that adds great ratings to Michigan Colleges., 952493=There are many options for dining on campus, and the food is of pretty good quality for college. And as of the 2014-2015 academic year, the university is continuing to add dining options to the campus., 161581=1. make an appointment and definately visit the campus .. you will love it and be prepared to be impressed! 2. apply before december 31 of each school year so that if your act score is 26+ you are eligible for a $1500 scholarship that will be renewed each year for up to four years! sad but true, if you miss the deadline they will not award it to you...even if you apply january 1. 3. some of the dorms are much newer, but i'm in the old jail cell style ... they were made the way they are so that if the college failed they could be used as a jail. they may be small, but you really get to know people because you hang out in the lounge together. i was encouraged to apply for these dorms by previous gvsu students and now i understand why!, 938166=Early in September GV holds Campus Life Night, which is like Pitch Perfect on steroids! This night is all about the different clubs and organizations that are offered on campus, ranging from sports, a cappella singing, Greek life, to belly dancing. Each group has a booth set up for students to gather information on what they might be interested in., 166054=i am an african american student of the sciences. i will be graduating may 2013 with an analytical chemistry bachelors in science and certification in green chemistry. this experience is a promising one for science students who want some of the best teachers who are involved with you on a one to one type of setting. you have no other option but to excel academically, in research, and planing on post graduation. hang in there and you will not graduate and be unemployed., 753861=I would be sure to take a tour. Within my first year I heard a lot of complaints about the campus because it wasn't what people were looking for. Just Like anything else you do in life you really want to make sure you feel comfortable walking around and making this campus your home. During my tour in February of 2012, I had never felt better walking around the campus. I knew it was for me., 878812=There are a lot of different food options for Campus dining. There are some dining areas that are better than others, and you definitely have to change up what you eat or else you will get sick of the same thing all the time. They even have different options for special diets. I am a vegetarian and I never have a problem getting a sufficient meal, and every monday at Fresh Food Company, they have Meatless Mondays as well as having gluten free options every day. Fresh Food Company and The Connection both have different options different days of the week, but most of the other dining areas always have the same thing, but they have plenty of options. There is also a variety of coffee shop type of areas, such as Java City, Einstein's Bagels, and even a Starbucks on the downtown campus, and coming to Allendale Campus in Fall of 2015, as well as a Qdoba coming to the Allendale campus in Fall of 2014. There is a wide range of food selections from pizza, to mexican, to italian, to salad. Most things you would or could want you can find in Campus dining with all the selections available to students., 956822=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 951923=The main campus of Grand Valley is located close to downtown Grand Rapids, a bustling and vibrant city with a thriving arts culture. There are great restaurants, good shopping, and events of all natures, including the city-wide art festival ArtPrize during August and September.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Grand Valley is a great atmosphere to live and learn in. People will smile at you as you walk by and hold doors for you or help you up if you slip in the snow. There are tons of activities for students to do, from clubs and intramurals to watching the exceptional sports teams play, going to concerts and comedians, and watching theater. Am enjoying being here It was really easy to make friends at Grand Valley. Because of the large number of students, there is many different types of people. This with good food and lots of things to do make it a great place to be. Am learning a lot Although there are a lot of students at Grand Valley, they try to keep the class sizes small for a better learning environment. They also offer free tutoring if you need it, and professors are usually readily available for help if you need it.
