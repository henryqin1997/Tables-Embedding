            "The administration for the college has many issues, but the overall Lesley community is really great if you can get involved. Some of the professors are incredible. Take a class with Cristin Ashmankas if possible!",
            "Lesley is a small enough school to feel at home, but has a large enough reach to feel like apart of a larger world. This very environmentally conscious school helps each student grow exponentially as a student through a huge variety of opportunities and self-designed programs"

Work studies are often awarded, however they dry up fast. There is plenty of places to apply off campus less than 20 minutes of walking, but once October hits you will likely have to wait 'till spring unless you want to take the T to work., 27902=Make sure while you are looking at this school to keep in mind that it is not like a ordinary college. It is small with around 1800 undergraduates. If you like a sense of community and diversity then Lesley is the perfect school for you. It also offers great programs for secondary education, expressive arts therapy, psychology and counseling. There is a small group of people I know studying business management and science but those aren't the biggest majors on campus. Unfortunately, the food here isn't THAT good, but what can you expect from a college that is more focused on your journey of education?}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Boston is a great city, and Lesley has a great campus. Lesley is about ten minutes away from Harvard Square, which is fun to explore. Boston is also very walkable, and an interesting place to explore with friends. Some times my friends and I just wander along the Charles River when it's sunny out. If you want a good place to start exploring, I say follow the Freedom Trail. Another favorite place of mine is around Boston Harbor. Am learning a lot I am actually a student at the Art Institute of Boston, but since AIB doesn't have its own tab on Cappex I'm leaving a review under Lesley since we are affiliated with them. My schedule is often very busy. My Lesley classes, that is to say my general education credits, are about an hour each two times a week while my AIB classes, my art/main classes, are three hours a day usually two times a week. It's a long day, but you really do learn a lot once you get past your Freshman year. The staff at both Lesley and AIB are helpful and I've been told if you're having trouble learning the tutoring center is good as well. Login to rate or flag the reviews",
