Makes a whole lot more sense not to carry six outfielders, seven if you count Lombo. I'd have preferred that Nady be the guy to go instead of Brown, but having three reserve LH outfielders does seem a bit much, and they just aren't going to cut someone when there's someone with options who can yo-yo up and down, like Brown (and Moore), at least until it's clear the Morse is back for good. So welcome back Mickey Morse. May the force be with you. If you mash tonight, maybe Davey will leave you in the cleanup spot where you belong, even against righties. And yes, please hit the cutoff man and don't try to emulate Harper on the bases., 57017=From Mark on Twitter, take a look at the picture!https://twitter.com/MarkZuckerman/status/208663202786062336/photo/1, 88511=sjbThere's plenty more rain coming\u2013flood warning thru 8:30, and 75-100% chance of rain thereafter thru midnight.Only question is when they call it, not if., 1814=[UPDATE AT 3:40 P.M. \u2014 It's official now: Michael Morse has been activated off the DL and will hit cleanup tonight.

The Nats would never, ever, circulate misleading information about an injury! June 01, 2012 5:07 PM ____________________________Thought the same thing when I first heard about it but do believe he told the Nats his hand got caught in the door -or- maybe a translation error, the door got caught in his hand., 75621=Look, Nationals, if you postpone the game and the storm doesn't materialize, nobody's going to blame you, considering the weather reports we've been getting.But if you start the game at 9:00 and then postpone it when things turn really ugly, lots of people are going to hate you.Or if you start it at 10:00 after the system has blown through, in front of thirty-two people who live within a few blocks of the park, you'll have another 20,000 or so people who wasted a ticket hating you., 112024=baseballswami said\u2026D'Gourds \u2013 do you think that Lombardozzi has a weak arm or hasn't yet learned how to make outfield throws? Mike Morse commented that during this rehab he has just learned how to do it. He was also an infielder. Lombo strikes me as the kind of kid that works so hard he can improve anything he sets his mind to.Still so young, too. My bet is that if he decides to improve his arm, he will do it. He won't be Ankiel \u2013 who is? But with his other abilities he is a really good asset to this organization. MLB guys were just talking about John Lannan \u2013 talking about possibly trading CMW. Heyman says Det and Lannan could both take the 5th spot after Strassie is shut down. They think the CMW starting move is about showcasing him.June 01, 2012 4:58 PM______________________________________________________________________Swami, Lombo can learn to throw more efficently and can add some arm strength, but will never have a strong outfielder's arm. Some guys are seemingly born with an actual cannon. Unlike Morse, Lombardozzi never had a strong infielder's arm either. Morse has worked with the Nat's Cathcart to learn to throw correctly from the outfield. He had a strong arm to start with. I've never seen him make a throw from left, or right, using the proper crow hop, either. It makes a huge difference in how good a throw you make. Like any other position in baseball, there are a zillion nuances to playing the outfield properly that are not learned in a couple of weeks., 67239=Just got the following email:*****************************************Severe Thunderstorm Warning for the City of Alexandria (NEW)For Immediate Release: June 1, 2012The National Weather Service has issued a new Severe Thunderstorm Warning for the City of Alexandria, in effect until 5:15 pm.

Someone had to use it.I need to leave by 5:45. I've blown one game already, not going to blow another.Pepperdine just scored a 2nd run against Mich State. Nice place to go to school., 103489=Thomas Boswell \u200f@ThomasBoswellWPNats game canceled at 6:42. Should probably have been banged earlier. What is it about \"tornado warnings\" that's hard to understand?, 9473=You're correctomundo MarkMeister. What more could a Nats' fan ask??
