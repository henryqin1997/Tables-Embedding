    "textAfterTable": "8 Songs Editors\u2019 Notes Pelican\u2019s third studio long-player finds the Chicago quartet pulling in the reins of their instrumental epics to offer compositions shorter in length but just as powerful (if not more so) than the recordings that comprise their two preceding albums. Upon close listen, the band\u2019s implementation of verse-chorus-verse architecture reveals that Pelican are building actual song structures here, rather than blasting off into the stratosphere without a map. Opener \u201cBliss In Concrete\u201d has memorable changes that are almost as catchy as any hook-laden pop song. Their winning combination of post-rock and doom metal leans on the former more often than before, especially in the melodic title-track and the gossamer \u201cSpaceship Broken \u2013 Parts Needed.\u201d Another noticeable change in the band\u2019s musicianship surfaces in the kind of taut changes and unspoken communication between players that could only have blossomed from the incessant touring of their first two albums. The ferocious \u201cLost In the Headlights\u201d is a prime example of the band\u2019s ability to keep their changes vacuum-tight while allocating propulsive riffs underneath exploding leads before pulling it all back in with a soft recoil.
