This is referred to as the location of the comment. Location relative to %COMMENT tag The default location is the %COMMENT tag itself. For example:  %COMMENT{type=\"below\"}% will add comments in the current topic, directly below the %COMMENT tag. Location relative to an anchor The target attribute may specify a web, and may also specify an anchor within the target topic; for example,  %COMMENT{type=\"above\" target=\"%MAINWEB%.PersonalRemarks#InsertHere\"}% This uses a standard in-topic anchor as the insertion location. See TextFormattingRules for more about Foswiki anchors. Location relative to an arbitrary text string Getting more sophisticated, you can also specify a regular expression for the target location using the location parameter. The target topic is searched for the regular expression, and the comment inserted relative to the string that the search matched. For example,  %COMMENT{type=\"above\" location=\"Flights of Fancy\"}% will place comments above the first occurrence of the string Flights of Fancy in the current topic. Warning of course, if a user's comment contains the string \"Flights of Fancy\" they may and up changing the location for the next comment! Also, if you use a tag in the location, then you've just inserted another tag in the page that contains",
