    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{1320=Which means they'll need to get their lineup going tonight against Wei-Yin Chen. They've already beaten Chen this year, scoring six runs in 4 1/3 innings off him on May 20, so that's an encouraging sign. No surprises in Davey Johnson's lineup. As he indicated after last night's game, he's sticking with slumping Ryan Zimmerman in the No. 3 spot. Michael Morse again serves as DH, with Tyler Moore in left field and Xavier Nady in right field., 48660=Swami \u2014 Rizzo's explanation for signing EJax was clear and reasonable at the time \u2014 Stras' innings deficit, which meant not only the obvious September shutdown, but also Davey's appropriate tendency to use him sparingly in the late innings of his starts. So he needed not only a potential 3d playoff starter but a guy who would not wear out the pen in his starts.Boy is he doing both and dealing tonight! I've never seen him mix in so many breaking balls effectively. Good game plan so far. But Ron's walk Nick., 1003=BALTIMORE \u2014 We're four games into the six-game Battle of the Beltways for 2012, and by virtue of last night's 2-1 victory the Orioles have already clinched at least a split of the season series. For the Nationals to keep it at that, they'll need to win tonight and again tomorrow at Camden Yards., 102640=Someone needs to take the lead here and make the hitters own up to their resposnbilities. The \"accountability\" thing again. What do you expect someone to do, beat them with rubber hoses until they start hitting? This is who they are. They aren't good hitters, mostly. That's all there is. They are trying. You can't play this game better by trying harder, you have to relax. It's hard to relax when you're 0-for-June., 136673=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images.

Glad that our humble host will be on the scene, so that I can read about the game after the fact (going to the P-Nats tonight). Maybe Mark should just leave the press box in the top of every inning, just to be on the safe side. I'm not kidding. Well, okay, I am kidding. Sort of.}",
