            "Kettering is really big on Greek life, a large portion of the student body is involved in Greek life, and the first month of school you spend a good amount of time rushing, there is a Greek event for just about every single day the first month.",
            "As long as you have a car (which freshmen are allowed to have) then there is a lot to do.",
            "There are only 2 things good in the cafeteria and that is the salad bar and the fresh sandwich and wrap line, other than that the cafeteria is not good. Fortunately your meal exchange works at Einstein's across the street which is good.",
            "At Kettering instead of having a roommate, you get a suite mate. So you and another person get a single room and there is just a conjoining door. There is also a community bathroom.",
            "Kettering has an interesting schedule where you go to school for three months then co-op for three months then go to school for three months and so on. So a class that at most colleges you would get a whole semester which is typically 4 to 5 months to learn, you only get 3 months, making Kettering a lot more fast paced of a school, just think of it as you are constantly in motion and learning new things.",
            "If you are interested in this school just look into it, they have a lot of events that you can attend while you are in high school so that you can get to know a lot more about the school.",
            "Kettering is a great school. With a small campus it easy to get to find your classes and know the campus. And with a small student body you get to meet and know a lot more people and get a lot more personal attention than you would at a bigger university."

And when you budget your earnings from your co-op properly, there shouldn't be too much of an issue. As of 2012, there are now more jobs than students again., 224312=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 192999=If you aren't sure you want to go into your degree field, don't attend Kettering. While it is a great school, it is hard to transfer out of and it isn't the cheapest place around. If you are looking for a ton of people, don't attend Kettering. We have maybe 1000 students on campus at a time, and that isn't for everybody. Don't think Kettering is like every other school, the faculty and staff expect more mature behavior because we are all employed by a company and therefore are held to a higher standard. Plus the classes are so small that they will notice if you aren't there. Visit the campus before you apply. You have to be comfortable here to succeed. I am very happy with my choice to attend this school, but I have seen people burn out from it and waste money and time that could have been spent somewhere else. Also, don't let anyone tell you that you can't go to Kettering just because you have a ton of money. Most of us are very dependent on our scholarships and co-op wages, so don't think you'll be the only one. Your work in high school does pay off in terms of scholarships and don't be afraid to ask questions, there are tons of people that are ready and willing to help., 48305=I'm from California and I visited Kettering in March when it was snowing and it was just beautiful. It ay have been cold, but the school is built for it. They have an underground tunnel-way where students can walk from building to building, underground, without getting wet or cold. The dorms are also small, but private, with one person to a room and they can be customized in almost any way that you want. You can also personalize the wall outside your room if you would like as long as you get permission from the school., 83008=It depends on the section you go. A-section school term starts in July and ends in September. B-section school term starts in October and goes till December. During the summer term for A-section, it's a blast. Everyone is outside grilling burgers and hot dogs. You can always find people playing beach volleyball or corn-hole. There are large fields where you can play soccer, football, softball, or ultimate frisbee. There is also a very nice recreational center with a pool, 2 full basketball courts, 2 full tennis courts, dance studio, all exercise machines, and running track.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Students who like small a campus, small class sizes, and are sure that engineering is for them. Tips for prospective students With school semesters being only 11 weeks (to accommodate the co-op rotations) Kettering is definitely a challenge academically, so be prepared for that. Also be involved in as much in you can in high school; that will help you a lot when you start interviewing for your co-op job. Bang for the buck Kettering may look pricey, but lots of scholarships are offered and they're easy to get. Combine that with your co-op earnings and you can't go wrong. In addition, you'll be graduating with two years of work experience, which puts you ahead of other graduates who didn't do co-op. Am enjoying being here Attending an engineering school is great because all of my friends are taking similar, if not the same, classes as me. This allows for a great academic support system and as a result I have made life long friends. I also love being on a small campus where there is small class sizes and all the buildings are within easy walking distance. Above all else, what I love about",
