The college tries in the sense that, it may not be the most academic, or has the best student body, but it has resources. The resources to help students that want to succeed, and helps students get the credits they need to obtain an associates degree and transfer. I have seen that students have gone to schools such as UCLA and USC from this school, because the faculty truly dedicate themselves and knows there are individuals that can be steered into the right direction."
