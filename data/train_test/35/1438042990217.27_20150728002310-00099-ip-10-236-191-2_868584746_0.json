The SuperSoft Big Bead Omega is all about touch. It's super soft great grip and chain-grabbing stickiness have made it a favorite among disc golf players of all skill levels. It's soft, sticky, and grippy. The Omega gives you total control of angle, direction, and pace, keys to success in the short game. It is totally stable in virtually any wind, and its extra softness gives you extra stick when it hits the chains. It's the only putter you need and everything you want in a top notch putter. Even if you\u2019re outside your putting range, the Omega has the precision to get up-and-down. The Millennium Standard Omega SuperSoft Big Bead is a putter that flies straight. It features a large bead around the rim which offers a little bit more fade than the beadless or small \"micro\" bead that is featured on the original SS Omega. The larger bead provides great support for your finger when throwing. Reviews (0)",
