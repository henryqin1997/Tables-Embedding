When I first heard of this book I thought: zombies. Flesh eating/Bite-infecting zombies. NO-WAY. The second and the third time I came across it... well, the same thoughts ran in my head. By the time I finally decided to read it, my mind was full of doubts and... prejuice. Why would anyone want to read about zombies? Why would anyone want to write about zombies? Now,I can safely answer the first question: because this book is amazing. When everybody knows the entire world is a zombie-surrounded village in the middle of a forest, Mary believes in a larger world, in the stories her mother told her about the sea, in the existence of more people, maybe in other villages, outside of the fences created for their safety. And when everything is falling down: her family, her hopes for a future, her love, her entire world, her beliefs may be the only thing that will keep her - and others - alive. The story is absolutely breathtaking. I highly recommend tissues at hand. And a few day of recovery after reading it. Yes, it hits you that hard. ...more",
