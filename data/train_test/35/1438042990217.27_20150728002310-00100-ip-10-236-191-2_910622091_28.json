            "There is a cafeteria, union with a restaurant and a few quick eat booths and small supermarket on campus. I prefer bringing my own lunch because the options are not always the healthiest and very limited. I would seek living in an apartment and heading to the nearest grocery store, Rouse, and cooking my own meals.",
            "I was a commuter to Nicholls State University so can't say much about dorm life except the fact that my on campus living friends seemed to enjoy it very much so. There's pools for swimming, a tennis court, super nice basketball court in the newly built recreational center on campus which also has a full gym, showers, locker room, cafe, etc. Lots of fun activities on and off of campus as well as international students who like to make the most of college. Just put yourself out there and get involved!",
            "Nicholls overall has a very well rounded education system. I suppose what degree you are pursuing would have an impact on the academic rigor specifically for you. Were there some tough classes, sure, but nothing you cannot conquer if you want it bad enough. This very dependent on the course and teacher you are enrolled.",
            "Get to know the people around you, in your classes and on around campus. Don't be bashful and ask questions. It can only benefit you throughout your time spent here at Nicholls. It is essential in meeting new friends, business partners, getting tips on future classes, study partners, job opportunities, scholarships and may even save you a few hundred dollars by borrowing books from others. My other suggestion is if you want to get something accomplished, be persistent and don't give up if you are turned away, keep going. Good things are bound to come from it.",
            "Nicholls State University offers a friendly, welcoming atmosphere where you can feel right at home. The University is filled with superb teachers whom you can build a great relationship with making your learning experience much more personal than larger universities. Although, Nicholls is mostly a commuter school for the students in the area, there are tons of colorful extracurricular activities to get involved in and make lasting friendships."

Some of those choices would be a salad bar, sandwich shop(kind of like Subway), pizza place, Jazz-mans(coffee shop) and even Colonel Retreat(offer wings, burgers, and beer). Prices are a downside, all on campus residents have to buy a meal plan. If you stay in the dorms you can end up spending over 1400 on a meal plan alone. If you live in the apartments though you have an option of $500 declining balance.}",
