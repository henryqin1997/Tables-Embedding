The support posts 26 are disposed to prevent the metal switch pad 12 from contacting the actuation pads 16. The actuation pad 24 may include a dielectric, or may be an exposed metal. The raised contact bump 28 facilitates electrical contact and reduces the gap between it and the dimple 22. The support posts 26 in FIGS. 5A and 5B are disposed around the actuation pad 12 and are high enough to stop the metal switch pad before it contacts the actuation pads. The posts 26 are preferably disposed on multiple sides of the actuation pads 16 and are preferably fabricated close to the actuation pads 16. The support posts 26 may be formed to ground contact. In this way, the posts 26 will direct some current from the signal line 10 to ground, with the remainder being directed through the cantilevers 14. Posts are shown in the partial SEM image of a prototype in FIG. 6. In a preferred low voltage embodiments, posts have a height in the approximate range of 0.5 to 1.25 \u03bcm and an actuation pad (with dielectric) is approximately 1000 \u212b to 2000 \u212b. Some applications, e.g., wireless RF devices, permit higher actuation voltages. In such applications, higher posts are preferred to enhance lifetimes. For example, a preferred range for the posts in such devices is 0.5 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm with an actuation pad of approximately 1000 \u212b to 2000 \u212b.}",
