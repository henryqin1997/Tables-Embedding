    "textAfterTable": "LIGHT THE FIRE: In Chicago, Philip Hersh noted there were \"two noteworthy aspects\" to the USOC's announcement. The committee \"includes representatives of every USOC constituent group, including two members of the Athletes Advisory Committee,\" but it \"does not include any of the\u00a0U.S. sports federation (NGB) leaders who have been publicly critical of the current USOC leadership.\" However, there are \"valid reasons for not having the two most outspoken NGB leaders,\" USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny and USA Triathlon CEO Skip Gilbert. Gilbert simply was \"not interested in the role,\" while Penny's name \"has\u00a0been bandied about as a candidate for CEO.\" Meanwhile, Hersh noted USOC acting CEO Stephanie Streeter and two of her three immediate predecessors, Lloyd Ward and Norm Blake, \"all came from corporate backgrounds.\" So perhaps that is \"why the USOC\u00a0won't a) pay the search firm until 18 months after the CEO is in place and b) retained the right to set the amount of the payment.\" If the result of the search is \"another short-term stiff, the USOC should stiff Spencer Stuart\" (CHICAGOTRIBUNE.com, 10/29).
