This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1986 it has nearly tripled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +26% per year. These returns cover a period from 1986-2011 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly, an independent accounting firm., 20028=The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a smaller-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies. Despite this drawdown, gas stocks continue to remain bloated, reflecting low demand amid robust onshore output. About the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report The Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report \u2013 brought out by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) every Thursday since 2002 \u2013 includes updates on natural gas market prices, the latest storage level estimates, recent weather data and other market activities or events. The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of natural gas. It is an indicator of current gas prices and volatility that affect businesses of natural gas-weighted companies and related support plays. Analysis of the Data Stockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell by 172 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Jan 18, 2013, lower than the guided range (of 173\u2013177 Bcf drawdown) as per the analysts surveyed by Platts, the energy information arm of McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. . The decrease represents the ninth withdrawal of the 2012-2013 winter heating season after stocks hit an all-time high in early November last year. Though the draw was lower than the five-year (2008\u20132012) average reduction of 176 Bcf for the reported week, it exceeded last year\u2019s withdrawal of 162 Bcf. Following the past week\u2019s reduction, the current storage level \u2013 at 2.996 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) \u2013 is down 157 Bcf (5.0%) from the last year but is still 320 Bcf (12.0%) above the five-year average. In fact, natural gas inventories in underground storage have persistently exceeded the five-year average since late September 2011 and ended the usual summer stock-building season of April through October at a record 3.923 Tcf (as of October 31, 2012). A supply glut kept the natural gas prices under pressure during the couple of years or so, as production from dense rock formations (shale) \u2013 through novel techniques of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing \u2013 remain robust, thereby overwhelming demand. However, with the U.S. winter set to be colder than the unusually warm last one, we might expect some balancing of the commodity\u2019s supply/demand disparity on the back of its more normalized use for space heating by residential/commercial consumers. This, in turn, could improve the prices and buoy natural gas producers, particularly smaller players like Quicksilver Resources Inc. , WPX Energy Inc. (WPX - Analyst Report) and Forest Oil Corp. . With an improvement in the companies\u2019 ability to generate positive earnings surprises, they can then move higher from their current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)., 61676=Copyright \u00a9 2015 Zacks Investment Research, 14859=by Zacks Equity Research \u00a0\u00a0Published on January 29, 2013 |}",
