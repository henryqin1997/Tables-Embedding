If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer A graduate of Parsons, designer Isa Tapia is focused on making feminine shoes that are bold and colorful. After an internship with Marc Jacobs and an apprenticeship with Oscar de la Renta, Tapia fell in love with the art of shoemaking and lived between Florence and New York studying the craft. In 2012 she launched her eponymous line, and with an eye for sculptural detailing, Tapia set her sights on injecting glamour into everyday fashion with sexy, yet practical footwear designed to serve the fast-paced lifestyles of the women who inspire her.
