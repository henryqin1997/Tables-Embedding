    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{40224=In spite of being genetically disposed toward selecting \"too much\" of anything that looks like more power, I continually see the reverse for a big-block Chevy engine. Unless it's a really small big-block (396 maybe) there is really no place for a 4150-style single four-barrel Holley on 505-inch big-block with a target output of 650-plus hp. To meet our 505's induction requirements a 1050 Holley Dominator was chosen along with an appropriate Weiand Team G single-plane intake. The intake was port matched to the heads and the rest of the runners given a coarse (80 grit) emery roll clean up. This was in preparation for an intake coating test that we planed to do with this motor but subsequently ran out of time on. On the flow bench this clean up made very little difference to the flow and while it may have contributed to the engines output it is doubtful that it did so by much., 31660=With the lobes selected, Cam-Master was used to determine the Lobe Centerline Angle. With the figures input a result of 106.5 degrees was called for so we settled on 107. This was ground at 4 degrees advance. Motion from the cam profile was transmitted to the valves via a set of Comp Cams Endure-X solid roller lifters, 3/8th Magnum pushrods and aluminum 1.7:1 rocker arms., 42875=It was obvious that the original Holley jetting on this carb was really close to optimal as our change to two sizes bigger jets only made a very small difference. From the dyno data we figured that though our 1050 Dominator had performed magnificently we may have chosen one that was slightly too small., 28882=For the pistons it was necessary to have Ross make us up some custom items so we could nail the 10.5:1 compression ratio with the RHS heads right on the money. We were rewarded with a nice looking set of pistons that weighed in at a very respectable low weight. By using the 250 long Scat rod with the 4-1/4 inch stroker crank the stock rod/stroke ratio was almost maintained and left a compression height of 1.165 inches. With the 1/16 - 1/16- 3/16 Total seal ring pack being used, the pin bore intruded into the oil ring groove necessitating the use of a steel support rail type oil ring assembly. The rings used for this engine were from Total Seal., 39833=For rockers Comp's tried and tested basic aluminum 1.7:1 rockers were used. Partly as a result of the pushrod length selection their rockers delivered a tad over 1.7:1, thus adding a few thousandths to the theoretical valve lift. For valve springs we ran those that came with the heads-after all RHS is a subsidiary of Comp Cams so it should know what works in this department., 30577=The eventual profiles chosen were not of overly long period but they did get with the program in terms of opening and closing rate. For the intake, an SP-series roller with an advertised duration of 279 degrees was chosen (profile #4788); for the exhaust a slightly less aggressive RP profile of 284 degrees advertised duration was selected. These, with 1.7:1 Comp Cams rockers, delivered a gross valve lift of 0.653- and 0.648-inch respectively. As short as these profiles look at the 0.020 lifter rise used for the quoting advertised duration, they are longer by about 14 degrees at the lash point. This makes the seat duration, at 293/298 look a little on the long side for a street cam.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "RHS big-block Chevy 320 head flow tests. Conclusions After watching this good looking big-block disappear down the road in the back of a truck, Lloyd and I sat down to take a hard look at the dyno printouts. The first question we asked ourselves was did the RHS heads work as we had expected. Answer: They certainly did, to the extent we planned to re-visit them for a test on a bigger, more powerful engine such as a 540 or even a 572. The street price for these heads is likely to be around $2,200 while a whole T&L built engine just like you see here will set you back $7,749 with a cast crank or $7,995 with a forged one. However you need to be aware that upgrading to a 540 or 572 incher is only about a grand extra and either of these will go well beyond the 700 hp mark. It was obvious that the original Holley jetting on this carb was really close to optimal as our change to two sizes bigger jets only made a very small difference. From the dyno data we figured that though our 1050 Dominator had performed magnificently we may have chosen one that was slightly too small. Dyno Time This engine was broken in and dyno tested with fuel from the gas station just down the road. After a post break in oil change and a re-lash of the valves, a full power run was made and we were pleased",
    "textAfterTable": "Here are the \"as cast\" numbers for the RHS heads. Even as cast there is enough airflow From the RHS 320 heads for 700 hp on a 540-inch engine. When simple porting techniques (that is no more complex than a near beginner might do over a couple of week ends at home) are applied the numbers look even better. The figures achieved with the T&L ported heads are as below.
