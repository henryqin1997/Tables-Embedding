            "We have call buttons all over campus just in case someone needs help immediately and we always have security on campus.",
            "The Regis campus is never boring. There is always something to do that's exciting. The classes will never be very simple and the professors will never blow you off if you need help.",
            "When you go to Regis, there is never a day when there isn't something going on. On Thursday, we have Thursday thrills, which varies from a comedian performing or an activity out on the quad. We also have free movie Friday. Every Friday, the student life faculty buys a certain amount of movie tickets to a new release movie and the first people to get there go see a movie. It's really fantastic.",
            "The food is great! I don't eat on campus very much just because, as I said, I am a commuter student but the food is great when I do eat it.",
            "I am a commuter, so I don't live in the dorms, but I've heard many great stories from the students who live in the dorms.",
            "You will always have a challenging class. No matter how much you think you're going to take an easy class, something will change that. You are always challenged at Regis and that is part of why I love it.",
            "I recommend visiting the campus if you are thinking about going to Regis. It gives you an idea of what the campus is like. I would even take part in a Discover Regis Day because that really gives you an idea of what Regis is about.",
            "Regis has a beautiful campus and the staff generally cares for you as a person and a student. If your grades have slumped a bit, they talk to you about it and see what they can do to help you. In general, you're surrounded by a good vibe and you have a fantastic learning environment."

I love the fact that there are only 15-25 kids in each of my classes and that all my professors know me by name. Also, as a liberal arts school with widespread core requirements, I am taking classes in disciplines I never would have thought of and have found new subjects that are interesting to me. Another great thing about Regis is the fact that they have a free tutoring program, that's right free! There are tutors for nearly every subject and it is actually part of their workstudy to help you, so all you have to do is make an appointment. They also have a great Writing Center and Library where people are willing to help you with any part of writing a paper, whether it's research, grammar, or format., 160262=Regis University is a wonderful school with caring professors. It is a writing intensive university which has prepared me for my Master's program. Upon graduating in May, I feel I got a good education worth all the money I spent on the tuition., 188621=There are about 11 trees on campus that have state and national recognition for their size, form and species. They are well cared for and tours are often taken on campus by botanical societies and gardeners. The campus is well groomed and cared for. Another interesting note is the Statue of Sacred Heart of Jesus at Regis University with Latin writing. A Latin scholar once read it and verified that there is no meaning to the words that are inscribed on the plaque. The statue however is beautiful, and one of many statues on campus which receive attention and recognition. Main Hall is the oldest building, built in 1887 and it marks the highest point in the Denver vicinity. It also supposedly has a cell phone tower transponder in the cross on top of the building because of its location., 126385=One fun activity to do on your own or with a friend on a cool September evening is walk around campus and find all the benches and study spots.}",

    "textAfterTable": "The professors are really friendly and the students are nicer and more open-minded than I ever could have dreamed. Granted, you'll have your snobs or your political extremists (on either side) at any school, but don't ever let anyone tell you that Regis is just a school for rich conservative white kids; We have a great variety of students from all walks of life, and we get along great. There are tons of activities for weekends, and the clubs are always looking for people to get involved. Regis also has a lovely campus with lots of grassy areas where you can curl up under a tree to study or play frisbee with your friends when the weather is nice (or have a snow-ball fight when the weather isn't!) and all you have to do is walk off-campus to find yourself in the middle of Denver with a variety of restaurants and activities available to you. Am learning a lot All of my classes have been taught by brilliant and passionate professors who really care about teaching and want students to succeed, both on tests and in life. Regis provides you with a challenging academic curriculum, but professors and tutors are always very easy to get in contact with if you need help. The small class sizes create a close-knit academic community where you learn from",
