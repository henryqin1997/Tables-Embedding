[AFTER THE JUMP: TURKEY no just UFR] Toussaint went out early with his injury; after that it was all Rawls and Smith until very late; Justice Hayes did get in at fullback(!) on a play where Michigan ran an iso. Oh and that Denard guy played some. Substitution notes: Line as per usual. Tight ends as per usual. Joe Reynolds got some burn at wide receiver on actual passing plays, catching a long handoff type thing that Gardner clearly aborted to\u2014about which more later\u2014and a hitch on which it looked like he ran a nice route, for all I know about route running. Other than that, WRs were as per usual including usual lack of focus on throwing to Dileo when not throwing to Gallon or Roundtree. Formation lingo may not match your local football talking guy and is merely present to help facilitate communicative acts. In keeping with this blog's tradition of naming weird things he hasn't seen after the nearest equivalent in NCAA Football X, this was dubbed \"far twin TE.\" And then there was\u2026 this.

Omameh(-1) released directly downfield into a LB who got his hands inside and shoved him backwards after some initial movement, but because of the big gap between the DL Toussaint(+1) can hit the gap and jet for a nice gain.

Kwi(+1) seals another LB, big gap; Omameh(-0.5) doesn't move to the safety here, instead coming back on to the LB Kwi has and bumping Robinson(+1) as he reads the blocks and jets to the secondary level.
