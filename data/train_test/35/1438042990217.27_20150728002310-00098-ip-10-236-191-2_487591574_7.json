The ESP 60 and the ISP 134 will look like web servers to the packet-based network. When a caller 82 or a subscriber 86 accesses their ISP 134, the ISP 134 assigns a temporary IP address to the caller 82 or the subscriber 86, respectively. The ISP maintains a mapping from the subscriber's permanent URL (e.g., the hostname) to the temporary IP address. One method for IP address assignment is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Reference RFC 1531 developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the present invention has been described with reference to a few specific embodiments, the description is illustrative of the invention and is not to be construed as limiting the invention. Various modifications may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The present invention has the advantages of providing flexibility, and allows subscribers to screen calls from callers from packet-based networks with packet addresses. In addition, the invention allows subscribers to receive and screen calls from a single telephone connection even when that connection is otherwise \u201cbusy\u201d because the subscriber is connected to a packet-based network via their ISP. In another aspect of the invention, the ESP provides for anonymous calling between subscribers and accessers using the internet, and when the internet connection is in use the subscriber may be called anonymously at a designated telephone number using the PSTN. In server-based lookup, the subscriber publishes an email address instead of a public URL. The ESP database associates the public email address with the private IP address or voice telephone number. The ESP receives an email from caller at the published email address, looks up the public email address in the database, and translates the email address to the subscriber's private email address. Alternately, instead of an email address, a voice mail address is used. Note that, in H.323",
