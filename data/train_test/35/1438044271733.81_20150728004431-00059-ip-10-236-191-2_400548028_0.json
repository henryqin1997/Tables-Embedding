The simple fact, as Ausmus and Dombrowski acknowledged separately Monday, is the Tigers have no practical choice in early June but to hope Nathan finds his old competence and saves games his team is often winning through eight innings., 44428=He also has Joel Hanrahan rehabilitating in Lakeland, Fla., 13 months after Hanrahan had Tommy John surgery. The Tigers signed him in May with one thought in mind: Hanrahan might be able to help during the season\ufffds second half. The timeline hasn\ufffdt changed, which means Hanrahan and the trade market enjoy the same status. Neither can be of much support 10 days into June., 40915=Ausmus has said the right things since he was hired last November. When it was suggested Monday he could only play the roster cards he has been dealt and not overly agonize about personnel beyond his control, he protested., 40066=Joe Nathan, once the portrait of game-closing supremacy, has four blown saves and a 7.04 ERA. He also has a two-year contract through 2015 and the better part of $20 million headed his way. And, yes, a 40th birthday is also on the docket in November., 41723=Dombrowski, at this stage, has few options and thus takes the same approach. He and Ausmus have been dealing with bullpen breakdowns that have been an intermittent menace since Bruce Rondon was lost to surgery during spring camp and Nathan began having occasional problems in early April., 43267=\ufffdIt would be different if his stuff was considerably down \ufffd and it\ufffds not down from last year,\ufffd Dombrowski said, referring to the fastball-slider combination that led to some standard Nathan numbers for the Rangers in 2013 (43 saves, 1.39 ERA, .162 opposing batting average)., 39817=The ninth inning, specifically, is haunting Detroit and its 2014 season. The Tigers have the ugliest ninth-inning ERA in all of baseball: 7.71, more ghastly than the next-worse team, the Angels at 6.08.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Joe Nathan has given up at least two earned runs in four of his last five outings: Closer not close It was not clear how confident was a manager, or his boss, with that thought. Not when a playoff ticket hinges so heavily on a single pitcher. Not when the Tigers on Monday were dealing with baseball\ufffds most troubled bullpen closer. Ausmus assured everyone Monday that Nathan would be back in the closer\ufffds cockpit as the Tigers got ready for the White Sox. Nathan had another tough go of it Saturday, throwing 32 pitches, and sat out Sunday evening\ufffds ninth. It was Chamberlain, until that point one of the bullpen\ufffds few happy stories from 2014, who got the latest dose of Ortiz\ufffds devilry. \ufffdWe have to straighten out our own guys,\ufffd Dombrowski said. \ufffd I know people are concerned. I see what the numbers are in the ninth inning. But we\ufffdre early in season. We\ufffdve struggled. We need to get Joe back and straightened out.\ufffd Corey Knebel, a rookie, has the pitches but not the experience to close and is probably soon headed back to Triple A Toledo. Chad Smith, his likely replacement, has no big-league background and is by no means a closer. Precisely what Dombrowski and the Tigers can otherwise do is, again, limited. Joba Chamberlain is important and effective as Detroit\ufffds set-up man. He also has Joel Hanrahan rehabilitating in Lakeland, Fla., 13",
