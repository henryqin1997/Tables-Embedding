Event Narrative A favorable La Nina Pattern resulted in severe drought conditions across portions of the Northwest Hill Country and the Northern Edwards Plateau. However, the drought improved across Brown, Irion, Mason, Menard, San Saba, and Schleicher Counties by early January as beneficial rainfall fell in December. According to the Texas crop weather report issued January 19 and 25 by the Texas A&M agriculture program, the following agricultural impacts were noted across the drought stricken counties of West Central Texas: extremely cold, dry and windy conditions continued. All counties needed rain to keep winter pastures and crops going. Extremely dry conditions continued to take a toll on wheat and oats. Small grain crops were complete failure in some areas. There was very little field activity due to dry soils. Producers increased Supplemental feeding of livestock as range land and pasture conditions continued to decline.
