    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{21638=A 2003 report by archaeologists indicates a possibility that grapes were mixed with rice to produce mixed fermented beverages in China in the early years of the seventh millennium BC. Pottery jars from the Neolithic site of Jiahu, Henan, contained traces of tartaric acid and other organic compounds commonly found in wine. However, other fruits indigenous to the region, such as hawthorn, cannot be ruled out.[21][22] If these beverages, which seem to be the precursors of rice wine, included grapes rather than other fruits, they would have been any of the several dozen indigenous wild species in China, rather than Vitis vinifera, which was introduced there 6,000 years later.[21], 66617=Outstanding vintages from the best vineyards may sell for thousands of dollars per bottle, though the broader term \"fine wine\" covers those typically retailing in excess of US$30\u201350.[80] \"Investment wines\" are considered by some to be Veblen goods: those for which demand increases rather than decreases as their prices rise. Particular selections have higher value, such as \"Verticals\", in which a range of vintages of a specific grape and vineyard, are offered. The most notable was a Chateau d'Yquem 135 year vertical containing every vintage from 1860 to 2003 sold for $1.5 million. The most common wines purchased for investment include those from Bordeaux and Burgundy; cult wines from Europe and elsewhere; and vintage port. Characteristics of highly collectible wines include:, 162391=While red wine contains the chemical resveratrol and there is tenative evidence it may improve heart health, the evidence is as of 2013 unclear in those at high risk.[110] Resveratrol is produced naturally by grape skins in response to fungal infection, including exposure to yeast during fermentation. As white wine has minimal contact with grape skins during this process, it generally contains lower levels of the chemical.[111], 114400=2006 Estimate (thousands of hectoliters), 18399=Archaeological evidence has established the earliest-known production of wine from fermenting grapes during the late Neolithic site of Hajji Firuz in the northern Zagros Mountains or early Chalcolithic in the Caucasus and the northern edge of the Middle East.[16] The earliest chemically attested grape wine in the world was discovered at Hajji Firuz in the northwestern Zagros Mountains of Kurdistan, ca. 5400 BC. Both archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that the earliest production of wine may slightly predate this, and the earliest wine making likely have taken place in Trans-Caucasia (including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia), through the region between Eastern Turkey, and North West Iran.[17][18], 104239=* Unofficial figure. ** May include official, semi-official or estimated data., 119617=The Wine Institute, a nonprofit group, tracked that the U.S. has been the largest wine consuming nation in the world since 2010, with residents individually consuming a total of 2.82 gallons a year in 2013, up from under 2 gallons in 1979.[89] Wine shipments within the U.S. from California alone were 215 million cases in 2013, up 3% from the previous year, with an estimated retail value of $23.1 billion, up 5%.[90] All American regions produce wine however, 95% comes from four regions with California as the most prolific producer, followed by Washington, Oregon and New York., 113849=2005 Estimate (thousands of hectoliters), 86936=* FAO estimate. ** May include official, semi-official or estimated data., 51910=France has various appellation systems based on the concept of terroir, with classifications ranging from Vin de Table (\"table wine\") at the bottom, through Vin de Pays and Appellation d'Origine Vin D\u00e9limit\u00e9 de Qualit\u00e9 Sup\u00e9rieure (AOVDQS), up to Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) or similar, depending on the region.[59][60] Portugal has developed a system resembling that of France and, in fact, pioneered this concept in 1756 with a royal charter creating the Demarcated Douro Region and regulating the production and trade of wine.[61] Germany created a similar scheme in 2002, although it has not yet achieved the authority of the other countries' classification systems.[62][63] Spain, Greece and Italy have classifications based on a dual system of region of origin and product quality.[64], 112088=The UK was the world's largest importer of wine in 2007.[88], 151235=Alcoholic beverages, including wine, are forbidden under most interpretations of Islamic law.[98] Iran had previously had a thriving wine industry that disappeared after the Islamic Revolution in 1979.[99] In Greater Persia, mey (Persian wine) was a central theme of poetry for more than a thousand years, long before the advent of Islam. Some Alevi sects use wine in their religious services., 23044=The spread of wine culture westwards was most probably due to the Phoenicians who spread outward from a base of city-states along the Lebanese and Israeli coast.[23] The wines of Byblos were exported to Egypt during the Old Kingdom and then throughout the Mediterranean. Evidence includes two Phoenician shipwrecks from 750 BC discovered by Robert Ballard, whose cargo of wine was still intact.[24] As the first great traders in wine (cherem), the Phoenicians seem to have protected it from oxidation with a layer of olive oil, followed by a seal of pinewood and resin, again similar to retsina., 94819=* FAO estimate. ** May include official, semi-official or estimated data. *** FAO data based on imputation methodology., 115056=In 2003, world wine production had reached 269 millions of hectoliters. The world's main 15 wine producers were:, 19734=The earliest form of grape-based fermented drink was found in northern China, where archaeologists discovered 9,000-year-old pottery jars,[12] while the earliest archaeological evidence of wine particles found has been in Georgia, where archaeologists discovered evidence of wine residue inside ceramic jars that were dated back some 8000 years[5][19][20] and Iran (c.\u20095000 BC).[7] The earliest evidence of wine production was discovered in Armenia within the Areni-1 winery in 2007 and is at least 6,100 years old, making it the oldest winery in the world. The development of a winery implies wine had started being produced much earlier.[9][10][11]}",
