The youngsters probably won't play in the European Cup but their inclusion highlights how highly they are rated at the club. 'It is great this chance they are getting to witness and take part in first-team training and be involved on European trips because not only does it hopefully motivate them but it will inspire all the other young lads as well,' reserve boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told the Manchester Evening News. 'Macheda is a big talent. He has the ability and can score goals. It is not easy to leave your home country at 16 and come to a new culture. It takes time to settle down. But he signed pro in August last year and has buckled down and got a professional head on him. We expected him to make progress and he has. He is a big, young lad and has good technique and is quick. 'He scored goals for the Under-18s but unfortunately because we have struggled with forwards in the reserves he has had to play up front a lot on his own. 'But it is all a part of the learning curve for him. He is hungry to improve. 'Davide is a No.10 because he plays behind the striker and can also play in midfield. They bounce off each other and look for each other in matches. Sometimes partnerships like that just happen. Like Federico, Davide took his time to adapt. It takes six months to get used to United's intense training. But he has found his feet. 'He is technically and tactically very gifted. He scores some great free kicks and goals. He scores the kind of goals you would put on a DVD because he is capable of the spectacular.' I'd say they are in the right hands - they can't ask for a better natural striker to educate them!, 14534=Di Maria Was Always a Risky Buy! (Tuesday July 28 2015), 13937=Van Gaal`s Dilemma!
