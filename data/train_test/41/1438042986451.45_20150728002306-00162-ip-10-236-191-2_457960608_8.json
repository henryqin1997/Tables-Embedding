    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6227=The mobile phone 1 shown in FIG. 1 comprises a wireless apparatus housing 1 a in which a telephone functional circuit part and a battery are accommodated. Various buttons including a dial button, as well as a display, are disposed on the front surface of the wireless apparatus housing 1 a. Furthermore, a fixed antenna part 2 which is a multiple resonance antenna according to the present invention is mounted on the upper surface of the wireless apparatus housing 1 a. For example, this fixed antenna part 2 is formed as an antenna that can operate in three frequency bands, i.e., 900 MHz band of the AMPS system, the 1.8 GHz band of the PCS system, and the GPS system in which the satellite transmission frequency is set at approximately 1575 MHz.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{45931=In cases where the fixed antenna part 2 in which an antenna element 14 formed with the first pattern example or second pattern example is formed on the outer circumferential surface of the antenna bobbin 12 is set so as to be operable in three frequency bands, i.e., the 900 MHz band of the AMPS system, the 1.8 GHz band of the PCS system, and the GPS system in which the satellite transmission frequency is set at approximately 1575 MHz, the first element 14 a operates mainly in the frequency band of the AMPS system, and the second element 14 b operates mainly in the PCS system and GPS system. However, since the first element 14 a and second element 14 b are disposed in close proximity to each other, these elements do not operate independently, but rather influence each other. As a result, the antenna element 14 as a whole can operate in the three frequency bands of the AMPS system, PCS system and GPS system. Furthermore, since a parasitic conductor 11 which is inserted into the accommodating hole 12 a of the antenna bobbin 12 is disposed in close proximity to the pattern of such an antenna element 14, the antenna element 14 is influenced by the parasitic conductor 11, so that the electrical characteristics are improved to good electrical characteristics in the frequency bands of the AMPS system, PCS system and GPS system, and a fixed antenna 2 that can operate in the three frequency bands is obtained. Moreover, the impedance of the fixed antenna part 2 in the frequency bands in which this antenna part can operate is approximately 50 \u03a9; accordingly, a matching circuit for matching with the wireless apparatus circuit can be omitted., 23716=This application is the U.S. National Phase under 35 U.S.C. \ufffd371 of International Application PCT/JP03/06531, filed May 26, 2003, which claims priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-168640, filed Jun. 10, 2002 in the name of NIPPON ANTENA KABUSHIKI KAISHA. The International Application was published under PCT Article 21(2) in a language other than English., 25472=Furthermore, in the case of mobile phones, GPS receivers for GPS systems in which the satellite transmission frequency is set at approximately 1575 MHz have been incorporated into the apparatus. The mounting of an antenna which operates in a plurality of frequency bands is required in mobile phones that thus receive or transmit a plurality of frequency bands. Conventionally, therefore, a planar antenna or small-volume chip antenna has been installed inside the wireless apparatus housing as an antenna that operates in a plurality of frequency bands in addition to the main externally mounted antenna. In such cases, however, the antenna occupies volume inside the wireless apparatus housing, and interferes with the compact construction of the wireless apparatus. Furthermore, when the user grips the mobile phone, the proportion of the internal antenna that is covered by the hand is large, so that there is a deterioration in the antenna characteristics during the use of the mobile phone., 24432=The frequency band used by mobile phone systems is generally considered to be a plurality of frequency bands. For example, in the case of PDC systems (personal digital cellular telecommunication systems) in Japan, the 800 MHz band (810 MHz to 956 MHz) and the 1.4 GHz band (1429 MHz to 1501 MHz) are used, and in the case of digital cellular systems in the United States, at least the 900 MHz band (824 MHz to 894 MHz) is used for AMPS (advanced mobile phone service) systems, and the 1.8 GHz band (1850 MHz to 1990 MHz) is used for PCS (personal communication service) systems. Furthermore, in Europe, the 900 MHz band (870 MHz to 960 MHz) is used for GSM (global system for mobile communications) systems, and the 1.8 GHz band (1710 MHz to 1880 MHz) is used for DCS (digital cellular system) systems. The reason for such use of a plurality of frequency bands is that the number of frequencies that can be utilized in a single frequency band is insufficient due to an increase in the number of subscribers.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Moreover, if such a multiple resonance antenna is formed so that this antenna can be fastened to a housing as a fixed antenna part, and a mobile phone antenna is constructed from this fixed antenna part and a retractable antenna part which passes through the fixed antenna part and is retractable with respect to this fixed antenna part, a compact mobile phone antenna with good electrical characteristics which can be operated in a plurality of frequency bands can be obtained. In this case, the electrical characteristics in the retracted state can be further improved by positioning an expanded-diameter part formed at an intermediate point on the retractable antenna part inside the through-hole in the antenna bobbin when the retractable antenna part is extended. As was described above, since a conductive parasitic conductor is inserted into the accommodating hole of an insulating antenna bobbin on which the pattern of an element that resonates in a plurality of frequency bands is formed, a multiple resonance antenna with good electrical characteristics which can be operated in a plurality of frequency bands can be obtained. Furthermore, this antenna can be made compact. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY In the fixed antenna part 2 described above, instead of inserting a parasitic conductor 11 into the accommodating hole 12 a formed in the antenna bobbin 12, it would also be possible to form a conductive film 12 a on the",
