The theme for this year\u2019s event sponsored by the American Radio Relay League is \u201cWhen All Else Fails, Ham Radio Works.\u201d The emphasis this year is that when events like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, ice, snow and even the cutting of fiber optic cable leaves populations without phone, cell and other communication services there will be ham radio to help them communicate. Last year\u2019s event drew more than 35,000 amateur radio enthusiasts to the airwaves. \u201cThe fastest way to turn a crisis into a total disaster is to lose communications,\u201d said Allen Pitts of ARRL. \u201cFrom the earthquake and tsunami in Japan to tornadoes in Missouri, ham radio provided the most reliable communications networks in the first critical hours of the events. Because ham radio operators are not dependent on the Internet, cell towers or other infrastructure, they work when nothing else is available. We need nothing between us but the air.\u201d In addition, ham radio operators can often be a link between loved ones serving in the military and the family back home. Activities for local hams from Gilchrist, Levy and Dixie counties will be in the Gilchrist County Emergency Operations Center this weekend. The public is invited to come out and meet and talk with the ham radio operators and make new friends. \u00a0}",
