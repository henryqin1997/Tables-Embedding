            "I have never had a problem on campus. The spirits are always high and students are very friendly. One great thing, however, is that a student can be escorted to his or her car at night by CSUN security.",
            "The great thing about this school is that any type of student can thrive and enjoy time here. It can be home to athletes, soon-to-be scholars, or even just students who are also working.",
            "There is a turtle pond on the southeast corner of the campus that is a nice place to relax and enjoy a little dose of nature.",
            "The SRC is amazing! Theres is so much that students can do in there. The SRC at CSUN offers rock climbing, spinning classes, dance classes, weight training, sports and so much more. When classes are fairly easy I like to spend hours a week in the SRC staying fit.",
            "I like to Crossfit as many days a week as I can. On Fridays and Sundays I practice cultural dances in Santa Fe Springs with other Bolivian friends.",
            "There are plenty of CSUN \u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a8spots\u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2\u00a8 nearby where student will gather and have fun at. My favorite would be Showgun Sushi on the southeast corner of Reseda and Devonshire.",
            "I don`t live on campus. I live 10 minutes away. It`s very convenient, actually.",
            "I spend hours inside of the Oviatt Library studying. I slack off here and there as do most student. However, I am determined to achieve a respectable GPA to get into graduate school.",
            "With fewer classes, enrollment is becoming more and more difficult. Be on top of your deadlines and know your enrollment date by heart. Enrolling in classes the minute your enrollment time comes will be your best bet of getting the classes you want.",
            "It`s no wonder than CSUN is ranked 68th in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities (West) by US News. This school offers incredibly small class sizes which are ideal for getting the best of lecture time. CSUN`s vast variety of degree programs ensures than just about anyone can attend CSUN and study what he or she wishes."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{136352=I highly recommend the dorms to the newly incoming freshmen so they can start many new people and have a great sense of community within the dorm life. Also there is events sponsors by the RA (Residental Advisor) with free movie screenings, ice cream parties, and even peer advisement. For exercise, their are volleyball nets, a small field for soccer, and basketball courts. The only downside is that the Matador Patrol closes the gates at 7:30 pm so if you need to enter to the dorms, you have to sign and verify with matador patrol before you enter., 1103142=As an Alumni, class of 2012, i really took advantage of all the opportunities that were offered to me in the School of Sociology. The professors are great and really allow you to learn skills that are practiced in the classroom so that you can immediately start using in the workforce. Professor Morgaine, Hatkoff, and Debose were my mentors, teachers, life coaches, and friends., 56915=I love CSUN,but if I were living on campus I would have a lot more fun.The sports are fun and it is easy to get involved with activities.The campus is beautiful and they are building a new Art center which is suppose to open in 2011.I also love the library because I always can find what I am looking for in there if I can't find it at my local library., 675507=I don't dorm, but I do live across the dorms, there is a curfew for getting inside without having to be checked in, they close the gates at 7:30. Also they are fairly overpriced, but I do still wish I dormed to meet new people., 235458=there are many fun events held at c.su.n. such as concerts by well known artists like b.o.b. and the cataracs, who performed in the fall semester, 2011. they recently built the student recreational center where students can become fit and active. best part it is free for students! during the hot weathers c.s.u.n. has a big pool where students can cool off., 75282=Great school. May not have the prestige of other schools like the UCs but it is one of the best CSUs in the state and has a great business program., 874348=I had no fun time. I tranferred in 2006 Fall semester from Mission College and I Graduated from CSUN in Spring 2008. My goal was to complete my BA as soon as possible because I was having a baby in Sep 2008. I had no time to see or do fun things at school... but study,go to class and take exams., 740882=I've been a student majoring in Civil Engineering here at Cal State Northridge since the Fall of 2007. I have seen the campus grow with student life and expand. CSUN has just finished building a new student recreation center, parking structures, updated technology in classrooms, and improved student life on campus. Overall I have enjoyed my years here and despite the large majority of peers commuting to and from, the student body can connect on campus. Go Matadors!, 714536=CSUN has an entire escort system that guards the library and personally approaches students to walk them either to their car or back to the dorms. Security guards have two shacks on the outskirts of Student Housing and patrol from 7:30 pm- 3:00 am. The guards are pretty cool, they actually like chatting with students and asking what's going on with them. They also patrol inside of Student Housing too., 597215=They are not acceptng new applicants until 2013., 739714=CSUN has updated their dormitory life since 2007 and provided better meals for on campus dining., 122576=This year 2012 the hired various security! Its really good., 987137=It`s no wonder than CSUN is ranked 68th in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities (West) by US News. This school offers incredibly small class sizes which are ideal for getting the best of lecture time.
