On the first of July last there were in the men's building 184; in the women's building 167, and in the hospital 144; on the first of the following January there were in the same buildings 397, 208 and 149 respectively. It will be observed that the variation in the case of the men outside the hospital was much greater than in that of the women, while in the case of the sick it was practically nothing. As a rule the male population is about twice as great in winter as in summer and the hospital population remains about constant. The following table shows the movement of the population during 1897:, 708079=The pension system of the United States, which, including the appropriation for the current year, has taken from the Treasury more than a billion and a half of dollars (over 94 per cent. having been paid out since 1861), had its rise August 26, 1776, in a resolution of the Continental Congress providing that every commissioned officer, non-commissioned officer and private soldier who shall lose a limb in any engagement, or be so disabled in the service of the United States of America as to render him incapable of afterwards getting a livelihood, shall receive during his life or the continuance of such disability the one-half of his monthly pay from and after the time that his pay as an officer [or soldier] ceases. The monthly pay of a captain of infantry in active service was $26, and that of a private was $6. The benefits of the resolution were also extended to officers, marines, and seamen serving upon armed vessels. Claims were to be adjusted through the legislative bodies of the States where the applicants resided, which were authorized to make proportionate allowances in cases of less than total disability. In 1782 a maximum pension of $5 per month was granted to disabled privates and non-commissioned officers in lieu of half-pay. On account of the inability of Congress to raise money by taxation, the States, in 1785, undertook the payment of pensions, until the adoption of the Constitution made it possible for the general government to perform this function., 475860=Five hundred and seventy women have graduated from this school. Among these alumnae may be found many individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the nursing profession. Miss Ida M. Barrett, an early graduate, became the superintendent of the hospital and school of nursing in 1893. She remained in this position for twenty-five years and served both hospital and school with intense devotion and remarkable success. Miss Mary Welsh, also an early graduate, became assistant superintendent and dietitian under Miss Barrett. After serving the hospital in this capacity for eighteen years, she became the superintendent of nurses and assistant superintendent of the hospital. Beyond question, when two fine women of such remarkable character are each willing to devote twenty-five years to the growth and development of a school, that school is destined to become a splendid influence in the development of nursing in that community. Miss Welsh, after a number of years of service elsewhere, returned to Blodgett to resume her work as superintendent of nurses and now occupies that position there. Her remarkable character and intelligent direction of the school commands universal respect and the love and devotion of every nurse who has ever been so fortunate as to serve under her., 466848=Nineteen hundred and twenty-eight young men and young women have graduated from his school of nursing and have gone \"into all the world,\" where they are holding positions of trust and responsibility. Mrs. Mary Staines Foy, a member of the first class, then again of the class of 1890, has been intimately and constructive associated wit the Battle Creek Sanitarium for fifty-one years. For the past thirty she has been the director of nurses. Miss Charlotte Hoffman, also an early graduate, went to Honolulu to be chief nurse in the sanitarium there. She worked in several missions in California and in 1913 she returned to Battle Creek to take charge of t he nursing service for the obstetric and out-patient departments of the sanitarium. Miss Lenna Cooper, 1900, was selected by the United States government to be the chief dietitian during the World War. At present she is food director of the University of Michigan and professor of institutional administration of Battle Creek College. Miss Leone Sweet, 1903, Miss Jessie Midgley, 1903, Miss Fern Sheick, 1924, as well as other alumn\u00c3\u00a6, are teaching or supervising in their own school., 950754=\"In 1934 I obtained employment as a weaver in the Montrose mill. I worked steady the whole year except for a few weeks when the mill was closed by a strike. But working conditions had changed. They were as different as day and night from the working conditions of the 1920 to 1930 period. The pay had been greatly reduced and the amount of work per man had been increased. I had been making $40 a week as a weaver operating two looms. Now I am operating six looms on the same material and only making $24 a week. I am lucky that I am working on fine worsted cloth because in some mills on coarser cloth, the weavers now operate from eight to twenty-four looms for $24 a week. Apparently the only thing that a textile worker can rely upon in these times is that the mill owner will never suffer lower profits as long as he can transfer the burden upon his employees., 652324=Enston's estate at his death in 1860 was valued at $1 million, but reduced by half after losses from the Civil War. The project was delayed until after Mrs. Enston's death in 1886, when the City received the whole of the estate. Charleston Mayor William A. Courtenay corresponded with the mayor of Canterbury to develop the concept for the \"model village.\", 946981=\"In 1928 work in the mills began to slacken and I was laid off. After being out of work for two months I secured employment in the Saranac mill as a weaver. At this job I received $40 a week, but I believed that in a short time I would again find employment as warp-starter. The next year conditions were worse and I was without work for three months. My wife and I were not worried about the future, as we believed that the mills would be slack for only a short period, as they were in 1921. So we lived on what I made and did not touch the $3,500 that we had in the bank. I was without work for six months in 1930 and we were forced to use some of the money that we had saved. But I was in a better position than most of my friends who were buying houses and were unable to meet their payments. My brother Peter was caught in this condition and as the bank was going to foreclose on his house I loaned him $500. I knew that he, a cutter in the Rubber Shop, making $70 a week, would be able to repay me as soon as his work picked up. Then without warning the Rubber Shop closed down and moved out of the city, throwing 1,500 people out of work. The next year, 1931, the bottom dropped out of everything and we were forced to use up most of our savings. In only one way, was I fortunate, and that was that I had no more Doctor's bills to pay, as my wife was well again. The bank foreclosed on my brother's house and my $500 was gone. My father died in July and after the funeral my mother came to live with me. She did not live long after my father but died in October, 1931. As neither my father nor mother believed in life insurance, all of their children contributed to the cost of the funerals. I was unable to find work and spent the entire year hanging around the streets. By the end of 1931 my bank balance was less than $500 and going down rapidly., 162680=A 1948 Social Security Advisory Council report suggested that additional Old Age Assistance (OAA) payments should be made available for poor people who required medical care, since the amount they were receiving was insufficient to cover it.\u00a0, 53381=Sailor's Snug Harbor was continuously in operation until the late 1960's, creating an interesting opportunity to see life in an old age home across several eras. That long span of existence and its location near a large city meant it was well-documented. Author Theodore Dreiser, lived nearby and got to know the the inmates of the place well. In his 1899 book, The Color of the Great City, he concluded that institutionalization was not a good solution for their old age, because \"...this is a great institution and indeed a splendid benefaction, but it insists upon what is the bane and destruction of heart and mind: conformity to routine, a monotonous system which wears as the drifting of water.\"\u00a0(Snug Harbor Cultural Center) More insight was provided in an article in Harpers Magazine which describes life in Sailor's Snug Harbor in 1873, and in another article from the depression-era Federal Writer's Project which describes life in Sailor's Snug Harbor in 1938.\u00a0 (Harpers Magazine, 1873) (Federal Writer's Project, 1938), 211453=Questions about nursing home quality continued to dominate. By 1960 a U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging report said that 44% of nursing home beds failed to meet Hill-Burton fire and health standards. This should not have been surprising because few had been held to those standards (or any standards!) when they were built., 920597=\"No action was taken by any state until 8 years later, in 1923. In that year three states, Montana, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, passed old age assistance laws, but only one of them, that of Montana, has remained in the statute books. In 1925 the Nevada state legislature passed a bill repealing the 1923 law, and putting another one in its place. The Pennsylvania law was declared unconstitutional in 1924 on the basis of the state constitution, which prohibited the legislature from making appropriations for charitable, benevolent and educational purposes. Pennsylvania proceeded immediately to take steps to amend its constitution, but it was not until 1931 that the amendment passed the legislature. Since this amendment had to be repassed in 1933 and then submitted to a referendum vote for approval, it was not until 1934 that Pennsylvania secured action. Thus the decision of the court deferred legislation for ten years in Pennsylvania., 37955=That group probably included some victims of dementia. The words \"dotage\" and \"dementia\" had been used by physicians and researchers as far back as Roman times, but the distinctions between dementia, other types of mental illness, and normal aging were not well understood in the 1800's. The term \"senile dementia\"\u00a0 was first used in 1838 by Dr. Jean \u00c3?tienne Esquirol. Dr. Alois Alzheimer would not discover that \"Alzheimers Disease\" resulted from plaques and tangles in the brain until 1906. (David Shenk, The Forgetting, 2001), 817018=Reputed centenarians in this country whose ages exceed a hundred by more than three or four years have no documentary or satisfactory evidence to offer. The oldest, of whose age there is little room for doubt, though the documentary proof is not complete, was Mrs. Emily Robins Talcott, of the age of 105 years and 4 months. She was born near Hartford, Conn., where she spent most of her life, and died of bronchitis April 20, 1896. Her memory, health, and eyesight were good, and she took care of her own room. She had shaken hands with Washington and Lafayette, and had seen Fulton's first steamboat ascend the Hudson. She said her great-grandmother was 107, and that her mother was within a few weeks of 100., 88895=As more people became unable to support themselves or rely on their families in their old age, there were movements in various states to provide public cash assistance to the poor elderly in order to keep them out of the poorhouses. Arizona enacted a law in 1914 which abolished almshouses and provided pensions for aged persons and people with disabilities. That law was declared unconstitutional by the State Supreme Court in 1916, but they made some changes and passed a law that did conform with the constitution., 997676=For the first year, 1924 $151.74 per person per year $12.64 per person per month \" 1925 $174.14 \" $14.36 \" \" 1926 $179.59 \" $14.96 \" \" 1927 $167.97 \" $13.91 \" \" 1928 $188.35 \" $15.69 \" \" 1929 $168.77 \" $14.15 \" \" 1930 $154.30 \" $12.85 \" \" 1931 $158.34 \" $13.18 \" \" 1932 $145.37 \" $12.12 \" \" 1933 $ 87.32 \" $ 7.27 \", 715775=In 1780 the Continental Congress granted half-pay for seven years to the widows of officers dying in the Revolutionary service., 656604=The Mexican War has not proved an expensive one. A service pension was not granted until 1887. About 8000 claims were allowed under this act last year, the payment being eight dollars per month in each case., 735594=Proceedings of this sort always open the door to fraud, and it is only saying that citizens of the pensionable classes have not maintained among themselves a higher level of integrity than prevails among their fellows, to say that fraud and imposition have here found a peculiarly inviting and profitable field. In the debate on the Revolutionary service pension act of 1832 the extensive frauds committed under former acts were referred to as matters of common knowledge. The compiler of the first digest of pension laws, in 1854, a late chief clerk of the Pension Office, attributed to the chaotic state of pension legislation, and to the ex parte system of adjudicating claims, the perpetration of innumerable frauds against the government., 457223=Miss Margaret McDermid was left in charge of the school when Miss McLaughlin went overseas. She was followed by Miss Lula B. Durkee, 1894. Miss Durkee had also seen service in the Spanish-American War., 731222=But the sentiment of gratitude affords the only legitimate reason that can be urged for any of our service pension laws since the resolution of October 21, 1780. To this sentiment has been added as a ground for our pensions of the second class, in which the indigence of the beneficiary is a requisite, the consideration that the nations defenders and their dependents ought not to be abandoned to want, or the humiliation of alms, from whatever cause their need may have arisen., 382625=The institution was to be opened as soon as the income from the estate, in the judgment of the trustees, should seem sufficient to. support fifty seamen. But the persons thus designated as trustees being also the appointed executors of the will of Captain Randall, soon found themselves inconvenienced in the management of the estate by reason of the changes which took place in the ordinary course of elections and appointments to these offices, and therefore applied for, and in February, 1806, received, an act of incorporation from the Legislature. The first trustees were John Lansing, Jun., Chancellor of State; De Witt Clinton, Mayor; Maturin Livingston, Recorder of the city; John Murray, president of the Chamber of Commerce; James Farquar and Thomas Farmar, president and vice-president of the Marine Society the Rev. Benjamin Moore, senior minister of the Episcopal Church; and the Rev. John Rodgers, senior minister of the Presbyterian Church. At their first meeting they elected officers, adopted by-laws, and appointed a committee to prepare a suitable design for a seal for the corporation, the device of which, when subsequently adopted, represented a harbor formed by two points of land projecting into the sea, in which a ship appears riding safely at anchor, and on the shore, in the background, a view of the hospital, with the motto, Portum petimus fessi., 711831=Invalid pensions on account of disability incurred after the Revolution, began with the act of April 30, 1790, creating The Military Establishment of the United States, and promising pensions to officers and enlisted men who should be wounded or disabled in the regular service, at rates fixed under rules to be established by the President, not to exceed half-pay for commissioned officers, and $5 per month for others. This provision was extended by subsequent enactments to volunteer troops raised for special purposes, including the war of 1812, the Florida and Mexican wars, and the late rebellion. In 1816, rates for disabilities of the highest degree were graduated from $17 per month for first lieutenants, down to $8 for non-commissioned officers and privates. By appropriate legislation, officers and enlisted men in the navy and marine corps were kept on a substantial equality, with respect to pension, with those who served in the army., 666141=From this statement of facts, it is evident that there must be something wrong in the method of proving claims. The labors of the Pension Office, at this rate, would seem to be interminable. The force of clerks employed is as large as it ever was, and consists of 1500 employees, at a cost of over $2,000,000 a year. The number of claims filed, as we have seen, increases annually, and the delay involved in their adjudication increases patri passu with the increase of claims. The fault lies in the system followed in proving claims under the law., 713495=A few years later pensioners for disability incurred prior to March 4, 1861, were placed on the same footing as to rates with pensioners under the act of 1862. The rates established in the latter act have continued to be the totals of the respective ranks. But the term is misleading; it has never been restricted to cases of total inability to perform manual labor, though for a few years the rates of 1862 were the highest granted in any instance., 399749=We found lying in bed, in one of the wards, with a bowl of chicken soup on a small table beside him, a invalid, Charles Risby, Norwegian by birth, and seventy-seven years old. He arrived in this country at Boston on the day that the long embargo went into operation. During the war of 1812 he belonged to the Constitution, on board of which he participated in the fight with the Guerriere. In the same ward was Ebenezer Lakemann, who, while serving in the American privateer Buckskin, of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1813, captured the English schooner Marianne, which was recaptured, with him on board as prize-master, by the English frigate Maidstone. He was taken to England and imprisoned there, and afterward exchanged for one of the crew of the Guerriere., 407346=Dora Costa has collected statistics on the marital status of elderly men and women from 1880 to today. She discovered that the percentage of older men and women who are married has hardly changed in the last century, and that throughout that period older women are only half as likely as older men to be married. She points out that the increased life expectancy of women is partly responsible for that difference in the later years. In earlier years, when there was not as much difference in life expectancy, women were more likely to marry men who were much older than themselves, so they often outlived their husbands. In later years, the percentage of women who were widowed began to decline, but it was compensated for by an increase in the percentage of divorced and never married women, while the percentage of age 65+ women who were married remained fairly constant., 335960=In 1875, the home was transferred to more commodious quarters at 144 Island Street, upon property belonging to Mr. and Mrs. E. P. Fuller, who generously donated its use rent-free for a number of years., 287461=Library of Congress: Pioneering the Upper Midwest: Books from Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, ca. 1820-1910, 740041=In 1882 it was greatly augmented, and the special agents or examiners instead of making their headquarters in Washington, as before, were stationed in different parts of the country, each with a definite district. A marked increase in the quantity and thoroughness of the work performed by this branch of the Pension Bureau was thus effected. Commissioner Dudley said, in his report of 1883: The means taken to prevent the successful consummation of fraud are reasonably efficient to that end, and it may be easily demonstrated, I think, that such claims [i.e., claims without merit] are, to be found mostly in our rejected files. If it be doubted whether the rejected files have gathered in so large a proportion of the unworthy claims as this opinion would indicate, it is at least safe to say that instances of gross fraud have become comparatively rare. The ratio of the cases specially investigated in any year to the whole number of pending claims is always very small. Of those that are tested in this way, it is probable that few dishonest ones pass the ordeal successfully; and it is certain that the presence throughout the country of agents of the government charged with the detection of violations of the pension laws has a deterrent effect upon those who would otherwise resort to fraudulent practices., 722576=A service pension was first granted to widows in 1836, by legislation which gave to the widows of persons entitled under the act of June 7, 1832, the same pensions which the husbands drew or might have drawn, provided marriage took place before the expiration of the last period of service. This was the first allowance of pension of any sort to the widows of Revolutionary soldiers after the seven years half-pay of 1780 to the widows of officers, nor were children of these soldiers ever pensioned in their own right except by special acts of Congress. The limitation as to marriage was from time to time moved forward, and repealed altogether in 1853., 1109609=The data in the following table comes from a variety of sources, and it's impossible to tell if all of them were referring to exactly the same facilities and residents, so it is imprecise. However, it probably is good enough to create a very general picture of nursing home utilization and expenditures in the mid-twentieth century. The explosion in utilization and costs that took place after FHA financial assistance for nursing home construction was made available in 1959 and again after Medicare and Medicaid were enacted in 1965 is obvious. Also note that the percentage of the cost borne by the federal government increased far more than that borne by state and local government., 341311=Fifteen years after possessing its first new building, and almost simultaneously with the erection of the new Butterworth Hospital, 1926, St. Mary's Hospital enlarged its quarter and perfected its equipment on the scale that the social growth of the twentieth century demands. The realty know as The Elmwood, lying south of the main hospital building, was acquired. An addition was made to the main building, and a new unit was erected for maternity and children's cases. The extension was largely planned by Sister Superior Mary Bernard. A high Authority on nursing, who visited Grand Rapids shortly after it went into operation, declared that the unit for mothers and children was one of the most perfectly planned buildings for the purpose in the United States, and that some woman must have thought it out. St. Mary's Hospital in its new form is arranged according to the Bacon plan. The latest additions represent an outlay of $550,000 in buildings and of $50,000 in equipment and furniture. The architect were Berlin and Swern, of Chicago, with Harry L. Mead, of Grand Rapids., 59375=Poorer families couldn't afford to hire private nurses, but home care services for the poor also emerged around this time, launched by women like Lillian Wald of New York City, who had been trained as a nurse and was studying to become a doctor. During her medical studies Wald volunteered to visit poor immigrant pregnant women, elderly, and disabled people in their homes. When she saw the need of the poor for medical care, she dropped her medical studies and organized the Henry Street Settlement in 1893, also called the Visiting Nurse Society (VNS) of New York. These early home care agencies were directed to the poor and were supported by philanthropy, often \"Societies\" of wealthy women interested in public works. (VNSNY)\u00a0, 629330=The spirit of this legislation is indicated by the preambles to the statutes introducing it. The laws of New Zealand and New South Wales declare that \"it is equitable that deserving persons who, during the term of life, have helped to bear the public burden of the Commonwealth by the payment of taxes, and by opening up its resources by their labor and skill, should receive from the colony pensions in their old age.\" The law of Victoria goes even further, asserting that \"it is the duty of the state to make provision for its aged and helpless poor.\" As the main features of these systems are reproduced in the recently adopted system of Australia, a brief description of the latter will suffice. In order to secure a pension in Australia, the applicant must have attained the age of sixty-five, must have resided in the country for twenty-five years continuously prior to the date of application, must be of good character (that is, have led a temperate and reputable life during the five years immediately preceding the date of application), must not have deserted husband, wife, or children, and must be in need of the assistance, the test being the amount of income from other sources (not more than \u00c2\u00a352) or the amount of property owned (not more than \u00c2\u00a3310). The persons satisfying these requirements are entitled to pensions of not more than \u00c2\u00a386 ($130) a year. If the income from other sources amounts to more than \u00c2\u00a326, the pension is reduced correspondingly, the total income being kept down to \u00c2\u00a352 a year ($250). It is too early to judge of the effect of this federal old-age pension policy in Australia. The New Zealand system, however, has now been in operation for more than ten years, and some notion of its tendencies may be formed. The total number of pensioners in 1908, out of a population of about one million, was 13,569. The expenditure for pensions in that year was $1,626,000, or approximately $1.70 per capita of the population.7 Since the system was introduced, the number of pensionaires has increased year by year, but not with alarming rapidity. The amount paid in pensions has trebled during the ten years from 1899 to 1908, but this fact was due in large measure to changes in the law which increased the maximum pension from \u00c2\u00a318 to \u00c2\u00a326. As an offset to this expenditure, the pension policy has reduced the amount expended on outdoor relief; there has been, on the other hand, an increase in the amount spent in indoor relief, but that is explained chiefly by more liberal provision for indoor paupers., 923935=\"In 1930 the Massachusetts and New York laws were passed, which not only were of the mandatory type but also provided for the state sharing in the expense of the locality., 50572=One of the earliest planned \"retirement communities\" was the William Enston Home in Charleston, SC, constructed in 1889. It is described by the National Park Service Register of Historic Places as follows:\u00a0, 1059759=[After retiring from the Army] he was employed in the County Clerk's office and was later appointed to fill the unexpired term of a former incumbent of the office of County Assessor and Collector of taxes and, while so engaged, industriously applied himself to the study of law. He was admitted to the bar in 1851, license being granted by Hon. O. M. Roberts, the presiding judge, afterwards Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court, Governor of Texas, and later, senior law professor in the University of Texas. Major Beaton afterwards, for a period of over thirty years, engaged in the practice of the profession., 782336=Edward Miller. Born in Halifax in 1866 but has been thirty years in the United States. Is a carriage smith, intemperate. IHas received no public aid. Does not know his wife's present whereabouts. Has two children in the Mareella Street Home. Needs medical treatment. His father and stepmother unable to aid him on account of their own sickness., 51549=Sailor's Snug Harbor was built in 1833 on Staten Island New York as a 130-acre campus for \"old and worn out seamen\", funded by a generous bequest from Robert Randall, who left the bulk of his fortune to endow \"...an Asylum, or Marine Hospital, to be called \"Sailor's Snug Harbor\" for the purpose of maintaining and supporting aged, decrepit, and worn-out sailors.\" Randall had originally made a bequest of land in Manhattan, but by the time litigation surrounding the will was settled, New York City had grown substantially and the Trustees of Snug Harbor decided that Randall's farmland was too valuable a piece of real estate to be used for a seamen's retreat, so they sold it and used the proceeds to purchase the 130-acre Isaac Housman farm in what was then a rural area of Staten Island. Eventually, the site included dormitories, gardens, a greenhouse, dining rooms, workrooms, barns, a dairy, a hospital, a sanitarium, a bakery, a laundry, a snack bar, a library, a vaudeville house, a church and a chapel.\u00a0, 179948=A consensus was building that facilities for the aged should focus on providing medical care, as well as residential care, and legislators decided to actively promote the development of skilled nursing homes. In 1954 the Hill-Burton Act was amended to provide funds to nonprofit organizations for the construction of skilled nursing facilities that met certain hospital-like building standards, if built \"in conjunction with a hospital\".\u00a0, 222443=While the bill's authors intended to exclude nursing home coverage from Medicare, the general public assumed that long term care costs would be paid for by Medicare, since much of the promotional material they were hearing said that Medicare would help the elderly \"avoid dependence\". Discussions in the U.S. Senate underscored the fact that legislators knew that there was a discrepancy between the public expectation and the bill that was being voted on. During 1965 Senate Finance Committee hearings, Chairman Russell Long asked HEW Chairman Celebrezze, \"Why do you leave out the real catastrophes, the catastrophic illnesses?\" Celebrezze replied that it was \"not intended for those that are going to stay in institutions year-in and year-out.\" Senator Long responded, \"Almost everybody I know of who comes in and says we ought to have medicare picks out the very kind of cases that you and I are talking about where a person is sick for a lot longer than 60 days and needs a lot more hospitalization.\" Senator Allen Ellender stated on the Senate floor that \"many sons and daughters whose mothers and fathers are growing old are of the belief that under the pending bill they will be able to get the Government to take care of their older parents, in the event they become ill for long periods of time\" (Twight, 1997)., 299059=A third Roman Catholic home for the sick, St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital, on East Grand Boulevard, is as recent as 1922. This is under the control of the Sisters of Mercy, two branches of which order are operating hospitals in Michigan, one of them centered at Dubuque, Iowa, and the other at Grand Rapids. St. Joseph's has 185 beds and maintains an outpatient department., 1092281=Sailors' Snug Harbor was founded by Robert Randall, Esq., of New York City, whose last will and testament - drawn by Alexander Hamilton, on June 1, 1801 - bequeathed almost his entire estate for the establishment and maintenance of a home for aged and disabled sailors. Mr. Randall's estate, a twenty acre farm, occupied the site of what now is valuable property in Manhattan. It lies between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, and Sixth and Tenth Streets., 199400=A 1955 study by the Council of State Governments reported that the majority of nursing homes had low standards of service and relatively untrained personnel. Various states began to report problems.\u00a0In response, the chronic disease program of the Public Health Service began to study state licensing programs, and found that few states had adequate numbers of survey staff and that the qualifications of survey personnel varied widely.\u00a0, 727897=This was the law until the act of July 14, 1862, which dated pensions of the first class from the discharge of the soldier when the claim should be filed within a year after discharge; otherwise from the filing of the application. The limitation was afterwards extended to three years, and later to five; and it was provided that no claim not prosecuted to a successful issue within five years after the date of filing should be allowed except upon record evidence from the War or Navy Department of the disability on which it was based., 402985=The chaplain belonging to the Sailors Snug Harbor lives with his family in a large and comfortable house situated on the premises, in the rear of the chapel, which was erected in 1855. Here services are held every Sunday during the winter, and every day, morning and night, during summer. The chapel is a plain but handsome brick building, without any cupola or belfry, but with large stained windows. The interior is plain, but scrupulously neat and taste- fully decorated; and upon two long tablets, one on each side of the altar, are inscribed the names of all the trustees and officers that have been connected with the Harbor since its first opening., 11991=Concerns about the high cost of operating the poorhouses lead to other indignities. For instance, New Jersey law included a provision forbidding emancipation of slaves who were 40 years old or more \"for fear of the distant contingency, that this freedman might become a public burthen to the township, by being a pauper in his old age, and rather than subject the towns to that they preferred to let the man and his posterity remain in slavery.\" (Library of Congress: Slaves and the Courts, 1740-1860), 349098=The building was ready and occupied in April, 1923. With many improvements, and an addition of twelve private rooms made possible in 1926 by gifts totaling $41,000, the hospital now has forty beds for women and twenty-four cribs for infants. An active maternity and surgical service is maintained., 147403=The benefit levels had risen so much that by 1948 the average OAA benefit ($38.18 per month) greatly exceeded the average Social Security benefit ($25.13 per month), providing a perverse disincentive for people to provide for their own old age by working and saving. (Advisory Council Report, 1948) Amendments were proposed for the Social Security Old Age Insurance program to increase payment levels and expand coverage to more people. In 1939, Social Security OAI was amended to pay benefits to widows, widowers, and dependent children of workers who died, primarily to start moving this population off of the welfare rolls, but the most significant changes weren't made until 1950.\u00a0\u00a0, 657495=It was, therefore, only natural that the business of the Pension Bureau should increase enormously after the close of the Civil War. In 1865, 72,684 claims were allowed, the disbursements being $8,525,123.11. There was a diminution after this, until the passage of the notorious Arrears Act, in 1879, when 141,466 claims were filed. The appropriation was insufficient, but the disbursements were $57,240,540.14. The law granting pensions has been substantially the same ever since the provisions of the Arrears Act ceased to be operative, June 30, 1880; the only changes of consequence having been made in the ratings of certain specific disabilities. The number of claims filed has, however, increased. From the last report of the Commissioner of Pensions we learn that 75,726 claims were fi1ed in the year ending June 30, 1888, as against 72,465 in 1887, and 31,116 in 1881. For the past few years the number of claims filed by survivors of the War of 1812 has been insignificant, and need not be taken into account. For the Mexican War, 7853 claims were filed in 1888, and 18,718 in 1887. This would make the number of claims filed in 1887 on account of the Civil War 53,747, and in 1888, 67,873, as against less than 30,000 filed in 1881., 177738=Another important aspect of the 1950 amendments to the Social Security Act was that federal matching funds were finally made available for the cost of providing for aged and blind persons in \"public medical institutions other than those for mental disease and tuberculosis.\" This belatedly allowed governments to develop nursing homes, long after proprietary operators had dominated the market.\u00a0\u00a0, 163652=As an example of the problem, they reported that in Connecticut in 1946 the average cost of nursing-home care for the aged was $118 a month, far more than the maximum $50 a month OAA payment.\u00a0, 438180=Not only has the course of study become more inclusive and technical, but also the instruction has become more regular and assured. Getting away from the early days in which physicians and superintendents of nurses assumed the entire responsibility of educating the young nurses, every training school today employs a registered nurse for this purpose. Some of the larger schools employ several such instructors. Many of the training schools are augmenting this teaching with that of experienced teachers outside the medical and nursing professions. In 1912, the Children's Free Hospital of Detroit enrolled their students for a course in chemistry given by the Cass Technical High School. Soon other training schools began sending their probationers to Cass for instruction in the basis sciences: Chemistry, anatomy and physiology, bacteriology, dietetics, psychology, materia medica, and dietotherapy. The plan gave the students the opportunity of receiving instruction from specialists in each of the sciences. Moreover, the instructors of nurses are given more time for following up the practical procedures in nursing technic. Making use of the public schools was next tried in Grand Rapids. Two of the hospitals, Butterworth and St. Mary's, sent their beginning students to the junior college for the basic sciences in September, 1918. The following fall, Blodgett Memorial joined them in the movement. With the rise of junior colleges throughout the state, other schools for nursing have followed this example and are sending their student nurses to the college for class work, or by having the college teachers meet the classes in the hospital. Many hospitals give their dietitians to teach dietetics and dietotherapy to the nurses. Some hospitals employ registered pharmacists to hold the classes in materia medica. Two of the hospitals founded by the Sisters of Mercy have engaged priests to teach the nurses psychology and ethics. It is interesting to note that in both cases the priests hold Ph.D. degrees in psychology. It is not to be questioned that nursing procedure and clinical instruction must be given by nurses and doctors, since they are expert in these fields. More and more our hospitals are arranging with doctors, as well as with instructor nurses, to carry on this work. The present directors of training schools are putting forth a painstaking effort to secure an expert teaching force., 97609=A staff report prepared for the committee that studied old age security in 1935 relied on a few reports done in individual states. One of the more comprehensive surveys was done in New York just prior to the 1929 stock market crash. It determined that 50% or more of the age 65+ population was dependent on relatives or friends (either living with them or getting financial assistance from them to live somewhere else), 2.5% were living in poorhouses or mental hospitals, and 1-2% were living in private homes for the aged. If those percentages were representative of the national experience, that would mean that about 175,000 people age 65 or older were living in poorhouses or mental hospitals and 70,000 were living in nonprofit or proprietary homes. Note that a significant percentage were self-sufficient because they were still working. (Estimates of Institutionalized Population), 459300=Dr. Kellogg was still a student in Bellevue when the first American training school for nurses was opened. It was in 1883, however, when he and his associate, Dr. Kate Lindsay, organized the three months' course for the instruction of nurses in connection with the sanitarium. Within the year they increased the curriculum so that a two years' training was established. The first class, with a membership of seven, was graduated in 1886., 431224=Many physicians associated with the early Michigan hospitals realized that the way to have trustworthy nursing for their patients was to provide some sort of training. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, a young physician coming into Michigan from New York City to take charge of the Battle Creek Sanitarium in 1874, found that if he was to have skillful nurses for his surgical and medical patients, he would have to train them himself. He was a student in Bellevue Hospital Medical College when the training school for nurses was established. Since he knew what might be accomplished, he began giving short courses for nurses and attendants. The course increased to six months and included technic in hydrotherapy and massage. Gradually the course was extended and a formal training school for nurses was opened in 1883. At the time Dr. Kellogg was teaching men and women how to give skilled care to his critical cases, the doctors of Harper Hospital in Detroit were feeling keenly the need for trained nurses. The result was the opening of the Farrand Training School for Nurses in 1883. The school was named in honor of Dr. David Osborne Farrand. The idea upon which this school was founded was, \"That it should be a school open to women of culture and stability, who would become pupils with a view of making nursing a life work, and it should be so well established that eventually it would furnish trained nurses not only for Harper Hospital, but for the community at large.\" In the establishment of each training school in Michigan, the purpose was evidenced by some such expression as \"in response to the community's growing need for graduate nurses.\", 336932=The new building, under the name of St. Mark's Hospital, was opened in 1890, and was devoted exclusively to hospital purposes, which meant the discontinuance of what had been at first the primary object of the association, namely, the institutional care of homeless old people., 621876=So much for the situation as regards provision for old age in the United States. Other countries, as already stated, have gone much further in developing policies to cope with this problem than we have.3 In this, as in so many fields, Germany was the pioneer. Following the successful establishment of compulsory illness and compulsory accident insurance through the acts passed in 1883 and 1854, the imperial government introduced compulsory old-age and invalidity insurance in 1889. Under this system, employers in Germany are required to insure their employees sixteen years of age and over, by paying the prescribed premiums to the local insurance offices.4 One half of these premiums is deducted from the wages of the employee; the other half is contributed by the employer. The government itself contributes 50 marks ($12.50) per annum to each annuitant, and also bears most of the expense of administering the system. The annuities are paid to any insured person who is completely disabled from earning wages, or who has attained his seventieth year, whether incapacitated from earning wages or not. The amount of annuity depends on the wage class to which the insured belongs, but is, in any event, quite small according to American standards, the highest pension being only 230 marks ($57.50) a year.5, 762208=The New England Magazine Volume 24, Issue 2, April 1898, 460439=A report of this school of nursing published in 1896 stated that for several years the course of study had included anatomy and physiology, hygiene, surgical nursing, practical nursing, hydrotherapy, and cookery for the first year students. The second year students studied massage, manual Swedish movements, cookery, and disease. The young women were given procedures in obstetrics and gynecology. A knowledge of general housework was considered important., 247629=The following graph illustrates the expansion of the country from 1790 to 1990. The population moved from the original 13 colonies to the South and Midwest, and then to the West., 79273=(See 1800-1990: Changes in White and Black Fertility Rates.), 723597=In 1871 pensions of $8 per month were granted to surviving soldiers of the war of 1812, without regard to rank, who served sixty days in that war or had been honorably mentioned in a resolution of Congress for service therein, and who had not espoused the cause of the late rebellion, and to their widows in cases where marriage occurred prior to the end of the war., 488773=The next progressive steps to be taken by the Butterworth Hospital School for Nurses were under the direction of Miss S. Belle MacCallum, a former student and associate of Miss Flaws, an alumna of the school, and its superintendent of nurses since 1925. The student nurses have been placed on an eight-hour schedule. A system of electives is offered the seniors. The nurse who wishes to enter into private duty service is permitted to go on twelve-hour special duty and so gain experien, 87877=The program was so successful that in 1911, it was expanded nation-wide. MetLife hired visiting nurses to provide the services, and, by the close of 1916, they had made visiting nurses available to over 90% of their 10.5 million industrial policyholders in 2,000 cities. The insurance funding gave the home nursing agencies a new source of income which allowed them to thrive, and from 1909 to 1924 the number of visiting nurse agencies in the country more than doubled, from 1,413 to 3,183. (VNSNY) (Indian River), 942728=All of the above information was taken from Old Age Security Staff Report, Barbara Nachtried Armstrong and Staff, 1934, from unpublished studies by the staff of the Committee on Economic Security (CES), Volume II., 337931=In 1925, the present beautiful well-equipped hospital of 270 beds was opened largely through the generous gifts and personal interest of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Lowe. Mr. Lowe was president of the Board of Trustees from 1898 to 1928, a period of thirty years. It is worthy of note that Mr. Lowe was a grandson of Mr. Butterworth., 751946=Odd Fellows were pioneers in providing for orphans and aging, indigent, and infirm citizens. The first Odd Fellows home in the country was founded at Meadville, Pennsylvania in 1872. Ohio lodges first began considering the need for an Ohio home in 1864, when the Ironten lodge formed a committee to urge the Grand Lodge of Ohio to establish a home and school for orphans in the state. Not until 1882 however, was formal action taken when a separate Odd Fellows Association was incorporated to build a \"Home for Indigent Brothers.\" After years of deliberation, the first home in Ohio was opened near Mildale, Ohio in Hamilton County in 1890. It was known as the Rossmoyne Home and served aged and infirm Odd Fellows as well as some of their wives and widows. This home was operated by the Odd Fellows and Rebekah Lodges of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, and subsequently was taken over by the Grand Lodge of Ohio later in the 1890's. It was the seventh such Odd Fellows Home to be opened in the nation., 729065=In 1887 Commissioner Black thus summarized the results of an inquiry into the pension systems of the European governments: Two bases have been recognized out of which a claim for pension might rightfully arise in the case of almost every civilized power. The first is the mere fact of service of the state in a military capacity, and the second is disablement in that service. The service to be the basis of pension must have been of a very great length, rarely less than ten, and oftener of twenty-five and thirty years. A noticeable feature in all of these pension systems is that they were manifestly prepared only for regular service troops, although no discrimination is made between the regular service troops and the war levies.... No instance can be found where pension is allowed for services dishonorably terminated or marked by a dishonorable record.... The foreign pension codes are based upon this idea of. .. . the right of the state to demand the service of every man capable of bearing arms, without regard to any other than a disability pension, and that the pension itself is a mark of extreme honor, reward of long service, or distinguished ability., 1070187=\"Mr. Barbee made good money working for the telephone company,\" Elvira says, \"and we never wanted for a thing; we lived well and had just a plenty of everything.\" But when Elvira was thirty-two, Mr. Barbee died leaving her with $1500, three children to support and another one coming. The $1500 lasted several years, then Elvira went to work in the mill. \"I wasn't raised to work in the mill, but I wasn't above doing it to support my children,\" she will tell you pertly., 715602=(Footnote: The total number of pensioners on the roll June 30,1892, was 876,604. It will doubtless exceed a million at the close of the present fiscal year.), 310862=The Woman's Hospital and Infants Home, suggesting by its name a social work that has always lain close to the heart of womankind, was established as early as 1869 by the Ladies Christian Union, a society that had organized in 1860 and had operated a Home for the Friendless, and had re-organized in 1868. First occupying rented quarters on Cass Avenue, the institution was established in its own building on Thirteenth Street in 1875; and in 1893 found a more permanent home in Ferris Avenue. At the turning into the new century 270 cases was the measure of the year's work. In 1922, 3,464 patients were cared for, 2,132 of them being mothers and babies. The imperative expansion took form in plans for a building to contain about 200 beds. The institution already enjoyed a Class A rating by the American College of Surgeons. The new plans drafted in the form of an X were determined by special concern for sunlight, retirement from street, and ease of operation. A drive for $600,000 was put on by trustees and other friends in 1923, and ground was broken shortly afterward. Some of Detroit's noblest women among the fortunately circumstanced have served as patronesses of this institution. Officers of the modern social service work have contributed much to its effective operation; especially the Women's Division of the Detroit Police., 721412=In 1828, officers who served in the Revolutionary army as provided in the resolution of 1780, and enlisted men who performed like service, were granted their full monthly pay, no officer, however, being entitled to higher pay than that of captain., 474436=It was made evident that the type of training the Hospital Committee had in mind when the school was opened could not be given in eighteen months. In 1890, the course was extended to two years. Again in 1902, the curriculum was reorganized and the period of training lengthened to three years. The school has ever faithfully studied the nursing situation, and has sympathetically accepted any change that will better the service of its nurses. In 1919, soon after the Union Benevolent Association Hospital moved to a new site and was re-named Blodgett Memorial, the first year students joined the nurses from the other hospitals, St. Mary's and Butterworth, for class work in the academic subjects in the junior college. Three years ago, instruction in elementary nursing procedures was added to that part of the nursing curriculum given at the college. Consequently, the hospital instructor of nurses has had more time to devote to advanced students, and for supervision of beginning students in their duties on the floors., 924128=\"In 1931 and 1933 the state legislatures were very active in the field of old age pensions. It is estimated that 100 bills were introduced in the legislatures of 38 states in 1931. In that year five new laws were enacted in Delaware, Idaho, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and West Virginia. Of these all except the West Virginia law were of the mandatory type, but only Delaware and New Jersey provided for state funds. Colorado and Wisconsin amended their laws making them mandatory upon the counties as well as making state funds available for the purpose of old age assistance., 1064493=After we got here, I decided I wanted to be a doctor. I studied enough to get me a little business, then started out in Mason County in 1890. I turned out to be a saddle bags doctor. You know, carry all your stuff on a hoss and go from one ranch or farm to another. I was just as regular as the old circuit riding persons except when some contagious disease broke out., 322446=The City of Detroit has large hospital institutions operating under the municipal authority. All of these are incidents of that rapid growth which the census of 1910 brought home to the consciousness of the people. The Detroit Board of Health dates back to an act of the state legislature of the session of 1895. The State Board of Health, for two decades, had been agitating for isolation hospitals, and had issued a notable statement at its meeting in 1893 as to the prevalence of communicable diseases in Detroit. Smallpox was epidemic at the time. This can scarcely have been the original urge to operating as a city pest house the small building in the woods out Hamilton Boulevard. The Detroit Board of Health is specifically charged under the city charter to suppress the spread of contagious diseases, and to provide for the care and treatment of all persons in the city having malignant or infectious diseases. The Board is now operating two notable isolation hospitals. In 1906, the city established on the site of the little old pest house a spacious hospital for contagious diseases, 865 beds; and named it after Dr. Herman Kiefer, long an outstanding physician of Detroit and member of the Board of University Regents. The other institution under the City Health Department is Springhill's Tuberculosis Sanatorium, at Northville. The Department of Public Welfare, formerly the Poor Commission, has authority under the city charter to establish and operate hospitals, infirmaries and farm colonies for the care of the sick, except persons afflicted with contagious or dangerous communicable diseases. The department has operated since 1915 the Receiving Hospital, a large institution located at St. Antoine and Macomb Streets. The report of the city physician to the Board of Poor Commissioners for the year next preceding the opening of this hospital shows a most interesting distribution of the city's poor-sick among private hospitals and remedial institutions. The total number of patients cared for at municipal expense during that year was 16,352. St. Mary's Hospital had 3,431; Grace Hospital, 1,097; Harper Hospital, 922; Providence Hospital, 493; Boulevard Sanatorium, 54; Harper Hospital, West Branch (afterwards Delray Industrial Hospital), 99; Samaritan Hospital, 63; Florence Crittenden Home, 80; Detroit Tuberculosis Sanatorium, 45; Woman's Hospital, 68. The cost of caring for the city's sick-poor by this system had mounted up to about $110,000 a year; and the change to a municipally operated hospital proved a substantial economy. The initial unit of the Receiving Hospital cost $250,000. At the expiration of five years the second unit was added, involving a much larger outlay. The hospital has beds for 560 patients and a staff of thirty-five doctors and 150 nurses. It has regular departments in medicine, general surgery, emergency work, psychiatry and orthopedic surgery; it has an out-patient department. The emergency department leads all the others combined in the numbers of patients. There is a considerable transfer from the Receiving Hospital to Eloise Infirmary. In the city budget of 1924-1925, a second enlargement was projected to cost $900,000. The architects followed the tower style that New York City has given to the country; a far cry from the little low log building in which St. Mary's Hospital started only eighty years earlier. High up are quarters for 200 nurses, below operating rooms with the most modern accessories, X-ray and bacteriological rooms, psychopathic wards, laundries and executive offices, in step with the magical growth of first class American cities., 641823=1 We have no trustworthy information in regard to the amount of old-age poverty, as distinguished from pauperism, in the United States. Statistics of pauperism clearly indicate, however, our more favorable situation. Thus, according to the Massachusetts Commission on Old Age Pensions, Annuities, and Insurance, there were in that state in 1908 8.5 paupers for every 1000 of the population as compared with 24.2 per thousand in the United Kingdom, and 31.7 paupers over 65 years of age for every 1000 of the population in that age class as compared with 173 per thousand in the United Kingdom., 783546=Mary Griffin. Age 69. Born in Scotland. Very intemperate. Has been in House of Correction 24 times for drunkenness and vagrancy. Last time in June, 1897, In and out of the almshouse 15 times in past 15 years. Extremely troublesome wherever she is., 710715=Laws granting pensions of the first class have, as a rule, antedated the service in which the pensionable disability might be incurred, and have been designed to encourage enlistments; while with a partial exception in 1780, hereafter referred to, those providing for the other classes have always followed the service on which the right to pension is predicated. Although the Supreme Court has held that the first did not constitute a contract, it is evident that so far as they offered inducements to voluntary enlistment, they are of a quasi contractual character; while pensions of the other classes are, in their legal aspect, pure gratuities., 356626=From an article in the Baltimore Sun, June 4, 1850:, 289419=Michigan, however, is unique in that it both lies on an international frontier and has a bi-peninsular shoreline. The Straits were fortified by a stockade and a blockhouse, as soon as frontier trading began, and the earliest semblance of a Michigan hospital appeared in some crude quarters for the sick men of the garrison. The log-book of Capt. Alex Harrison, of The Gage, a boat that was unloading at Detroit wharf, contains these stories: \"October 11, 1785. One hand sent to the hospital October 14. Durett came on board in place of Butler, gone to the hospital.\" A report on barrack conditions at Detroit of 1790, June 24, describes the hospital as one room entered by two doors, equipped with twenty-one single berths and having one chimney. Something more spacious and better equipped must have been provided before 1812, when cholera visited Detroit as an incident of the war with England. Cantonment surgeons handled the scourge and the mortality was almost entirely among the soldiers., 1077125=They're pretty good about it, the company is, they let a man stay on as long as possible. But they're far behind some of the others on their pensions in this country. Now I went back to Ireland on a trip with my old man in 1924. And over there, they got it fixed so that a man gets half of what he earns at the time he retires. If a man gets thirty dollars a week, his pension is fifteen. They should adjust it like that here., 206940=Costs of Kerr-Mills increased from $449 million in 1960 to $2.3 billion by 1965, and nursing home costs comprised one-third of that total. This didn't even represent the cost of providing these services all across the country, since many states didn't participate in the new program, and 62% of this spending was concentrated in only five states. These states, New York, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania, experienced a glut of nursing home bed development, as speculators swooped in to benefit from a \"guaranteed\" return.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0, 654359=As the United States was the outcome of the Revolutionary War, one of the first duties of the government was the care of the soldiers of that war. Almost as soon as there was any Congress of the United States, and some years before the adoption of the Constitution, pension claims were presented for payment. The general government was not prepared, however, to assume the whole responsibility, and, by a resolution of June 7, 1785, Congress referred to the different States the right of judging who of their citizens were entitled to be placed on the list of invalid pensioners. The States refused to take any action, and the very next Congress found itself confronted with the whole subject again. The general government has assumed the burden of adjudication and payment of pension claims ever since. The appropriations were made for individual cases until 1790, when the first general appropriation of $96,979.72 was made. There was no general pension law until 1792, when it was enacted that, if any person, whether officer or soldier, belonging to the militia of any State, and called out in the service of the United States, be wounded or disabled while in actual service, he shall be taken care of at public expense. This law is the foundation stone upon which our general pension system has been built. The yearly appropriations under it averaged about $90,800 up to 1800. It was not until 1818 that a service pension was granted to the veterans of the Revolution, and then only to those who had served for nine consecutive months, and who were, from reduced circumstances, in need of assistance from the country for support. Under this act, up to 1858, over $22,320,000 had been disbursed, and a subsequent law, removing the property qualification, cost $2,601,000., 678193=The Training Of A Nurse Scribner's magazine (Volume 8, Issue 5, November, 1890), 73883=In 1900, those hardy souls who outlived diseases and injury in childhood and early adulthood had nearly as many years ahead of them as today's seniors do, and finding a place where they could live for what might be a fairly lengthy period of time was just as important then as it is now. People who reached age 65 in 1900 could expect to live another 10-12 years. Those that reached the age of 85 could expect to live another 4-5 years. (Changes in Life Expectancy)\u00a0To underscore the fact that the elderly of this period could live a very long time, an 1898 magazine article names hundreds of people who lived to the age of 100 or older, including a man alleged to be the oldest person in the United States -- a pauper who died in a North Carolina almshouse in the summer of 1896 at the reputed age of 128 years.\u00a0(North American Review, 1898), 146211=The federal and state governments reacted in different ways to the exploding costs of the program. Some states just cut their appropriations. For example, Texas Department of Public Welfare Executive Director Adam J. Johnson sent the following letter to all program recipients in October 1939:, 430222=The Michigan hospitals were not unique; these conditions prevailed all over the country. The way out of the difficulty was met by Bellevue Hospital in New York, by establishing a training school for nurses in 1873. Sister Helen, a Roman Catholic nun, who had been associated with Florence Nightingale, was secured to open the school. Within six years from the date of the establishment of this first nursing school, nine other schools were started; most of them in the East., 1098779=If this is accurate, the increase of 900 nursing homes from 1950 to 1961 and 4,100 beds from 1961 to 1971 reported by the IOM may greatly understate the number of new facilities which were opening. Much of this information is estimated, and there is no way to be sure these numbers reference comparable facilities. Although this information is somewhat speculative, it is provided to illustrate the level of turnover that may have been occurring during this period., 595721=Mr. Low, in a paper to be found in the published proceedings of the National Conference of Charities and Correction of 1881, brings forward three instances of the sudden curtailment of public official out-door relief which were attended by no discoverable distress. In 1876, the town ship in which Indianapolis is, by a change in the trusteeship of poor relief, reduced its expense from $90,000 a year to $8000. In 1878, the city of Brooklyn ceased to give out-door relief, in which $141,207 had been expended the previous year. The sudden withdrawal of this large sum found no compensations elsewhere that could be detected. There was no increase in the population of the almshouse or hospital, no augmented demand upon the treasury of the General Relief Society of the city, no police reports of unusual mendicancy or want. On the contrary, since the cutting-or of public out-door relief, with the exception of 1879, when the inmates of the hospital and almshouse were increased by only eleven, this in-door population and the expenditures of the Society for Improving the Condition of the Poor have diminished. Like statements may he made concerning Philadelphia, where the municipal councils in 1879 declined any further appropriations for out-door relief, although they had voted $66,000 to this purpose the previous year. No new strain was put upon either the public institutions or the resources of charitable societies., 458417=When Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, a recent graduate from Bellevue Hospital Medical School in New York, took charge of the Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek in 1874, he found that he needed men and women with some scientific understanding of the care of sick to assist him in his work. From time to time, he organized the \"family of helpers\" into classes, in order to give demonstrations of technic in nursing procedure. He augmented these demonstrations with lectures on physiology and hygiene. Dr. Kellogg was so interested in spreading the gospel of healthful living that, when time permitted, he taught classes in the community the value of sufficient rest, proper foods, and wholesome exercise for the maintenance of health. Out of these classes grew three schools; the school of nursing, the school of dietetics, and the school of physical education., 306047=With the reconstruction time, the hospital entered upon another expansion commensurate with newer scientific and social ideas. Gray Pavilion, to house the operating rooms and x-ray department, was given by the children of John S. Gray in 1918. In 1926, the Harper trustees made a great appeal to the friends of hospital philanthropy, setting forth the fact that while Detroit had become, in numbers, the fourth city of the United States, it was lagging with its 4,723 hospital beds at ninth place in provisions for the sick. The appeal was for an approximate $2,500,000.00 for the erection of a 450-bed unit, for which sufficient ground was already owned, on Brush Street. The care of 650 patients at one time was declared to be the hospital's ideal, 275 beds to be devoted to surgical cases, 200 to medical, and 100 to obstetrical, and 75 to eye, ear, nose and throat patients., 457440=Other alumn\u00c3\u00a6 that have become prominent in nursing circles are Miss Alice Bowen, 1889, who established the Visiting Nurse Association of Detroit; Miss Agnes Deans, 1895, who organized the Central Directory for Nurses and who became an executive in public health work under Miss Delano; Mrs. Elsbeth Vaughn, 1904, who assisted Miss Delano during the war and is now with the American Red Cross in St. Louis, Missouri; Miss Elizabeth Parker, 1888, who held important positions in nursing work in the state, especially in the tuberculosis crusade, the State Nurses Association, and on the State Board of Registration of Nurses., 290470=Sickness and poverty are akin; and the civic conscience, under primitive conditions, has provided for the two afflictions in one institution. A very early Act of Michigan Territory for the support of the poor, February 1, 1809, when William Hull was governor, provides that the overseers of the poor in the several districts within the Territory shall relieve and support all the poor, lame, blind, and sick, and shall provide for them houses, nurses, physicians, surgeons, in such cases as they shall judge necessary. Nothing more was contemplated by this than the letting out of cases to families that were willing to take them cheap. A poor law of twenty years later date, October 29, 1829, authorizes the proper officers to contract with a \"competent physician\" by the year, and to offer the contract at public auction to the lowest bidder. Seven years before Michigan arrived at statehood in 1837, a public Act authorized the establishment of county poorhouses with a superintendent. The seeds of the county infirmary, the home for the sick that civic charity provides for the poor, are found in this legislation; they, however, were seeds of slow germination., 801746=Mr. Chandler Eastman has been superintendent since 1889. Previous to his appointment to his present position he had been connected with the institutions at Deer Island and Rainsford Island. He is a veteran of the civil war., 998790=In 1923 349 pensions were granted \" 1924 521 \" \" 1925 583 \" \" 1926 584 \" \" 1927 693 \" \" 1928 884 \" \" 1929 875 \" \" 1930 1032 \" \" 1931 1130 \" \" 1932 1254 \" \" 1933 1781 \", 627275=Any person who has completed his sixtieth year, and satisfies these requirements, may apply for an old-age pension to be paid entirely out of the public treasury. The amount of the pension depends upon the cost of living in the locality, and is determined by local officials. That it is not excessive may be inferred from the fact that in 1904 the maximum pension paid was only $54 a year (in Copenhagen), and the average was less than $40. For pensioners who have no relatives or friends with whom they may lodge, old-age homes are provided of which Miss Sellers draws quite an idyllic picture I in her interesting account of the Danish Poor Relief System. They are managed more as small inns or boarding houses than as charitable institutions, and the residents are treated as voluntary guests rather than as inmates., 925138=\"Iowa and Pennsylvania passed mandatory laws in 1934, the state sharing the entire cost., 83488=\"The [Michigan] county sanatorium law of 1925... insures high standards and adequate financial support. The standards require that a sanatorium have a minimum capacity of fifty patients, thus eliminating the old, small tuberculosis hospital that was often nothing more than a boarding-home or retreat for consumptives on county poor farms, where doors and windows were shut, and where medical treatment occasionally consisted of self-administered cough medicine. The institution must employ a full-time physician, provide modern X-ray equipment, have a graduate nurse as supervisor of the nursing staff, and must furnish patients with occupational therapy work.\" (Medical History of Michigan, 1930), 752975=Even before Rossmoyne was officially opened, Ohio Odd Fellows began to investigate erecting an orphanage in the state. At the Grand Lodge session in Toledo, Ohio, in 1889 a special committee was appointed \"for the purpose of considering the advisability of erecting a Home for deceased Odd Fellow's Children...\" this \"action by the Grand Lodge is in the nature of the excavation for the foundation upon which the Springfield Home was built.\" It was not until 1896 although, that formal action was taken toward establishing the home at Springfield, Ohio. During the Grand Lodge session in May at Lima, Ohio, $45,000 was allotted and plans drawn by Columbus architects Tost and Packard were accepted for erection of the home. In August the contract for construction was let with F.J. Evans and Son of Zanesville, Ohio at a cost of $57,187 (including alterations to the original cost and plans.) The official name was the \"Odd Fellows Home of Ohio\" and it was financed through assessments on all Ohio Lodges for construction and maintenance. By the time of its completion in May 1898, it had been decided that the home would admit aged Odd Fellows, their widows, and orphans. The Rosemoyne Home was put up for sale at this time. The grand dedication of the Odd Fellows Home at Springfield was held on October 27, 1898 following a parade through the city and march to the home then on the northern edge of the town. The site was on a hill overlooking Springfield and consisted of approximately 73 acres, most of which was used eventually for farming and activities associated with providing the home with fresh produce, dairy products and meat., 412886=Dora Costa uncovered some interesting statistics about the percentage of women who lived with family members as dependents from 1890 to today. She found that unmarried women, whether they were widowed, divorced, or never married, were far more likely to be living with family members than married women throughout this period. However, she also determined that all women, regardless of marital status, have become less likely to live with family members than they were 100 years ago, and that they have become much more likely to be living independently in their own homes as the head of household or the spouse of the head of household. Her study found that this change was strongly related to the availability of income from pensions and old-age assistance programs in the latter part of the century., 318685=By August 1, 1918, the new buildings were well under way. At that time there was an acute demand for medical men and nurses for the army. The hospital was closed for the duration of the war and the entire staff volunteered and entered the army, a number of the staff being associated in France with Evacuation Hospital No. 33., 951640=\"In 1935 I was again laid off and the money that I had made in 1934 was soon used up, then back to the relief I went. Since that time I have worked about six months in each year, and being unable to support my family when I an not working, I usually spend the rest of the year on the relief. The last place that I worked was in the Montrose as a weaver, in the Spring of 1938. I worked here for four months but I knew that it would not last forever., 919701=The restrictions were so severe and the number of states that actually had launched their plans and committed funds to them were so limited that even in 1935, in the depths of the Depression, there were less than 200,000 people covered under state old-age assistance plans., 135675=During World War II many seniors came out of retirement to help with the war effort. Their employment income probably kept many of them off the welfare rolls during the war, but they had to retire once again when the servicemen returned home and needed jobs. The war also added to the size of the disabled population who needed long term care, and created many new widows and orphans who needed financial assistance. In 1939, the Social Security Act had been expanded to include survivors and dependents benefits, and the war greatly increased the number of people covered under the system.\u00a0After the war, the Veterans Administration added new benefits for newly-disabled veterans or surviving spouses.\u00a0, 1093188=The first building was erected in 1831-32, and during the year following, fifty seamen were admitted to the Institution. Since that time, it has provided for nearly nine thousand sailors. It's present guests are ex-mariners of various ranks. Among them are a great many former masters of all type of vessels that sail the seas., 207943=In 1956, an amendment to SSA authorized federal matching for state funds devoted to providing social services, and in 1962 it was expanded to encourage the provision of social services programs for the elderly. These funds were used to provide services that would allow low-income elderly people to remain in their home. Most states used the money to provide homemaking and other domestic services to older adults still living at home., 152876=\"On the heels of President Truman's election victory, an 'Armageddon' psychology set in within the AMA. In December 1948, the AMA's House of Delegates met, in an atmosphere of crisis and voted a special assessment of $25 per member to resist 'the enslavement of the medical profession.' A prominent public relations firm was hired and a $4.5 million fund was deployed to wage a 'national education campaign' against the Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill. The campaign included publicity through the mass media, nationwide distribution of pamphlets, a vast speechmaking effort, and a drive to win and publicize specific pledges of support for the AMA's position from the press and other private organizations.\"\u00a0(Corning, 1969), 968980=May I take another two or three minutes to point out one very important consideration in the immediate sizing up of the problem confronting us? That is that at best the so-called old age pension gratuitous grants are after all a modified, camouflaged form of relief, which do not meet the conditions, and might as well be nothing, because they are based upon evidence of need. The one thing 75 investigators in our little town have to struggle with is determining, not whether the people are deserving, but whether they are in need. Of course, when you get into a situation of this kind there is bound to be the temptation to misrepresent or exaggerate. I certainly do not blame the old people. If I were dependent and had to make a sad story of my own life, I probably could succeed in making up a good one. The \"means test\" is a consideration of old age legislation., 781646=Peter Doherty. Age 78. Born in Ireland but has lived in Boston since 1842 with the exception of the period between time 1859 and 1872, when he was in California. Before 1859 he had built and owned two houses. On his return from California he was robbed of a considerable sum of money. Since 1883 he has been in the almshouse 30 times. Is intemperate occasionally., 917528=By 1928, just prior to the start of the Great Depression, only 6 states and territories had old-age assistance laws. As the Depression deepened, that number increased, until there were 28 states and 2 territories (Alaska and Hawaii) with old-age assistance programs by 1934, most just enacted in the prior year or two. Unfortunately, the plans were quite limited, and inconsistent from state to state. As summarized in the final report of the Old Age Security Staff to Chairman Witte, the state plans included the following features and restrictions:, 317574=On October 1, 1915, the first patients were admitted, a pavilion for seventy-five patients of the original plan having been completed, together with the operation rooms, laboratories and service buildings. Dr. Frank J. Sladen, formerly resident physician at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and associate in medicine in the University, had received the appointment as physician-in-chief., 446526=Years ago, when hospitals were less certain as to what should comprise a suitable training for the nurse, and the question was being debated as to what a nurse might owe the hospital for this training, the student performed heavy labors and worked long hours. It was a Michigan hospital, Harper Hospital of Detroit, that first established the eight-hour day for nurses. This standard day for women was not only accepted by other hospitals throughout our country, but also laws were passed to protect women in industry from a day too long to maintain good health. While Harper observed the eight-hour day for its students as early as 1891, some of the hospitals have only recently limited the nurse's working time to a fifty-six-hour week., 203594=Nursing homes were so entrenched in the welfare system by 1960 that the surveys mandated by the licensure requirements of the Social Security Act were done by the state welfare departments, rather than the health care departments.\u00a0, 751095=The fraternal organization known as the Independent Order of Odd Fellow was founded in England and established in America in Baltimore, Maryland in 1819. The order burgeoned in America and dedicated itself to worldwide relief efforts stemming from its governing principals: \"the strong support the weak, the well nurse the sick, the learned instruct the unlearned, and the rich help the poor.\" By 1897, there were 11, 569 lodges in the United States with over 2,197,196 men having been initiated. The women's counterpart, the Daughter's of Rebekah, number 4,808 chapters with 298,263 members at that time., 343299=In the month of April, 1928, a new million-dollar Hurley Hospital was opened for public inspection. Complete in every detail, with different color schemes carried out on every floor, the new building presents features of great interest. The Board of Health Clinics are quartered in the basement. The physicians are provided with a library, a large auditorium and amphitheatre operating rooms. The patients have advantage of the complete physiotherapy, X-ray and laboratory departments. The new Hurley Hospital takes high rank among the modern hospitals of this country., 1086871=Summary: Life in Sailor's Snug Harbor in 1938 as described by a writer in the Federal Writer's Project., 337225=In 1894, the name was changed to Butterworth Hospital in memory of the man whose generous gifts had made possible the erection of the hospital., 1058364=Living a retired life at his home, 1871 Seventh Street, where he indulges to his heart's content in his hobby of plain and fancy wood-working, is Jacob Ernst. Many years ago Mr. Ernst represented the first ward as a member of the city council. In more recent years, after he had long since retired from active business, he served for 16 years as an assessor in Columbus., 322110=One hundred and ninety-two papers have been published by the staff. A volume of collected papers was published in 1925., 423658=Library of Congress: Pioneering the Upper Midwest: Books from Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, ca. 1820-1910, 628686=Germany's and Denmark's systems were introduced by conservative leaders who were alarmed by the progress of radical thought as typified in the social democratic party. From this point of view, the adoption of old-age pensions by New Zealand and the states of Australia, which came next in chronological order, is highly suggestive. New Zealand's system, which was introduced in 1898, was the policy of the labor party itself. This system was copied within the next few years by New South Wales and Victoria, and in 1908 introduced for the whole Commonwealth of Australia through a federal law which has just come into operation., 273337=Summary: The 10 largest cities in the United States from 1800 to 2000, showing the westward migration of the country that contributed to the disbursement of families., 902695=This data comes from several sources. No accurate information really exists on the number of elderly people living in institutions for these early dates. The data on the age 65+ population in mental facilities and poorhouses in 1904 and 1910 comes from Colleen L. Johnson and Leslie A. Grant. Estimates of the institutionalized population for 1930 come from Bruce C. Vladeck. Census data is from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Current Population Reports, Special Studies, P23-190, 65+ in the United States. (U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1996)., 73433=The number of people living to old age and the number of years they spent in old age continued to increase. The average life expectancy at birth increased by 10 years from 1900 to 1930, and increased by another 15 years from 1930 to 1990. This change occurred largely because fewer people were dying in childhood, so larger percentage of the population lived to old age.\u00a0(Changes in Life Expectancy)\u00a0, 16012=Benefits for veterans' surviving spouses came later, and most were limited to spouses who were indigent. In 1780, the first benefit for surviving spouses was created for widows of officers who died in the Revolutionary War. In subsequent years, the law was changed include officers who died in service after the War, and to their children under age 16, if their mother was deceased. Eventually, when the government needed incentives to get men to fight in the War of 1812, benefits for widows and children were made available to enlisted men as well as officers., 943944=Narratives from: American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1940., 86660=The \"Visiting Nurse\" associations around the country were growing. By 1905 there were 455 visiting nurses in the country employed by 171 visiting nurse associations. By 1909 that had tripled to 1,413 nurses employed by 566 associations. The growth was fueled as the organizations started getting financial support from sources other than private charity. State and local boards of health and education began to sponsor public health nursing, which was focused on prevention and education. In 1912, the American Red Cross created a rural visiting nurse association. The response to the Red Cross program \"was so tremendous that the Red Cross could not keep up with the chapters' demands for nurses.\" (Indian River)\u00a0, 400521=In a ward on the opposite side of the hail, looking bright and cheerful, and ornamented with several bird-cages containing chirping and twirling canaries, we found old Jacob Morris (colored), who entered the Sailors Snug Harbor in the year 1848, then at the age of eighty. He was now in the 104th year of his age, and had, until very lately, been well and up every day, walking around the grounds as one of the youngest. \"But, gov'nor,\" he said, \"me getting feeble, sah; bery feeble! Me can not now leave bed, dinner, sah, bery weak in de joints, sah; and bosom pangs here--here!\" and he pressed his hands against the left side of his breast. It was evident that he could not live long., 741374=On June 30, 1891, there were 110 special examiners in the field. Not only are cases of suspected fraud referred to them, but also many cases of probable merit in which the evidence filed by the applicant does not warrant allowance, and there is reason to believe that a more explicit showing of the facts would establish their merit, the government thus practically undertaking to supply the deficiencies in the prosecution of the case by the claimant and his agents. The benefit of this procedure to worthy claimants is apparent from the fact that during the last fiscal year over two thousand claims were admitted after special investigation, most of which must have been rejected if settled upon the original ex parte evidence. And it is a fact indicative of either a high average of merit in the pension claims of the present day, or great liberality on the part of the Bureau, or both, that the proportion of specially investigated cases finally allowed during the last two years to those rejected was eight to one., 707795=Pensions: The Law and Its Administration Harper's new monthly magazine (Volume 86, Issue 512, January, 1893), 168251=Initially, the payment to medical providers was capped so that it would not exceed the amount that would have been paid to the individual, but in 1956 the Social Security Act was again amended to eliminate that cap. This was extremely important because nursing home costs were much higher than the individual OAA payment. The elimination of the cap on payments meant that the government quickly became the primary purchaser of nursing home care., 1094265=Summary: An analysis that indicates that about 7,000 nursing homes may have closed from 1948-1968, while 13,000 new homes were opened., 924726=\"Ten more laws were added in 1933, in Arizona, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii. With the exception of Hawaii, they were all mandatory upon the counties, and in Oregon and Washington the state does not share in the expenses of the locality. Arkansas passed a law in 1933, but it was declared unconstitutional by the state supreme court., 987859=In view of the fact that it was my good fortune to be legislative author of the first old age pension bill passed in the United States, introduced during the time I was a Democrat floor leader of the Montana Legislature in 1923, I may perhaps be permitted unusual contentment and satisfaction at this notable gathering and be allowed to tell you of the operation of years of old age pensions., 782697=Sarah Gallagher. Age 62. Is by occupation a domestic, intemperate. Has been, under an assumed name, at Deer Island 20 or more times. In and out of the almshouse 36 times since 1883., 462779=The year 1888 was noted not only for the beginning of this five-year course, but it also marked the introduction of scientific cooking into the training course. Mrs. C. E. Kellogg, a scientifically trained women, converted her kitchen into a nutrition laboratory, and after thorough experimentation, she brought her findings to the cookery classes for the nurses., 242986=By 1968, ECF costs were up to $500 million, and HEW decided drastic action was required to scale the program back. They distributed \"Intermediary Letter 371,\" which listed a number of \"required\" services which had never before been required and warned the insurance companies that administered the program (the intermediaries) that they should err on the side of denying, rather than approving, Medicare claims. Since Medicare claims are not reviewed until some time after the services have been delivered, thousands of elderly people and their families suddenly found out that Medicare was not going to pay for services they had already received, and which they had believed Medicare would pay. Nursing homes had to issue bills to the families asking for payment long after the fact, and thousands of residents and families had to scramble to find the money to pay for it. Estates of deceased residents had liens or garnishments placed on them, and some residents were discharged for nonpayment. Many never did pay, and the nursing homes ended up with uncollectible accounts that had to be written off. To illustrate the drastic change that took place, Medicare denial rates shot up more than 600% between early 1968 and early 1970., 716472=No provision was made for cases where the soldier died of disease until 1848, when a five-years half-pay pension was granted to widows and minor children of officers and enlisted men who died, of either wounds or disease, during service in the Mexican war. By later statutes there were included cases where the soldiers died at any time after discharge by reason of disabilities incurred in the war, and the pensions were continued for a term of five years., 184764=In 1956, amendments to the Social Security Act created a new, and separate, matching program for medical services like nursing home services, a program which would prove to be far more expensive than first anticipated.\u00a0In 1958, Federal grants to the states for public assistance were further liberalized. Up to that time, all grants were split 50/50 with the state paying half and the federal government paying half. In 1958, the amount the government provided was based on the per capita income in the state, so that the federal government paid more than half of the cost of OAA in the poor states, and continued to pay half of the cost in richer states., 407106=Summary: Research by Dora Costa shows that older women were more likely than men to be unmarried even back in 1880, but the percentage living with their children has declined significantly since then., 1025220=The Social Security Act of 1935, 339969=The Sisters of the Order of Mercy established their hospital at Grand Rapids in August, 1893, when Sister Mary Ignatius, accompanied by two or three others, arrived from Big Rapids. Their original property, donated by Mrs. Mary McNamara, was a dwelling house known as 145 South Lafayette Street. To this was attached a small house brought from the corner of Sheldon and Maple Streets. In 1898 and 1900, additions were made, at a cost of $10,000. The hospital association was incorporated March 23, 1901. The enlargement that greeted the new century was but a beginning. The old Coffinberry home adjoining the hospital on the south, was acquired by it in 1903; the Smiley residence at the southwest corner of Cherry and Lafayette Streets, in 1905. This became the site of a new building that was dedicated June 26, 1911, and received patients a month later. The Amberg property directly west was also acquired, and converted into a nurse's home., 336177=In June, 1876, the institution was incorporated under the name St. Mark's Home and Hospital., 529627=Coming East, one finds a degree of improvement. Yet even Massachusetts cannot show a blameless record. A few hundred crazy people are still kept in her town and city almshouses, and these do not always receive the best of care. Tewksbury almshouse is not without reproach, as the investigation of 1876 showed; and, although improved since then, it has the faults inseparable from large institutions. In comparison with most almshouses it shines like the just. This is the testimony of a man intimately acquainted with Pennsylvania almshouses. \"There are some persons,\" he says, \"foolish enough to assert that the insane are just as comfortable and well cared for in an almshouse as in a hospital. Experience proves just the reverse. . . . In some of the very best of institutions there is a lamentable display of ignorance in connection with the management of the insane. . . Patients are seen confined in narrow corridors, or perhaps exercising in a small yard bounded by high walls. You are struck with the hopeless look which their faces wear. Every now and again you note some poor maniacs face, and wonder how he or she could have inflicted such a variety of .cuts and bruises. . . . Patients under restraint are noted everywhere. Upon inquiring, you are told that the bruises, etc., are the result of falls, the patient being subject to fits, and that the restraints are necessary in order to keep the unfortunates from destroying their clothing, injuring themselves or others. All this may be true; but how is it that the same things are conspicuous by their absence in hospitals properly arranged?\" He speaks of their meagre diet and scant clothing, of the slender attendance, of the gloomy surroundings, but most of all complains of the almost total absence of employment. The picture is of another sort than those drawn in the Western reports, yet it is hardly less dreary. The Western lunatic is unkempt and neglected, sometimes he is harshly used, but unless he is violent he has the free air and sunshine one half the year; he has, too, the chance of resting his wandering wits by tiring his muscles. Covert for open abuse, Utica cribs, muffs and strait-jackets for chains, after all, these are not such great gains. Order and cleanliness are great gains, yet they are dearly bought when the patient pays for them with air and sunshine and work. Neither are chains and filthy dungeons quite gone out of fashion in Pennsylvania. Many almshouses still employ them., 294496=\"Following the cholera, the city was burdened with many invalids, widows and orphans, and the poorhouse utilized to its capacity. In the lack of other provisions for their care, Bishop Res\u00c3\u00a9 placed the Sisters of St. Clare in charge of the inmates. Most of the inmates were brought to the institution by Fr. Kundig, who took pains to search out the needy, and, having assumed so many of the duties, he was appointed supervisor of the poor in the fall of 1934. The county allowed him 16 cents a day for the care of the inmates; but the actual cost was about double that amount, for provisions were hard to get, and labor was scarce, owing to the departure of many people from the city. There were more than 100 inmates of the poorhouse, and sixty of those were invalids., 632023=The pension system that has attracted most attention, and that for obvious reasons is most interesting to us in the United States, is that introduced into the United Kingdom by the act passed August 1, 1908, and which came into operation January 1 of last year. This act follows the laws of Denmark, New Zealand, and Australia in limiting rigidly the persons who are entitled to this form of public assistance. To receive a pension in the United Kingdom, a person must have attained the age of seventy, must have been a resident in the country during the twenty years preceding the application for the pension, must satisfy the pension authorities that his yearly income from other sources does not exceed \u00c2\u00a331 10s. ($157.50), that he has not failed to work according to his ability, opportunity, and need, for the maintenance of himself and family, and that he has not within ten years been convicted of any offense for which the punishment is imprisonment without the option of a fine. The amount of the pension for persons whose income from other sources does not exceed \u00c2\u00a321 ($105), is 5s. or $1.25 a week;. From this maximum the pension declines with the amount of the income from other sources. Persons whose outside income exceeds \u00c2\u00a331 10s. a year may not claim a pension. Under this law, some 667,000 persons qualified for pensions during the first year, and the resulting expenditure amounted in round figures to $40,000,000. These 667,000 persons constitute somewhat more than one half of the population of the United Kingdom seventy years of age and over., 456639=Miss Matilda Krueger, of the class of 1907, followed Mrs. Gretter as principal of the training school. Miss Krueger was called from this post to take a very important place in the nursing service of the American Red Cross in Serbia. She died while serving her country., 200598=In 1959, a special Senate Subcommittee on \"Problems of the Aged and Aging\" was established. The subcommittee reported that few nursing homes were of high quality, and that most facilities were substandard, had poorly trained or untrained staff, and provided few services. But they concluded, \"because of the shortage of nursing home beds, many states have not fully enforced the existing regulations, failure to do so reflecting the policy of the states to give ample time to the nursing home owners and operators to bring the facilities up to the standards.\", 386207=In May of the following year (1831) the trustees purchased their present site upon Staten Island, consisting of a farm containing 130 acres of land, for the sum (Of $10,000. Subsequently they purchased 21 acres more, with a water-privilege, which had been originally a part of this farm, but had been sold, and was used for manufacturing purposes, the price paid for this part of the property being $6000. These two parcels of land now constitute the farm and grounds of the Sail ors Snug Harbor At a still later period the trustees added to the farm, by lease, 36 acres of excellent woodland. In October, 1831, was laid the corner-stone of the main building, which, over a marble foundation, was built of brick, two stories high, with a portico supported by eight Doric pillars in Vermont marble. A broad flight of marble steps leads to the main entrance, and the centre of the roof supports a low cupola of an oval shape. This building, embracing all of what was then the Sailors Snug Harbor, was completed in 1833, and formally opened on the 1st of August of that year with great festivities, furnishing a home for thirty aged and worn-out sailors, Subsequently two wings were added to the main building, and connected with this by two covered corridors of one story each. These wings are built of the same material, and are of the same height as the main building, and are wholly occupied by sleeping apartments. The centre or main building has a frontage of 65 feet, with a depth of 100 feet; each of the two wings is 51 feet by 100; and the connecting corridors are each 39 feet 6 inches in length. Later yet the rear building was erected, of dimensions nearly similar to those of the main building, but three stories in height, the two upper stories being partitioned off into lodging and sleeping rooms., 120705=\"Most of the early state old-age assistance program were administered apart from other public aid in accordance with the intent of the legislation. The leaders in these programs were trail-makers in pointing up the special needs of older people...It was not until the 1937 session [of the American Association of Social Security] at Indianapolis that the National Conference of Social Work devoted separate program time to the subject of aging and even then somewhat reluctantly. A special subcommittee was allowed to schedule two meetings but the hours allotted were the least desirable--two to four on Friday afternoon and eleven to one on Saturday morning, by which time most delegates would ordinarily be on the way home. Much to everyone's astonishment, both meetings brought out a full house.\" (Robert T. Lansdale,1960), 714310=Since 1864 a great number of laws have been enacted affecting rates of pension, all in the direction of increased liberality; and many additions have been made to the specific class. The lowest strictly specific rate now allowed is $30 per mouth for total deafness, or loss of a hand or foot; and the highest is $100, for loss of both hands. By Pension Office usage the total rates prescribed in 1862 are given for anchylosis of the wrist and equivalent disabilities. There is obvious difficulty in comparing a gunshot wound in the head, or a case of heart-disease, or partial loss of sight, with a stiff wrist, yet this is precisely the sort of problem presented in the rating of the great majority of disabilities. For non-specific disabilities greater than total, there are allowed rates varying from $10 to $24., 1031445=SHORT TITLE - The Social Security Act (Act of August 14, 1935) [H. R. 7260], 63437=At the end of the century, employers began to take a role in providing assistance for their employees. In 1875, American Express developed the first private employer-sponsored pension program. It wasn't available to all retirees, but was limited to those age 60 and over who were incapacitated and unable to work. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad inaugurated a pension in 1884 and its example was quickly followed by\u00a0 other railroads. The railroad pensions required no contribution from the employee, but were designed to tie the employee to the employer for life by limiting benefits to employees with very long tenure, as long as 30 years.\u00a0Other employers created innovative programs, some even provided housing for employees or retirees., 333390=The latest and furthest step of Union Benevolent Association Hospital into the great things of medical science has been taken in its transformation into Blodgett Memorial Hospital, wrought by John W. Blodgett in memory of his mother, Jane Wood Blodgett. In November, 1914, the public was informed that Mr. Blodgett would tender a large gift to the trustees of the Union Benevolent Association. An architect from the New York firm of York & Sawyer had already been consulted. A plot of twenty-five acres situated between Wealthy and Sherman Streets, east of Plymouth Road and overlooking Fisk Lake, was purchased for a site. Ground was broken May 18, 1914, Mr. Blodgett turning the sod. A splendid hospital structure in Florentine style was erected without delay. On March 31, 1916, formal dedicatory exercises were held. The hospital, representing nearly fifty years of development of physical properties and institutional organization, is well adapted to the purposes and needs of the community. It has 150 beds and all the accessories that such a hospital should gave, and is at present one of the three general hospitals in Grand Rapids. Three persons intimately associated with its growth should be mentioned. Mrs. Marion L. Withey for many years devoted much of her time and effort to the institution. The training school bears her name. Miss Ida M. Barrett, a superintendent, devoted a large part of her life to the hospital and was largely responsible for the upgrowth of the service upon which the present hospital is founded. Miss Mary A. Welch, at present superintendent of the training school, has been identified with the hospital for more than a quarter of a century, and as an administrator has few equals. To her should be credited chiefly the fine spirit and ideals of nursing which are an outstanding feature of the institution., 80061=For the first time, older people faced the prospect of being unemployed, a word which wasn't even in the dictionary before 1888. (Social Security, 1937) If older people couldn't work, they had to depend on their families even more. In this new society, unemployed and unemployable older men and women could become a significant financial burden on their families., 647048=Since its construction in 1888, the Berkshire Home for Aged Women has provided a retirement home for elderly, retired, and widowed women. The original money to construct this handsome Richardsonian Romanesque building came from an $18,000 bequest from Pittsfield's Crane family to be used as a home for \"the elderly ladies of Berkshire County.\" Over the years, this building has reflected the changes in attitudes and ideas regarding care of the elderly. In 1891, the home only had two requirements--that applicants pay an entrance fee of $300, and that they own a black silk dress. For many years, the citizens of Berkshire County and Pittsfield contributed generously to the upkeep and support of the home--gifts of fruits, vegetables, and even one $50,000 donation made the Berkshire Home for Aged Women one of Western Massachusetts' finest retirement homes. In the 1930s, the home enjoyed the patronage of a wealthy local woman--Catherine Cary--who eventually donated well over $500,000 dollars to the home. The rising costs of home care depleted the Berkshire Home's resources, however, and by the 1950s, the home's chief problem revolved around finances. With a capacity of only 29 women, the home's waiting list rose to 9 years. In the 1960s, the Federal government's Social Security program allowed the elderly to stay in their own homes longer, but depleted the number of women applying and staying at Berkshire Place. The Berkshire Home for Aged Women continued to struggle financially in the 1970s and early 1980s, and in 1989, when a report indicated that most retirees had no desire to live in a gender-segregated environment, the Berkshire Home for Aged Women began to accept male applicants, 101 years after its establishment., 766359=In 1887, a large brick building, the present \"institution\", having been erected, the female paupers were brought here from Austin Farm, whither they had been removed from Deer Island ten years before. But these were not destined to remain here a great while at this time. Within two years of their arrival they were transferred to Rainsford Island, where the male paupers had stayed their wanderings since leaving Deer Island in 1872, to take the places of the male paupers who in turn took their places at Long Island. The reason for this change was that on Long Island the men could be set to work, while on Rainsford they had little or nothing to do. When the hospital on Long Island was ready for occupancy, in 1893, however, the inmates of the Rainsford Island hospital were removed to it; and on the completion of the women's building, two years later, all the women were brought back., 381860=Captain Robert Richard Randall, of the city of New York, by his last will and testament, dated June 1, 1801, after leaving certain specific legacies, bequeathed all the residue of his estate, real and personal, to the Chancellor of the State, the Mayor and Recorder of the city of New York, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, the president and vice-president of the Marine Society, the senior minister of the Episcopal Church, and the senior minister of the Presbyterian Church, in said city, and their successors in office respectively, to be received by them in trust, and applied to the erection of an asylum or marine hospital, to be called The Sailors Snug Harbor, for the maintenance and support of decrepit, aged, and worn-out sailors., 346900=On October 24 and 25, 1928, at the new Merliss Brown Auditorium at Hurley Hospital, at Flint, was held a medical and surgical conference and clinic. Attendance each day was about one hundred. The subjects discussed were all very well received and appreciated by those in attendance. All felt that the bringing of these conferences is a big step forward in post-graduate work and as they are more appreciated by the medical profession, the attendance will increase. Men could spend much time and at greater expense visiting clinics hundreds of miles away and not received and valuable information given by these papers., 487674=In 1917, the conditions of war were making such a drain on the trained nurse supply that the problem arose as to how the sick were to be cared for in the home hospital and student nurses continue their training at the same time. Grand Rapids, under the influence of the public health supervising nurses and the superintendents of the hospitals, agitated the sending of the probationers from the three local hospitals to the Grand Rapids Junior College for instruction in the basic sciences. Such a departure in nursing education was not without precedence since the Central School of Nursing was already established in the Kansas City Junior College and Vassar was offering a nursing curriculum. Miss Elizabeth Seldon, the superintendent of Butterworth, was deeply interested in the project and evolved a practical working plan for its operation. The difficulties were overcome and matters went forward. Since 1918, Butterworth has sent it first year nurses to junior college. Miss Grace F. Ellis was appointed by the Board of Education to be the director of this Central of Nursing., 997486=The first nine months of the year 1923, the first year of the law's existence, disclosed that pensioners received $65.24 per year per person, only $5.43 per month per person., 348859=In 1912, five acres of land on Lapeer Street were purchased from Mr. and Mrs. D. P. Smith. A campaign to raise money to pay for the property and to remodel the house into a small hospital procured $76,000 by December, 1912., 736354=In 1872 Commissioner J. H. Baker said, in his annual report: . So long as pensions are to be granted upon evidence which (except record evidence) is purely ex parte, so long frauds will continue to exist.... In our system the record of the soldier is too meagre at best, and during the late war the hospital records were illy kept, very frequently, as the experience of the office daily shows, so indefinite as to be utterly worthless in determining the origin and character of the alleged pensionable disability; hence the law authorizes a resort to parol evidence.... in which the government has not exercised the right of cross-examination, and upon which a decision could not be had in any court of justice. General Baker suggested that a special pension court should be established in each congressional district, in which there should be opportunity for open cross-examination of witnesses., 921760=\"By 1925 the movement had gained considerable impetus. Although only Wisconsin passed a law which has remained effective since that time; there was much activity in a number of the states. California passed a law, which, however, was vetoed by the Governor. Bills were introduced in the legislative sessions of Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Ohio, and Texas. In Indiana and Illinois the bills passed the lower house, but were not acted upon by the upper chamber. In four states, Colorado, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Utah, commissions were appointed., 182366=Several amendments to the Social Security Act were made in the 1950's, creating millions of additional people who would have a reliable source of income in their old age. In 1950, domestic workers; farm workers; non-farm, non-professional self-employed persons; and federal civilian employees not in the federal retirement system were brought into Social Security. In 1951, railroad workers with less than 10 years of service were added. In 1954, homeworkers and all self-employed persons except lawyers and medical professionals became eligible. In 1956, members of the military and all remaining self-employed persons except doctors joined., 331740=In 1873, January 18, the Benevolent Association reincorporated, with Union Benevolent Association for its official name. The Orphan Asylum had been closed in 1871, largely because state institutions for children at Coldwater were expected to take over a good share of its work. Its purpose now was to provide a home for infirm, aged, homeless persons, to care for and relieve temporarily any necessitous persons, and to erect and manage a general hospital for those suffering from disease or injuries. This two-fold work went on for twelve years at the old Gage place, on the west side of Bostwick Street, just south of Lyon. The first of two notable transformations was realized in the removal on February 23, 1886, to a new building at the southwest corner of College and Lyon Streets. The site was the gift of the Sarel Wood estate. The sale of the former property was a substantial contribution to the cash of the new one, $31,707.31; a final debt of $3,000 was cancelled by Hon. Thomas D. Gilbert. Local merchants contributed to the furnishing. Union Benevolent Association Hospital now developed along strictly professional lines. In 1890, the first medical staff was appointed, Dr. Charles Shepard being chief. When the third incorporation occurred, the articles taken in 1873 being limited to thirty years, the provisions for general philanthropy disappeared from the charter. The care of the aged had already been discontinued because other societies were competent to take it over. There are two noted names, Mrs. Wealthy M. Morrison and Mrs. Marion L. Withy, that appear in the charters of 1857, 1873 and 1903 respectively., 809116=The North American Review. Volume 166, Issue 497, April 1898., 328463=The settlement of Grand Rapids, on the west side of the state, dates from 1837; the municipal incorporation from 1850. Here it was Protestant philanthropy that developed the earliest hospital foundations. The details are of liveliest interest to lovers of local chronicles, and to those that despise not the day of small things. For the purpose of devising ways to care for the poor and sick independently of the town poor masters, a meeting was held in the fall of 1847, at Prospect Hills schoolhouse, on the site of the Ledyard Block. Thus began a Benevolent Association under the presidency of Mrs. Francis F. Cumming, wife of the rector of St. Mark's Church, which operated a house-to-house relief work through district visitors. On January 16, 1857, a charter was taken out under the name Grand Rapids Orphan Asylum, by a group bearing a close personal identity with the unincorporated workers of the ten years preceding. A double function was herein authorized, namely, to provide for orphans and destitute children, and to extend relief to sick and indigent persons. In less than five years a more stirring function than either had interrupted the ordinary activities of the society. The benevolent and patriotic citizens of Grand Rapids devoted their energies to the Civil War encampments in their midst., 436986=Class work in the early training schools did not occupy the important place it does today. Staff doctors did much in the instruction of student nurses. Naturally it was done in a rather haphazard way, for it was difficult for the physician to fit the work of instruction into his daily routine and classes were held with too little regularity. The superintendent of nurses was, of course, held responsible for the instruction of the pupil nurses and she helped them in nursing procedures. She, also, with many other duties to fulfill, was likely to find her day too full for formal class periods. One school records that for the first three years of its existence it averaged eight lectures a month to student nurses. A report of the superintendent of another pioneer hospital states that no lectures had been given to the nurses that year. She hastens to say that the fault did not lie entirely with the doctors. The work was too heavy for the number of workers, and the nurses had no time to attend classes. But the elaborate course of study outlined by the National League of Nursing Education in 1927 shows how far nursing education has advanced since its inception in 1880., 202258=In 1959, Congress attempted to fill many gaps in health care coverage by amending the Old Age Assistance (\"OAA\") program. The amendment sought to increase medical assistance for welfare recipients through federal and state matching funds. In addition, Congress added a proposal to create the Medical Assistance for the Aged (\"MAA\") program which would make health care available to people age sixty-five and older with low or moderate incomes. The MAA program also required state matching funds. By 1960, both proposals became law., 915917=Data Sources: National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 50, No.6.

Besides performing domestic duties of every sort, they work in the laundry and sewing rooms, and the men in the carpentry shop, about the grounds and on the farm. None of them are paid for their services, who are not required in or about the An idea of the work accomplished by them along certain lines will be conveyed by a few figures. In the sewing rooms, in 1897,the repairing for the entire institution was done and the following articles, among others, manufactured: Aprons, 1,412, bedticks, 105; dresses, 891; night 492; night caps, 362; petticoats, 993; pillow-slips, 850; shoulder shawls, 378; sheets, 1,227; towels, 729; and shrouds, 43., 296054=The earliest hospital in the city of Detroit to have a continuous existence is St. Mary's, dating from June 9, 1845. It is the earliest in the state of any operating under private management. Four Sisters of Charity, an order founded by St. Vincent de Paul, began this work in an old log building at the southwest corner of Larned and Randolph Streets, which the Sisters of St. Clare had used for a schoolhouse in the previous decade. St. Vincent's Hospital was the original name. Dr. Vlemcke superintended the medical and surgical work during the opening years. Sisters were the nurses, and operating expenses were met by popular subscription. The hospital made early provision for contagions cases, and cared for cholera victims in 1849. November 6, 1850, marked the first new era in its history when the hospital occupied a new building on Clinton Street near St. Antonie, which had been erected by popular subscription at a cost of ten thousand dollars. The lot, having a frontage of 87 feet and running through to Mullet Street, was the gift of Mrs. Antoine Beaubien, at whose request the institution changed its name to St. Mary's Hospital. It had accommodations for 150 patients and was a large establishment for its time. A hospital register, now in the Burton Historical Collection, show that the institution was receiving county patient in very considerable numbers over the period 1855 to 1873. A more faded order and account book shows that St. Mary's was serving from December, 1864, to April, 1865, as a United State General Hospital, W. H. Goimger, A. A. Surgeon, U. S. A. in charge. A second material advance is marked by the date November 21, 1879, when an additional building was occupied that had been erected at a cost on $50,000 on ground worth $15,000. This accommodated 130 inmates and the older building was reserved mainly for out-patient purposes. A free dispensary was by this time an important feature. While patients were received mainly on order from the director of the poor, others could secure board and attendance by the week at prices not greatly differing from present time hospital rates. In its present form St. Mary's Hospital has 330 beds, besides operating an out-patient department., 821294=Hester Jackson, colored, was an inmate of St. Michaels Hospital, Newark, April 16, 1897, which she said was her 104th birthday. She was born a slave at Rahway, N. J., and distinctly remembered that her master, Elston Marsh, was an officer in the war of 1812, and also that she had seen Washington. Jane Brown, also colored, was an inmate of the Home for Aged Colored People in Brooklyn in the summer of 1896, when she celebrated her 103d birthday. She was born a slave in New Jersey, spent much of her life in Philadelphia, and saw Washington. Mrs. Angelique Galipean, a neighbor of the centenarian Darwin's, is said to be 102. She sews without glasses, and walks a mile to church. Her father is said to have lived 110 years. John McKenzie died at Jersey City in December, 1896, at the age of 102. He was called the best-natured man in the world, and it was to his amiability that his long living was due in the opinion of his friends. Mrs. Martha Squires, of Nelsonville, a small settlement near Peekskill, New York, celebrated her 102d birthday October 11, 1896. She has lived there for seventy years, and her neighbors are confident she is as old as she claims to be. Her oldest child is now 85. Mrs. Clarissa Stebbins Lawrence, of Marlboro, near Keene, New Hampshire, was 100 on January 25, 1896. Mrs. Lydia Turner, of West Concord, New Hampshire, was 101 December 8, 1896. She is in good health, and has all her faculties. Mrs. Hannah Bartow was 101 May 1, 1896. She lives at New Brunswick, New Jersey, and is the great-grandmother of a child which weighed less than five pounds at nine months of age. This old lady does not wear glasses and keeps a small candy store. Mrs. Cox, of Holderness, New Hampshire, died of whooping cough in 1896 at the age of 101. Elisha Boulden Glenn, of Newark, N. J., was 100 years and 4 months old November 7, 1896. He walked to the polls the same week. Emanuel Schwab, of East Fifty-sixth street, New York, received each guest at the door on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of his birth, December 14, 1896. He sang a song and read a poem which he had composed the same week. He walks two miles every morning and smokes a long German pipe. John Lockhart, aged 100, walked into Parkersburg, Pa., in October, 1896, from his home on Lee Creek, fifteen miles away. While in town he danced a jig., 945144=\"That night we were very happy and proud of what we had accomplished in the two years since our marriage. Our friends gathered at our home and we held a party. It was a gay party. Some of the time was spent in singing old songs and telling stories, then all gathered around and started telling of the hardships that each of us went through in our childhood -- how we had to wear our older brother's cast-off clothing that was go faded and patched that you could not tell what the original color was; how each of us longed for Sunday, as that was the only day on which we had meat for dinner. The life that we had lived as children was, in 1924, laughable, for all of us knew that conditions could never be like that again. How could we foresee the future? Everyone at the party was well clothed, well nourished, happy, willing to work for what they desired and were working at good pay. Each one was planning to possess more of the necessities and the luxuries of life. One wanted an electric refrigerator, another a new car, some were saving so that they might purchase a home or a business., 393482=Here we also found, engaged in basket-making like the rest, a veteran from the war of 1812, named Daniel Collins, who had been twice captured in American merchantmen by the English cruisers. Nearly opposite him, with a large mat upon his knees, with which he was busily engaged, sat Cornelius Rose, an old white-haired and white-bearded sailor, who joined the American navy in 1812, belonged to the schooner Enterprise when she was captured by the English brig Boxer, and was one of the crew of time frigate President when, under the command of Decatur, that gallant ship fought three English frigates. He belonged to the old Constitution for nine years, and took an active part in the Mexican and Florida wars. His records and papers show that he has participated in no less than twenty-seven conflicts., 468240=One of the first industrial nurses in the country came from this school. In In 1904, Miss Jennie Williams was employed by the National Cash Register Company in Dayton, Ohio, to do first aid among the employees., 721676=By the act of June 7, 1832, equal benefits were extended to those who had served two years in the Revolution; and one who served a term or terms in the whole less than the above period, but not less than six months, was authorized to receive out of any unappropriated money in the treasury, during his natural life, each according to his term of service an amount bearing such proportion to the annuity granted to the same rank for the service of two years, as his term of service did to the term aforesaid. This latter provision is interesting as embodying the principle contended for by the advocates of the cent-a-day bill which was introduced in the Fifty-first Congress., 652706=The majority of the cottages were built in 1889 on 12 acres with shaded and stone-paved roadways, named after various English sites and historical figures. The remaining buildings were all added by the 1930s. Today the complex is owned by the Housing Authority of Charleston, and the restored cottages are home to persons of low to moderate income., 18821=In the early 1800's, much of the travel to the west was on trails like the \"Cumberland Road,\" later called the \"National Road,\" which funneled early pioneers into the midwest. In the early- to mid-1800's, pioneers began to travel farther west on the Oregon Trail, the Santa Fe Trail, and other major wagon train routes. By the middle of the century, the railroads were beginning to make travel easier, and in 1869 the transcontinental railroad was completed, making it possible to ride coast to coast in comparative comfort on a train.\u00a0, 336285=About 1887, Mr. Richard Edward Emerson Butterworth, who for many years had been identified with the business interests of Grand Rapids, offered to the city the sum of $10,000 towards a hospital building, but the offer was not accepted by the city. The diversion of Mr. Butterworth's interest towards St. Mark's Home and Hospital is attributed to the effective intercession of Mrs. E. P. Fuller., 1098010=In its 1986 report on For-Profit Enterprise in Health Care, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimated that there were about 9,000 nursing homes in the country in 1950, and 9,900 in 1961., 490706=PAUPERISM with us is not the grim menace which it is in Europe. True, the vagabond pauper otherwise the tramp has given us a vast deal of trouble; but lie is as much outlaw as pauper, and, such as he is, he is a distinctly novel figure in American life. The normal, quiet, legally supported pauper has never taken enough money from us to startle us out of our apathy. This is peculiarly the case with the pauper whom the State supports entirely, the indoor pauper, as the reports style him. Commonly, his misfortunes or his vices are stowed away in a remote farm-house on a muddy road. Politicians do not concern themselves with his fate, for he has no vote; benevolent people have their hands full helping the poor who are not yet sunk into paupers; the very newspapers seek him out only when his woeful lot has acquired the lurid attraction of a horror. Yet this neglected and repulsive being has claims upon our attention, because upon our fears. Pauperism has increased rapidly within the last decade. Few people realize how much money is spent annually for the support of our almshouses, to say nothing of what we spend upon our other paupers, partially supported outside, or wholly supported in hospitals, insane asylums, and asylums for orphan children. The State of New York spent, during the year ending November 30, 1879, the sum of $1,618,867.63 for the keeping of 57,925 persons in almshouses and poorhouses. These same almshouses and poorhouses gave temporary aid to 79,852 persons, at an expense of $692,465.77. Pennsylvania last year supported 20,310 persons in her almshouses, at a net cost of $1,515,290. Massachusetts paid $1,776,778 for pauper support and relief. The whole number entirely supported was 13,989, and the number of the partially supported was 72,881. Ohio, which is not especially afflicted with pauperism, pays more than half the money obtained by the state taxation for the welfare of her criminals and paupers; and the estimate does not include the public charities of her cities, or any township aid. She has an almshouse population of 13,599 during the year. The Michigan paupers, in 1878 (when the last biennial report was published), showed a rate of increase four times greater than the percentage of increase in the population. Such statistics could be multiplied indefinitely. It should be stated, however, that there has been a great lessening in the number of out-door paupers aided, since the business of the country has improved; the number of almshouse inmates remaining about the same. Undoubtedly, many of the indoor paupers came to the almshouses during the hard times, but the better times fail to draw them away. Indeed, once a pauper, always a pauper, has become an almshouse axiom. The pauper being thus expensive and pertinacious, we must needs be interested in our manner of dealing with him, however unpleasant he himself may be. In this article I shall try to describe, as fully as my space will permit, the Indoor Pauper, what he is, and how we treat him. I shall not discuss here any question of the necessity of poor-laws; whatever their defects, however tragical their unforeseen results, the argument in their favor has been reinforced by the kindly sentiment of generations, until now the popular heart makes the legal care of the poor a part of our Christianity, and assaults upon such care excite overwhelming opposition. Yet, granting the necessity of poor-laws, their warmest friend will admit that they may be so framed and so administered as to do grievous wrong. To tempt the poor into pauperism is a bad business; but it is the business of every State which is unwisely lavish with its poor-fund. To brutalize men, and ruin women, and corrupt children, are acts usually called by harsh names; but they are the acts of every State which gives over the management of its almshouses to ignorant officials To load with chains helpless creatures, proven guilty of no crime; to beat them, starve them, shut them up in underground dungeons, cold and damp, with mouldy straw for furniture and rats for company, and there leave them for months and years untended, save for the daily pushing of their coarse food through a hole in the door, this conduct, when we read of it in the history of the Inquisition or the Bastile, we say is wicked cruelty; but it is cruelty which has been practiced by every State that has abandoned its insane paupers to almshouse tending., 129515=The prohibition on care in public institutions did have an effect on the use of poorhouses -- many of the poorhouses and poor farms saw their population dwindle sharply after 1935. Following a pattern that was repeated throughout the country, 15 Minnesota poor farms closed between 1935 and 1950. (Ramsey County Nursing Home), 314499=The year 1909 marked the beginning of a movement to establish a new hospital in rapidly growing Detroit. The Detroit General Hospital Association was organized to plan and build the Detroit General Hospital. With Mr. Henry Ford as chairman, the Finance Committee obtained subscriptions and purchased twenty acres of land bounded by West Grand Boulevard, Hamilton, Byron and Bethune Avenues. Plans of a pavilion type of hospital, drawn up after committees had studied hospitals in Europe and America, were accepted and the work of building began., 546853=The Pauper Question by D. 0. Kellogg The Atlantic Monthly. (Volume 51, Issue 307, May 1883), 480802=Grace Hospital School has had five superintendents since Miss Hibbard resigned to do nursing during the Spanish-American War. Miss L. J. Gross was superintendent until she resigned to become superintendent of nurses in Buffalo General Hospital, Buffalo, New York. Miss L. A. Chambers next held the position, to be followed by Miss C. P. Van Der Water. Miss Van Der Water was principal for seven years. Miss Harriet Leek was principal during the World War. Miss Laura Meader served ably for eight years. She died while she was director of the training school on June 1, 1928. Miss M. Delta Long is director of the school at the present time. The six nurses who have held this post have instilled into their students their own ideals for the nurse and her service to mankind., 327638=At Grosse Pointe Farms in Cottage Hospital, operated under Detroit Community Fund auspices. This was opened in an eight room house as a small nursing unit during the influenza epidemic of 1917. Later, another house was acquired, and a modernly equipped operating room and delivery room were built to join the other two. This was followed by adding emergency room and operating room, bringing the capacity to twenty-one beds. Added to this, a new fifty-bed hospital was occupied in the autumn of 1928. Cottage Hospital is standardized. Since the Detroit Community Fund makes up the annual deficit, amounting to one-fourth of operating expenses, patients are charged a very low rate. There is an endowment adequate to provide free service for the needy of the community., 1025112=Summary: The complete original text of the 1935 Social Security Act, 247414=Summary: The percentage of the population in each region from 1790-1990, when the population moved from the original 13 colonies to the South and Midwest, and then to the West., 354745=Aged Women's Home, 1400 W. Lexington Street, Baltimore, MD Built 1850, demolished, July 1959., 751727=Odd Fellows was established in Ohio prior to 1845 and grew rapidly throughout the 19th century. As of 1989, there were 721 lodges in Ohio with 61,328 members and 362 Rebekah lodges with 29,989 members., 486867=Miss Flaws realized that a school can do better work if its graduates feel a sincere interest in its welfare. She also knew that graduates felt more responsible when the school kept in touch with them; consequently the Butterworth (the hospital was renamed in 1894) Alumn\u00c3\u00a6 Association was organized. Miss Flaw's resignation in 1912 was a severe loss to hospital and school. The seven years of her service were momentous ones in the history of the institution., 502856=Perhaps as easy a way as any to answer the question will be to describe a visit made by the writer, a few months ago, to a large rural almshouse in Illinois. I select this particular house because it is not the best, and is a long way from being the worst, within my knowledge. The house stands in the centre of a great coal district, thirteen miles from the county seat, but only two from a little mining hamlet. The road is fairly good in dry summers; when the weather is wet, and through most of the winter, it is almost impassable. My companion was a clever young physician, of considerable experience among the insane. After a long drive we stopped before a cluster of buildings, to which a tall windmill gave something of a picturesque and foreign air. There was a neat brown cottage; a large, bare brown house, without blinds, and seeming to have a disproportionate number of windows; along, two-storied building, shining with new paint; and a number of out-buildings, in appearance much like those to be seen on any large farm, even to the detail of a brick-red barn. The yard in front of the house had a number of trees, and a little to the right was a large garden. We saw no flowers, except the great white snowballs weighing down a half dozen huge bushes; but green things were sprouting and springing up all over the garden beds, and the foliage and the short scant grass had the fresh beauty of May. A man opened the gate. for us. He was a short, squarely built fellow, in dingy yellowish garments; and he had chains on his feet, making him take queer, short steps. His face was pale and sodden, with blear eyes and shapeless features; somehow, he seemed all of a color, hair, skin, eyes, and clothes. Several other men, also in chains, and more or less of a color like him, were hobbling about the yard; and one young man, in a long blue jean gown, was sitting chained to a post. Those must be the insane, said the doctor. Mingling with these men were others without chains, men and women, some of whom were painfully deformed. No one appeared to pay them any attention. The superintendent was away; but his daughter, a rather pretty, slim girl of eighteen, offered to show us through the house. The brown cottage was the keepers house; this we did not visit, but passed directly into the large frame building, the home of the sane paupers and of the harmless insane. At the time of our visit the house contained ninety-seven paupers, including some thirty-seven insane people and nine children. The first room we saw was a small store-room. Besides stores, there was a shelf filled with medicine bottles. The almshouse being so far from the county-seat, the almshouse keeper acts as resident physician., 105268=Families couldn't support their members and often split up. \"The divorce rate fell, for the simple reason that fewer people could afford one, but the rate of desertion soared. By 1940, over 1.5 million married couples were living apart.\" (American History Files) Hard times generated new waves of migration. Unemployed workers crossed the country to search for jobs, further dispersing families. Children were sent away to orphanages and older family members who had no income of their own were more likely to end up in the poorhouse or dependent on charity., 337384=A training school for nurses was established in 1890, and since that time 480 graduates have gone forth. Many of the graduate are filling important positions in institutions, public health, and every other nursing endeavor. The missionary spirit has taken our graduates to many of the foreign fields, as Arabia, Abyssinia, China, India, Korea, as well as the home missionary fields of Alaska, Kentucky, and New Mexico. Several Butterworth graduates served during the Spanish-American War, and many more had a part in the World War., 116294=Title I of the 1935 Social Security Act created a program, called Old Age Assistance (OAA), which would give cash payments to poor elderly people, regardless of their work record.\u00a0OAA provided for a federal match of state old-age assistance expenditures. Among other things, OAA is important in the history of long term care because it later spawned the Medicaid program, which has become the primary funding source for long term care today.\u00a0, 11094=(See 1809-1930: History of Hospitals in Michigan.), 463552=An important change took place in 1923, when the management of the Battle Creek Sanitarium and Hospital bought the buildings of the old Battle Creek College and housed the three schools, School of Nursing, School of Physical Education, School of Home Economics under one roof. These three schools became the nucleus for the present Battle Creek College. Two years later, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences was added. Battle Creek College wan then granted full recognition as a four-year college worthy to grant the baccalaureate degrees by the North Central Association of College and Secondary Schools., 472300=The community has been interested in its own first school for nursing from its very inception. This interest has asserted itself in many ways. The graduating exercises for the first class was a social event attended by a large audience. The stage was beautifully decorated with flowers. The class was dressed in striped seersucker with white caps and aprons. Each graduate received exquisite floral tributes from friends. Mrs. Withey, a member of the Hospital Committee, when she handed their diplomas to them, admonished the class to be discreet and above gossip; to be brave, to be patient, gentle and faithful. In fact, she summarized the community's ideal for the nurse when she said, \"Keep a high standard constantly in view.\" She also offered them the protection and comfort of the Home if ever sickness or misfortune should overtake them. It was not alone such glorious occasions as commencement exercises that friends of the school showed interest. Dr. Frances Hillyer, Dr. Frances Rutherford, and Dr. Elizabeth Earle were actively concerned for the school and for each individual student. When it was difficult to secure a suitable superintendent for the hospital, Dr. Earle gave half of her time to the hospital and actually held the school together. Dr. Earle was courageous enough to make the public see just what it owed to the young women who were taking the training. She plead for reasonable housing quarters. Her efforts were rewarded in 1889, when a modern lodge, tastefully furnished, was opened for the student nurses. Dr. Earle has told of some of the idiosyncrasies of the patrons of the school. The school charged $10.00 per week for a nurse's service in a private home. One woman refused to pay. She felt that $7.50 a week was enough to ask for the services of an undergraduate, especially since the student nurse was required to do so little. The patron pointed out that the nurse allowed two hours a day for rest and she was seldom called after midnight. In a remarkably short time, the school was excellently organized, and it has been serving a grateful public for forty-four years., 178169=The traditional role of the county poor farm had become increasingly irrelevant since the inception of Social Security and Old Age Assistance in 1935, although a certain number of poor elderly still remained as the responsibility of the counties. Many of the poorhouses closed or were sold, but a few continued to operate as homes for the indigent elderly. The 1935 law created financial problems for the counties running nursing homes, because the residents couldn't qualify for Social Security Old Age Assistance. In some cases, the 1950 Amendments created a new source of financing for both the operations and the cost of constructing or renovating buildings to meet new licensing standards, and the county poor farm became a nursing home.\u00a0In other places, the tougher licensing standards were the last straw, and the county poor houses were shut down., 660482=The number of claims allowed in 1887 on account of the Civil War was 46,380, and in 1888, 46,750, as against about 25,000 in 1881. There is no part of the Commissioner of Pensions report more significant than the table which shows the number of invalid claims filed each year, and the percentage allowed of each years filing:, 642603=3 Admirable brief descriptions of foreign systems of caring for old age are given in the Preliminary Report of the [Massachusetts] Commission on old-age Pensions, etc., submitted to the legislature in January, 1909., 299444=St. Luke's Hospital and Church Home, operated by St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal Church, is interesting as the earliest continuous institution with hospital features set up in Michigan under Protestant auspices. It was made possible by bequest of Mrs. A. C. Caniff, 1861, amounting to $1500. After location, 1864, in Lafayette Street and in West Forth Street, 1868, modern Detroit knows it as situated in Highland Avenue, where it carries on a work for the aged, sick, and poor, under support of the Episcopalian church parishes., 444593=The number of young persons who at present select nursing for their life work has increased since the latter part of the nineteenth century. Up to the year 1890, there were less than fifty students enrolled in the training schools for nurses in Michigan. In 1921, 1,575 men and women were studying nursing. In making this comparison, it is only fair to state that by 1921 the number of training schools had so increased that any locality of the state was within a reasonable distance of at least one of them. The proximity of such schools possibly had something to do with the increased interest in nursing. Of course, the population of the state had increased. While these factors all contributed, there is no question but that the ideal of service and the glory of the profession made a very strong appeal to the young person of character. The nurse played such an unselfish and heroic part during the World War, that she won respect from all observers. Her growing interest in the social conditions of her own locality and of the world was making her an outstanding citizen. Young girls were attracted by the nurses and nursing activities, and so it is not surprising that many of them elected the profession. It is pre-eminently a woman's work., 948858=\"In September, 1932 I reached the end of my resources. I was desperate, with a wife and three children to support I was unable to find work of any kind. All of my friends were in the same predicament. Finally I had to go on relief, and what a relief that was! I shall always remember my experience while trying to get relief from the city. I went down to City Hall and registered at the Poor Department. After looking me up they gave me a pass to obtain food. But in order to receive the food I had to stand in line on Main Street with every passerby staring at me., 206311=Program costs had continued to escalate, and payments for OAA exploded from $36 million in 1950 to $280 million in 1960, a 680% increase.\u00a0The new Kerr-Mills program didn't rein in any of the costs, it created new ones. Along with adding new classes of beneficiaries, the Kerr-Mills program had eliminated the only control on spending that existed up to that time -- the cap on payments set by OAA. From this point forward, states could set payments to nursing home providers as high as they wished, and the federal government, which had no control over rates, was mandated to pay its part of the cost.\u00a0, 817746=Hiram Lester, who was alleged to be the oldest man in the United States, was a pauper who died in a North Carolina almshouse in the summer of 1896 at the reputed age of 128 years. His only evidence was the statement of his father, who died in the same almshouse many years ago at the age of 115 years, it was said, Noah Raby, also a pauper, an inmate of the almshouse at Piscatawa, near New Brunswick, N. J., celebrated what he said was his 125th birthday on April 1, 1897. He was born in Gates County, North Carolina, his father being a full-blooded Indian named Andrew Bass. He says he was discharged from the man-of-war \"Braudywine\" eighty-four years ago, but has lost his discharge papers; that he heard Washington make an angry public address at Norfolk; that he began smoking when he was five years old, and has continued to smoke ever since, and has always been a drinker of liquors. It is on his unsupported statement that the people of the neighborhood regard him with local pride. Mrs. Margaret Bowen died near Chicopee Falls, near Springfield, Massachusetts, in May, 1896, at the reputed age of 121 years. She was born in County Clare, Ireland, and came to this country in 1865. Her husband, still alive, is now 78 years old. James Oney, who died in Knott County, Kentucky, in April, 1896, said he was 115 years old, though there are no records in the case. He was born at Mount Vernon, Virginia, near the home of the man who could not tell a lie, had twenty-three children, three of whom were born blind. Of his 178 descendants, thirteen were born blind. He died virtually a pauper, and was fond of whiskey toddy, getting jolly to the end. His oldest son, blind, is now living in Knott County at the age of 90, which age is also unsupported by evidence. The father had seen Washington often. Louis Darwin and his wife, French Canadians, living at Saint Paul, Canada, aged respectively 107 and 101 years, have been married 81 years, according to their own account. \"Jack\" Casar, a negro, who was a slave in New Jersey, the body servant of Mr. John Quackenbush, died at Ridgewood, in that State, December 19, 1896, at the reputed age of 106 years. Mrs. Yetta Gerber died in March, 1897, at 52 Suffolk street, New York City, at the age, it is said, of 106 years. She was born in Poland, and distinctly remembered she was 21 years old when Napoleon passed through the village in which she lived on his way to Russia, and again on his return. A few days before her death she entertained visitors by cracking a filbert with her teeth, of which she had never lost one. Joseph Field, there is good reason to believe, was 104 years and 6 months old when he died, April 1, 1897, near Red Bank, N. J., where he had always lived. He was a farmer with a fortune of half a million. He had remained a bachelor until he was 75 years old, when he married a young woman who bore him three daughters. He was able to walk about until a few months before his death. He had always used whiskey in moderation. Mrs. Goings, who professed to be 109 years old, died at Indianapolis in February, 1896. She said her father was 111 at the time of his death and her mother 106. William Taylor, of Augusta County, Va., died at the reputed age of 105 years and ~ months, at Baltimore, where he had gone in search of work as a painter. Mrs. Lorena Huntley, of Moira, Franklin County, N. Y., who was born at Peru, in the same State, died in December, 1896, at the age of 104 years. There is an early family Bible record of her birth., 21541=(See 1790-1990: Population Percentage by Region.), 558085=When the ruinous nature of this method was brought to light by a parliamentary investigation which occupied four years, Lord Grey carried an amendment to the poor law through the legislature, which stripped the local justices of the power to order relief, created a national board of commissioners, with district commissioners under them, and ordered the erection of work-houses in every parish, or authorized union of parishes. It was the intention of the framers of this amendment to confine all relief to inmates of the work-house, except in cases of peculiar emergency. The parish officers were to see that work was provided for and secured from all the inmates who were capable of performing it, especially able-bodied dependents. Those who would not accept this mode of relief were to be held as not sufficiently pinched by want to be objects of official aid. This is the famous but neglected work-house test of England. Its character and issue were tersely stated by Mr. Edward Denison in 1869, the year previous to his death: The framers of the poor law of 1834 never seriously considered how they could find work for the destitute. They only wanted a disagreeable and deterrent occupation. Their principle was to offer board and lodging in the work-house to all who would take it; the only further consideration being how to make the recipients condition so uncomfortable that he would avoid it as long as he could, and get out of it on the first opportunity. Possibly this system, thoroughly and universally enforced by able administrators, would have stamped out pauperism altogether, to the infinite advantage of the whole laboring class. But the law never was in harmony with public opinion; it was very partially and negligently executed, and of course broke down. The poor law of 1834 has practically been repealed long ago. Four causes wrecked the plans of Lord Grey's government: the recalcitrancy of the parish authorities, who would not follow the instructions of the board of commissioners; the distress consequent upon the bad harvests of 1837-39, and upon the commercial depression of that period; the sundering of families in the work-house; and the lack of proper discrimination between helpless and able-bodied inmates. One building and one administration were offered to the infant and the idle, to the aged and the vagabond, to the deserted mother and the penniless inebriate, to the blind or maimed and the street beggar. Two incompatible designs were to be pursued under one roof. The same institution was to be a hospital for the helpless and ah agency for repressing importunity. Humanity lay behind one part of the scheme, and suspicion behind the other. Occupation meant to be deterrent in one ward could not he regarded as honorable in another. The work-house dress and discipline confounded the impotent with the vagabond. Misfortune wore the badge of vice. Of course, in such an institution, the natural associations of the family must be broken up by artificial classifications. Parents are sundered from children, husbands from wives, brothers from sisters, a separation which is the bane of institutional life. The one cause rendered the workhouse unpopular, while the other rendered its repressive design fruitless. The general commissioners were not clothed with authority over the parish guardians, whose administration still managed the tax-rate, and distributed its proceeds. Local self-sufficiency and usage met the intervention of a national committee with jealousy and obstinacy, as if it were an impertinence. Then, the quick succession of general distress compelled the commissioners to relax their instructions, and in three or four years after the poor law was amended there were in England seven out-door beneficiaries of the parish-rate to one inmate of the work-houses, a proportion which has been maintained ever since with disheartening monotony. The sequel is thus narrated by Edward Denison : The guardians, with short-sighted economy, knowing that the fewer the inmates of the work-house the smaller their expenses, neglected to offer the work-house when they ought to have offered it, and got into a way of giving small doles of out-door relief to those whom they knew they ought to have admitted. Once embarked on the system of giving out-door relief, without the application of either work-house or labor test, there was naturally no end to it. They had taken the lock off the door; they had no means of discriminating the applicants. These, of course, became more and more numerous, as it became evident that any one might get relief, if he were lucky, deserving or undeserving. Then, having voluntarily pulled down the barrier which excluded only the unworthy, they were at length, in self-defense, compelled to put up another of some sort, and they put up one which excluded all alike, or, at least, let no more than half in. They gave so little relief that it was a mere mockery. Then in comes public benevolence, says the poor law has broken down, and does its best to make a real break-down of it. That, in my view, is the history of the matter. To this statement he adds his opinion, formed when he was living in Philpot Street, at the East End of London, whither he went to obtain by daily contact with it some clear insight into the nature of pauperism: The remedy is to bring back the poor law to the spirit of its institution.? The same conclusion had been reached by Sir Charles Trevelyan, a coadjutor of Denisons in philanthropic endeavor, and one of the most patient students of this social problem in England. It is shared by Professor Fawcett, the present postmaster general of the realm. And it has also recently been proposed by Mr. Seth Low, the mayor of Brooklyn, before a conference of charities held in Boston; and his intelligent devotion to the cause of the poor in his native city attracted to him that attention which raised him to civi5 honors, usually reserved, not for riper, but for more protracted years., 355714=In December, 1848 the Society announced their determination to build an aged women's home on the present site. The lot measured 80 feet front by 150 feet depth. Fifty feet of the frontage was contributed to the Society by James Canby of Wilmington Delaware. Canby owned 33 acres of land in the vicinity, and was in the process of developing it for residences. The home was one of the first building to be erected in his development. In the same announcement, the Society urged merchants and artisans to contribute materials and labor to the building., 783830=Not only do these sample \"settlement histories\" give us glimpses of the variegated characters at Long Island; they suggest how many of these must have been criminal offenders at some time. Out of the 872 different individuals admitted in 1876, 244 men or 48 percent, and 184 women or 60 percent had been recent inmates of penal institutions. Long Island and Deer Island are not far apart literally or figuratively. Inmates of the latter as recently as last June and one as recently as last November are now inmates of the the former., 1100235=The following text is an excerpt from a 1948 report of the Advisory Council on Social Security which resulted in major changes in the Social Security legislation in 1950. This excerpt explains why the Old Age Assistance program in 1935 excluded payments to individuals in public institutions, and recommended that OAA be expanded to be made available to public institutions that provide medical, rather than domiciliary, care. It also recommended expanding assistance payments to pay for care in nursing homes, and creating a system of state oversight of nursing homes., 131555=In contrast, while the nursing home industry was becoming primarily a for-profit industry, hospitals continued to develop under government and non-profit sponsorship. By 1935, there were about 6,400 hospitals in the United States, and virtually all were either non-profit or government facilities. Most hospitals had always admitted a significant percentage of \"charity\" patients who could not pay their own way, whose care was heavily subsidized by the government or by the religious or charitable institutions that supported the hospitals. They also required more capital and operated on a scale that few private operators would have been able to finance.\u00a0, 484663=The length of the training was to be two years, but for some reason the first class was not graduated until 1893. The commencement of the first class was a dignified and charming service. The six young women, in uniforms of blue chambray, white aprons, white caps, cuffs, and collars, with mulls ties, seated under their motto of \"Nil Desperandum,\" took the vows of unselfish and untiring service in carrying for the sick. Dr. G. K. Johnson delivered the graduating address. He advised the nurses always to be scrupulously neat, to maintain control of tongue and temper, to think clearly and to keep command of themselves in the performance of their duties., 556661=The English scheme of poor relief lies in confusion. Until Lord Grey's government, the justices of the peace had authority to order pauper relief at their discretion. There was no uniformity of method observed in the realm, but each parish was at liberty to pursue its own counsels. The local officers had some ground for prodigality in the standard set up by a statute of 1796, which directed the public pauper to be maintained in a state of comfort. Poor-houses, built under the Elizabethan statute of 1601, existed in most parishes, but they were designed only for impotent folk. At the beginning of the present century pauperism increased with great rapidity, and in some seventeen years the ratepayers burden was doubled, a tax that in some instances amounted to a confiscation of ratable property. Whether as a consequence or a cause of this increase, the justices of the peace had adopted the expedient of making allowances from the parish treasury for insufficient wages, and bad fixed a standard to which the weekly income of paupers should be raised out of the rates. They justified this course by the argument that it was cheaper to provide a partial than an entire maintenance for the dependents upon the parish. The effect was disastrous, for it appeared in the genera1 reduction of wages, which brought the most industrious to the brink of starvation, and destroyed the motive of self-support., 39247=(See 1898-1987: History of the Odd Fellows Home of Springfield Ohio.), 781376=A glimpse of some of the types may be had from the following \"settlement histories\", selected almost at random from those on which permits were granted as recently as last January. Of course the correct names are not given., 369842=The Sailor's Snug Harbor. Harper's new monthly magazine. Volume 46, Issue 272, January, 1873., 483670=The Women's Board of St. Mark's Hospital held a meeting one summer day in 1890, and received, as its guest, Dr. Reuben Peterson, the first superintendent of the institution. Dr. Peterson, on that occasion, told the good women assemble about the great need for a training school for nurses in connection with the hospital. If the hospital would train its own nurses, it could not only supply the deficiency then existing, but it might also supervise the instruction and mold the student to the hospital's standards. Dr. Peterson was granted the authority to establish a training school, and he accepted three probationers that first summer. Miss Koler, of St. Luke's Hospital, Chicago, was secured as superintendent of the hospital while the school was yet in its infancy. She proved to be an able and sympathetic supervisor, inspiring the confidence of the students, the medical staff and the public. To her must be given much of the credit for the early success of the school., 5269=(See 1800-1990: Changes in Urban/Rural U.S. Population.), 322245=On July 1, 1929, 132,700 patients had been registered and had received complete examinations. All patients reporting for even a trivial ailment are urged to have a complete examination., 94218=Bruce Vladeck estimated that by 1930 there were as many elderly people in facilities for the mentally ill as there were in poorhouses and voluntary and charitable facilities combined. If his estimates are accurate, about half of the total elderly population living in an institution in the early 1900's may have had some sort of mental disease or condition, about the same ratio as we see in nursing homes and assisted living facilities today.\u00a0(Estimates of Institutionalized Population), 193286=In 1959 The Housing Act was amended by creating several programs to be administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). One program provided federal mortgage insurance to enable private lenders to make low-interest loans for the construction or rehabilitation of nursing homes, which were available to private, public operators, and non-profit operators. This was the first time that the federal government had provided any financial assistance to proprietary nursing home operators for the significant cost of building new facilities, and they took full advantage of it, greatly increasing the number of for-profit nursing homes in the country in the next few years., 828951=The Subtle Problems of Charity Jane Addams The Atlantic Monthly Volume 83, Issue 496, February 1899 ext from: Library of Congress American Memory Collection An article from The Atlantic Monthly written by Jane Addams, founder of Hull House in Chicago that illustrates some ideas prevalent at the time about old age and poverty., 1092744=The income from real estate on this rich property furnishes adequate funds for the up-keep and perpetuation of the imposing buildings which stand on the ground of The Sailors Snug Harbor, a monument to the benevolence, philanthropy and foresight of its distinguished founder. Although the will was made in 1801, litigation and other causes delayed the purchase of the site for the Home on Staten Island until thirty years later., 599740=Whatever scheme of dealing with pauperism may be pressed upon our notice, one truth will doubtless emerge from every experiment, clad in repulsiveness until society recognizes it, transfigured with divine radiance when obeyed. It is the truth that man is not an animal, but a moral and social being. The system must be simply the method 0 by which the noblest spirit acts, not a labor-saving mechanism. The English work-house, with all its discriminating rules, has lapsed again and again into a winters refuge of vagabonds, a recuperating asylum of the inebriate and licentious, a source of infection to its hapless innocent inmates, and a prop to prolong the career of profligacy. Under the elaborate and splendidly adjusted organization of the Bureaux de Bienfaisance, Napoleon III. thought it necessary, during his reign, to expend more than $360,000,000 on the public improvements of Paris, in order to furnish employment to the people, while Belgium is the classic land of pauperism. The severe Fragebogen of Leipsic cannot remedy the faithlessness or indifference of the overseer, nor the lack of moral influences attaching to the paucity of visitors. Under all systems, everything depends on the manner of administration, and the spiritual wealth of the community at their command. While the scope of relief extends to no greater wants than an intelligent farmer considers in his herd, the pauper cannot hut feel that he is placed among the cattle outside, and excluded from all participation in the life of these households. The closing of the doors to high human fellowships, with their moral basis of order and concord, with their bright conventions of courtesy and refinement, with their rich play of responsive sympathies, with their hope exciting vistas of still ampler and purer prospects, this is the saddest element in the situation of those whom adversity, ignorance, or vice has depressed. The poor wretch, who, lapsed from the pale of cosmic life, is sinking into the debasement of animalism, where intelligence turns to predatory instincts, the voice of conscience is quiet, the faculties for fellowship wither up, and the hope of better things does not stir the heart, needs to be environed by the friendships of the capable and strong. Without this higher and harder charity, organization is not method, but mechanism. The hand without the mind is but a tool. Together they are the artist. The mechanisms of charity can never shape the hard rock of pauperism into the features and forms of beauty. For that undertaking society must become an inspired artist. May not this persuasion have led the apostle Paul to couple the principle and exhortation together? He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due season we shall reap if we faint not., 292340=\"On June 7, 1834, Governor Porter, of Michigan Territory, died very suddenly. The circumstances of his death must have aroused suspicion of Asiatic cholera in the minds of the attending physicians, for his funeral was held on the day of his death. Between that time and August 1, several cases occurred with the unmistakable symptoms of cholera, and an alarm went through the city. There was a hurried cleaning of streets and alleys, but the plaque continued., 241563=As standards were increased and Medicare funding was cut, older homes continued to close. A report by the National Center for Health Statistics determined that 1,445 facilities closed just between 1969 and 1971., 330894=February 14, 1863, the following appeal was issued: Hospital 7th Michigan Cavalry., 1098429=Another indication that the high number of closures may be reasonable comes from Inpatient Health Facilities, As Reported from the 1971 MFI Survey (NCHS Series 14, Number 12), which determined that 1,445 nursing homes closed in only two years between 1967 and 1969., 731718=But the principle upon which pensions of the fourth class were granted by the act of June 27, 1890, is not so clear. So far as relief is given under this law to needy persons, or to those who are suffering from disabilities probably due to military service, but not provable to be so, and it was the existence of. many such cases that furnished the chief argument for the measure, the principles above cited apply., 586786=The result of Von der Heydts Elberfeld plan was so remarkable as to attract attention from all parts of Europe and America. In 1852, the year before Von der Heydts society was formed, the city, with a population of fifty thousand, had four thousand paupers. In 1869 the population was seventy one thousand, and the paupers one thousand and sixtytwo, while the expense had dwindled one half. In Leipsic, the ratio of paupers in 1832 was 9.2 per cent., in 1870 it was 3.26 per cent. In Berlin, the ratio of out-door paupers is about 2.5 per cent., and it is not materially different in Hamburg., 454005=Mrs. Lystra Gretter, of the Buffalo General Hospital, became the principal within the first five years of its beginning. She guided its destiny for a period of twenty years. The purpose of the school has always been to keep pace with the demands of the community. Mrs. Gretter rearranged, lengthened, and added to the curriculum that these needs might be met. The eighteen months of training was extended to two years. This satisfied only for a time and in 1891 a three-years course was developed. The year 1891 was an important one for the nurses of Harper, as well as other hospitals, and for women in industry everywhere. Harper adopted the eight-hour day for its nurses. It was the first hospital in American to take such reform measures, and for several years it stood alone in this idea. The result of that radical step has been harvested by women in employment around the world., 922598=\"At the end of 1928, after six years of agitation, there were only six states and one territory which had made provision for their aged. They were Colorado, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, Wisconsin and Alaska. All the state laws were of the optional type, i.e., they left the adoption or rejection of an old age assistance system to the discretion of the counties. For this reason these laws had very limited effect only. In these six states, there were slightly above 1000 pensioners, and these were found almost exclusively in Montana and Wisconsin, the former having 884, the latter 295 old people on their pension rolls. The total amount spent by the six states in 1928 was, in round numbers, $200,000.(1), 793436=The hospital, although a part of the almshouse, is of sufficient importance in itself to be considered a separate institution. The total number of patients in 1897 was 387 men and 573 women. Of these, 305 men and 409 women were admitted during the year, and 297 men and 426 women were discharged. The largest number at any one time was 281, and the smallest, 233. Besides those treated in the hospital, 883 were treated as out-patients. Among the diseases treated were, in the hospital: General debility, 65; senile debility, 91; rheumatism, 38; phthisis, 96; tuberculosis, 4; typhoid fever, 4; alcoholism, 23; epilepsy, 19; dementia, including senile, 34; bronchitis, 29; pneumonia, 13; venereal diseases, 64; and, in the outpatient department: Rheumatism, 39; alcoholism, 16; debility, 71; and venereal, 23. The other ailments treated would exhaust the nomenclature of diseases. The insane are transferred to some hospital for the insane, but cases of mild dementia are retained. Twenty-three cases of insanity were transferred during 1897., 181122=If all nursing homes had been built under these standards after 1954, some of the quality problems that later emerged might not have occurred. But Hill-Burton financing was limited to a small group of non-profits affiliated with hospitals, so these standards had little impact on the vast majority of new nursing home construction. Ironically, restricting the funds to hospital-affiliated non-profits was intended to increase the quality of nursing homes, but it had the opposite effect. Developers who couldn't qualify for Hill-Burton funds continued to build thousands of new facilities with no reference to Hill-Burton standards. When regulators later decided that all nursing homes should meet the higher qualifications, it was too late. Trying to make the nursing homes fit the standards many years after they were built was nearly impossible., 920131=\"The first state law was passed in Arizona in 1915 by an initiative act, which abolished almshouses and established old age and mothers' pensions in their stead. However, it was worded so loosely that it was declared unconstitutional on account of its vagueness. In the same year Alaska passes a law, providing assistance to its aged pioneers. This law, though it has been amended on different occasions, is still in effect at the present time., 335255=In the winter of 1872-1873, St. Mark's Church in Grand Rapids had under its care two aged and infirm women. To provide a home for them and for others who might come to the same need, the rector appealed to the philanthropic women of the church. Prominent in the group which responded and effected the desired organization was Mrs. E. P. Fuller, who, with her husband, gave encouragement to the project by donating the use of a small house at what is now the corner of Bond Avenue and Crescent Street. Here on February 11, 1873, was held the first recorded meeting of St. Mark's Church Home, a voluntary association, in the modest inception of which lies the origin of Butterworth Hospital., 450961=In 1881, the Michigan Medical News reports, \"It gives us pleasure to announce the establishment in this city [Detroit] of a training school for nurses. The work has been undertaken by the Michigan College of Medicine, and the co\u00c3\u00b6peration of a number of prominent citizens and ladies has already insured its success. The Michigan College of Medicine is entitled to credit for the innovation. For $25.00 and two years study and practice of their profession, they [the nurses] will receive $216.00 and be prepared to earn at least $10.00 a week in this remunerative and useful field of work for women.\" This notice is the only record of the training school which has been found. How long the school existed and how many nurses it trained are undetermined. Nevertheless, this school has the honor of being the first formal training school for nurses to be mentioned in print in Michigan., 319027=On October 27, 1918, the huge shell of the new hospital building was turned over to the United States Army at a rental of one dollar a year and used as U. S. Army General Hospital No. 36, with Lieutenant Colonel Alexander T. Cooper as commanding officer, and wounded overseas men were received as patients early in 1919. The hospital was returned to Mr. Ford by the government on January 1, 1920, and the original staff returned from their army service and again opened the hospital., 271457=Summary: A graph showing the sharp decline in fertility rates since 1800, reflecting the reduction in the average size of families over time., 988607=In 1923 there was no awakened consciousness of the desire for old age pensions. It was introduced in our legislature during times that were most difficult and following a year of drought and distress., 196619=Not surprisingly, with government financial spigots open wide and few restrictions on what nursing homes should look like or how they should operate, quality issues started to come to the forefront. Among other problems, the lack of standards and the old age of many of the converted buildings made nursing homes fire hazards. When they did burn, there were often many deaths because they were filled with frail elderly residents who were unable to get themselves out of danger. One of the most tragic events was a fire in a nursing home in Warrenton, Missouri on February 17, 1957.\u00a0, 384024=In October, 1806, the reported income of the whole estate was $4,243. Eight years later the annual income had increased to about $6,000; and in the same year the New York Legislature, owing to some difficulties which had arisen in determining who were the senior ministers of the Episcopal and Presbyterian churches, decided that the rector of Trinity Church and the minister of the Presbyterian church then located in Wall Street were of the trustees of said corporation. An act also was appended requiring the trustees to make an annual report of the state of the funds held by them to the Legislature of the State, and to the Common Council of the city. Thus the State and the city of New York were constituted the guardians of the trust. In 1817 the total income of the estate was $6,659.92; and during that year the trustees petitioned the Legislature for permission to change the site of the hospital. Instead of erecting it on the twenty-one acres of ground in the upper part of the city, as had been contemplated by the testator, which plan would absorb a large portion of their revenues, depreciate the value of the adjoining lots, and necessarily confine the inmates to narrow limits, they asked to be authorized to purchase ground for the hospital at the entrance to, or in sight of, the harbor of New York. A short time previous they had been tendered the liberal offer of a conveyance gratuitously of a lot of land, not less than ten acres, on Staten Island, situated on the bay between Point Diamond and the quarantine grounds, then belonging to, and offered by, Daniel D. Tompkins., 465376=The educational requirements for entrance were raised to meet the college requirements. This school of nursing, along with other schools in the state, is finding that applicants for admission are presenting ever higher educational attainments. The later classes have had a sprinkling of students with some college training. The classes of 1927 and 1928 each had seven college graduates among their number., 1097095=A 1969 survey of facilities estimated there were about 18,000 facilities, 15,000 of which were \"nursing care\" or \"personal care with nursing\" facilities. In another report, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Monthly Vital Statistics Report (July 1972, Number 21, Volume 4) reported they had asked each of about 18,000 homes in a 1968 survey to indicate whether they had been in operation 10 years prior (in 1958) and 20 years prior (in 1948). That report found that 60% had been in business for 10 years or less, about 40% of them had been in business in 1958, and only 14% had been in business in 1948. That would seem to indicate that about 13,000 (86% of the 1969 total) were added in either the 1950's or 1960's, and about 9,000 (60% of the 1969 total) must have been added during the 1960's., 917245=Summary: A summary of the requirements and restrictions of state old-age assistance programs, along with state-by-state data on coverage and expenditures for 1934., 1059297=Major Beaton went to Taos, New Mexico, with three companies of the regiment and remained there, doing duty as acting adjutant of the battalion, until the end of the war, when he returned to Independence, Mo., with the entire regimental command, where with his fellow-soldiers he was, in the fall of 1848, honorably discharged from the service. He now draws a pension of $8.00 per month as a Mexican war veteran from the United States government., 734173=The current of ever-increasing liberality which has flowed through our pension legislation may also be traced in the administration of the laws. In the earlier years there were some attempts to throw about the adjudication of claims certain judicial safeguards, which gradually fell into disuse. An act of 1792 provided for the attendance of each applicant and the production of his evidence before the United States Circuit Court of his district, and the court was required to make a personal examination of the disability, and forward the papers to the Secretary of War with a report and recommendation., 464177=Mrs. Mary Staines Foy, who has been the director of nurses since 1899, and who was ever watching for opportunities for expanding the curriculum of the training school that it might become of still greater service to the students, saw her chance. She and Mrs. Louise Gleim-Fischer assumed the task of reorganizing the nursing school so that two courses might be offered. One course was for three years. It prepared the student to take the examination for registration. The other course was for five years and led to a scientific degree, as well as giving an adequate training in nursing. The subjects required of all the student nurses were put in three consecutive years, during which time hospital training was given. Five-year students spend the other two years in the literary college, preferably before entering the school for nursing. The three-year course was planned for a curriculum which totals 1,025 hours of class work. This is 200 hours more than that suggested by the standard curriculum; 196 of these hours are devoted to hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, and massage. Mrs. Gleim-Fischer was made dean of the school of nursing and remained in that position for three years., 609525=Much more significant in its promise for the future is the introduction of old-age pension plans by some of the railroad and industrial corporations. The pioneer in this field was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which inaugurated its pension policy in 1884. Its example has already been followed by twenty-four other railroads, including such important systems as the Chicago and Northwestern, the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western, the Illinois Central, the Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia and Reading, the Southern and Union Pacific, and the New York Central. Needless to say, these pension systems, though they require, often, no contribution whatever from the employees who benefit from them, have not been introduced on grounds of philanthropy. They are frankly intended for the good of the service. As Mr. Burlon Hendrick puts the matter in an article on \"The Superannuated Man\": 2 \"The most effective way of securing the right kind of force is obviously to adopt a broad general policy that will attract the most ambitious men, and secure from them the most efficient work of their productive years. The law of gravitation affect wage earners as well as other objects in nature; the best inevitably gravitate toward the most satisfactory terms of employment. The corporation that can insure its employees a reasonable permanency of employment, promotion in order of precedence and fitness, and a satisfactory provision for old age, will inevitably attract the highest grade of men and obtain from them the most efficient work.\", 36783=In 1845, Congress enacted a law giving public land to each of the states \"for the benefit of indigent insane persons\", and the states started to build insane asylums and hospitals for the insane. Many of the mentally-ill poorhouse inmates transferred to these new facilities were elderly. (Vladek, 1980)\u00a0, 87462=In 1909, Lillian Wald convinced Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to finance home care: \"Armed with data documenting that nursing care saved lives, Wald urged MetLife to hire visiting nurses to care for policyholders during illness. For a modest fee per policy, Wald believed that MetLife could reduce the number of death benefits paid.\" (VNSNY), 633662=As is well known, the United Kingdom did not adopt an old-age pension policy without having devoted many years to the consideration of the subject. As long ago as 1878, Canon Blackley proposed a contributory old-age pension policy. From that year until the enactment of the old-age pension law thirty years later, a great variety of pension plans were proposed and considered by royal commissions, parliamentary committees, and successive cabinets. On the eve of the Boer War the Conservative Ministry of the day was on the point of introducing an old-age pension bill into Parliament. The state of the public treasury during and immediately after that war made the adoption of any pension policy impossible. How favorably English public opinion is disposed to this method of caring for the aged poor is attested by the fact that when the Liberal government came into power three years ago this was one of the policies which it put into effect. Its attitude was no doubt influenced by the growing strength of the Labor party, but there is every indication that even had the Labor party failed to return fifty-two members to the last Parliament, some sort of old-age pension system would have been adopted., 643192=5 Though the average pension paid in 1906 was only $39.52, the system called for a total expenditure in that year of $32,845,000., 397021=The hospital is a magnificent and solid building of gray sandstone, built in the same style as the main building, with massive pillars supporting a portico over the entrance. In the basement are the kitchen and work-rooms for the convalescent patients who desire to work at their usual occupation -- basket-making. On the first floor is a large hall with a gallery or promenade overhead, and also the mess-rooms; and the upper story is occupied by the wards, which are all large, light, and airy, and have five or six iron bedsteads in each. On entering we were met at once by old Webster, who is now in the ninety-fourth year of his age. He was admitted an inmate of the Sailors Snug Harbor in 1844, then sixty-seven years old. It must be confessed that age has, as he said himself, \"rather brought him down.\" His mouth is toothless, his eyes watery and dim; but his white hair and long white beard give him a venerable appearance. He speaks with difficulty, and is perfectly helpless at table., 209704=Not all of the explosion in nursing home development was related to the availability of payments for welfare recipients. The number of people receiving Social Security increased throughout the 1950's and 1960's as new groups of employees were added to the program, and in 1961 when the retirement age was lowered from 65 to 62 and benefits to aged widows were increased. That enlarged the pool of people who had the financial wherewithal to pay privately for at least some part of their care needs., 711411=The resolve of August 26, 1776, remained the basis of the pension rights of Revolutionary soldiers until the act of April 10, 1806, which repealed all previous legislation on the subject, and pensioned all persons unable to procure a subsistence by manual labor on account of known wounds received during service in the Revolution, granting half-pay to commissioned officers, and $5 per month to others., 317971=In February, 1916, Dr. Roy D. McClure, resident surgeon of the Johns Hopkins Hospital and associate in surgery in the medical school, was appointed as surgeon-in-chief., 498884=(Footnote: Laws of New York, 1873, chapter 661, contains an act to provide for the support of state paupers. All blind, lame, old, impotent, or decrepit persons, who have not resided sixty days in any county of the State are deemed state paupers, and provision is made for their care by the Board of Charities.), 273543=The following table shows where the population was moving as the country expanded and families became disbursed. In 1800, the largest cities were all in the original 13 colonies. By 1850, some of the \"gateway\" cities to the west, like Cincinnati, St. Louis, and New Orleans, overtook the eastern cities. By 1900, many people had moved to the Midwest and early settlement of the West centered in San Francisco. By the mid- to late-1900's, many of the largest cities were in the West and the South., 350498=St. Joseph's Hospital was founded in May of 1912, by four Sisters of the nursing order under the patronage of St. Joseph. One of the fine old residences of Flint, the Stockton home at 722 Ann Arbor Street, was remodeled, and an addition built, making room for forty beds for adults and a nursery with eleven cribs for infants., 922532=\"In 1927 Maryland and Colorado passed bills., 199862=In spite of all the problems, there was still resistance to making changes. Many states said that strict enforcement of the regulations would close the majority of the homes and no one knew what they would do with the residents.\u00a0Buildings had already been built and were full, and residents who were living in them had no place else to go. Putting in controls after the fact was going to cause massive disruption. In 1957 the Public Health Service began to work with the states to create the \"Nursing Home Standards Guide\", but it took six years to agree on what the standards should be, and the guide wasn't finished until 1963. In the meantime, hundreds, maybe thousands, of new nursing homes were built., 942198=1 - Where no special reference is given, the figures are as of December 31, 1933 2 - 1930 Census figures 3 - Where no special reference is given, the figures represent actual cost for the year 1933 (a) As of October 1, 1934 (b) As of August 1934 (c) As of December 1934 (d) Estimated from expenditures of April through November 1934 - $317,000 (e) As of November 1934 (f) Estimated from monthly figures (g) As of September 1934 (h) Appropriation for 1934, 782895=William J. Downey. Age 44. Is a peddler, intemperate. At one time well-to-do but in a freak sold his business for almost nothing. On the death of his wife in the Massachusetts General Hospital of consumption, her mother took the three children. Later, a sister adopted the youngest. The man probably has a record in House of Correction. Has been in and out of the almshouse 41 times since 1885. Makes a paralyzed arm an excuse for not working. Met at Long Island a pauper woman whom he married for his second wife. The two children of this marriage are now in institutions. Two brothers of the man are at Long Island with consumption., 143668=Although the number of people receiving OAA stayed fairly stable during the 1940's, benefits increased precipitously, even after accounting for inflation. Average benefits restated in 1940 dollars increased by nearly 20% from 1940 to 1950. (Friedberg, 1998) Gross OAA expenditures doubled from $474 million in 1940 to $960 million by 1947. (Advisory Council Report, 1948), 716228=The act of April 16, 1816, extended this allowance to widows and minor children (under sixteen, which has remained the limit of pensionable age) of officers and enlisted men dying, after discharge, of wounds received in action., 715142=On June 30, 1891, invalid pensioners under laws prior to the act of June 27, 1890, and under special acts of Congress, were drawing 134 different rates, varying from $1 to $100. Of 419,046 such pensioners, 20 were drawing $1 per month; 17,036, $2; 62,318, $4; 83,- 299, $8; 46,097, $12; 20,246, $24; 14,834, $30; 3210, $36; 3161, $72; and 36, $100. The average monthly rate was $15 16; while among 676,160 pensioners of all classes it was $11., 717923=The act of July 14, 1862, above referred to, was the foundation of the colossal pension system of the last thirty years. The rebellion had been in progress more than a year, and the end was not yet in sight. Troops were needed, and it had become evident that if citizens were to be induced to voluntarily leave their homes and expose themselves to the perils of active service, more liberal provision must be made for the families to which they might never return. It was accordingly enacted that if any officer or enlisted man had died since March 4, 1861, or should thereafter die, by reason of any wound received or disease contracted while in the service of the United States and in the line of duty, his widow should receive the total pension of his rank, to continue during life or until re-marriage; and if no widow survived, or in case of her remarriage, a like pension was granted to his minor children., 312218=The Children's Free Hospital of Detroit was established by charitable ladies in 1886. Nine years later, Mr. Hiram Walker, in memory of his daughter, Jennie Walker, erected a fine building at the corner of Farnsworth and St. Antoine Streets. Attending physicians donated their services, and everything was free. About sixty children of parents of less than ordinary income received care. Senator James Couzens, while mayor of the city, re-established this especially appealing charity on a munificent scale, with a donation of $5,000,000, made upon the condition that the Children's Free Hospital of Detroit and the Michigan Hospital School of Farmington be consolidated. The Children's Hospital of Michigan is the result. It has 250 beds and an out-patient department. Prominent Detroit men and women, including Senator and Mrs. Couzens, make up the executive committee and the board of trustees., 64606=California passed the first state old-age assistance law in 1883. Helen Valeska Bary, who had worked at the California State Department of Social Welfare and later became the 8th employee of the Social Security Administration, recalled,, 894863=Summary: The table shows the number of people age 65+ who may have been living in institutions from 1900 to 1930, and their percentage of the total age 65+ population at the time., 723980=In 1878 the requisite term of service was reduced to fourteen days or participation in an engagement, and the limitation as to the date of marriage was removed., 642491=2 McClure's Magazine, December, 1908., 785049=This heterogeneous population is constantly changing. The aged and infirm stay on, of course, from year to year, but the younger and more active elements grow restless after a time and drop away, to return perhaps in a few weeks or even a few days. As a matter of fact, during 1896 there were admitted once, 724, twice, 175, three times, 38, four times, 18, five times, 5, nine times, 2. To put some check on this free and easy going and coming the following order was issued about a year ago:, 463158=The student nurses were not receiving as complete a training as Dr. Kellogg and his staff wished, and so a general hospital was added to the sanitarium in 1887. This made it possible for the nurses to have experience in all nursing services except in contagion and mental cases. The name of the school was again changed to Battle Creek Sanitarium and Hospital School for Nurses., 958926=\"The next day I applied for my unemployment compensation and because of waiting for these cheeks I was unable to go on the relief for two months. By this time I was completely broke, so for the next few months we struggled along on the six dollars a week that I received from the relief. But week by week we were going deeper in debt for rent, electricity, and many other small bills. One morning a Deputy Sheriff handed me an eviction notice and departed. And there I sat, in the kitchen, alone, forlorn and in despair. It was the morning of November 25, just one month before Christmas, and in my hand I held the notice from the court to evacuate the tenement that I occupied. This was not the first eviction notice that I had ever received. During the past ten years, the deputy Sheriffs had worn a path to my door delivering eviction notices, writs of attachment and liens on my pay. How could I break the news to my wife, when she returned from a visit to a neighbor's house? Where could we go? When you are on relief and only receive six dollars a week it is impossible to support a family and pay rent. The landlords did not care to rent a tenement to families on relief as they could not be sure of their rent. So most of them were demanding their rent in advance. If I could find a tenement, where could I borrow the three dollars for the first week's rent? What a Christmas was in store for my children! As I sat there alone with my thoughts the door opened and my wife walked in. Without talking I handed her the eviction notice. She knew what it was. She had seen many of them since 1930. Silently she laid it down and started to prepare dinner, each of us wondering where we could find a tenement., 65633=Robert Lansdale, a professor who headed up a study of state old-age assistance programs for the Social Security Administration in 1936, thought that people in the West were particularly sensitive to the need of the poor elderly. He said,, 369495=Summary: A very complete description of life in a self-supporting old-age campus in 1873 as described in an article written in Harpers Magazine., 388873=After the successful termination of the numerous lawsuits and intrigues that had for such a long time embarrassed the trustees, the revenues of the estate increased at an extraordinary ratio; and as at the same time the value of the real estate owned by the corporation in the upper part of New York had more than trebled in value, it is not surprising that the income of the estate in 1855 amounted to the handsome sum of nearly $75,000, while the institution at that time supported three hundred inmates. And since then the animal income has kept on increasing, making for 1870 a total amount of about $127,000., 1005997=May I just briefly survey the whole field which does properly come under the jurisdiction of social insurance against the hazards, the physical hazards of existence? All of the major hazards of existence may be classed properly under six heads: birth, unemployment, illness, accident, invalidity, death. I don't include old age, because old age is not primarily a major classification. Old age falls under two heads, invalidity due to advancing years, and unemployment due to depreciation or advancing years or both., 794507=In a hospital of this description the death rate must necessarily be very great. The morgue, which is a separate building, is seldom if ever free from dead bodies. Not infrequently it contains six or seven. About half are claimed by relatives or friends; the rest being buried on the island. The hospital is under the care of a medical superintendent with three assistants. There is a visiting medical and surgical staff. Connected with the hospital is a training school for nurse attendants. The course requires one year and includes general medical, minor surgical, maternity, and infant nursing. Instruction is given by means of lectures and text books, and teaching by the bedside in the regular performance of duties. The first graduating exercises were held in September, 1896; at which time seven pupils received diplomas. There are at present 25 in the school., 112287=A 1937 Social Security pamphlet said,\u00a0, 354990=The history of the organization responsible for the Aged Women's Home and the later adjacent Aged Men's Home is pertinent. \"Several ladies\" formed the Impartial Female Humane Society in 1802 for the purpose of assisting \"the deserving widow and deserted wife\" and to establish a \"Male Free School, upon liberal principles.\" The Society was incorporated in 1811, and in 1849 the Society was reincorporated as \"The Baltimore Humane Impartial Society and Aged Women's Home,\" for the express purpose of enlarging its sphere of activity to include the aged. In 1864, the charter was again changed to include a home for Aged Men. About this time the school was discontinued., 451958=Two schools for nurses were organized in the year 1883. These schools are outstanding today because of the breadth of their work and because of their influence in the development of nursing. Certainly a pioneer in nursing education in the middle West, as well as in Michigan, was the Farrand Training School honoring Dr. David Osborne Farrand. It was established in connection with Harper Hospital, Detroit. The only trained nurses this section of the country had known up to that time were from one of the very few training schools in the East or Chicago. There was also a dearth of physicians. Dr. Farrand, as well as other doctors, felt that medical service could be extended over a greater field if the physician could leave at the bedside of a critical case a reliable, skilled nurse. The Farrand Training School was opened with the ideal of training women of culture and stability who were willing to make nursing a life work and who would care for the sick not only in Harper Hospital, but in the community as well., 342807=The old hospital was opened in 1908 and had a capacity of thirty-six beds. Arrangements was made for free patients, to be examined by the health department. Under the city charter at that time, there was provision for a one-mill levy for maintenance. This gave the hospital $20,000 a year with which to operate. Thus the city hospital came into existence., 208394=In 1961, Congress approved a new medical facilities construction bill, the Community Health Services and Facilities Act. The bill increased federal grants to states for nursing homes, general public health services, hospital planning, and outpatient services for the aged and chronically ill by $40 million over five years., 175399=The first ever national inventory of nursing homes was done in 1954. When the first survey was tabulated, it was estimated that there were about 270,000 people living in 9,000 homes classified as \"nursing care home\" or \"personal care home with nursing\". Virtually all the homes were for-profit facilities -- 86% of all nursing homes were proprietary, 10% were voluntary, and only 4% were public.\u00a0, 307372=The first suggestion of a homeopathic hospital at Detroit seems to be the offer of a building site at the southeast corner of Willis Avenue and John R. Street, made by Amos Chaffee in 1869. The first homeopathic physician to locate at Detroit, Dr. S. S. Hall, entered upon his long practice there as early as 1843. In 1879 the Detroit Homeopathic Association was incorporated. But the hospital project lagged until 1886, when Mr. James MacMillan expressed to Dr. C. A. Walsh his purpose to sponsor a building that should cost $100,000. Mr. John S. Newberry soon afterwards proposed a gift of $50,000 as an endowment for operating costs. Mr. Chaffee then renewed the gift of the building site, which had reverted to him within the seventeen years since his first offer. Stipulations were made that the hospital be maintained forever free to all needing its services and unable to pay for them. Grace Hospital was opened in December, 1888. Constructed for 100 beds, it was equipped for thee care of only eighty-five patients. The MacMillan and Newberry families, reinforced by Mr. D. M. Ferry, and supplemented by others, continued to subscribe to the general endowment fund in sums from $1,000 to $50,000., 91690=Progress had been made for older adults who were not disabled or in need. In 1896, New Jersey created the first state-sponsored pension plan for teachers.\u00a0In 1911, the first pension program for all state government employees was instituted in Massachusetts. In 1920, the Civil Service Retirement Act created a retirement system that covered many governmental employees.\u00a0, 114968=The cost of many of these plans would have been enormous. In contrast, the 1935 Social Security Act as it was finally written seemed relatively modest. The \"Old Age Insurance\" (OAI) program we call \"Social Security\" today was created as Title II of the Social Security Act. It established a pool of funds that workers would pay into while they were working, which they could draw upon to support themselves in retirement. The government would not pay for it. Instead, it would be funded out of contributions of both workers and employers. To keep the cost of the program down, the initial Social Security law limited the program to workers in commerce and industry other than railroads. However\u00a0 amendments to the law in subsequent years have added more and more groups to the program until it is now nearly universal.\u00a0 (Social Security Act, 1935), 1056336=Narratives excerpted from: American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1940., 372549=I promised to do as asked, and we went together through the iron gate, and up the smooth walk leading to the centre or main building of the Sailors Sung Harbor. On our way thither I learned that the boy, Jack Stubbs, for whose benefit I had promised to interfere, was eighty-two years old, and that celebrating the birthday of the old man was only a slang term for getting a little the worse for liquor, which will, my friend with the wooden legs said, occasionally happen to some of 'em. Ascending the broad marble steps, we entered a large hall in the main building, lighted from above by a large oval window in the cupola, and occupied with chairs and benches placed across the floor, and leaving a narrow passage-way along the wall on either side. Just inside the door, and fronting the benches, was a reading-dcsk of oak with a red velvet cushion, and in the rear stood, on either side of the opposite door, two vases of terra cotta, filled with shrubs and flowers. A gallery went round the hall on all sides, at the height of the second floor, and above that was the cupola and sky-light. A large portrait of Captain John Whitten, who had once gone from Albany direct to China in a small sloop, and who subsequently was the first governor of the Harbor (from 1833 to 1844), faces the main entrance from the gallery; and above that is a well - executed bust, in marble, of the founder of this grand institution, Captain Robert Richard Randall., 401565=Leaving the hospital we proceeded to visit the farm belonging to this institution, and were accompanied thither by another old veteran, John Strain. The products of the farm in 1870 amounted to $9,067.60. Allowing for expenses for conducting and stocking it $3,768.87 there a net profit of $5298.73, which is a very handsome exhibit. Among the articles raised may be named 5,465 eggs, 20,662 quarts of milk, 1,722 bushels of potatoes, 5,627 heads of cabbage, 2,990 heads of lettuce, 16,410 cucumbers, besides great quantities of carrots, radishes, beets, corn, onions, sweet-potatoes, squashes, watermelons, string-beans, etc., etc. The live stock consisted of 12 milch cows, 4 young heifers, 1 Albany bull, and 90 hogs, besides oxen and horses. Of poultry there are kept about 70 chickens, mostly for the use of the hospital. An ice-house is also erected here, in which is stored away the ice for the use of the Harbor, which is obtained from a pond situated on their property., 791406=But all the able bodied are by no means fully occupied, especially in winter, on account of what may be called the institution's deficient industrial equipment. The sewing rooms, for instance, have fewer machines than could be used. \"With more machines,\" a former superintendent says in his report for 1896, the men's outside clothing could be made, and the expense saved of having it made at Deer Island.\" There is, to be sure, the large farm; but unfortunately this cannot be cultivated during the season when the number of men is the greatest. With the exception of the sewing rooms with their limited capacity, and the farm, which can be worked only a part of the year, there are no means of utilizing the labor of those buildings or on the grounds. Many therefore have little to do, less perhaps than would be good for them. There is, of course, a very large number of those unable to work and hence condemned to pass their time in absolute idleness. But this number could be reduced undoubtedly by more varied means of employment, and many be made the happier for having something to do., 653949=The United States Pension Office by Gaillard Hunt The Atlantic Monthly. (Volume 65, Issue 387, January 1890)., 319777=The Clara Ford School of Nursing and Hygiene was opened in 1925, being unique in having the first separate school building with class rooms, laboratories, gymnasium and swimming pool., 721023=On October 21, 1780, the Continental Congress resolved that the officers who shall continue in the service to the end of the war shall..., be entitled to half-pay during life, to commence from the time of their reduction., 999609=In 1933 there was quite a large increase in pensions over 1932, but there was a decrease in the amount paid to each pensioner. This was due to two factors. There was a greater demand for pensions, but there was less money with which to pay them. As a consequence the amount each person received was materially reduced. The pensions are paid from the country poor fund and many of these funds are depleted due to delinquent taxes., 737267=In his report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1875, Commissioner H. M. Atkinson said: The development of frauds of every character in pension claims has assumed such a magnitude as to require the serious attention of Congress... From the nature of the system under which the right to pension is determined under existing laws, viz., upon ex parte evidence, the successful prosecution of many fraudulent claims cannot be prevented, even though the utmost caution be exercised. The lapse of time since the war, and the consequent unreliability of parol proof relating to facts at this remote date from their occurrence, afford the most forcible argument for the adoption of a more thoroughly organized system of adjudicating these claims. By actual test in cases taken from the files of this office it is shown that a large percentage of the affidavits filed in support of claims for pension are signed and sworn to without being read over to affiants, and without their having a full and proper knowledge of the contents, though accompanied by a certificate of the magistrate before whom they are executed that the witnesses have been fully informed of the purport., 231796=The data in the following table comes from a variety of sources, and it's impossible to tell if all of them were referring to exactly the same facilities and residents, so it is imprecise. However, it probably is good enough to create a very general picture of nursing home utilization and expenditures in the mid-twentieth century. The explosion in utilization and costs that took place after FHA financial assistance for nursing home construction was made available in 1959 and again after Medicare and Medicaid were enacted in 1965 is obvious. Also note that the percentage of the cost borne by the federal government increased far more than that borne by state and local government. (IOM, NCHS, CMS), 799095=Besides the almshouse on Long Island there is a much smaller almshouse in Charlestown. This was opened in 1849 as the Charlestown almshouse, but on the annexation of that city to Boston in 1873 it was continued as a Boston poor-house more especially for pauper couples., 456923=Miss Emily McLaughlin, 1896, then took charge of the training school for the next nine years. Miss McLaughlin had served during the Spanish American War. When her country needed her again, she organized the nursing force for Unite 17 which did such faithful work during the World War., 718852=In 1868 these pensions were increased by two dollars per month for each minor child; and in 1886 the eight-dollar rate of widows, minors, and other pensionable dependents of enlisted men was increased to twelve dollars. Dependent relatives of soldiers, other than widows and children, were first pensioned under the act of July 14, 1862, which gave the mother, in case no widow or minor child survived, the same pension which a widow, had there been one, would have received; and a like provision was made for orphan minor sisters. Fathers and orphan brothers were included in similar legislation in 1866 and 1868. The dependence contemplated by these statutes might be partial only, but must have existed at the date of the soldiers death. Under the act of June 27, 1890, it is sufficient that a parent shall be in dependent circumstances at the time of applying for pension, without regard to his condition when the son died; but pension under this act begins at the date of filing the application, instead of from the soldiers death, as in cases established under former laws., 455696=During the forty-six years that Farrand has been training nurses, it has always stood for excellency and proficiency in nursing technic. The able women who have served as principals have left their stamp not on students alone, but on the nursing profession in the state. Many illustrious names in the field of nursing social welfare are to be found among the 1200 graduates from this school., 724157=In 1887 a like provision was made for survivors of the war with Mexico and their widows, sixty days service being required, or engagement in a battle, or honorable mention in a resolution of Congress. This was made applicable, however, only to persons who were or should become sixty-two years of age, or subject to any disability [not incurred while voluntarily abetting the late rebellion] or dependency equivalent to some cause prescribed or recognized by the pension laws of the United States as a sufficient cause for the allowance of a pension. This apparent restriction may seem to bring the law within our second class; but when it is remembered that persons who were twenty-three years old at the close of the Mexican war were sixty-two in 1887, it will be seen that the act granted practically a mere service pension. At any rate, such has been its effect in its administration., 348473=On April 28, 1919, the Flint Chamber of Commerce approved of the incorporation of the Women's Hospital Association, which took over the hospital and made plans for a new site and a larger building. Committee from the Rotary and Kiwanis Clubs, as well as from the Genesee County Medical Society, were active with the Chamber of Commerce in furthering the re-organization., 326818=1.

Joseph Mercy Hospital.\u00a0, 728451=All these checks were swept away by the arrears acts of 1879, which granted pension from the discharge or death of the soldier in all late war claims of the first class which had been or should thereafter be allowed, provided that application should be filed prior to July 1, 1880; otherwise, from the date of the application. This limitation was in turn removed with respect to the claims of widows in 1888. Service pensions, requiring little or no proof beyond that furnished by the official records, have been made to commence from the dates of the several acts by which they have been granted., 716946=In 1858 they were confirmed to widows for life or until re-marriage. In 1866 and 1868 widows whose right to pension accrued after the Revolution and prior to the rebellion were granted equal rates with those pensioned under acts passed since March 4, 1861., 395789=Crossing the bridge, we again entered the rear building, the basement of which is occupied by the kitchen, the store-room, stewards office, colored men's mess, and blind men's mess. Here, also, are the apartments in which the assistants and employees of the institution take their meals. The blind men have two waiters to attend to their wants and assist them; but beyond some help at table, they require no aid, but navigate the whole building, up stairs and down stairs, assisted only by a cane, with which they feel their way. Here we meet one of the most interesting of the blind men just coming from his dinner. It is Captain John Mewen, who in 1813, while belonging to the privateer Vengeance, of New York, assisted at the capture of twenty-one British vessels. Afterward he became the captain of an East Indiaman, and was for many years a prominent, successful, and well-known master of ships in the East India trade. But misfortunes overtook him; he lost his sight, and consequently became unable to follow his profession, and he is now a much-esteemed inmate of the Harbor. Passing from this building, we cross the grounds to the hospital, stopping on the way to have a look at the steam-laundry and bakery., 428843=Michigan felt the need of the nurse many years before she arrived. In a history of Detroit published in 1834, the lack of a sufficient number of nurses to care for the sick and for orphans was mentioned with regret. And later in that year, when the whole vicinity was suffering with cholera, Father Kundig organized a Catholic Female Association, whose members would devote their time to nursing as long as the community needed them. Even at the time of the Civil War, there were no trained nurses. There were a few hospitals in the state, but the care of the patients was intrusted to convalescents and hired men and women. The first University Hospital at Ann Arbor was built in 1869. The early records show that the male patients were cared for by the handy man about the hospital. Two practical nurses were employed to attend the women patients. Another hospital, at an early date, recorded that it was difficult to have all patients cared for properly. The hospital paid wages varying from $3.00 to $10.00 a week for practical nurses, but there was never any assurance that the new day would find a complete corps. The women employed were very unreliable and would resign their positions without notice. It is also recorded that the hired nurses were likely to neglect the disagreeable patients when caring for the kindly disposed was more congenial to them., 113193=The Committee on Economic Security reported to President Roosevelt in 1935 that one-third to one-half of the 7.5 million people age 65 or older in the country were dependent on either public assistance or help from their families, and that only a relatively small percentage of that group were receiving any help from the government. (Committee on Economic Security,1935)., 738452=In his report of 1876 Commissioner John A. Bentley presented a forcible indictment of the ex parte system, and recommended a plan by which testimony should be taken viva voce in all cases, and subjected to proper tests. A measure known as the sixty surgeons bill, embodying this recommendation, was introduced in Congress, but failed of passage. In 1878 he said, I am convinced that a great number of persons have been pensioned who have no just title, and that the number of that class is being constantly increased in the settlements which are now going on. In 1879 he presented a table showing that in 500 cases dropped from the rolls since July 1, 1876, there were 3084 false affidavits out of 4397 affidavits in all, and 92 forgeries. More than half a million dollars had been paid to these pensioners before the frauds were discovered. He said in 1880, The number of frauds discovered year after year, when it is considered that the attention of the office was attracted to them through accident or some suspicious circumstance, or by the statement of a volunteer informer, is very great, and renders it certain that but a very small percentage of the frauds committed come to the knowledge of the office., 1062111=After delivering papers for the Florida Times-Union and working for a while helping my father in the shops of the Florida Railway and Navigation Company, which later became the Jacksonville, Tampa and W., being the beginning of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in a later merger, I obtained a position with the S. B. Hubbard Hardware Company as an office boy on June 1, 1878. I was in the employ of this firm for fifty-five years, becoming President of the company upon the death of Mr. Hubbard in 1903., 317037=On June 26, 1914, the present site of the Henry Ford Hospital was deeded to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford. On September 15, 1915, the articles of incorporation for the Henry Ford Hospital were recorded with the Secretary of State at Lansing. Five days later Henry Ford and his wife deeded the property to the Henry Ford Hospital, Incorporated. The first meeting of the incorporators was held September 20, 1915, and a board of trustees was elected. Mr. Henry Ford was made president and Mr. Edsel Ford, his son, vice president., 352835=The American Medical Director for 1927 lists one hundred and seven cities and towns in the State of Michigan as having hospitals, sanatoriums and charitable institutions with hospital features, this not including State and Federal institutions.

These three center, 1062931=I was one of the founders in 1885 of the American Trust Company, later taken over by the Atlantic National Bank. I am still on the board of directors, also for another local bank, and have been one of the bond trustees of Duval County since 1890, including the St. Johns River bridge - too much responsibility for one of my age. I'll have to pass some of it to younger shoulders. And just look at this stack of unanswered letters! Six inches high. I have three secretaries at the store, but do not like to trouble them with my personal mail., 216211=Another event that occurred in 1965 was the passage of the Older Americans Act. This Act created the Administration on Aging; authorized grants to states for aging-related community planning, services programs, research, demonstration and training projects; and called for the development of State Units on Aging. This created what is now called the \"Aging Network\", a web of federal, state, and local agencies linked together to focus on social services and other programs primarily targeted to older adults living in their homes. The mission of the Aging Network was expanded in numerous ways in subsequent years, to include advocacy, meal programs, and a number of other services. Because of a lack of funding, many of the services developed long waiting lists, which limited the benefits to a relatively small proportion of the poorest elderly. Although the program had the potential to save the government money by providing more supportive services to people who wanted to remain in the community as a substitute for some of the nursing home costs, it never had the visibility or legislative urgency of Medicare and Medicaid.\u00a0, 719980=Pensions of the second class were first granted nearly thirty-five years after the close of the Revolution, by the act of March 18, 1818, which provided that every officer, soldier, sailor, and marine who served nine months in the Revolution, and who was or should become in need of assistance from his country for support, should be pensioned for life, officers at *20 per month, and enlisted men at $8. There was no further legislation of this general character until the act of June 27, 1890, which grants to the widow of every officer and enlisted man who served ninety days or more in the war of the rebellion a pension of $8 per month, with *2 additional for each child of the soldier under sixteen years of age, in case she is without other means of support than her daily labor. When the widow dies or remarries, the right survives to the minor children, as under former laws, and pension is continued during life to children who are insane, idiotic, or otherwise permanently helpless., 922369=\"In 1926 one law was added, that of Kentucky. In the same year, the Washington Legislature approved a bill, which was vetoed by the Governor., 329791=The war hospital was located near the site of the Central High School. Fountain Street, 1863. The troops were for a short time located on low ground near the river on the West Side, but soon moved to the Prospect Hill, the land the Union Benevolent Association lately occupied being part of the ground. The actual encampment with its cavalry occupied a large territory. Between six and seven thousand troops rendezvoused here., 109319=The restrictions were so severe and the number of states that actually had launched their plans and committed funds to them were so limited that even in 1935, in the depths of the Depression, there were less than 200,000 people covered under state old-age assistance plans. (Old Age Security Staff Report, 1934), 313167=The Henry Ford Hospital was visioned by a group of citizens and physicians who sensed the rapid growth that their city was passing through in the opening decade of the twentieth century, and foresaw the need for a larger hospital than any existing and one that should have the most up-to-date equipment. in 1909, a plat of twenty acres was purchased at West Grand Boulevard and Hamilton Avenue. Building operations began according to plans for a great general hospital, and two or three units were completed. Then the enterprise lagged under its own weight. Mr. Henry Ford took it over with some changes of plan, and the main building was ready for use not far from the time when the United States entered the World War. Mr. Ford handed it over to the government, and it became United States General Hospital in 1918. Thus it furnished a scene in the drama of nursing sick and wounded soldiers back to life, and of teaching disabled men some new way to earn a living. Fifteen hundred soldiers were care for. After their discharge, Mr. Ford resumed building operations. The hospital is remarked for its very complete equipment and for original features. It is a \"closed hospital\" in that the staff is attached to the institution and cares for all the patients. It has 548 beds and a high emergency capacity., 14623=One of the first acts of the new government in 1776 was to authorize pensions for disabled Revolutionary War veterans.\u00a0The initial military pension law offered half-pay for the rest of their lives to soldiers who were so disabled in the war that they were unable to work for a living.\u00a0The federal government and the states disagreed about who should pay for and administer the program. The federal government didn't have the authority to raise funds by taxation at that time, so they said that the pensions were to be administered and paid for by the states. The states didn't want to bear the cost and they refused to do anything, so the federal government took back responsibility. However, the newly-formed government hadn't yet created any organized system for accepting and paying pension claims. For several years, a separate act of Congress had to be voted on to appropriate funds for each individual that requested a pension, until, finally, a general appropriation was made in 1790, and a pension law was enacted in 1792., 308592=The twenty-first year of Grace Hospital, 1910, opened a period of much needed enlargement. Patients were being cared for to the number of 156 under sorely crowded conditions. An addition to front on Willis Avenue was projected, the Board of Trustees undertaking to raise $50,000 and appealing to friends to subscribe a like amount. An addition devoted to surgery was the result. Thereafter continuous expansion is discernable, although checked by the drain of the World War. The Merriam Memorial Branch, constructed in 1913 on West Grand Boulevard, added fifty beds to the 242 of the main hospital. An x-ray department was added in 1916; a radiotherapy department in 1922. Between 1917 and 1919, 163 of Grace Hospital personnel received leave of absence or resigned to answer the call of the government; seventy-seven physicians, seventy-four nurses and twelve employees, many of them serving overseas., 35519=\"In the decades after 1820, America turned with unprecedented enthusiasm and energy to the construction of custodial institutions for the poor, the insane, the orphan and the criminal. Institutionalization now became the first rather than the last resort. The institution and not the household became the preferred setting...Americans during these years also seem to have shared a confidence in the ability to design an environment and construct a setting in which these faults could be eliminated and the causes of dependency thus eradicated...And, understandably, with the beginnings of a factory system, the institutions built after 1820 were more influenced by and more nearly resembled the factory; whereas those built before 1820 more nearly resembled the household.\" (Abe Bortz, 1970), 1103569=Care of chronically ill persons in medical institutions is necessarily expensive. A needy person without \u00c2\u2018some additional resources can- not obtain satisfactory care with an assistance payment limited to $50 a month. In Connecticut in 1946, for example, the average cost of nursing-home care for the aged was $118 a month., 723247=In 1867 the additional annuity of $100 given to Revolutionary veterans in 1864 was extended to their widows, and in 1878 all widows of soldiers who served fourteen days in the Revolution or were in any engagement were pensioned at $8 per month. Twenty widows of this class were still on the roll at the close of the last fiscal year., 92086=More private companies were providing retirement programs. By 1910, Seager would write:, 116762=Although many people today only know about the Old Age Insurance (OAI) portion of the Social Security Act, in 1935, when the Act was passed, it was OAA that everyone was really interested in. Support for Old Age Insurance was much weaker, and President Franklin Roosevelt had to work hard to convince Congress that OAI was an important component of the Social Security Act.\u00a0One problem with the Old Age Insurance plan was that reserves had to be built up before they could begin paying benefits, and no OAI benefits were supposed to be paid before 1942.\u00a0, 215339=To counter the opposition in order to get the bill passed, all these concepts were incorporated into the legislation, and the 1965 amendments to the Social Security Act established the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Medicare Part A covered hospital costs, Part B was a voluntary program partially financed by premiums which covered physician and other out-of-hospital costs, and Kerr-Mills was converted to a program called 'Medicaid' to cover the indigent elderly., 903377=The New York survey was taken from Old Age Security Staff Report, Barbara Nachtried Armstrong and Staff, 1934, from unpublished studies by the staff of the Committee on Economic Security (CES), Volume II., 140570=The states welcomed the opportunity to share public assistance costs with the federal government and quickly jumped into the program. By 1940, every state had set up an Old Age Assistance program, and coverage increased until 22% of the age 65+ population were receiving OAA benefits averaging about $20 a month in 1940, where utilization leveled off. Somewhere between 2,000,000 and 2,200,000 people received OAA each year throughout the 1940's, representing about 23% of the age 65+ population by 1950.\u00a0, 485346=The school soon assumed a very important place in the community. It became a leader in the education of the nurse in Grand Rapids and throughout the state. Mrs. Susan Fisher Apted, a woman of superb ideals, untiring energy and great personal magnetism, was among its earlier superintendents. She exerted a very great influence over the school and inspired in her students a marked sense of devotion to duty and of the dignity of a nurse's work. Miss Elizabeth Flaws came to the hospital in 1905. She was a woman of remarkable executive ability and a strict disciplinarian. Those were the days when the duties of hospital superintendent and that of the training school were often combined in one. The hospital flourished as never before and the standards of the nurse's training were made more exacting and advanced steadily. During her regime, she raised the course from two to two and a half years. This was still inadequate, and the training was later increased to three years., 388679=In front of the main building is the marble monument erected over the remains of the founder, which were, in August, 1834, removed hither from their original place of internment., 244693=In spite of the looming problems with Medicare reimbursement, publicly-traded nursing home chains became one of the hottest things on Wall Street. Everyone viewed Medicare and Medicaid as a risk-free source of revenue that made this a business where no one could lose money. In 1966 there were only a few publicly-traded nursing home chains, by 1969 there were 58, and by 1970 there were 90. The best known were called the \"Fevered Fifty\", and they were promising investors returns of 20-25% a year. In many cases, they went public before they had even completed construction of their nursing homes, with prices at a huge premium to the rest of the market. The stock of the \"Fevered Fifty\" exploded in 1969 and 1970, then the bottom fell out by 1971, as reality set in., 155225=World War II halted construction and development of every kind, and by the end of the war, many buildings were badly in need of replacement or modernization. The national health insurance program that was being discussed highlighted the poor quality of the nation's healthcare infrastructure, which could only be improved by devoting significant funds to the construction and modernization of hospitals. During the high-profile controversy over national health insurance, Senators Joseph Lister Hill of Alabama and Harold Burton of Ohio quietly carved out hospital construction financing into a separate bill, and introduced the Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946 (commonly called the Hill-Burton Act). Compared to the high cost of national healthcare insurance, the Hill-Burton Act seemed relatively risk-free and inexpensive, and it passed with little fanfare., 722368=An additional stipend of $100 a year, granted in 1864, completed the measure of the nation's bounty to the boys of 76. The last Revolutionary soldier borne upon the pension roll died in 1869., 482360=The School of Nursing connected with the Woman's Hospital of Saginaw was established in 1889. The need for trained women to carry on the work of the hospital was recognized by the altruistic women who founded the Woman's Hospital Association under the presidency of Mr. J. W. Freeman. The association found that it was impossible to supply this need. They decided to answer the difficulty by establishing their own training school for nurses. The school first offered two-year course. This grew into a three-year course. At the present time, in order that the student nurses may receive training in all the services, the school has formed an affiliation with larger hospitals. The class work is organized to meet the requirements of the standard curriculum which the State Board of Registration of Nurses and Trained Attendants recommends., 436364=The length of time spent in training has increased. At first some of the courses were but six months long, others as long as eighteen months. But by 1900 all of the better schools of nursing gave a training of at least two years. The law limits the course to a minimum of two years; at present, all but five of the schools offer three year courses. Three of these schools affiliated with the State University or colleges combine in five year courses, and graduates obtain a Bachelor of Science degree. The five training schools with courses less than three years exceed the minimum two years by six months., 151413=Public interest in national health insurance began to increase during the 1940's, although it would be another 20 years before the Medicare program would finally pass the legislature. The first salvo occurred during the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt. The Social Security Board drafted a bill which was introduced in 1943, by Senator Wagner and Senator James Murray of Montana and Representative John Dingell of Michigan. Historian Peter Corning says,\u00a0, 715919=But the system of pensions to widows and orphans really began under the act of June 7,1794, which gave a half-pay pension for five years to widows, or, if no widow survived, to the children under sixteen years of age of officers who should thereafter die of wounds while still in the service., 895519=Bruce Vladeck estimated that by 1930 there were as many elderly people in facilities for the mentally ill as there were in poorhouses and voluntary and charitable facilities combined. If his estimates are accurate, about half of the total elderly population living in an institution in the early 1900's may have had some sort of mental disease or condition, about the same ratio as we see in nursing homes and assisted living facilities today., 712797=No important changes were made in the invalid pension laws until the act of July 14, 1862, which provided that all officers and enlisted men disabled since March 4, 1861, by reason of any wound received, or disease contracted while in the service of the United States and in the line of duty, should receive pension proportionate to the degree of their disabilities, the highest rate for total disability being fixed at $30 per month for lieutenant-colonels and all officers of higher rank in the army and marine corps, and captains and other officers of corresponding degree in the navy; and at gradually decreasing sums for lesser officers, down to $8 per month for enlisted men., 113644=By 1935, a majority of legislators agreed that a federal program for old-age pensions and welfare was required, to help the individuals in need, to stimulate the depressed economy by getting cash into the hands of citizens, and to \"retire\" older workers without impoverishing them in order to make their jobs available to younger people., 351334=The Sisters are soon the to be rewarded for their wonderful work, as a fine new hospital is at present (May, 1928) contemplated., 271637=This graph shows the dramatic decline in fertility rates since 1800, as demonstrated by data compiled in the American History Files (myhistory.org), an initiative of the National Endowment for the Humanities. This data reflects the decline in the size of families over time., 657302=It is estimated that there were 289,715 men engaged in the Revolutionary War, 527,654 in the War of 1812, 100,460 in the Mexican War, and 2,780,176 in the War of the Rebellion., 471675=The early classes were asked to supply themselves with suitable dresses and aprons. This permitted an interesting assortment. One young lady appeared for duty in a lovely Paisley-patterned calico gown with a modish train. By 1893, a uniform was adopted that controlled the personal tastes somewhat, leaving the individuality to assert itself only in the matter of the size of the bow on the apron. It developed that the larger the bow, the more confidence the nurse felt in her own appearance. The detailed regularity of the trim uniform of today leaves no chance for the display of rivalry among the wearers., 782026=John J. ORourke. Born in Charlestown, 1863. His father at one time paid taxes on real estate. Is a teamster, intemperate. Left his wife about eight years ago on account of her intemperate habits. Has never had to be aided before. Was at Deer Island in September, 1897. Needs medical treatment., 946257=\"During our third year of married life in 1925, a son was born to us. He was named Henry in honor of my father-in-law. A few months previous to the birth of our son, my wife gave up her job in the factory, but as I had had a promotion to 'warp-starter' and was making $50 a week we were able to continue saving $20 every week. The next year we became the parents of a daughter, whom we named Marie. From this time on I was unable to save $20 a week but put in the bank some money every payday. After the birth of our second son, Homer, in 1927, my wife became ill and needed medical attention. Because of this I was unable to save any money, for the Doctor's bills used up whatever surplus money we had., 469955=The school was opened in 1886. It was named the Marian Louise Withey School of Nursing. Entrance was granted to young women who could furnish references as to excellent health and good character, who were between 25 and 35, and who had had a common school education. Preference was shown to applicants with experience in general house work. Five candidates could meet all of these, qualifications, and were accepted for the first class. During the first year, however, the number was raised to nine. From the very beginning of the Marian L. Withey School, more applications for entrance have been made each year than could be accepted, and the school has always been able to choose its students., 479364=The Newberry Training School for Nurses--now the Grace Hospital School for Nurses--was established in 1889, in connection with Grace Hospital, Dr. W. L. Babcock and Dr. Stephen H. Knight were active in these early days in stimulating interest in the project. A committee composed of Mrs. Helen Handy Newberry, Mrs. Helen Joy, Mr. Truman H. Newberry, Mr. John S. Newberry and Mr. Eldridge M. Fowler made it possible for the school to be instituted., 643396=6 The weekly premiums now required range from 14 pfennigs (3 1/2 cents) for the lowest grade of wage earners to 36 pfennigs (9 cents) for the highest. As the insurance begins at 16 and continues to 70, it would be necessary, in the normal case, to affix the stamps 2508 times., 797984=Dr. L. F. Wentworth, the superintendent, although still a young man, has had considerable and varied institutional experience. Before coming to Long Island he had been assistant physician at the Brattleboro, Vermont, insane asylum, assistant superintendent of the state insane asylum, Topeka, Kansas, superintendent of the state insane asylum at Osawatomie, Kansas, and in the service of the Massachusetts state board of lunacy and charity. He entered upon the duties of his present position in April, 1897., 50830=\"The home is comprised of 24 residential cottages; Memorial Hall, a community building; an infirmary; an engine house; a water tower and an entrance gate. Designed in 1889, the water tower served as the centerpiece of a model waterworks system, and the spacious, landscaped grounds exemplified suburban planning ideals of the 19th century...Enston specified that the complex be comprised of neat and convenient two-story brick cottages with at least eight acres of land. He also stipulated that potential residents be the old and sick, from 45 to 75 years old, of 'good honest character,' and not suffering from 'lunacy'.\" (National Park Service), 923335=\"From 1929 on, the trend in the pension legislation has been toward making the adoption of the old age assistance systems mandatory upon the counties. This type of legislation proved much more effective, especially when it was accompanied by a provision by which the state shared in the expense of the county. Of this latter type was the California law which was passed in 1929. In the same year, Minnesota, Utah and Wyoming passed laws, which did not provide such state assistance, although those of Utah and Wyoming made the adoption of the system mandatory upon the counties., 650958=The William Enston Home is an early example of a planned community for the elderly. Developed in the late 19th century, the home is comprised of 24 residential cottages; Memorial Hall, a community building; an infirmary; an engine house; a water tower and an entrance gate. Designed in 1889, the water tower served as the centerpiece of a model waterworks system, and the spacious, landscaped grounds exemplified suburban planning ideals of the 19th century. The buildings also constitute a significant collection of Romanesque Revival architecture, a style rare in Charleston., 286323=* Annexed to New York in 1898 ** Annexed to Philadelphia in 1854, 754843=1901 - IOOF brother Arthur G. Bobcox, a landscape architect of Cleveland, prepared a landscape plan for the grounds around the house. A subscription plan of selling coin-tokens among the various lodges to raise money to implement the plan was not successful. It is not recorded if any of the original plan was carried out, but in 1902, the Wade Park Lodge of Cleveland did plant trees and flower beds on the grounds., 904429=Summary: Tables showing the changes in expected remaining years of life at birth, age 65, and age 85 for black and white men and women from 1900 to the year 2000., 102724=Family life and working conditions drastically changed during the Great Depression. Nearly half of the working age population became unemployed in some parts of the country. Even young, healthy people lost their jobs and watched their savings dry up. (Federal Writer's Project, 1938)\u00a0President Roosevelt quickly initiated numerous Federal Emergency Relief (FERA) programs after his election, and his Committee on Economic Security estimated that by the end of 1934 there were 750,000 single persons and 4.2 million families receiving some sort of emergency relief. Counting all the members of the affected families, nearly 19 million people, 15% of the total population, were dependent on FERA programs. (Committee on Economic Security,1935), 538639=The West probably treats her pauper lunatics decently, so far as food and clothing go; otherwise, the States without Boards of Charities seem to be doing much as the States with boards were doing ten years ago. The South does no better. In the States where the paupers are boarded out, and auctioned off to the lowest bidder, the insane, as may be supposed, are not desired at any price. Their place is not the almshouse, but the jail. Of their fate I say nothing; but it is sufficiently dreadful. The others lie and die in corners, tended or untended by the few private families willing to have them about. Where there are almshouses, these miserable beings go to them. What the almshouses are we can only judge from the reports of the State of Maryland, the single Southern State which has systematically investigated the matter. In 1877 John Lee Carroll, then governor, ordered an inspection of the Maryland public institutions, particularly with reference to their sanitary condition and treatment of the inmates, and the number of the pauper insane who are confined therein at the public expense. The man selected for this arduous and delicate task was the secretary of the Board of Health, Dr. C. W. Chancellor, and he seems to have performed his duties thoroughly and fearlessly. His report revealed a state of things in the almshouses which appalled the very county supervisors. Most of his pages cannot be quoted. I shall try only to give a feeble notion of what he saw, leaving the rest to the readers imagination. He saw everywhere men and women handcuffed, bound, and chained to the floor; he saw rooms filled with lunatics, weeping, howling, and dancing, unrestrained; he saw the sane and insane men and women all crowded together in the same noisome den; he saw their children deformed in mind and body; he saw, by the light of a candle which, in the broad daylight, he was obliged to use in order to see at all, a haggard, half-clothed woman crouching in the corner of a room so filthy that when the door was opened he staggered back, half fainting. Speaking of the almshouses as a whole, Dr. Chancellor said, In most of these places cleanliness is an unknown luxury; all is filth and misery, and the most degrading, unrelieved suffering. The inmates, sane and insane, were found, in many instances, huddled together without discrimination of age, sex, or condition, . . . with results shocking to all sense of humanity. And he thus described the condition of the insane: \"There are now within the almshouses and jails of our State five hundred insane and idiotic people, who are utterly cast down, neglected, half fed, and ghastly in their wretchedness. A few figures will speak more plainly than words. Maryland has twenty almshouses. Only six of these, in 1877, appeared to be kept with any regard to cleanliness; and two of the six had colored departments, in disgraceful order. More than three fourths of the almshouses were old, dilapidated, and so constructed that any classification of the inmates was out of the question. Thirteen houses kept children whose parents were insane, and whose birth was directly owing to the States neglect; indeed, there were only three almshouses quite free from abuses of this shameful character.\", 925248=\"By the end of 1934, twenty-eight states and two territories had passes old age assistance laws.\", 241395=The Moss Committee was back in business. They held 30 hearings from 1969 to 1970 on nursing home issues, and accumulated thousands of pages of testimony., 552979=Inasmuch as a frightful chasm lies between that position where a man is sustained by those resources of industry, thrift, affection, and esteem which centre legitimately in himself, and that wherein these are all dried up and public relief takes their place, the attention of social economists has long been directed towards the danger of offering facilities for crossing the chasm to those who are tempted to take the step by the pressure of poverty, a danger which is enhanced by the fact that the temptation appeals to those who have the fewest safeguards of intelligence and self respect. It is widely felt that public charity does present such facilities, and that it is a source of corruption, unless accompanied by provisions for restricting it to unavoidable suffering. Some of the humanest spirits, who have sacrificed themselves without reservation to charitable labors, even sympathetic women, through the secret chambers of whose heart the cry of pain went vibrating like a trumpet-blast from heaven, summoning them to duty, have regarded the prodigal relief of the present day as a source of no less mischief than intemperance. This opinion stands on record in a most emphatic way. Lord Grey's reform of the English poor law in 1834 was preceded by the most thorough scrutiny ever made of the pauper system of that country, by a parliamentary commission. It resulted in the creation of a national board of commissioners, who were to give effect to the changes deemed necessary. After several years experience, in the midst of a succession of bad harvests, and when the accompanying pressure of disordered markets had spread distress over the whole realm, the commissioners said, in their report to Parliament in 1839, all poor laws are in their essence impolitic and uncalled for, and that, consequently, their abolition ought to he the ultimate object of any changes that may be made, an object, however, that cannot be attained without being preceded by several years of careful preparation for it.\u00a0, 213460=The Senate created the Special Committee on Aging in 1961, chaired by Senator Frank Moss, and they began to hold hearings on nursing home problems. The Moss Committee hearings in 1965 documented a huge lack of consistency in state nursing home standards and enforcement efforts, but they expressed caution about increasing enforcement because that meant closing facilities, which were already in short supply. They were concerned that there would be no place to put the dispossessed patients., 405628=As I left I was accompaied to the gate by an old veteran, who told me that his, name was John Perz, and that he had been captured and taken to England a prisoner in 1814 by the British ship of the line Elizabeth, of seventy-four guns; and just us I got outside the gate somebody seized my hand and said, \"Thank you, Sir, thank you; much obliged, Sir!\" and turning round I beheld my friend of the morning on his two stumps, in company with the delinquent Jack Stubbs, who held his hat in his hand, looking somewhat sheep-faced, and staring at the knob at the end of his wooden leg. The governor had kept his promise: he was outside the iron railing, and consequently no longer tabooed., 456103=Mrs. Gretter was interested in every progressive movement in nursing. She contributed in a large way to many branches of the service. Her ideals for the nurse are expressed in the Florence Nightingale Pledge, which was written by her and her Committee on Nursing Education for the class of 1893. Because it expresses superior ideals for women entering the nursing profession, the pledge has been adopted by other training schools. Hundreds of young nurses have agreed to the covenants of the pledge on commencement days., 24913=Older women were far more likely than older men to be unmarried (whether they were widowed, divorced, or never married). Only about one-third of age 65+ women were married in 1880, less than half the percentage of age 65+ men who were married. Although their life expectancies weren't much longer than men's, most women married men who were much older than themselves, so they often out-lived their husbands. Older unmarried women largely had to rely on children and other family members for help, and often ended up living with them. 10% of married women and nearly 60% of unmarried women age 65 or older were living with children or other family members as dependents in 1890. (Costa, 1997), 299989=The State of Michigan had its share in the hospital drama of the Civil War; and the principal scene was enacted at Detroit. The most important was staged on a plat of ground on the west side of Woodward Avenue, where Martin Place was later cut through to John R. Street. The federal government co\u00c3\u00b6perated with the newly incorporated trustee of Harper Hospital in making provision for the soldier sick who were returning from the front wounded and invalided. The hospital corporation purchased this land, which had joined their holdings by gift of N. Martin. At the government expense a large wooden building, supported on either side by a line of cottages, was erected on the Woodward Avenue front for a military hospital. When hostilities were over, the government conveyed these building to the Harper trustees, on condition that invalided soldiers should be cared for at local expense. Arrangements were also made between the hospital management and the local United States Sanitary Commission, whereby that society, noble forerunner of the numerous relief agencies of the World War, paid over to the hospital its final fund amounting to about $6,000, and gave over the care of all sick and needy ex-soldiers who might come into its hands. Although the hospital opened for general patients on New Year's day, 1866, its first beneficiaries were twenty ex-service men received from the Soldiers Home in the Arsenal Building at the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Main Street. This initial work of Harper Hospital was protracted over the period of a generation. Among the soldiers' records preserved in the Burton Historical Library there are two massive volumes of medical prescriptions issued during the years 1864 to 1868 which probably throw upon present practice in medication the highlight of contrast., 203846=Interest was growing in creating a national health insurance program to help Social Security beneficiaries pay their medical costs because medical costs were increasing far faster than other costs. Retired people were particularly at risk because many weren't covered under the employer health insurance plans which had become more widely available since the debate on national health insurance had begun in the 1940's. President John F. Kennedy strongly supported legislation to create such a program, but the debate was highly charged. (Kennedy's interest in the subject apparently grew after his father had a stroke which resulted in enormous medical bills which Kennedy realized most seniors would have been unable to pay.) The concept of national health insurance was opposed by the insurance industry, the American Medical Association, most members of the Republican party and some members of the Democratic party. As a compromise, opponents agreed to support a program to pay for more of the medical costs for the indigent elderly, and in 1960 the medical assistance component of the OAA program (the \"vendor payment\" program) was replaced with a new program called Medical Assistance for the Aged (MAA), or \"Kerr-Mills\", 315060=In 1911 ground was broken for the first building unit. As was the experience of many public enterprises at that time, enthusiasm lagged and subscriptions did not prove sufficient to carry the project through. The foundation of the building remained unfinished for eighteen months. In 1914 it was suggested that the City of Detroit take over the entire project. In June of the same year Mr. Henry Ford wrote to the trustees of the association as follows:\u00a0, 656151=In 1814, after the close of the War of 1812, the whole amount paid to army pensioners was $90,164.36. There is no tabulated statement attainable, showing the actual sum paid in pensions on account of this war, until the year 1871, when pensions were granted to all who had served sixty days. From that date up to 1888, 60,670 claims had been allowed. The disbursements have decreased from $2,313,409.47 in 1872 to $1,670,264.44 in 1888., 564099=How exactly this brief account is paralleled by our American States! New York, for example, by a statute which Mr. Low thinks to be as nearly perfect as can be, but which, unhappily, has been much disregarded, restricts out-door relief, to quote Mr. Lows words again, to persons not in a condition to be removed to the poor-house, and in cases where the disability is likely to be temporary. So distinct is this provision that the city of Brooklyn was impelled in 1878 to withhold its customary appropriations for out-door relief, and with what results will be told further on. Here, then, is English experience repeated. An excellent repressive law is neglected; an unlawful system of inadequate doles to the lucky is set up ; in self-defence a barrier is erected against the depletion of the public treasury by excluding, without discrimination between need and mere greedy clamor, half the claimants of relief. Then voluntary charity steps in, and creates a confusion amenable to no method or discipline. Divided among a hundred practically irresponsible organizations, and flowing from thousands of hands, guided by neither experience nor information, the generosity of men, conscientious enough to give but not to befriend, engulfs the poor in stronger temptations to pauper life., 298559=The beginnings of Providence Hospital, West Grand Boulevard, are inseparable from the House of Providence for destitute children and unfortunate women, opened by the Sister of Charity in 1869. This home was originally on Fourteenth Street, between Dazelle and Marantette. The institution was incorporated in 1872. Out of it has grown the largest Roman Catholic Hospital in the state. It has 475 beds, and compares favorably in equipment and service with the best hospitals of Detroit., 238274=In 1967, the \"Moss Amendments\" were passed to authorize HEW to standardize the regulations for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and to withhold funding from nursing homes that did not meet those standards. Regulations were added requiring nursing homes to meet the life safety code of the National Fire Protection Association, and requiring skilled nursing facilities to have at least one full-time Registered Nurse (RN) on staff. For the first time, nursing homes were compelled by federal law to disclose their ownership and all financial interests, to make it easier to identify fraud and abuse., 165593=Home care had never really received much consideration as an alternative to institutionalization. Private duty nurses had provided for wealthier individuals in their homes since the late 1800's, but served only those who could afford the cost of highly individual in-home care. The visiting nurse associations and public health nurses who were available to the poor had been focusing their efforts not on care for the elderly but on health education, disease prevention, and pregnancy. By the 1940's, infant mortality rates had dropped dramatically, hospital care had improved, and patients began to look to medical facilities as the preferred sites for receiving medical care and education. As the cost of salaries and medical technology increased, it was also more cost-effective to ask patients to come to the medical professionals rather than the other way around. Since that was where the jobs were, most nurses began working for hospitals or physicians. By 1952, Metropolitan Life discontinued the visiting nurse program they launched in 1909 and the home care industry floundered with little funding and no clear sense of direction., 448301=Since 1880, when some kind of training was first offered in Michigan to persons who wished to care for the sick, many training schools have sprung into existence, some to weather the difficulties that beset them and others to fall by the wayside. Every hospital that offered a nurse's training contributed to the rise of the nursing profession in Michigan. When a hospital discontinued its training school, either because of the force of circumstances or for other reasons that seemed desirable, it did not withdraw from active its graduates who were already raising the standards in the field of nursing. Nor was the influence which the school initiated during its existence completely lost when it no longer accepted students. Such a training school as the one connected with the Homeopathic Hospital of the State University was a pioneer in advancing nursing education. The Lockwood Hospital and Deaconess Home in Petoskey offered one of the first training schools in that section of Michigan. The nursing school at the Ann Arbor Private Hospital was disbanded when progress in the educational program and the facilities of the University Hospital School for Nurses made it possible for it to care for all the student nurses in the vicinity of Ann Arbor. Dr. Reuben Peterson and Miss Fantine Pemberton, the two persons who organized the Ann Arbor Private Hospital Training School for Nurses, were very active in developing a program for nursing education for the University training school. The training schools connected with the Paulina Stearns Hospital in Ludington, St. Joseph's Hospital in Menominee, and the Samaritan Hospital in Detroit were discontinued in 1923, after years of successful teaching. Unstable economic conditions caused the Calumet and Hecla Hospital of Calumet to dispense with its training school. The Newberry State Hospital stopped giving nurses' training after 1921. Today, along with six other hospitals, it offers a course for the training of attendants. This brief mention of those schools which have gone out of existence as such, and not live only in the lives of the nurses who were influenced by them, does not begin to evaluate their service. No more will be said of them, however. In the following pages only schools recognized by the State Board of Registration of Nurses and Trained Attendants in 1929 will be included. The schools will be considered in chronological order. Whenever possible, the oldest schools will receive special mention because they \"blazed the trail\" for the training schools that followed., 1072005=Next year Eugene, the oldest boy, will be sixteen and he will go into the mill to help support the family. Elvira is terribly proud of her children and she is ambitious for them. She will not let the two younger ones go to the mill grammar school although it is closer. They go to the school downtown. She sees to it, too, that they look as nice as any other children there. Her ten year old daughter, Helen, has a permanent and her nails are expertly polished by a neighbor. Helen is the pride of her mother's life. Besides being \"primpy,\" she can cook, wash, and housekeep as good as a grown up., 167500=Two years later, in 1950, amendments to the Social Security Act said, \"[The] Federal Government will share in cost of payments made directly to medical practitioners and other suppliers of medical services, which when added to any money paid to the individual, does not exceed the monthly maximums on individual payments.\" This created a significant change in the way that welfare was delivered and paid for. Nursing home operators could now contract directly with the states for payment, providing nursing homes with a new and more reliable source of income. Individuals were more time-consuming to deal with, and they didn't always pay their bills. The check from the government was one a nursing home could count on.\u00a0, 95801=Source: Vladeck, 1980; Johnson, 1985, 520975=Two other classes of paupers were noticeable in the almshouse which I have described, the insane and the children. With the insane I group the feeble-minded and the epileptic. It is difficult to describe the way in which we treat our insane paupers, because the plainest recital of facts would seem to accuse almshouse officers of revolting barbarity. Yet, in most cases, ignorance and fear are their worst faults. Often the almshouse keeper is forced to use harsh measures, because he has not enough assistants to be gentle. \"I don't want to shut them up,\" is the keepers indignant plea, \"I don't want to chain them; but I cant have them running round the yard naked, or tearing things to pieces, or pitching into people! I don't want to be killed, and I don't want anybody else killed!\" Meanwhile, his superiors, the superintendents, or, more often, the county supervisors, have plenty of other work, and take his word for the necessity of chains and dungeons. No public interest spurs the wits of either keeper or superintendent into devising better methods. And thus, within the present century, as almshouses multiplied, there grew up a tradition of torture, if one may so phrase it, a belief that the only proper treatment of a lunatic was restraint, and that the one indispensable quality of restraint was completeness; so clubs, whips, straps, darkness, and starvation supplemented chains and bolts as means to keep lunatics quiet. The rough-and-ready modes of dealing with the insane practiced in the Illinois almshouse which I have mentioned are but mild expressions of the average almshouse theory. The Boards of Charities, at the outset, found a state of things which belong to the Middle Ages. Let me give a few extracts from the early reports, dating back, however, no farther than 1873 :, 138840=A number of amendments to the Social Security Act increased both the cap on Old Age Assistance payments and the percentage of OAA that was paid for by the federal government. The cap on the total combined payment that was eligible for a federal match increased from $30 a month to $50 a month, and the maximum federal share of the payment increased from 50% to 60% from 1936 to 1948. (Advisory Council Report, 1948), 347572=The Women's Hospital, Flint, Michigan, was founded in 1917 by a woman physician, Dr. Lucy Elliott, whose life dream it was to provide special hospital services for women and children., 732149=But another group of pensioners is being added to the rolls under this act, those who are not in needy circumstances, and whose disabilities are not even colorably due to military service. On what principle are these pensioned for their disabilities? If from gratitude, why discriminate in rates ac- cording to the degree of the disability? Would not length or character of service be the proper criterion? If the well-to-do business man, who served ninety days in the commissary department, sustains today a serious and permanent injury while exercising his favorite horses, why should he receive an expression of public gratitude, if he choose to ask for it, to which he would have had no title yesterday? And why should he have $12 per month, while his coachman, who served four years at the front, injured in the same accident, but only half so severely, can get but $6? One year after the passage of the act of June 27, 1890, 391,431 invalid claims had been filed under its provisions, of which 236,362 were in lieu of pensions or applications under previous laws, the remaining 155,069 coming from new claimants. How many of these claims have been made by men who are far from indigent, and whose disabilities are in no wise due to service in the army or navy, let the reader judge from his own observation., 28076=One way to control cost and deter use was by segregating the poor. New York City purchased Blackwell's Island (now called Roosevelt Island) in 1828 as a remote spot for their paupers. On Blackwell's Island they built a penitentiary for criminals, men's and women's almshouses for the poor elderly, hospitals for those who were poor and ill (Charity Hospital, Smallpox Hospital, and the Hospital for Incurables), a workhouse for the able-bodied poor, and a lunatic asylum for the poor who were mentally-ill. (NYC Corrections History), 309510=Following a survey of hospital capacity in Detroit after the World War, the trustees of Grace formulated a program of enlargement in terms of $1,000,000, contemplating three major units and two minor constructions. Two of the proposed additions have been realized, the larger one being a building for the out-patient department occupied in 1926, when the Board received its program as including a private patient's unit, home for nurses and home for staff and employees, all to be erected at the main hospital site; also a new main building on the west side to replace the Merriam Memorial Branch. Thanks to generous endowments, the charity work of Grace Hospital has kept pace with its general expenses. In 1925, of all the patients received, 24.2 per cent paid the full cost of care; 63.9 per cent were part pay patients; and 11.9 per cent were city, county and charity patients treated without personal charge to such patients. Eleven hundred and fifty-two were treated free; and in so doing the hospital expended $65,000. An increase was noted in the number of colored applicants for both out-patient and hospitalization. The most shining contribution of personal service to Grace Hospital is the long and distinguished career of Dr. Oscar LeSeure, for many years chairman both of the attending staff and of the executive committee., 319526=In January, 1920, the second influenza epidemic arrived, and 300 emergency beds were made available for the city. The main hospital was opened in December, 1921, with a completely equipped diagnostic clinic, staff and 450 bed capacity., 241192=In 1966, the Joint Commission on Health Care Organizations (JCAHO), an organization long known for accrediting hospitals, created their first accreditation program for nursing homes.\u00a0, 214342=Although President Kennedy had not been able to get majority support for a national health insurance program while he was alive, after he was assassinated the programs he had been espousing took on new life. Lyndon Johnson ran for President in 1964 promising to implement Kennedy's plans, and won by a landslide, convincing many opponents that Medicare had overwhelming public support., 344436=On Wednesday evening, October 24, 1928, the Merliss Brown Auditorium of Hurley Hospital was officially dedicated and turned over to the Genesee County Medical Society. The Auditorium is built as an integral part of the hospital. Architecturally it conforms to the regular theater style, with a suitable for speakers and a seating capacity of three hundred. The acoustics are exceptionally good. Very infrequently does one find such perfect ventilation, the air remaining clear and fresh. The decorations are subdued and in excellent taste. The sidewalls are paneled in antique oak for a height of about eight feet; above this the walls are stippled in a warm brown; overhead the ceiling is beamed and richly decorated with conventional design done in blue, red, and gold. The lighting fixture are very decorative and unique, in that ample light has been provided without glare. Comfortable upholstered seats have been purchased with funds raised by voluntary subscriptions from members of the county medical society., 1109413=Summary: Statistics on nursing home usage and costs from 1950-1970., 898930=A staff report prepared for the committee that studied old age security in 1935 relied on a few reports done in individual states. One of the more comprehensive surveys was done in New York just prior to the 1929 stock market crash. It determined that 50% or more of the age 65+ population was dependent on relatives or friends (either living with them or getting financial assistance from them to live somewhere else), 2.5% were living in poorhouses or mental hospitals, and 1-2% were living in private homes for the aged. If those percentages were representative of the national experience, that would mean that about 175,000 people age 65 or older were living in poorhouses or mental hospitals and 70,000 were living in nonprofit or proprietary homes. Note that a significant number were self-sufficient because they were still working., 356279=Sometime afterwards Thomas Dixon, architect, supplied general drawings. In July of 1840 a number of carpenters submitted bids for construction. L.G. Shipley estimated the total cost as $15,240, and was willing to do the carpenters work at a deduction of 55% from the standard measurement prices, and also donate $225 to the Society., 3885=Before 1800, less than 5% of the U.S. population lived in cities. Everyone else resided in rural areas where extended families could live together easily and cheaply. Generally, people worked for themselves. As a 1937 Social Security pamphlet described it, \"The home of a pioneer family was a little world in itself. Members of the family were their own farm and factory workers, butchers, bakers, and barbers; policemen and firemen; often their own doctors and nurses, and sometimes their own teachers as well.\" (Social Security, 1937) You didn't need cash to survive in that economy, and families were fairly self-sufficient., 721261=In 1783, at the instance of the officers of General Washington's army, this half-pay for life was commuted to full pay for five years., 239324=The 1967 amendments also created a new category of nursing home, called Intermediate Care Facilities (ICF) for facilities which cared for residents that did not need 24-hour-a-day nursing services, but who needed custodial care. The definition of an ICF was not clear, and states began using it as a catch-all for any nursing home unable to meet other standards, in order to get a federal match on their expenditures. HEW tried to create standards, but finally withdrew their proposed ICF regulations when the states protested, and the ICF category remained in limbo until 1971, when ICF standards were finally agreed on and included in Medicaid., 20391=In 1800, the largest cities in the country were all in the original 13 colonies. By 1850, some of the \"gateways\" to the West, like Cincinnati, St. Louis, and New Orleans, overtook the eastern cities as the largest cities in the country. By 1900, the Midwest had become quite settled and many of the largest cities in the country were in the Midwest.\u00a0(Largest U.S. Cities)\u00a0(Population Percentage by Region), 434404=Since the organization of the Michigan State Board of Registration of Nurses in 1910, there has been a greater uniformity in the courses offered in the choice of subject matter in the training schools throughout the state. The entrance age limit is now defined to be eighteen by law, but there are still training schools that refuse entrance to those so young. The Farrand Training School of Harper Hospital requires that the applicant be at least nineteen. Michigan law also demands that the applicant shall have completed the tenth grade before entering a training school. In this respect, again, Michigan training schools show some variation. Although no accredited school enters a student with less than two years of high school, several schools expect three and four years. The training schools in connection with the following hospitals demand the completion of high school before a pupil is accepted: University Hospital, Ann Arbor; St. Joseph's Hospital, Ann Arbor; Harper Hospital, Detroit; Children's Free Hospital Detroit; Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit; Battle Creek Sanitarium and Hospital, Battle Creek; Mercy Hospital, Grayling; St. Luke's Hospital, Marquette; Hackley Hospital, Muskegon; Edward W. Sparrow Hospital, Lansing; Blodgett Memorial Hospital, Grand Rapids; and St. Mary's Hospital, Grand Rapids. At the present time, regardless of the legal requirements, student nurses themselves realize the value of good preparation, and most of them enter the training school only after the completion of a high school course. The State Board of Registration of Nurses, in going over its files for 1929, found that 79.8 per cent of the nurses applying for registration had a high school diploma. Only 15.6 per cent of the nurses seeking registration were adhering to the minimum requirements. The State Board, also, finds that each year shows an increasing number of graduate nurses who have had a partial or complete college course., 1020172=It will therefore be necessary to close this meeting at 4:20 so that those belonging to the Council can leave., 301825=The beginnings of Harper Hospital have a surpassing tinge of eccentric romance. In 1831, when the Jackson administration was furnishing names for counties and towns in Territorial Michigan, Walter Harper, in his boyhood an Irish immigrant, came from Philadelphia to Detroit. There came with him as an upper domestic servant Mrs. Ann Martin, a young widow. She had suffered a broken life and a distracted mind for the death of her little girl in a Roman Catholic convent; and seems to have come west along with her employer at the urge of her mother, who feared some active violence against those whom she held responsible. Both Harper and Mrs. Martin acquired land at Detroit and in the environs. The woman derived the small sums she had to invest from a huckstering trade in vegetables, poultry and game that she carried on in a stall at the old city market at the upper end of Woodward Avenue; also delivering her wares at certain business places where her epicurean patrons were employed. Walter Harper died in 1867, and \"Nancy\" Martin in 1875. Her crowning active philanthropy reveals her a noble soul, although in an exterior that classes her with the very rough diamonds. In the year 1859, by Walter Harper's deed bearing date of February 3, and Ann Martin's deed of March 10, their realty was conveyed to trustees to be used for the erection and maintenance of a Protestant charity hospital. Rev. George Duffield, Dr. George Russel, Alexander C. McGraw, Jacob S. Farrand, Buckminister White, Frederick Buhl and David Cooper were the parties of the second part. Rev. George Duffield, for thirty years pastor of the First Presbyterian Church at Detroit, had inspired Harper with the idea, and Mrs. Martin chose to supplement with all her wordly goods the philanthropy of her long standing benefactor. The hospital was named for the man; the trustees so incorporated May 4, 1863. \"Nancy\" Martin had been honored in the naming of the street cut from Woodward Avenue to John R. Street. The Civil War contact of the Harper trustees with the United States government had resulted in the conveyance of an outfit of cheaply erected wooden buildings. These served as the principal hospital plant until 1884. At that time a main building of red brick, erected at a cost of $115,000, was completed, and the Civil War structures were disposed of. A current of benefactions had now set in. The contributors' list includes many persons of local prominence over this middle period of the history of the city and some of national fame, as Zachariah Chandler and Russell A. Alger. Miss Jean L. Coyle's free bed endowment, rated at the time at $220,000, and in property of increasing value, was given in 1924 in memory of her father, William Kieft Coyle. It has meant much to this important philanthropy. Harper Hospital, for a number of years, operated a unit for the care of contagious diseases, housed in a small red brick building in the rear of the hospital plant. This discontinued when the Herman Kiefer Hospital was established. The Charles C. Case Cancer Research Fund is indicative of the forward stand for hospital on the scientific side. In its jubilee year, 1913, Harper Hospital experienced a notable expansion, to be surpassed in the aftermath of the World War. On the last day of that year, the J. L. Hudson Memorial Building and Theodore D. Buhl Memorial Building were opened. The second of these additions, a family gift, was a center for the out-patient and social service departments. The first had been projected by the hospital trustees and was completed as a monument to a leading benefactor of the City of Detroit, a gentleman high up in its business circles, who was president of the hospital board at the time of his death in 1912. The golden anniversary reports of Harper Hospital discovered that it had cared for 72,250 patients, totalling 933,390 hospital days, and that not over half of the patients had paid anything for their care or treatment., 713961=A class of specific disabilities i.e., disabilities of fixed degree for which special rates are expressly provided by law arose under the act of July 4, 1864, which granted $25 per month for loss of both hands, or the sight of both eyes, and $20 for loss of both feet, in cases where the total of the pensioners rank was a less sum., 490208=The Indoor Pauper: A Study By Octave Thanet, Secretary of the Board of Charities The Atlantic Monthly. (Volume 47, Issue 284, June 1881), 183959=\"A 1953-54 survey of nursing homes found that 90 percent of the patients in proprietary nursing homes were aged 65 or over. Two-thirds of the aged patients were women. Only one-half could walk alone and one-fifth were completely bedfast. Public assistance financed, in whole or in part, the cost of care of one-half of all patients in proprietary nursing homes. Stated another way: The proprietary nursing homes of the United States are almost exclusively geared to caring for old people and to a great extent to old people on public-assistance.\" Charles M Schottland, Medical Care through Social Security: What Lies Ahead?, Journal of the American Public Welfare Association, Volume 18, Number 3, 1960., 199014=A 1952 nursing home fire in Hillsboro, Missouri had claimed the life of 20 nursing home residents, and the impact of two major nursing home fires in five years stimulated the Missouri legislature into action.

The question of old age pensions was submitted to a referendum vote, but it was decided adversely by a vote of almost 2 to 1., 739680=In 1862 the Commissioner of Pensions was authorized to detail a clerk, with power to administer oaths, for the personal investigation of cases of suspected fraud. Such special investigation was found necessary and effective in a growing number of cases, and additions to the force of employees assigned to this duty were made from time to time., 385636=This permission was, however, not granted by the Legislature until 1828, after a delay of eleven years, the result of numerous lawsuits against the trustees by various parties that claimed to be the legal heirs of Captain Randall. Troubles and suits seemed to involve the estate upon all sides, and large sums of money were expended in disposing of them. It was not until March, 1830, that a final decision in this matter, by the Supreme Court of the United States, in favor of the trustees, set at rest all doubts as to the validity of the disputed will., 486341=Miss Flaws was deeply concerned with the subject matter and the teaching of the academic portion of the curriculum. She brought in teachers to lecture to the student nurses. The probationers were sent to Central High School for a course in chemistry in 1912. Miss Gertrude M. Smith, and interested citizen, conducted classes in dietetics in her home for the seniors. Every efforts was made to give the students a careful training, in order that they might be able to meet any situation in the field of nursing., 169885=Nursing homes were emerging all over the country, but there were no federal standards for their design or operation. They were not licensed, buildings were unsafe, there were allegations of abuse and neglect, and nursing care was sometimes non-existent. Most states licensed hospitals, because the Hill-Burton Act required it, but few licensed nursing homes. The 1950 SSA amendments for the first time demanded that states that received federal matching funds must create systems to licensing both nursing homes and hospitals. This provision was added to \"raise the standards of those institutions that have been understaffed and underfinanced, that have been firetraps, and in which people have been badly treated.\"\u00a0Effective in 1953, \"If a State plan for old-age assistance, aid to the blind, or aid to the permanently and totally disabled provides for payments to individuals in private or public institutions, the State must have a State authority to establish and maintain standards for such institutions.\", 432909=Up to 1890, Michigan had four training schools for nurses; one in Battle Creek, one in Detroit, one in Grand Rapids, and one in Saginaw. The next decade saw twelve more schools established, and, strange to say, all twelve were in the immediate neighborhoods of the early ones. However, from 1900 through 1910, twenty other training schools were founded. These were distributed over the state, three being in the upper peninsula. There were a number of schools which, for one reason or another, ceased to thrive and went out of existence. At the present time, there are forty-nine accredited schools of nursing in Michigan, all endeavoring to give careful training to their students., 468902=When the Union Benevolent Association of Grand Rapids began to admit the sick as well as the aged into their home, a need for nurses was felt. It is true that women could be hired to care for patients, but this was more or less unsatisfactory. They were untrained, and their unfitness for the responsible work of a nurse was soon recognized. The advisability of opening a training school for nurses was discussed for over a year, with the result that two members of the Womans's Board were sent to England to study the conditions under which the nurses' schools organized by Florence Nightingale were conducted. Finally, in 1886, at a meeting attended by the Union Benevolent Association Hospital Committee and a number of interested physicians, the plans were formulated for the establishment of a \"nursing academy.\" The proposed course of study was to be so thorough and so complete that any one taking it might receive a certificate on graduation that would entitle her to do nursing in the hospital and in private families., 338781=St. Mary's Hospital, at Grand Rapids, is one of the enterprises of the Sisters of Mercy, an order founded in Dublin, Ireland, in 1831, by Mother Catherine McAuley. It is the largest of the system of hospitals conducted by this order in the State of Michigan. The bringer of the work of the Sisters of Mercy into the American Old Northwest was Mother Mary Joseph Lynch, a woman of rare personality and varied gifts. She came to Grand Rapids from Kinsale, Ireland, in 1873. Twenty years before she had done a nurse's service in the Crimean War, where she was intimately associated with Florence Nightingale. The Sisters of Mercy, coming to Grand Rapids at the request of Rev. J. P. McManus, opened an Academy on South Division Street, and members of their order were the first non-secular teachers of St. Andrew's School. But to Mother Joseph, influenced by her early contact with suffering in Ireland, the care of the sick and the relief of the poor made a more immediate appeal than education did. And she took her little community to Big Rapids, where they instituted a hospital for the care of men injured in the lumbering business, ministering to thousands of patients., 19397=Railroads encouraged the use of their new western lines by offering to sell land to potential settlers at low prices, over long terms, and at low rates of interest. Later, the federal government decided to further encourage the development of all the western states and territories by enacting the Homestead Act of 1862. The Homestead Act declared that any citizen or intended citizen could claim 160 acres of unoccupied public land in \"public domain states,\" virtually any part of the country outside the original 13 colonies, Tennessee, Kentucky, Texas, and Hawaii. Claimants had to improve the plot with a dwelling, grow crops on it, and live there for five years. If the original filer met these requirements and was still on the land five years later, it was his property, free and clear. The opportunity to get free or low cost land drew millions of people out to the west, including many of the new immigrants pouring in from Europe and other parts of the world., 326089=The \"History of the City of Detroit,\" 1701-1922, prepared under the distinguished editorship of Mr. Clarence M. Burton, gives space to seven hospitals and finds nineteen others to notice by name. It adds to this list, under the name of \"Charitable Institutions,\" eight that receive the more extensive treatment and twenty-one called by name only. Some of the names are interesting indices to race and religion. There are the William Booth Memorial Home and Hospital and the Serbian-American Hospital Relief Association., 497970=(Footnote: The Massachusetts board was organized first in 1863 (the different departments of health, lunacy, and charity were consolidated in 1879); the first New York board was organized in 1867; Illinois, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Ohio organized boards in 1869, Wisconsin and Michigan in 1871, and Kansas in 1875.), 350361=The hospital (May, 1928) is under the superintendency of Margaret E.

This paper will attempt only to out- line some of the general features. In order to do this the more clearly the various grants of pensions may be divided into four classes, viz.:, 107141=By 1928, just prior to the start of the Great Depression, only 6 states and territories had old-age assistance laws. As the Depression deepened, that number increased, until there were 28 states and 2 territories (Alaska and Hawaii) with old-age assistance programs by 1934, most just enacted in the prior year or two. Unfortunately, the plans were quite limited, and inconsistent from state to state. As summarized in the final report of the Old Age Security Staff to Chairman Witte, the state plans included the following features and restrictions:\u00a0, 532139=What has been said of Pennsylvania applies also to New York. No State has struggled more valorously to provide for her insane poor; but in spite of Willard Asylum, there remain 6456 insane, idiotic, and epileptic paupers, under county and city care. Their condition is often very melancholy. To support this statement I shall not make any quotations from the horrible disclosures published periodically in the New York papers; such testimony is always received with suspicion by the sober mind; moreover, it is not needed; official reports, indictments of grand juries, and coroners verdicts contain proof in plenty. The late reports of the Boards of Charities show that the best county and city almshouses care for their insane in the manner already described; the worst have the familiar dungeon and chain, and the pauper attendants keep order with their whips and their fists. The institutions managed by New York city are as bad as any. Overcrowding; poor food served cold; insufficient clothing; neglect and abuse by the overworked and underpaid attendants; patients dying of scurvy; patients eating rat poison; patients strapped to their beds for days and weeks, until the bones started through the skin, these are some of the grim facts told of the asylums on Blackwell's, Randall's, and Hart's Island. The almshouse of Onandago County may serve for an example of the rural ill-treatment of the insane. A newspaper reporter visited the house, and saw and heard enough to furnish materials for a startling article, which roused the public indignation so effectually that the supervisors asked the Board of Charities to help them investigate his charges. I have their report before me. Besides the customary cells, there were some underground dungeons of solid masonry, with concrete floors, without windows, but having a hole in each door large enough for a man to thrust his head through; both cells and dungeons being cold and damp. In summer the supply of water used to give out, although the almshouse authorities wasted very little on the paupers. The keeper of the insane department, O'Connel by name, had been a drunken pauper; he worked very cheap, and was considered a faithful fellow. To keep his patients quiet he used muffs, chains, dark cells, starvation, blows, and other straightforward arguments of force. His wife was matron. She was accustomed to mop the women; once she seized a crazy woman by her hair and flung her to the ground; but the matron of the almshouse testified that she never was particularly harsh. All the attendants were paupers; they swore at the patients, and talked loudly; it was a way they had, said the witnesses. Lunatics were shut up in the dark cells for weeks and months at a time. Two men died in these cells; one of them in a dungeon without window or bed. He wore himself out, said the keeper; he did not want to live, and I closed him in there, and he died comfortably. The attendant testified that the man was a harmless man, not ugly or vicious. The other cell had a window and a bed. Why he was put in the cell at all is not plain; he could not have excited much fear, since he had lost both arms, and was a mere skeleton, dying of consumption. But, in the language of the attendant, he was a violent man, did not appear to know nothing, which is the sole explanation given. There is no need of considering the darker charges made against O'Connel; they rest, for the most part, upon the evidence of pauper women, likely enough to avenge his blows by a cunning lie. However, no one who heard the testimony seems to have doubted that the insane suffered cruel hardships. It is only fair to add that the board of supervisors at once discharged the old attendants, and now employ paid attendants and a resident physician. The dungeons have been demolished, the building is heated by steam, and other improvements have been introduced. It is now the declared policy of the county . . . to retain only the quiet and harmless chronic insane under county care. Onandago County is not a sinner above all others. In 1878 Washington County poorhouse had a woman chained to a bar. Clinton County kept seventeen lunatics in dark, hot cells, filthy beyond description; four of the seventeen being restrained further with chains and muffs. Alleghany and Cattaraugus counties used cells very similar; and all over the State chains and handcuffs were found in the almshouses. Since then there has been a gradual improvement, or, rather, I should say a gradual abandonment of open violence; but, substantially, the situation remains unchanged. The foregoing descriptions all apply to the States having Boards of Charities, whose particular vocation is to discover abuses. Naturally, the States where the counties have had their will unchecked do not make so good a showing, when they make any showing whatever. No longer ago than 1877, a commission, appointed by the governor of Connecticut to inquire into the administration of the various charitable appropriations of the State, reported that they had found the insane at Tariffville in a condition which should shame a savage. At the New Haven almshouse there were fifty-four insane persons, some of them lying upon loose hay, without much clothing, and sorely in need of care. I have some local New Hampshire reports, all very complacent in tone, praising the county system, praising the commissioners, praising the almshouse officers, in fine, praising everything and everybody except the paupers themselves. One finds, however, that the insane are secluded and restrained in New Hampshire, just as they are in other States. Nor is the attendance more numerous or better trained than elsewhere. When a New Hampshire poorhouse burns down, no one seems to know where the keys to the cells are. This was the case at the Strafford County fire, where thirteen paupers and lunatics perished., 962918=Advisory Council Conference November 13, 1934, 581818=The English type of the work-house is almost unknown in Germany, though in some states, as Saxony and Bavaria, for example, legal provision is made for it. The attempt was twice made to introduce it into Leipsic, but in 1846 the institution was finally abandoned. The German work-house is a convict place. Its doors open only to the mandate of the magistrate. The Armenhaus, or almshouse, is usually an asylum for impotent folk; and while these are employed as their capacity will allow, the institution does not aim at being a test of destitution. In Berlin, the great influx of population since the city became an imperial capital has forced the workhouse into a new and probably temporary use. As building has not kept pace with the increase of population, rents have risen rapidly, forcing the poorer tenants to seek for cheaper apartments. These are not easily found, and dislodged families obtain a refuge in the work-house while in quest of new homes., 1058872=He went to work as the manager of a pool and billiard hall on Water Street, that was owned by his brothers Frank and Lawrence, where he remained until his ill health forced him to retire in 1936. He hasn't worked anywhere since, and as he is well off, he probably won't again., 220351=The 1965 Advisory Council said in their report \"Since the proposed program is designed primarily to support efforts to cure and rehabilitate, and since 'nursing home' care, in many cases, is oriented not to curing or rehabilitating the patient but to giving him custodial care, the Council does not propose the coverage of care in nursing homes generally.\" (Advisory Council, 1965), 725094=The only pensions of this class, for disability without regard to its origin or the pecuniary circumstances of the applicant, are granted by the act of June 27, 1890, which provides that all persons who served ninety days or more in the military or naval service of the United States during the late war of the rebellion, and who have been honorably discharged therefrom, and who are now or may hereafter be suffering from a mental or physical disability of a permanent character, not the result of their own vicious habits, which incapacitates them for the performance of manual labor in such a degree as to render them unable to earn a support, shall..., be placed upon the list of invalid pensioners of the United States, and be entitled to receive a pension not exceeding twelve dollars per month, and not less than six dollars per month, proportioned to the degree of inability to earn a support. This act is substantially the same as the so - called dependent bill, vetoed by President Cleveland in 1887, save in three particulars: the earlier bill provided for a uniform rate of $12 per month, excepted cases where the disability was due to the soldiers gross carelessness, as well as those where it resulted from his vicious habits, and extended its benefits only to those who were dependent upon their daily labor for support. In his veto message Mr. Cleveland construed this last provision as requiring not that the applicant should be wholly dependent upon his daily labor, but only that labor should be necessary to his support in some degree. This construction was fully warranted by that which had been given to the Revolutionary dependent act of 1818, and by the existing practice of the Pension Bureau in the claims of dependent relatives. In the administration of the act of June 27, 1890, actual dependence on manual labor for support, in any degree, is not deemed a requisite. To all pensions granted prior to the rebellion, it was essential that the soldier should have been honorably discharged from the service. Under post-rebellion laws this has been necessary for pensions of our second, third, and fourth classes, but not for those of the first class. A soldier who deserted during the late war in the face of the enemy and was drummed out of the service, or an officer who was cashiered for embezzlement or cowardice, stands on an equal footing, with respect to pension for disability incurred in the service, with his comrades who served honorably from Bull Run to Appomattox. Early legislation fixed the commencement of pensions at the date of the termination of service, and a limitation of two years for the filing of claims was established. This limitation was soon removed, and the pension was made to commence at the date of the completion of the proof., 717219=It will be observed that the early pensions to widows and orphans were confined to cases in which the soldier held an officers commission. Half-pay pensions to widows of enlisted men began during the war of 1812, when special inducements were needed to secure enlistments. Legislation of this sort was restricted to widows of volunteers and militia-men until 1848, when it was extended to widows of regular army soldiers who died of disabilities incurred in the Mexican war. Its benefits did not embrace the regular army equally with. volunteers until 1853, in which year the soldiers of all wars since 1790 were placed on the same footing with respect to the pensioning of their widows., 360123=Home for Aged and Infirm Colored Persons 111 South 4th St., Philadelphia, PA January 13, 1870}",

One of the more comprehensive surveys was done in New York just prior to the 1929 stock market crash. It determined that 50% or more of the age 65+ population was dependent on relatives or friends (either living with them or getting financial assistance from them to live somewhere else), 2.5% were living in poorhouses or mental hospitals, and 1-2% were living in private homes for the aged. If those percentages were representative of the national experience, that would mean that about 175,000 people age 65 or older were living in poorhouses or mental hospitals and 70,000 were living in nonprofit or proprietary homes. Note that a significant number were self-sufficient because they were still working. Source: Vladeck, 1980; Johnson, 1985",
