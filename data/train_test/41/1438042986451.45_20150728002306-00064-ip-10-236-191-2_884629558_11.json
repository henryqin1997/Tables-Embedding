            "There is a campus safety office located in the student center with someone on staff 24 hours. They are always seen patrolling campus. They are good with the text alerts to let the students know what's going on on campus.",
            "The Greeks are wonderful people. There is no discrimination and absolutely no hazing on campus. The Greeks are truly sisters and brothers and have a tight bond. Though the Greeks are great, there aren't many to choose from.",
            "For such a small college, there are suprisingly many clubs and organizations and activities (especially activities). There is something to do for everyone, so there is no excuse to not be involved.",
            "Great for serious students looking for a great, hands-on education that appreciate small classrooms and individual attention.",
            "Many people like to hang out in the grille and the LRC to study and socialize. On Giddings lawn people play soccer with their friends.",
            "For a private institution, I do think that the education is worth the money, though the price keeps rising. The money that we pay for living space is absolutely ridiculous & there ought to be different varieties of food for what is being paid for meals.",
            "Join something on campus! Basically, there isn't much to do on campus, but you can go to Lexington have have fun on the town! There are Greek parties every now and then, but they have to be over by a certain time.",
            "The food is usually good and the staff is very nice. If something you want isn't out, sometimes you can request to have it brought out. There is food for vegetarians & soy milk for those with milk allergies.",
            "The dorms can get loud, especially on the weekends, but the noise isn't so bad. Girls freshman dorm has no air conditioning, all buildings are old and need renovations.",
            "The material is advanced and fast-paced compared to larger universities.",
            "Do not be overwhelmed about the look of the dorms. They are not that bad. Try not to go home often if you live nearby or else you'll miss out on many socializing activities. Take advantage of the many spaces that there are to study. Also, if you plan on working, ask around for jobs on campus ASAP!",
            "The college has such a beautiful campus with a welcoming atmosphere. The staff truly cares about the students' individual needs and they are friendly outside of a professional environment. The educational standards are outstanding, but the living spaces are not up to par."

We hold Songfest every October, and it is huge on campus. Every dorm creates their own skit and preforms. Almost everyone on campus participates or comes to watch. It's so much fun, and it really brings everyone together. The third floor of the library is kind of hidden. I didn't know about it until my second semester. It's a great place to study, since no one every goes up there., 99077=The dorms are very uncomfortable and are 100 years old. The newer dorms are $1800 more and probably dont fit in your scholarship., 130397=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
