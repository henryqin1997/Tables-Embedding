            "Students that love nature scenery will love SDSU. The college is full of beautiful nature which includes hundreds of different types of plants, flowers, and trees. In the middle of the school is a coy pond full of fish and turtles, this pond is so relaxing to visit during a break or just to lie down on the grass and take a nap. If you want to go outside the college area there are beaches and parks in very close distance. Students that want or are interested in joining a fraternity or sorority, our Greek system is fantastic and has a huge range from the Pan-Hellenic to cultural fraternities and sororities. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find one that is perfect for you; it\u2019s a great way to be social and make new friends! Active students will enjoy the many different sports SDSU has to offer from division to intramural sports, or for those who love attending sporting events our men\u2019s basketball team is a sight to see.",
            "For all incoming freshmen i strongly recommend that you live on campus at a dorm, it\u2019s a fantastic way to make new friends and to find people who you can live with your sophomore year. Plus you\u2019re much more involved in campus activities when you live at the dorms. Campus activities are so much fun and a great way to be social. Activities include carnivals, concerts, casino nights, dances, games, BBQ's, outdoor movie nights and much more. Also by living in a dorm you receive access to an AM (Academic Mentor), this person can help you plan your upcoming semester classes, give you advice on school work, look over your schoolwork and much more, they are a great resource for freshmen.",
            "Recently tuition went up along with many other CSU's in California, so make sure you have some money saved because SDSU is fantastic but it\u2019s also expensive. It's definitely worth the money though.",
            "You will never have a dull moment at SDSU! Events are constantly being held for all students year round. The gym is a fantastic place to go exercise and release stress and energy! The ARC offers a relaxing environment to take a swim and be with friends. There\u2019s even a bowling arena which includes a pool table and arcade games for all of you gamers out there!",
            "I have definitely learned new information and facts I did not know prior to attending SDSU. All professors are unique with their own way of helping students learn the material. Professor's office hours are so helpful and fitting to your schedule, and if they are not professors go out of their way to make a personal appointment to meet with you at your best time. The Lovely Library is amazing, it offers so many resources for your project needs and something very special that not many libraries have are it offers a 24 Hour Study Area! This study area is open to all SDSU students needing that extra time to finish up their studies or school work."

The average high school GPA for the class of 2017 was a 3.8., 504193=Go to the gym, play bowling at kearny mesa bowl since the aztec center is closed until fall 2013, go to the SDSU men's basketball games at Viejas Arena or concerts, go to the SDSU Football games at Qualcomm Stadium, and watch sports or listen to music/play video games., 360756=not really big here since the drug bust in 2007. many sororities/fraternities were suspended., 245933=There's a lot to do in San Diego! A cultural feast. Get a copy of the local weekly magazine, The Reader, when you arrive. Balboa Park alone has over 20 museums, biking and jogging paths, huge gardens, Spanish Village with an old California feel and artisans' shops, and hospitality houses from many countries. If you're a foreign student, go there for local information and socializing. The Park also hosts the Earth Fair every April. Movie theatres near campus show an eclectic array of films. The beaches are wonderful for surfing, relaxing and playing with your dog., 454032=The school is becoming increasingly difficult to gain acceptance to. For those hoping to transfer, keep in mind that there is a followup application due in January., 399492=food is tasty, but there could be more options. the associated students building which is set to open fall of 2013 will have great dining choices., 313617=I am an incoming freshman, and I will be attending in Fall 2015. I have some friends that go here, and they say that you should be very careful with the party scene here on campus. There are a lot of parties that you can go to, but always make sure to be careful!}",

Also, check out the plays put on by the theatre department, or go watch the student film festival. Periodically there are also free movie screenings on campus. Bang for the buck The recent increase in cost of registration was kind of a bummer, but it's still affordable. Am enjoying being here There are so many things to do. What with all the clubs, the ARC, pool, bowling, concerts, and nearby beaches, there's no way you can get bored. Am learning a lot Most of the teachers I've had have been great and are dedicated to helping their students. It may be a party school, but don't be fooled -",
