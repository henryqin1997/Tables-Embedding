The Linda Rice-trained six-year-old landed the Alfred G. Vanderbilt H. (G1) and Forego (G1) last season, but saw his championship aspirations fizzle out after finishing third in the Vosburgh (G1) and sixth in the Breeders' Cup Sprint (G1)., 9293=The Queen Anne was Solow's third straight Group 1 win this year. Solow captured the one mile Dubai Turf (UAe-G1) by 4 1/2 lengths at Meydan and followed up that score by winning the 1 1/8-mile Prix d'Ispahan (Fr-G1) at Longchamp on May 24. Maxime Guyon will ride Solow as he has done in all four starts this year., 15464=Trained by Reade Baker and ridden by Jim McAleney, Breaking Lucky completed 1 3/16 miles on a fast track in 1:56.59 and paid $28.10., 8972=Night of Thunder (Dubawi) finished five lengths behind Solow in the Queen Anne. Last year's Two Thousand Guineas (Eng-G1) winner, trained by Richard Hannon, won the Lockinge S. (Eng-G1) at Newbury on May 16 in his first start of 2015., 2435=The 1 3/16-mile Prince of Wales has attracted a field of seven, but all eyes will be on Shaman Ghost, who will try and follow in the hoof steps of Wando, the last horse to win both the Queen's Plate and Prince of Wales. That recently-deceased champion wound up sweeping the Canadian Triple Crown in 2003., 4908=Judy the Beauty (Ghostzapper), the 2014 champion female sprinter, will maker her first outing since May in Wednesday's $200,000 Honorable Miss H. (G2) at Saratoga., 13071=Also in the John Morrissey lineup is the race's 2014 winner Weekend Hideaway (Speightstown), who is also trying to snap a three-race losing skid. He's been unplaced three times since registering an impressive four-length score in the January 17 Sunshine Millions Sprint at Gulfstream., 9882=Solow, trained by Freddie Head, who trained Goldikova to three consecutive wins (2008-10) in the Breeders' Cup Mile and rode Miesque to victory in the 1987-88 editions of the Mile, has the gray ready for action since capturing last month's Queen Anne S. (Eng-G1) at Royal Ascot., 8267=Aidan O'Brien has won the Sussex four times in the last 15 years. He is represented by the Cougar Mountain (Fastnet Rock), who finished third in the Queen Anne and fourth in the Eclipse S. (Eng-G1) at Sandown on July 4., 18848=Triple Crown winner American Pharoah (Pioneerof the Nile) will return to action in Sunday's $1 million Haskell Invitational (G1) at Monmouth Park and the Bob Baffert-trained colt recorded his final workout in preparation Tuesday morning, breezing a half-mile in :48.80 at Del Mar.}",
