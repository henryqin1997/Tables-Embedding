    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31778=[0002] Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid, is a common household drug that can be found in almost every medicine cabinet in the United States. Aspirin has been used for over one hundred years, having been developed by German chemist Felix Hoffmann in 1897. Most commonly thought of as an analgesic, or pain reliever, it is considered by practitioners and consumers to be an effective, cheap and relatively safe drug. In recent years, however, aspirin also has been discovered to be effective in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart attacks. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and most developed countries. Generally, there will be 1,250,000 heart attacks every year in the United States with 500,000 of those attacks resulting in death. Therefore, aspirin's ability to prevent and treat persons suffering from cardiovascular disease cannot be overlooked or overvalued., 33791=[0004] While scientists continue to more fully understand how aspirin functions, its ability to treat serious cardiovascular conditions has been recognized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since at least 1985. In that year, the FDA approved the use of aspirin to prevent heart attacks in patients who had either suffered a previous heart attack or suffered from unstable angina. This approval was based on studies indicating that use of aspirin lowered the risk of a second heart attack by 20%, and, for persons suffering from unstable angina, reduced the risk of heart attack by 51%. In 1996, a further proposal was made by the FDA to amend professional labeling rules to include acute MI as an indication for aspirin. That proposal was incorporated into a final rule adopted by the FDA in 1998, which became effective Oct. 25, 1999. Adoption of this change was supported by recent studies on aspirin in the treatment of acute MI that were submitted to and considered by the FDA. Specifically, the rule states that, \u201cAspirin is indicated to (1) Reduce the combined risk of death and nonfatal stroke in patients who have had ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli, (2) reduce the risk of vascular mortality in patients with a suspected acute MI, (3) reduce the combined risk of death and nonfatal MI in patients with a previous MI or unstable angina pectoris, and (4) reduce the combined risk of MI and sudden death in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.\u201d}",

In this application, all references are incorporated herein by reference. [0033] Because medicament wafer 96 is of greatest value during emergency situations, the medicament kit also may include an alert, such as a bracelet or necklace shown generally at 108 in FIG. 9, indicating that the patient possesses carrier 78. When the patient is wearing an alert, if intervention is necessary (i.e. where the patient is unconscious otherwise unable to communicate), a person intervening during the emergency will know to locate carrier 78 and dispense medicament wafer 96. [0032] Once the user has filled out instruction card 74, the card may be placed within carrier 78. For example, instruction card 74 may be secured to the inside of the carrier (e.g., as a label, hooks) or instruction card 74 may be loosely placed within carrier 78. Cover 98 then may be closed and removably attached to flanges 89-92. An adhesive may be provided on the inner surface of cover 98 or on the upper surface of cover 100. Regardless of where the adhesive is located, because of the hinged connection between one side of cover 98 and lower housing 80, the remaining sides of cover",
