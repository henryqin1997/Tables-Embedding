            "Most students can find this school beneficial because they have many programs and majors. Also, they have many sports and clubs which are available to most students.",
            "If you have interest in this school, make sure you come to a campus open house so you can check out everything to really get a feel. Also, if you are looking for a good education and not as much worried with the social aspects than this is the best school for your money. Check out the college's website for their sports and clubs and see which one you would enjoy as this is the best way to guarantee a strong social relationship with other students living on campus.",
            "If you live in Connecticut, Southern is one of the best schools for the money. Out of state students do pay quite a bit more so I am sure there are better options from a out-of-state student if they are looking for a cheap state school.",
            "The school has a nice, up-to-date campus that is aesthetically pleasing. Also, the dorms are not very far from the center of campus. One thing that Southern lacks is a large population of students on the weekends. For the most part, students go home on the weekends or just commute to school. Southern has tried to stop this by disallowing freshman students parking passes so they have no choice to stay which is good for most freshman.",
            "There are a wide variety of classes to take with a large spectrum of subjects. Also, the faculty is very helpful and for the most part truly cares about his or her students education."

Southern is a respected nursing school and the program's very competitive. In 2015 we will have a new library and science building, both are going to be huge and contain everything a student could need and more.}",

Tips for prospective students When choosing schools make sure it has everything that you're looking for. Southern offers almost every major possible. There's nothing here at Southern I don't enjoy. Bang for the buck Out of the four state schools, I'd have to say in my opinion Southern has the most to offer. The campus is the nicest and the activites are so often that you always see your money at use. Am enjoying being here I live on campus and love it so much! Southern is a perfect match for me and I could never imagine going anywhere else. Am learning",
