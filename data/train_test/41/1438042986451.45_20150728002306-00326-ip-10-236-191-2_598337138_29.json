    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{26945=The clock frequency of the core has been increased from 680 MHz to 715 MHz (+5%). The biggest difference is the number of shaders: AMD has increased the number of stream processors from 960 to 1120 (+17%). The pixel fill rate has risen 5% (22.9 vs. 21.8 GPixel/s), and the texture fill rate has increased about 23% (40.0 vs. 32.6 GTexel/s)., 27840=Enough about the case - time to take a look at the graphic card itself. The \u00a0Radeon HD 6990M\u00a0resembles its predecessor (the\u00a0HD 6970M) in a few ways. Both graphic cards use the\u00a0desktop Barts chip with 1700 million transistors and have 2 GB of fast GDDR5 VRAM\u00a0which operates at 900 MHz\u00a0(bandwidth: 115.2 GB/s). The memory interface is also identical; 256 bit is right now more than enough for GDDR5 memory. The GPUs were produced in the 40 nm format., 1377=The Radeon HD 6990M delivers a great performance in the 3DMark 11 (1280 x 720, Performance setting). The GPU score of 3179 points beats almost all single mobile graphic cards. The Radeon HD 6970M\u00a0is left behind at 2834 points\u00a0@\u00a0Eurocom Racer\u00a0(-11%), The GeForce GTX 485M\u00a0scores around 16% less (2668 points @ Schenker XMG P501). The\u00a0GeForce GTX 580M\u00a0rubs shoulders with its AMD competition with a score of 3191 points (Alienware M17x R3). In our experience, the 3DMark 11 benchmark usually favors the AMD graphic cards., 41283=The Eurocom Panther 3.0 is extremely well-equipped with other high-end hardware modules, such as:\u00a012 GB DDR3-RAM (1600 MHz @ 1333 MHz) and three Intel 510 SSDs in RAID 0 (\u00a0each 250 GB). The performance of the three Solid State Drives in RAID mode is incredible. We measured a sequential read and write rate of\u00a0600 MB/sec with the AS SSD benchmark. So how much does all this cost? \u00a0Eurocom has priced this configuration above 5000 Euros - hefty.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{387734=In the Unigine Heaven 2.1 benchmark, the frame rate rose about 6% from 37.2 to 39.4 fps (1280 x 1024, High, Tessellation normal). The GPU score of the 3DMark 11 (1280 x 720, Performance setting) increased about 4% (3299 vs. 3179 points). As long as the cooling system is adequate, users can push the graphic card to enjoy a bit extra performance. With overclocking, the Radeon HD 6990M almost reaches the level of the far more expensive GeForce GTX 580M., 366743=As expected, the Radeon HD 6990M\u00a0is an exceptionally powerful \"High-End\" graphic card. It can deliver fluid gameplay with the highest graphics settings and high resolutions for almost any game (Metro 2033 and Crysis 2 are two exceptions). The graphic card even has enough power to turn up the anti-aliasing for most games., 387193=We tried to manually overclock the Radeon HD 6990M in an effort to coax as much performance as possible out of it.\u00a0Overdrive\u00a0allows the graphic card core and memory to turn up to 740 and 1000 MHz respectively. This is a rise of 3% (core) and 11% (memory) respectively. In short: the performance rose noticeably after the overclocking. In Dirt 3, the overclocking really upped the performance: from\u00a035.3 fps to\u00a037.6 fps which is a plus of 7% (1920 x 1080, Ultra High, 4x AA)., 10610=Let us move on to the gaming performance. For our game tests, the Eurocom Panther 3.0 had to compete with the\u00a0Eurocom Racer (Core i7-2720QM, Radeon HD 6970M), as well as the\u00a0Schenker XMG P501 (Core i7-2720QM, GeForce GTX 580M). In an attempt to hold the influence of the CPU to a minimum, we picked the highest settings with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The use of any other model, aside from the ones mentioned above, is noted in the game test., 106122=The benchmark results from Call of Duty: Black Ops surprised us. As in, Modern Warfare 2 and Starcraft 2, the performance of the Radeon HD 6990M lay lower than that of the slower Radeon HD 6970M. While the latter managed 74.5 fps (1920 x 1080, Extra, 4x AA & 8x AF) in single player campaign, the HD 6990M could \"only\" deliver\u00a070.1 fps (-6%)., 215260=1920 x 1080 pixels and Ultra settings coaxed a tired smile from the Radeon HD 6990M - 55.7 fps speaks loudly. As already mentioned before, the Radeon HD 6970M takes the lead from its stronger successor with 58.6 fps (difference of 5%). The GeForce GTX 580M lies above the other two with 58.8 fps (+6%)., 11902=Almost every years, Codemasters releases a high-quality racing game. Their latest creation, Dirt 3, is delivered smoothly to the screen with ultra high details by the Radeon HD 6990M. The graphic card managed 35.3 fps in the integrated game benchmark with 4x AA and a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels., 259712=This immersive game from the Ukraine developer 4A Games, can make even the Radeon HD 6990M shudder. Very high details, 1920 x 1080 pixels and DX 11 mode drop the frames to 19.1 fps, which means that the user will not be able to properly enjoy the game with these settings., 165421=As Mafia 2 has modest hardware requirements, the Radeon HD 6990M runs this game without a problem. In the integrated benchmark the graphic card delivers an impeccable 60.3 fps with high details, 16x AF, and a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels., 4819=The Unigine Heaven benchmark (1280 x 1024, High, Tessellation normal) favors Nvidia. The\u00a0Radeon HD 6990M (37.2 fps)\u00a0can not beat the GeForce GTX 485M (40.9 fps, +10%), or the GeForce GTX 580M (43.8 fps, +18%). The cheaper Radeon HD 6970M lies further behind:\u00a033.2 fps (11% gap). However, the performance of all four graphic cards is very strong, and so the user should be content for the next 1-2 years., 314397=The biggest challenger of the Call of Duty series can not bring the Radeon HD 6990M to its knees. The boat trip at the beginning of the single-player campaign runs fluidly at 54.8 fps on the display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, high details, 4x AA, 8x AF, an activated HBAO., 67564=The demanding Ego-Shooter, Crysis 2, takes everything the Radeon HD 6990M has to offer and is hungry for more. Even without the DirectX 11 patch, and high-resolution textures, the single player campaign did not run fluidly. Fraps measured on average 34 fps with 1920x1080 pixels and Extreme settings. Sadly, that is too little for a game which runs in the First-Person perspective.}",

The Radeon HD 6970M\u00a0loses its spot at the top of the AMD ladder. In our tests, the HD 6970M was around 5% slower than the 6990M.
