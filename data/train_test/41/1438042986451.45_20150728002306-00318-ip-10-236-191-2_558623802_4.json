    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{26689=In addition to the difficulty of treating biofilm with conventional antibiotic therapy, treating biofilm is further hindered by the rising antibiotic resistance among pathogens. Antibiotics targets are essential for bacterial survival. As a result, antibiotic resistant strains have been favored by selective pressure [18]. Antibiotic resistance in S. aureus such as the methicillin resistance is one of the most urgent medical problems [19,20]. It was estimated that 94,360 invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections occurred in the US in 2005, and these infections were associated with death in 18,650 cases [21]. Although S. epidermidis is part of the normal human epithelial bacterial flora, it can cause infection when skin or mucous membrane is injured. Biofilm formation on implanted indwelling medical devices is the major manifestation of S. epidermidis pathogenesis [3]. Antibiotic resistance is also widespread in S. epidermidis. For example, more than 70% of all hospital isolates of S. epidermidis are resistant to methicillin [22]. In summary, alternative approaches other than conventional antibiotic therapy are in urgent need to treat biofilm related infections. In this review, we will discuss alternative approaches to prevent or treat biofilms focusing on S. aureus and S. epidermidis, two of the most important biofilm forming pathogens., 17356=Int. J. Mol.
