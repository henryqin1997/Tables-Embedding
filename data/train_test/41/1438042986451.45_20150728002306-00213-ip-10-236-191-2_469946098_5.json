    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29771=FIG. 2 is an isometric, exploded view of a bipolar plate 56 comprising a first exterior metal sheet 58, a second exterior metal sheet 60, and an interior spacer metal sheet 62 interjacent the first metal sheet 58 and the second metal sheet 60. The exterior metal sheets 58 and 60 are made as thin as possible (e.g., about 0.002-0.02 inches thick), may be formed by stamping, by photo etching (i.e., through a photolithographic mask) or any other conventional process for shaping sheet metal. The external sheet 58 is formed so as to provide a plurality of lands 64 which define therebetween a plurality of grooves 66 through which the fuel cell's reactant gases (i.e., H2 or O2) flow in a tortuous path from one side 68 of the bipolar plate to the other side 70 thereof. When the fuel cell is fully assembled, the lands 64 press against the carbon/graphite papers 36 or 38 (see FIG. 1) which, in turn, press against the MEAs 4 and 6 respectively. For drafting simplicity, FIG. 2 depicts only two arrays of lands and grooves. In reality, the lands and grooves will cover the entire external faces of the metal sheets 58 and 60 that engage the carbon/graphite papers 36 and 38. The reactant gas is supplied to grooves 66 from a header or manifold groove 72 that lies along one side 68 of the fuel cell, and exits the grooves 66 via another header/manifold groove 74 that lies adjacent the opposite side 70 of the fuel cell. As best shown in FIG. 3, the underside of the sheet 58 includes a plurality of ridges 76 which define therebetween a plurality of channels 78 through which coolant passes during the operation of the fuel cell. As shown in FIG. 3, a coolant channel 78 underlies each land 64 while a reactant gas groove 66 underlies each ridge 76., 41680=1. Placed between a pair of gold-plated copper plates applied with forces of 1000 lbs. and 2000 lbs., and, 41805=2. Placed between porous graphite layers (0.008 in. thick) and compressed between a pair of gold-plated copper plates with applied forces of 1000 lbs. and 2000 lbs., 17263=Fuel cells have been proposed as a power source for electric vehicles, and other devices. One such fuel cell is the PEM (i.e., proton exchange membrane) fuel cell as it has potentially high energy, as well as low weight and volume. PEM fuel cells are well known in the art and include in each cell thereof a so-called \"membrane-electrode-assembly\" comprising a thin, proton-conductive, polymer, membrane-electrolyte having an anode electrode film formed on one face thereof and a cathode electrode film formed on the opposite face thereof. Such membrane-electrolytes are well known in the art and are described in such U.S. Pat. No. as 5,272,017 and 3,134,697, as well as in the Journal of Power Sources, Volume 29 (1990) pages 367-387, inter alia. In general, such membrane-electrolytes are made from ion exchange resins, and typically comprise a perflourinated sulfonic acid polymer such as NAFION\u2122 available from the E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. The anode and cathode films, on the other hand, typically comprise (1) finely divided carbon particles, very finely divided catalytic particles supported on the internal and external surfaces of the carbon particles, and proton-conductive material (e.g., NAFION\u2122) intermingled with the catalytic and carbon particles, or (2) catalytic particles dispersed throughout a polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) binder. One such membrane-electrode-assembly and fuel cell is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,017 issued Dec. 21, 1993 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention.}",
