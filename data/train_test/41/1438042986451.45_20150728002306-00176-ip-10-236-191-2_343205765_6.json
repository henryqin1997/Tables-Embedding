Not only is the expanse of space quite unfamiliar to a sailor accustomed to that of mono-hulls; but also Lagoon's style of interior finishing and decorating is far from traditional as well. Her configuration consists of a Salon on the centerline with access to hulls that are equipped with (2) berths port and (2) starboards, a chart table, a fully-kitted galley and (2) head/showers. \u00a0 \u00a0",
