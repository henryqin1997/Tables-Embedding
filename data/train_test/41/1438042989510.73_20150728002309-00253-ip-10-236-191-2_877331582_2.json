Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s., 21861=After the Greek cuisine-inspired \"Kotopoulopology\" and the spiraling Middle Eastern modes of \"Blind Inside\" and \"Bad Linen\" (the latter throwing in brassy spy and circus music flavors), the listener might think a respite has arrived with the opening moments of \"Too Sublime in Sin,\" calm and crystalline with bass, piano, and vibes in nighttime reverie, but don't settle in too comfortably \u2014 you will be out of your chair faster than a hapless bad guy tossed airborne by the ejector seat in 007's Aston-Martin (although the jumpiness of \"Sin\" is more Hitchcock than Bond). And then, a funny thing happens. First, the band actually does calm down on a version of Charlie Shavers' \"Dawn on the Desert,\" a beautiful clarinet showcase mixing \"The Mooche\" with XLS' \"Down at the Dinghy,\" and across the next three tracks Vermeersch and company have seemingly transitioned from an avant/experimental band with a jazz jones to a jazz band with deep avant/experimental tendencies. FES don't exactly play it straight and they still have a few warped surprises in store, but they also loosen up the arrangements, interject some madly swinging interludes, and offer up exploratory piano, reed, and brass solos and (especially on Vandenberghe's \"Smoke on Fire, the King Is Burning\") moody and textured ensemble investigations. By the time the CD has run its course, FES have managed to cover a wide spectrum of both jazz and non-jazz creative music, riveting the listener every step of the way. Regardless of stylistic labels, nearly everything here astounds, and Cheer Me, Perverts! is one of the most exciting releases of 2009., 23689=Formed: 1997}",
