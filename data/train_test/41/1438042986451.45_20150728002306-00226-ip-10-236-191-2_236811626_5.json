Despite the slightly lower overall precipitation levels, particularly from June to August, the Southwest Monsoon is characterized by its early-morning rainstorms; these often persist for one or two hours then taper off for the afternoon. Even these drier months experience a fair amount of rain (around 150mm each month), so be prepared for unpredictably wet weather any time of the year., 94628=Mon-Fri 0900-1300 and 1400-1700, Sat 0900-1300 if open., 116939=Opening times: Daily 0700-1200 and 1800-2100, 3334=Singapore receives a considerable amount of rainfall \u2013 approximately 2340mm annually.

Rain is a possibility at any time of year, but it\u2019s easy to escape in the city\u2019s air-conditioned malls. May and June are the hottest months, while November to January are the wettest, but the city doesn\u2019t have an off-season and hotel prices are fairly steady throughout the year. Festivals draw huge crowds to Singapore, particularly Thaipusam in January and Chinese New Year in February. Come from May to July for the Great Singapore Sale, or grab a plate or three at the Singapore Food Festival in April.

SMRT shares the city\u2019s bus routes with SBS Transit (tel: 1800 287 2727; www.sbstransit.com.sg).

Founded in 1859, it still provides a welcome escape from the urban sprawl, with shady trails, trickling water features and abundant greenery that almost makes you forget you are in the middle of the city., 2483=The beginning and end of the two monsoon seasons are not well defined, but are separated by the shorter inter-monsoon periods of April/May and October/November, during which months afternoon and evening rain showers are likely. These showers are typically sudden and heavy, but often only last for a short time., 2154=The region is extremely humid, with humidity levels usually between 70% and 90%; often the air is muggiest in the early morning, abating somewhat in the afternoon. On rainy days it is not unreasonable to expect the humidity to reach 100%. When visiting, be sure to drink enough water and seek frequent refuge from the sticky heat indoors.
