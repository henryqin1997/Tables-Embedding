NPD says it hopes to see a burst of sales when the big new crop of anticipated games comes this fall. NPD's video game analyst Anita Frazier noted that the retail sales numbers only account for between 50 and 60 percent of the total amount consumers spend on games today. While brick and mortar stores sold just $516.5 million in game hardware and software, NPD preliminarily estimates digital sales will push that number to $1.17 billion. This was the first time since July 2010 that a PC title recorded retail sales that were strong enough to top console titles. That game, not surprisingly, was another long-awaited Blizzard title: Starcraft II. Max Payne 3, Rockstar Games' revival of the seminal action series, was the top-selling game among consoles, followed by Ubisoft's Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon:",
