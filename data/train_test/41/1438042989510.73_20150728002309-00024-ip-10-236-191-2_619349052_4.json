Final FSC Report tentatively scheduled for Spring 2003., 8114=Bayonne Sewer Pipeline NJ Site 144: The Bayonne Sewage Pipeline (C-Line) cap project was completed in October. This included excavation of COPR material and consolidation under a cap in the bay area, giving way for construction of the City of Bayonne Wetlands Nature Park. An additional cap was constructed on NJ Turnpike Authority right-of-way. A workplan to monitor possible upward migration of COPR deposits beneath water level and to prevent its migration by placing additional geotextile, stone and sand was submitted to NJDEP. Additional delineation of COPR is being planned. This additional work will be performed in 2003. On-going deed notice work is continuing. Deed notices are needed from private property owners for the very deep (20 feet or more) deposits of COPR used as bedding along the length of the pipeline. The Construction Certification Report (Remedial Action Report) has been drafted., 5379=College Towers Apartments NJ Site 154: College Towers Apartments is a 320-unit apartment complex in Jersey City, New Jersey that houses elderly residents. The complex was built in 1955 in a low-lying area that was formerly a baseball field. The parking lot area and around the back of the buildings were partially backfilled with Chromium Ore Processing Residue (COPR), construction debris and other fill material. The backyard edges of 13 adjoining townhouses were also partially backfilled with COPR. Honeywell remediated the site by excavating all soil that contained >240 mg/kg hexavalent chromium (11,730 tons hazardous and 4,000 tons non-hazardous) around the buildings and backyards, temorarily stockpiling the material on the site awaiting laboratory results to determine if the soil would be handled as hazardous or non-hazardous waste then landfilling the material as appropriate. The buildings' foundations were power washed and waterproofing was applied. Clean fill was backfilled. While excavated soils were stockpiled right outside of residents' windows awaiting laboratory results, extremely diligent dust suppression and air monitoring was performed to ensure safety for all the residents. The parking lot perimeter was lined with sheetpiling to a minimum depth of 7 feet and a new 4.5\" asphalt cap installed to contain and isolate the COPR material left under the parking lot. Because the resident's parking area was the construction site, Honeywell rented a nearby parking lot, fenced it off and provided lighting, 24 hour continuous security and shuttle service for the displaced residents. A Honeywell representative was on-call at all times to answer resident questions and concerns. Information bulletins were distributed and informal meetings at the apartment complex were held. Restoration included providing new handicap ramps to all four buildings, installing new sidewalks, patios, fencing, three pools, sheds, grass, sprinklers, and landscaping. On the basement walls that had previously cracked from poor soil compaction a wall laminate was installed., 10281=Foodtown NJDEP Site 155: A report entitled \"Results of ASTM Leaching Experiments for Solids from Foodtown\" which helped to establish site specific acute contact dermatitis criteria was submitted to the Department on June 10, 2002 and later approved by the Department. Preliminary discussions with consultants for the NJEDA regarding developing the site for an elementary school occurred in November and December. DEP provided comments on the draft RI Report to Honeywell on November 6, 2002. Honeywell is finalizing a response to the comments in the form of a revised final RI report and is performing additional borings to delineate the contamination along Ocean Avenue., 13098=Remedial Investigation Report for Group 7 (Site 114) has been approved in September 2002. Building demolition is underway to begin Remedial Investigation.}",
