    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{98500=Other features are shown on the control unit panel 840 (e.g., transponder code selector knobs 630, transponder code window 632 and traffic display switches 634, 636 and 638) that are consistent with a TCAS 2000/Transponder control panel. Since these features are well known, they are not described in detail here., 71849=Processor/interrogator 410 may be any device or combination of devices capable of performing the functions described herein. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, processor/interrogator 410 is a modified or augmented TCAS 2000 system available from Aviation Communications & Surveillance Systems (ACSS), an L-3 Communications & Thales Company, which incorporates FAA \u201cChange 7\u201d software. The TCAS 2000 system includes a RT 950/951 receiver/transmitter (R/T) unit and top directional antenna 412 and bottom directional or omni directional antennae 411. The R/T unit performs airspace surveillance and intruder tracking, generates traffic display symbology, computes threat assessment and collision threat resolution and provides coordination between its own aircraft and surrounding TCAS equipped aircraft to provide non-conflicting RAs. The R/T unit computes the bearing of an intruder from antennae 41 land 412, which are preferably AT 910 Top-Directional/Bottom-Omni Directional antennas, and determines the range by the time lapse between interrogation and reply from an intruder. In the preferred embodiment processor/interrogator 410 broadcasts on a frequency of 1030 MHz and receives replies on a frequency of 1090 MHz. In active mode, the R/T unit provides surveillance information to transceiver 450 for networking to members of the formation having TCAS in passive mode. In passive mode, the R/T unit provides processing means for tracking surrounding traffic and/or threat assessment based on received networked surveillance information. Tracking and threat assessments by the R/T unit in passive mode may also be based on ADS-B or other squitter information received independently of communications link 390., 73665=Transponder 415 is any device or combination of devices capable of receiving an interrogation from another aircraft or ATC ground tracking station and transmitting a reply to the interrogation. As previously discussed, replies to interrogations may include the latitude and longitude of the aircraft's current position as well as other information including its identification (e.g., 24 bit Mode-S address). In the preferred embodiment, transponder 415 is an XS-950 or XS-950S/I Military Mode-S/IFF transponder having ground-based and airborne interrogation capabilities. Transponder 415 preferably includes ADS-B functionality and includes top and bottom ATC omni directional antennae 416 and 417 for transmitting/receiving information to/from other aircraft or ground based ATC systems. In the preferred embodiment, transponder 415 transmits on a frequency of 1090 MHz and receives on a frequency of 1030 MHz., 92214=There may be two types of blunder alerts: (1) a blunder proximity alert; and (2) a blunder acceleration alert. A blunder proximity alert occurs when a minimum threshold distance (Nth) between two formation members is reached (e.g., Distance to another formation member <(Nth) ft.), or when a time to penetration Tau (\u03c4) of a minimum threshold distance, is reached (e.g., Time until another formation member reaches threshold distance <(\u03c4)). An example for (Nth) and (\u03c4) is 1000 ft. and 30 seconds to 1000 ft., respectively., 47627=For surveillance, TCAS interrogations are transmitted over an interrogation channel (e.g., 1030 MHz) from the TCAS equipped aircraft to any aircraft within the range of the transmission. The interrogation requests a reply from transponder-equipped aircraft within range of the transmission to provide their pertinent position and/or intent information. Transponder-equipped aircraft within range of the transmitted interrogation, reply over a reply channel (e.g., 1090 MHz) by providing their associated information. This information can include altitude, position, bearing, airspeed, aircraft identification and other information of the in-range aircraft to assist the TCAS in tracking and evaluating the possibilities of collision with the in-range aircraft., 76251=Preferably, transceiver 450 is composed of equipment that already present on the aircraft. For example, military aircraft configured to fly in formations often have Station Keeping Equipment (SKE) used for keeping planes in formation position. The SKE used in this type of military aircraft, for example the C-130, communicate positional, range and control information between formation members for functions such as autopilot. SKE transmitter/receivers typically operate on frequencies between 3.1 to 3.6 GHz and includes a useable data transfer rates of 40 Kbps. Existing SKE is integrated with TCAS to network surveillance information over the existing SKE communication links between formation members (e.g., network link 390). When using SKE equipped aircraft, the present invention may be implemented by providing a software update for processor 410 and providing physical connectivity between the SKE and processor 410 and control unit 440. In the event an aircraft does not have SKE a separate transceiver 450 or the use of 1090 MHz ADS-B emissions of active lead aircraft surveillance data facilitates network link 390., 77939=Control unit 440 provides information to transponder 415 relating to required display data such as altitude and speed, and controls function selection of transponder 415 (e.g., transmission mode and reporting functions), processor 410 (e.g., passive mode, active mode), transceiver 450 and display 420. Control unit 440 also may include a processor for processing information outside of processor 410. In a preferred embodiment, control unit 440 is an ATC transponder and TCAS control unit implemented as an integrated menu-driven multi-function cockpit display unit or MCDU. An L-3 control panel or Gables control panel may also serve as control unit 440. Control unit 440 preferably controls other system components over a 1553 data bus., 92796=A blunder acceleration alert occurs when relative acceleration of a formation member within a certain distance of another formation member exceeds a certain amount (gb). For example, two formation members within 1000 ft of each other may have a threshold acceleration limit (gb) of 0.3 g. This means that when an acceleration of a first member of the formation is greater than 0.3 g relative to the acceleration of a second formation member that is within 1000 ft of the first formation member, a blunder acceleration alert will inform the pilots of the first and second aircraft of the potential danger., 75061=Transceiver 450 provides the layer for networking surveillance information to other aircraft in a formation. Transceiver 450 is preferably an RF transceiver operating on a frequency other than that of the transponder/TCAS interrogation and reply channels, typically 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz. However, transceiver 450 may be any type of wireless communication system operating on any frequency range. RF transceiver 450 is coupled to the processor 410 to provide networked surveillance data received from other formation members to processor 410 or transmit the same depending on whether the TCAS is in active mode or passive mode. The RF transceiver 450 of the preferred embodiment establishes network link 390 between other formation aircraft and transmits/receives data over network link 390 utilizing spread spectrum modulation. Transceiver 450 includes antenna 451 to transmit and/or receive the networked surveillance information. Antenna 451 is preferably an omni-directional or segmented directional antenna radiating on a non-ATC frequency (e.g., other than 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patentzitate Although there have been described preferred embodiments of this novel invention, many variations and modifications are possible and the embodiments described herein are not limited by the specific disclosure above, but rather should be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. Unless contrary to physical possibility, the inventors envision the methods and systems described herein: (i) may be performed in any sequence and/or combination; and (ii) the components of respective embodiments to be combined in any manner. When multiple aircraft are flying in a \u201cclose\u201d formation and their respective mode selectors 820 are set on either passive or active formation mode; if one formation member encounters a potential ATC collision threat that generates an RA in response to nearby ATC aircraft, resolution coordination may occur between all the formation aircraft to generate a coordinated RA. This prevents the formation members from generating an RA that is contradictory to the flight path of other formation members. TCAS in active or passive formation mode also prevents respective TCASs from treating other members of the formation as intruders (e.g., generating RAs and TAs against each other rather than blunder alerts). The formation collision avoidance system of the present invention may be effectively combined with the formation flying features of Enhanced Traffic Alert & Collision Avoidance System (ETCAS) and particularly of the type disclosed in U.S. application Ser.
