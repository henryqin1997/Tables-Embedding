Click here for past audio clips., 51083=raymitten said\u2026 Hope Riggs gets the job. Took a team with only 26 wins at the All Star break and was a shambles funadmentally, and had them over .500 under two years. I personally saw his hard work over two spring trainings. He contributed a great deal to the success of the Nationals and I hope that those looking to hire him recognize that. They will be getting a good baseball man, and a good guy. October 11, 2011 3:35 PM Ray, I agree with you. It was amazing what he accomplished in a short amount of time. When the 2011 team was constructed, the injury bug hit and he still got the team over .500 Give the man some credit., 53922=It's interesting to look at what the Mets fans are saying at a similar blog: http://www.metsblog.com/2011/10/10/mets-to-interview-jim-riggleman-for-bench-coach-job/Sound familiar?, 72623=Jd,Agree 100%. And, for the most part, I think they've managed to avoid both of those pitfalls so far. As witnessed in the two big trades that didn't happen (i.e., for Grienke and for Span), they've been unwilling to part with pieces they considered essential for the future. And even in the case of Werth's extremely generous (and long) contract, it would seem that they still have plenty of payroll flexibility for the future. I tend to believe that the GM can find a solid middle-of-the-rotation pitcher and an additional 'professional' hitter (as some people call them) or two without sacrificing the future, while at the same time positioning the club to play well in 2012, even as players like Harper, Rendon, etc. (not to mention the younger pitchers) continue to develop at the right pace., 77186=Jeeves, the Nats scored 624 runs this season. If they can increase that by 14% to get above 700, it certainly gets them into that range to be in the playoff discussion. Roughly 1/2 run per game more.Here's where the Nats were for BA/OBP in batting order:1st .226/ .285 2nd .222/ .283 3rd .270/ .344 4th .255/ .3305th .251/ .326 6th .260/ .330 7th .240/ .304 8th .259/ .318 There were a total of 1,485 plate appearances between the leadoff and 2nd batter. The 1st and 2nd spots got on base 412 times while a .320 OBP would get you 63 more men on base in the 1st and 2nd spots over the season. It also gets you 63 more at-bats during those games since they aren't extra outs. Not sure what metric would tell you how many of those runs would score. Now take 63 outs saved gives you an additional 63 at-bats and they get on at a .320 clip gives you 20 more base runners so of the 83 extra runners on base if 1/3 scores, you just found 27 runs.Werth needs to be in the 2 hole for 2012. BTW, Bernadina had the highest BA/OBP in the 2 hole .313/.333 in 67 plate appearances which may make that a compelling platoon in 2012 so Werth gets some days off. Werth had a .327 OBP., 68439=Jeeves,Actually, baseball does work that way most \u2014 but admittedly not all \u2014 of the time. Players' previous performances (as measured by their stats) tend to have significant predictive value, both in terms of their career averages and last season's numbers (particularly if last season's continue a several-season trend).That said, I'm an optimist and believe the Nats are heading in the right direction. Based on the production we've seen from Strasburg, Zimmermann, Lannan, Wang (I assume he'll be signed for at least one more year), and Detwiller, I expect the pitching staff to be solid next year. But I still think the Nats need to go out and sign another proven major league pitcher, not least because someone will either get hurt or slump (as Cassandra reminded us yesterday).Similarly, while I think the Nats have a decent core of position players, they still need additional bats \u2014 at least one high OBP guy and probably one more SLG/OPS guy \u2014 to complement Morse, Zimmerman, Werth, LaRoche (assuming he's fully recovered) and the rest. But given the Nats struggles at the plate in 2011 (bottom 25% in virtually every meaningful statistical category), they simply cannot stand pat. Even if every single hitter performs 10% better than last season, they would still be only a middle-of-the-pack offensive team (i.e., using a 10% increase in runs as a proxy, they would finish 8th of 16 in runs scored). Yes, they might still be in contention for a wild card spot in mid-September \u2014 which would be exciting \u2014 but they would be hard-pressed to make the playoffs.So I don't think it's defeatist to say that the Nats need to be active this offseason., 74061=Mark'd,Good point on the 'compounding' value of the individual components of hitting. I was just doing a quick, back-of-the-envelope calculation on runs scored, which I see as the best stand-alone metric for comparing team-to-team offense. I'll take your word that that's 8 additional wins. But remember that the Nats predicted wins (based on their runs scored/runs allowed) in 2011 was only 78 (not the 80 they achieved), so that still only gets them to 86 (plus or minus). Which, as I said, means that they'd be playing meaningful games in September, but without any guarantee of a playoff spot., 102604=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 992=Though Jim Riggleman knew he might never get a chance to manage again when he abruptly resigned from the Nationals in June over a contract dispute, he also knew he still had plenty of friends in the game who might be willing to offer him work., 37615=Knoxville Nat said\u2026 Steve M. said \"\u2026trade for Alex Gordan to be this team's leadoff hitter.\"Okay but what position will he play in the field? I don't see him replacing LaRoche/Morse at first or Zimmerman at third. That leaves left field as the only other position he has played in MLB (to my knowledge)and you certainly aren't thinking of replacing Morse. Has he ever played CF and if not can he handle it? What would it take to acquire him from the Royals? October 11, 2011 2:27 PM I see Gordon playing RF. See what I wrote in the \"Playoffs\" thread., 38818=To answer Mark's question, \"What would make the Nats a playoff team?\"The Nats were top 10 in pitching and bottom 10 in offense and middle 10 in defense. Since defense and pitching go hand-in-hand and your offensive players also play defense, it is important to get good 2-way players.For example, if you add a Josh Willingham for offense, you give up on defense.There is 1 offensive opening on the team with LaRoche coming back as I see it. Do you get a speedy CF who can play defense and can possibly be leadoff or get the #6 hitter who will play corner outfield and be a HR threat? I see 1 player who is a triple threat. Alex Gordon was the Royals leadoff for 89 games and spent the rest of the time in the 3 hole. He actually excelled at leadoff as kind of an Ian Kinsler type. Big power to go with high on-base and some good speed. He not only gives you the on-base threat but is also a RBI guy.For those that don't know the Gordon storyin the 2005 Draft, he was the heralded 3rd baseman who was ranked higher than Zim. JUpton went #1, Gordon went #2, RZim, #4, Braun #5, Ricky Romero #6, Tulowitzki #7, McCutcheon #11, Jay Bruce #12, Elsbury #51 so it was a bumper crop for draft picks except Alex Gordon was a late bloomer in the bunch.Gordon was a 5.9 WAR on BaseRef and 6.9 WAR on FanGraphs a .879 OPS with a .303/.376/.502 slash. Based on service time he appears to have 1 to 2 years before Free Agency. Crisp is a Free Agent and can bat almost anywhere in the batting order from leadoff to 8th. Big speed, good glove, good arm, clutch bat. Durability may be his biggest problem. He can also play off the bench.Bringing in 2 new players may be overkill but if you want to be a playoff team, you need depth.If the Nats get CJ Wilson, great, if not I pointed out a while ago 2 other lefties in Mark Buehrle who is Free Agent or Wandy Rodriguez in a trade. Both are durable pitching into the 7th inning of each game consistently. Buehrle didn't finish his season well and what I found was that is typical for him in his career. He starts out a little slow in April which is probably due to the colder Chicago weather and for May, June and July goes respectively 3.28, 3.48 to 3.79 in ERA. In August and September, he is 4.02 to 4.21.So I believe you go after another strong bat, a player like Crisp who is your insurance for leadoff and a 4th outfielder and get the #3 starter. You slide Detwiler then into the bullpen.1) Alex Gordon RF LH2) Jayson Werth CF RH3) Zim 3B RH4) Morse LF RH5) LaRoche 1B LH6) Desmond SS RH7) Espi 2B Swith8) Ramos C RH1) JZim RH2) Stras RH3) Buehrle LH4) Lannan LH5) Wang RH1) Gorzo Longman LH2) HenRod RH stopper3) Coffey RH stopper4) Mattheus RH5) Burnett LH6) Detwiler LH 7th inning setup7) Clippard RH 8th inning setup8) Storen RH closer1) Crisp CF Switch2) Flores C RH3) Lombo Infield Swith4) Ankiel OF SwitchI am thinking Davey goes with an 8 man 'pen and 1 short on the bench.
