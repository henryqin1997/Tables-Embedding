In years past, \u201ctin canners,\u201d as they call themselves, have come from as far away as New York, Michigan and Wisconsin to camp and show off their vintage RVs that span several decades. Most have been restored or are in the process of being restored, said Bruce Wilson, co-owner of Ada Blue Cafe, located near the RV park., 27138=The Great Suwannee River Clean-up, initiated and coordinated by Current Problems Executive Director Fritzi Olson, is nearing the end of the historic river and the final 2014 clean-up.\u00a0 The last 20 miles will be tackled by the Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge, the Friends of the Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuges and all the volunteers they can muster., 29711=The Levy County Schools Foundation will be hosting its 5th Annual Beast Feast on Saturday, Oct. 25, at the Etheridge Cracker House, NE 140th Avenue, Williston.\u00a0Gate opens at 5:30 p.m. Dinner will begin being served at 6 p.m. An interesting selection of specialties like gator tail, possum ribs and venison along with some good old-fashioned southern classics like mullet, grits and swamp cabbage will be served up by Levy County\u2019s very own businesses, politicians and community groups.

Fox is a potter whose work is very organic. She mostly hand-builds her pottery using an iron-rich clay and impressing designs into the wet clay. She leaves the pieces unglazed, resulting in a rich, high-fired red oxide color and a very tactile surface. Fox creates a wide range of ceramic items using this technique., 18896=Month of November, 31223=Artist of the Month The Cedar Keyhole\u2019s Artist of the Month for October is Sheila Thomas. Thomas is represented in the gallery in several mediums \u2013 photography, pottery, cast paper ornaments and notepads, fabric bookmarks and flowers artfully created out of pine cones and brightly painted. Her photographs are of Cedar Key scenes and wildlife, including the once iconic \u201choneymoon cottage\u201d which is now just four pilings in the water., 18973=The Cedar Keyhole\u2019s Artist of the Month for December is Harry MacLeod. MacLeod uses a scroll saw to create interesting and fun works in wood, which include puzzles, small sculptures, animals, intricate scenes, tree ornaments and signs for the home. His works are primarily left in the natural wood state, but some are colorfully painted.}",
