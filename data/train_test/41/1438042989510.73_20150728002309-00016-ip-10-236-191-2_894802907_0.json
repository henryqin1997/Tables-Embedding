I believe this branch is not copied from the GitHub repository because there are no files in the branch, and git ignores it. This caused me confusion, until I tried \"git checkout --track origin/empty\" on the next page, which magically created the branch in my local repository. I'd suggest either omitting the \"empty\" branch tag from the listing on page 28, or put a .gitignore file in the branch so git has something to work with (that's the suggestion here: git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#Can_I_add_empty_directories.3F)--Philip Steiner #50702: In section 3.2 \"Setting Up Puppet\", the listing for \"git branch -a\" shows a branch named \"empty\", however when I executed the command on my lo...more...",
