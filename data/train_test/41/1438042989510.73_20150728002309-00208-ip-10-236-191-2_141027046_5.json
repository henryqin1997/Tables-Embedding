You must be Have your say...show next 15 replies showing 1 through 15 of 35 replies View all replies \u00bb -- What causes a person to be a blue collar worker? I just noticed while reading the local news (online of course) there will be a funeral today for a cop killed in the line of duty. It got me to thinking about which groups of individuals have the most dangerous job. Most would say police, fireman, teacher, etc. However, I think drug dealers probably have the most dangerous job\u2026bar none. If they could unionize it would probably help them alot. Better yet if they fell under OSHA they would be really safe. What do you think? Am I right? #15 posted 01-21-2013 05:32 PM",
