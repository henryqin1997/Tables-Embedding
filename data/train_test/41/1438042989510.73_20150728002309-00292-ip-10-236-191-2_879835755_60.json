    "textAfterTable": "Did enjoy being here Being in a different country was a really great decision for me! I have always wanted to travel and with the Global College, you get to not only be immersed in another culture, you get to travel around and go on field trips! Also, the class size is pretty small (ranging from about 20-40) so you get to know the other students and the teachers very well and become like family. In the first year of the program, students live with host families and then have the option to get an apartment. Many people stay long-time friends with their host families and the friends they make in their travels around the world. Did learn a lot I was in the Global College of Long Island University, a school/program that is affiliated with Long Island University. At this school, students go to a different country every year -- the first year to Costa Rica, and the following years places like India, Thailand, Turkey, Taiwan, Australia and more! During my year in Costa Rica, my views were challenged and my mindset broadened. The program includes a lot of interactive learning, field study and independent study which allows students to get an in-depth knowledge of the region they are living in and learning about while giving them the opportunity to focus on their own",
