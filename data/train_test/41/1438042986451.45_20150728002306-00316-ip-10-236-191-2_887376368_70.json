            "There are many clubs and groups to join, too many to name. School host many events like fashion shows, pageants, cultural shows, Apollo Night, Mr.Smooth Contest, Poetry Slams, Tea Parties, and parties hosted by which ever club. Students can ice skate in the arena, play many sports in the gym or exercise. Many events happen off- campus as well or at University at Buffalo. Also you can watch the school's sports teams play, go to the lake, or the many museums across the street.",
            "There is good food and there is bad food. There are cooks that you would prefer over others. There are a variety of food that is served including Chinese, Mexican, and the usual one eats at home. There are retail stores Subway, Train Grill, which serves sandwiches like Bronx burger or Brooklyn cheese burger, Salsarita, Jamba Juice, Tomato, and this Jamaican retail store.",
            "I have only lived in a freshman dorm so far but there is two three floor dorms and another dorm that has like ten floors. Dorms are warm and a nice size. There are singles, doubles, and triples, but all rooms are the same size despite the number of roomates. Dorms have lounge, kitchen, free laundry room, computer lab, and study quad. Bathrooms get cleaned by workers everyday. I have heard some complaints of lack of warm water. So far I have not heard of any theft, however theft is a problem in most dorms.",
            "There are challenging classes and there are easy classes, but that applies to all colleges. Many students strive for excellence. There are a variety of academic programs available for students to take.",
            "-Bring clothes for all seasons because the weather is bipolar here. -It is good to have a car because although the school is not in a rural area, desired places are not too close like how they would be in the city. -Save a lot of money. Traveling from here to the city is not cheap. The school likes to make there own books so you may not find your required books on Amazon or what ever other book selling websites, and the school sells their books at a high price. Most of the parties or events on and off campus are not free.",
            "This is a very culturally diverse school. It is an affordable institution. A medium sized school that thrives it's students to success."

I do have to say though there are a lot of what they call foundation courses they make you take that I find useless to the actual degree I am going for., 339956=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 12262=I am going to be a Music/Communications major at the school in the fall of 2011. I anticipate learning a lot, because despite this being the biggest SUNY school in the system, the music program at Buff State is small, selective, and home-y. The Communications department is one of the three accredited ones in New York State (Syracuse is one of the others, I don't remember the other), which is ridiculously impressive for a SUNY school; only about 15% or so of colleges NATIONALLY get accredited!, 2418=The professors I have had since beginning Fall 2008 have been extremely helpful. They are available before and after class if you would like to speak with them and also through email. No matter what your problem is, they do what they can to assist you., 25436=It's not really a tradition but we do the wobble. I learned it during my freshmen orientation it's one of those cute school spirit things that's fun to do every once in a while. They have a how to video on YouTube called the Orientation Wobble where some of the orientation leaders of 2011 show you the basic steps., 313634=There's a time span from 12:15-1:30 called Bengal Pause which is a time on campus where most students don't have classes and they can use this time in various ways whether they want to discuss their work with their professors, go to the student fitness center to workout, or just socialize. During times of the year when the weather is nice there's music blasting from speakers in the courtyard that student can listen or even dance to which is very refreshing., 92613=they have a new building which is beautiful which i spent my first year residing , the 2am, 415, and sometimes 5:30 fire drills do become annoying but as people get adjusted in the building it does stop., 76227=Campus police patrol the area quite a bit; however, this is not a school that you will feel safe walking around the campus at 1:00 AM. There is some crime in the area, but just be cautious.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Buffalo State is perfect for students looking for more than just an education, students hoping to make friends and get involved; it is large enough to feel like a real college but small enough to become acquainted with professors, to make friends easily and participate in some of the many clubs. There is a great social atmosphere at buff state including a lot of student-focused activities day and night. Tips for prospective students Whether you dorm or live at home, get involved on campus! The best way to make the most of your college experience is to try something new, you never know, you just might like it. Also, don't be afraid to talk to your teachers and ask questions, it's your grade, don't be too cool to do well. Teachers at Buff State have designated office hours and they love when students stop by with questions or comments about class. Make sure to get your financial aide information taken care of quickly because it may put a hold on your account that could delay registration for classes. Bang for the buck Buffalo State College is a very affordable four-year college. For in-state students living at home, tuition is under $5,000 a year and for resident students, tuition, room and board plus meal plans",
