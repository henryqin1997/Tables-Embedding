In 2003, we took that same philosophy and expanded our product offering to other technology products such as digital pictures frames, solar chargers, etc.\u00a0Today, we are considered a top industry supplier in the promotional industry.\u00a0 Several companies tout Custom Logo USB drives \u2013 but they are just \u201cdecorators.\u201d\u00a0They buy USB drives and simply imprint a logo, hope it sticks, and on to the next customer.\u00a0As a true manufacturer and committed business partner, PromoLocker does not begin production until we receive your order\u2026from the ground up!, 52828=July 31, 2015, 51554=August 2, 2015, 52536=August 1, 2015}",
    "textBeforeTable": "As usual, we put the drives to the regular HD Tach test to measure its transfer rate. TRANSFER RATE When I saw the mock up, I liked what I\u00a0saw from the pictures. However, I was really surprised by how good it looked when I opened up the samples. \u00a0 If you look at the pictures above, you actually cannot tell how good the logos are as the pictures are a bit washed out. The actual unit\u2019s logo is shinier and much more vibrant (most likely due to the coating). The color also looks fuller and darker. Although we cannot verify whether the imprints will wear off or not for a long term usage, what we can say is that we tried to rub the imprints back and forth and even used an eraser to attempt to wear off the imprints. I even tried to use my finger to scratch the imprints, but the imprints stayed shinny without any sign of wearing off or discoloration. The coating that was applied to the drives seems to do the job fairly well and, not only that, it gave the logo a glossy feel, which looks quite nice. \u00a0 Here you can see Bjorn3D logo being printed these",
    "textAfterTable": "Keep in mind that the performance of the drives will\u00a0depend on the memory that was used. Since PromoLocker does not disclose which memory they use on their drives, it is not guaranteed that each stick of memory will have the similar performance. Though the Flip Drive and the Illuminator\u2019s performance is not the best we have seen with USB flash drives, they are nonetheless not a slow drives either. The Bowling Pin\u2019s performance on the other hand is one of the best we have seen. It yields one of the best transfer rates we have seen with the USB flash drives and\u00a0only the OCZ Throttle is able to out-perform it. CONCLUSION When we were first contacted by PromoLocker about customized USB Drives for Bjorn3D, we didn\u2019t know what to expect. We thought that \u201cOkay, a customized USB stick. It is merely as simple as submitting our logo\u00a0for them to put onto the drives. Then\u00a0after a few weeks we will receive our\u00a0review sample.\u201d We did not expect the type of personalized service we get from the PromoLocker. The personalized service we get allows us to save a lot headache of creating and modification of logos so it would look great on the drive. The fact that we get a preview of the finalized product before it goes into production helps us to avoid the possibilities of getting a poorly made product or unsatisfactory design. In a consumer\u2019s point of view, this type of service would save\u00a0money as you will not",
