    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{75627=FIGS. 39-42 illustrate a probe, generally designated 331, modified for use with a conventional carrier 301 of the type described above. The probe 331 is similar to the bovine probe 271 previously described, having a probe body 333, a probing member 335 at the forward end of the body curving forwardly and laterally outwardly in spiral fashion beyond the forward end of the probe body 333, and a passage 337 through the body through which the carrier may be inserted. However, this probe 331 is different in that it includes a gripping mechanism, generally indicated at 341, for gripping the cannula 303 and releasably holding it in selected axial positions relative to the probe so that the embryo transfer process to be described later can be conveniently carried out. The dimensions of the probe should also be suitable to handle the cannula. By way of example, the probing member 335 may have a diameter of 0.05-0.15 in., while the ball-shaped tip 343 of the probing member may have a diameter of 0.1-0.3 in.; the arch connector 345 may have a length of 0.4-1.0 in. with a bend radius of 0.3 in. (R1, R2), and may project laterally outward from the central longitudinal axis of the probe body 0.2-0.65 in.; and the probe body 333 may be formed from 61/2 gage stainless steel tubing having an inside diameter of 0.168 in., an outside diameter of 0.188 in. (7-gage tubing can also be used having an inside diameter of 0.15 in and an outside diameter of 0.18 in.), and a length of 14-20 in., 39875=The second part, shown in FIG. 4, comprises a probe generally indicated at 41 having a long tubular 43 body with open forward and rearward ends indicated at 45 and 47, respectively, and a probing member comprising a slender, finger-like member 49 (or, more simply, a finger) projecting in an non-axial direction from the probe body generally adjacent its forward end. More specifically, as illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, the finger 49 curves or arcs in spiral fashion laterally outwardly and forwardly from the probe body substantially beyond its forward end, the arc A shown in FIG. 5 being centered on a point P1 generally in-line with the probe body, and the arc B shown in FIG. 6 being centered on a point P2 generally in-line with the central longitudinal axis 51 of the probe body. The finger has a blunt and enlarged forward end indicated at 53. The probe body 43 and finger 49 are preferably formed as a single piece of metal, such as stainless steel, but may also be formed of plastic. The diameter of the finger 49 is preferably 0.05-0.15 in., while the diameter of the enlarged forward end 53 may be 0.1-0.2 in. Additionally, the length of the arching finger 49 is preferably 0.4-0.8 in. and the laterally outward projection of the finger from the central longitudinal axis 51 of the probe body 43 may be 0.2-0.45 in. By way of example, arc A may have a radius of about 0.43 in. and arc B may have a radius of about 0.5 in. The probe body may be formed from 12-gage hypodermic stainless steel tubing having an outside diameter of 0.109 in. and an inside diameter of 0.085 in. The length of the probe body may range from 16 in. to 28 in. For reasons which will become apparent hereinafter, the forward end 45 of the probe body is formed with an internal annular shoulder 55 forming an abutment (the inside diameter of the probe body rearward of this shoulder or abutment may be 0.109 in., for example, and the inside diameter of the probe body forward of this abutment may be 0.075 in., for example)., 66874=The system used to effect bovine embryo transplant is similar in certain respects to the system described above. It includes a probe, generally designated 271 in FIGS. 28-31, and the carrier 201 described above comprising straw 203, connector 217 and guide member 211. The probe 271 is very similar to probe 41 in that it comprises a slender, finger-like probing member 273 which curves forward and laterally outward from the probe body 277 in spiral fashion. However, in contrast to the probe 41 for pigs, the bovine probe 271 arches or spirals in the opposite direction as viewed from the front of the probe looking rearwardly (FIG. 29). This is to accommodate the physical anatomy of the bovine genital tract, which is different from a porcine tract. The probing member 273 has an enlarged ball-shaped tip 275 which is connected to the body 277 of the probe by a connecting arch 279. Like the probing member used in the probe 41 for pigs, the diameter of the probing member 273 for use in bovine is preferably 0.05-0.15 in. The diameter of the ball-shaped tip 275 of the probing member 273 may be 0.1-0.3 in. Additionally, the length of the arch 279 is preferably 0.4-1.0 in., the radii R1 and R2 (FIGS. 29 and 30) may be about 0.3 in., and the laterally outward projection of the probing member from the central longitudinal axis of the probe body may be 0.2-0.45 in. The probe body 277 has an internal shoulder 281 forming an abutment similar to the shoulder abutment 55 described above. This shoulder 281 is engageable by the annular stop 233 on the connector 217 of the carrier 201 during the transfer process. The probe body 277 has a handle 285 at its rearward end similar to handle 27, the rearward end of the passage through the probe being chamfered as indicated at 287 (FIG. 30) to facilitate insertion of the carrier into the probe. The overall length of the probe body 277 from its forward end to its rearward end may range from 14 in. to 20 in., which is generally shorter than the porcine probe body 43., 26125=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/438,174, filed May 9, 1995, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,636 on Sep. 24, 1996 and is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/438,162, filed May 9, 1995, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,010 on Aug. 12, 1997., 27183=One attempt at a non-surgical embryo transfer is described by J. M. Galvin et al. in \"Theriogenology\" 41:1279-1289, 1994. The described procedure involves inserting a tubular instrument (spirette) into the cervix of a recipient pig, and then forcing 10-12 milliliters of liquid medium containing embryos into and through the instrument, the objective being to deposit the embryos in the uterus. However, this procedure has several serious drawbacks. First, there is no way to determine whether the instrument has been inserted far enough into the cervix so that its forward end is adjacent the body of the uterus. As a result, in instances where the forward end of the instrument remains lodged within the cervix, the embryos may never reach the uterus. Also, if the instrument is inserted too far, the uterus or surrounding tissue may be damaged. Another disadvantage of this procedure is that the relatively large quantity of liquid introduced into the cervix and uterus tends to make the uterine environment unsuitable for growth of the embryos.}",

It is contemplated that the present invention may be applicable to animals other than pigs and cows. For example, it is believed the system and methodology described above is suitable for transferring embryos to any female animal having a cervix structure which poses a natural barrier against the conveyance of embryos therethrough. It will also be understood that the probe of this system may be used in other non-surgical procedures which require penetration into the uterus of an animal, such as recovering fluid or tissue from the uterus of the animal. The cannula 303 is forwarded through the uterine horn until it passes the edge of the dorsal intercornual ligament 263, as shown in FIG. 46. The embryos-containing fluid is then released by using the ram 371 (which is sized for insertion into the holder 321) to push the plug 323 in the embryo holder forwardly to force the fluid out the open forward end of the holder and into the cannula for exit through the",
