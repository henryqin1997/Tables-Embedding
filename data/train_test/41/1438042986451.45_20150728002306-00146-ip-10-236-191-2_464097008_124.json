    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{512753=Our management determines the collectability of outstanding accounts by maintaining at least quarterly communication with such customers and obtaining confirmation of their intent to fulfill their obligations to the Company. In making this determination, our management also considers past collection experience, our relationship with customers and the impact of current economic conditions on our industry and market. We note that the continuation or intensification of the current global economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations. To reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable, for the three months ended September 30, 2012, our management has made a 50% provision for all accounts receivable that are over 180 days past due and full provision for all accounts receivable over one year past due. From time to time, we will review these credit periods, along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above, to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts, and to make changes to the allowance, if necessary. If our actual collection experience or other conditions change, revisions to our allowances may be required, including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income, or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected., 494064=Our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations. Our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures, working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness. We have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations, equity financing, and bank debt. As of September 30, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.6 million., 490288=Loss from operations increased by $3,008,744, or 847.4%, period-on-period, to a loss of $3,363,798 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from$355,054 for the three months ended September 30, 2011, as a result of the factors discussed above., 187458=Bad debts are written off for past due balances over two years or when it becomes known to management that such amount is uncollectible. There was a provision for accounts receivable bad debts of $1,373,000 and $nil recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively., 288193=The weighted-average interest rate on short-term loans at September 30, 2012 and 2011 was 6.9% and 7.54%, respectively. Principal and interest under the short-term loans totaling $27,551,689 with RZB were to be repaid in full on July 31, 2012, but the Company has defaulted on this repayment obligation. The Company is currently in discussions with RZB regarding the restructuring of the loans for repayment but has not yet agreed on specific terms. Any restructuring will be subject to approval by RZB\u2019s governing bodies, and to the Company\u2019s ability to meet certain conditions and requirements that may be imposed by the Bank. RZB also has the right to take possession of the collateral granted in connection with their respective loan agreements, which action would have a material adverse impact on the Company., 327510=For the three months ended September 30, 2012, warrants to purchase 118,333 shares at an exercise price of $101.40 were not included as their effect would have been anti-dilutive, however, securities represented by the 118,333 warrants still outstanding could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future., 130350=For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2012, 552340=Below is a table setting forth our material contractual obligations as of September 30, 2012, debt obligations include principal repayments and interest payments:, 216416=Despite these changes, the EIT Law gives the FIEs established before March 16, 2007 (\u201cOld FIEs\u201d) a five-year grandfather period during which they can continue to enjoy their existing preferential tax treatments, commonly referred to as \u201ctax holidays\u201d, until these holidays expire. As an Old FIE, Chengtong\u2019s tax holiday of a 50% reduction in the 25% statutory rates expired on December 31, 2008 and it is currently subject to the 25% statutory rates since January 1, 2009; Shanghai Blessford\u2019s full tax exemption from the enterprise income tax expired on December 31, 2009, and it is subject to a 50% reduction for the three subsequent years expiring on December 31, 2012. Subsequent to the expiry of their tax holidays, Chengtong and Shanghai Blessford will be subject to enterprise income taxes at 25% or the prevailing statutory rates. The discontinuation of any such special or preferential tax treatment or other incentives would have an adverse effect on any organization\u2019s business, fiscal condition and current operations in China., 504907=Net cash flows used in financing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2012 were $nil, as compared to $810,921 for the three months ended September 30, 2011, for a net decrease of $810,921 as the Company did not make any loan repayment during the three months ended September 30, 2012., 16010=The number of shares outstanding of each of the issuer\u2019s classes of common stock, as of November 12, 2012 is as follows:, 488371=Allowance for bad and doubtful debts increased by $1,373,000, or 100.0%, period-on-period. Allowance recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2012 was in the amount of $1,373,000 in accordance with our policy for allowance for doubtful accounts., 534652=As of September 30, 2012, we had $27,551,689 in short-term loans. Principal and interest under the loans were to be repaid in full on July 31, 2012, but the Company has defaulted on this repayment obligation. The Company is currently in discussion with its bank regarding the restructuring of these loans but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully work out a repayment plan or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the loan., 535604=During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we invested $7,424 in purchases of additional property, plant and equipment., 179142=In June and July 2012, the Company defaulted on the repayment obligations of its short-term and long-term bank loans totaling $43,751,689. The Company is currently in discussions with its banks regarding the restructuring of these loans for repayment but has not yet agreed on specific terms. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully work out a repayment plan or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the loans. The uncertainty surrounding the successful restructuring of our bank loans and our current lack of readily available liquidity provided by other third party sources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern., 532705=Management continues to take appropriate actions to perform business and credit reviews of any prospective customers (whether new or returning) to protect the Company from any who might pose a high credit risk to our business based on their commercial credit reports, our past collection history with them, and our perception of the risk posed by their geographic location. For example, we have halted since the year ended June 30, 2011 all our sales transactions directly with customers in the Philippines as we consider the associated credit risk to be relatively high. Based on publicly available reports, such as that issued by A.M. Best, there is a high risk that financial volatility may erupt in that country due to inadequate reporting standards, a weak banking system or asset markets and/or poor regulatory structure. We expect to resume such exports when conditions improve., 20890=Three Months Ended September 30, 2012, 241594=The Company\u2019s list of suppliers whose sales to us exceeded 10% of our total purchases during the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:, 505439=On December 30, 2008, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC, which was declared effective on December 10, 2009. The shelf registration will permit us to issue securities valued at up to an aggregate of $40 million. The effective registration statement provides us with the flexibility to issue registered securities, from time to time, in one or more separate offerings or other transactions with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of issuance. Although we do not have any commitments or current intentions to sell securities under the registration statement, we believe that it is prudent to have a shelf registration statement in place to ensure financing flexibility should the need arise., 492389=For the three months ended September 30, 2012, we recognized no income tax expense, compared to an income tax expense of $54,312 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease of $54,312, or 100.0%, in income tax expense was a result of the net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2012., 573482=On March 15, 2012, the Company received notice of a complaint filed by Mr. Haining Zhang and China Venture Partners, Inc. in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York on March 9, 2012, against several defendants, including the Company, as successor to OraLabs Holding Corp. In the complaint Mr. Zhang is alleging, among other things, breach of contract by the Company and certain of our former officers, directors and control persons, in connection with our December 2006 acquisition of Partner Success Holdings Limited. Among other things, Mr. Zhang alleges that the defendants breached an agreement to compensate him for services he allegedly performed in connection with seeking out a merger candidate for the Company. The Company believes that the suit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend its interests in the case. The Company was granted court permission to file a motion to dismiss the action as against it. Prior to filing the motion to dismiss, plaintiffs amended their complaint. Accordingly, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion has now been fully briefed by the parties. The court has not yet advised whether it will permit oral argument on the motion prior to issuing a decision. An estimate of any potential loss cannot be made at this time., 351238=In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, (\u201cASU 2011-11\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2011-11 require entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on an entity\u2019s financial position. The amendments require enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (i) offset in accordance with current literature or (ii) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with current literature. ASU 2011-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This standard will become effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2013. The Company does not believe adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements., 274453=Depreciation expense related to manufacturing is included as a component of cost of goods sold. During the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, depreciation totaling $1,782,079 and $1,606,329, respectively, was included as a component of cost of goods sold., 11228=Indicate by check mark whether the registrant (1) has filed all reports required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2) has been subject to such filing requirements for the past 90 days. Yes [\u00a0\u00a0] No [\u00a0\u00a0], 487586=Administrative expenses increased by $148,539 or 50.5%, period-on-period, to $442,615 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $294,076 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. This was mainly due to an increase in legal and professional fees period-on-period., 228173=Fair Value of Financial Instruments \u2013 The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, other receivables, short-term loans, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other payables approximate their fair values as at September 30 and June 30, 2012 because of the relatively short-term maturity of these instruments. The Company considers the carrying amount of long-term loans to approximate their fair values based on the interest rates of the instruments and the current market rate of interest., 253529=The Company provides credit in the normal course of business. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its domestic and international customers and clients and maintains allowances for bad and doubtful accounts based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers and clients, historical trends, and other information. Trade accounts receivable, net totaled $57,932,138 and $59,116,931 as of September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively., 565385=For the three months ended September 30, 2012, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements., 483579=The cost of raw materials consumed decreased by $34,021,970, or 88.5%, period-on-period, to $4,435,761 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $38,457,731 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. This decrease was mainly due to a substantial decrease in total units sold during the three months ended September 30, 2012., 352708=In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (\u201cASU 2012-02\u201d). ASU 2012-02 amends Topic 350 by establishing an optional two-step analysis for impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill. This update allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. Under that option, an entity no longer would be required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset unless the entity determines, based on that qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012 and early adoption is permitted. This standard will become effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2013. The Company does not believe adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements., 276242=As of September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, construction-in-progress consisted of the following:, 309981=Significant components of the Group\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012 are as follows:, 295188=In June 2012, the Company has defaulted on its semi-annual principal and interest repayment obligation. The Company is currently in discussions with DEG regarding the restructuring of the loans for repayment but has not yet agreed on specific terms. Until such agreement is reached, DEG has the right to cancel the total outstanding commitment of the loan, demand immediate repayment of all or part of the loan with accrued interest, and/or terminate the loan agreement. DEG also has the right to take possession of the collateral granted in connection with its respective loan agreements, which action would have a material adverse impact on the Company., 315246=The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability as its foreign subsidiaries do not have any undistributed earnings as of September 30, 2012. A deferred tax liability will be recognized when the Company has undistributed earnings and no longer plans to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings., 9831=852-2543-2290, 225691=The revised People\u2019s Republic of China Tentative Regulations on Value Added Tax became effective on January 1, 2009 with the issuance of Order of the State Council No. 538. With the implementation of this VAT reform, input VAT associated with the purchase of fixed assets is now deductible against output VAT., 328230=For the three months ended September 30, 2011, warrants to purchase 118,333 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $101.40 were not included as their effect would have been anti-dilutive., 251839=Our management continues to take appropriate actions to perform ongoing business and credit reviews of our customers to reduce our exposure to new and recurring customers who have been deemed to pose a high credit risk to our business based on their commercial credit reports, our collection history, and our perception of the risk posed by their geographic location. We have halted all our direct sales to customers located in the Philippines since the year ended June 30, 2009 as we consider the associated credit risk to be relatively high. Based on publicly available reports, such as that issued by A.M. Best, there is a high risk that financial volatility may erupt in that country due to inadequate reporting standards, a weak banking system or asset markets and/or poor regulatory structure. We expect to resume such exports when conditions improve., 214177=On March 16, 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of China passed The Enterprise Income Tax Law (the \u201cNew EIT Law\u201d), and on December 6, 2007, the State Council of China passed the Implementing Rules for the EIT Law (\u201cImplementing Rules\u201d) which took effect on January 1, 2008. The New EIT Law and Implementing Rules impose a unified enterprise income tax (\u201cEIT\u201d) of 25% on all domestic-invested enterprises and foreign invested entities (\u201cFIEs\u201d), unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions. Therefore, nearly all FIEs are subject to the new tax rate alongside other domestic businesses rather than benefiting from the old FIE tax laws, and its associated preferential tax treatments, beginning January 1, 2008., 230441=The Company\u2019s list of customers whose purchases from us were 10% or more of total sales during the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:, 344194=On March 15, 2012, the Company received notice of a complaint filed by a Mr. Haining Zhang and China Venture Partners, Inc. in the U.S. Southern District Court of New York on March 9, 2012, against several defendants, including the Company, as successor to OraLabs Holding Corp. In the complaint Mr. Zhang is alleging, among other things, breach of contract by the Company and certain of our former officers, directors and control persons, in connection with our December 2006 acquisition of Partner Success Holdings Limited. Among other things, Mr. Zhang alleges that the defendants breached an agreement to compensate him for services he allegedly performed in connection with seeking out a merger candidate for the Company. The Company believes that the suit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend its interests in the case. The Company was granted court permission to file a motion to dismiss the action as against it. Prior to filing the motion to dismiss, plaintiffs amended their complaint. Accordingly, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion has now been fully briefed by the parties. The court has not yet advised whether it will permit oral argument on the motion prior to issuing a decision., 407089=A break-down of our sales by product line for the periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:, 200781=Capitalized Interest \u2013 The Company capitalizes interest cost on borrowings incurred during the new construction or upgrade of qualified assets. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company capitalized $nil interest to construction-in-progress., 298453=On November 6, 2007, in connection with the Subscription Agreement, the Company issued to certain institutional accredited investors warrants to purchase 118,333 shares of Common Stock valued at $5,374,748, and Roth Capital Partners, LLC, as placement agent, received warrants to purchase 18,800 shares of Common Stock valued at $887,504. These amounts were recorded as syndication fees offsetting additional paid-in capital. Warrants issued to Roth Capital were not exercised and expired on November 5, 2010., 560187=In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Disclosures About Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, (\u201cASU 2011-11\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2011-11 require entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on an entity\u2019s financial position. The amendments require enhanced disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (i) offset in accordance with current literature or (ii) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with current literature. ASU 2011-11 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This standard will become effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2013. The Company does not believe adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements., 378110=In June and July 2012, we defaulted on the repayment obligations of our short-term and long-term bank loans totaling $43,751,689. We are currently in discussions with our banks regarding the restructuring of these loans for repayment but have not yet agreed on specific terms. Any restructuring will be subject to approval by the banks\u2019 governing bodies, and to our ability to meet certain conditions and requirements that may be imposed by the banks. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully work out a repayment plan or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the loans. We are implementing a series of measures, discussed above, to remodel our business to make it sustainable, and as part of the ongoing discussions with banks to potentially restructure our bank loans., 180416=The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2012 and for the periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X applicable to smaller reporting companies. In the opinion of management, these unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments considered necessary to make the financial statements not misleading. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending June 30, 2013., 503192=Our uses of cash for investing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2012 were for the purchase of additional property, plant and equipment to complement our existing production facilities., 287221=The above bank loans outstanding at September 30, 2012 are Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d) loans, carry an interest rate of 1.15 times the standard market rate set by the PBOC, and are secured by inventories, land use rights, buildings and plant and machinery, and guaranteed by PSHL and our former Chairman, Mr. Wo Hing Li. In addition, pursuant to a bank loan agreement entered into between the Company and Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG (\u201cRZB\u201d), Mr. Li undertakes to maintain a shareholding percentage in the Company of not less than 33.4% unless otherwise agreed to with RZB., 35066=FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2012 AND 2011, 491008=Other income decreased by $96, or 48.2%, to $103 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $199 for the three months ended September 30, 2011, due to lower interest income period-on-period., 465814=Sales revenue generated from our top five major customers as a percentage of total sales was 46% for the three months ended September 30, 2012, as compared to 66% in 2011. The change in customer mix reflects management\u2019s continuous efforts in expanding our customer base and geographical coverage during the course of the quarter., 547576=On January 29, 2010, Shanghai Blessford entered into a Senior Loan Agreement with DEG -Deutsche Investitions-Und Entwicklungsgesellschaft Mbh, or \u201cDEG,\u201d for a loan amount up to $18,000,000 at an annual interest rate of 4.5% above the six-month USD LIBOR rate. The loan is secured by a mortgage on the new cold rolling line and annealing furnaces at Shanghai Blessford\u2019s facilities and guaranteed by the Company. The loan was to have been repaid semi-annually over five years starting on December 15, 2011, but the Company has defaulted on this repayment obligation, as well as on repayment of the June 15, 2011 installment. The Company is currently in discussions with DEG regarding the restructuring of the loans for repayment but has not yet agreed on specific terms. Until such agreement is reached, DEG has the right to cancel the total outstanding commitment of the loan, demand immediate repayment of the loan or any part thereof together with accrued interest, and/or terminate the loan agreement. DEG may also take possession of the collateral granted in connection with their respective loan agreements, which would have a material adverse impact on the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully work out a repayment plan with DEG or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the loan., 348570=The assets are subject to impairment consideration under ASC 360-10-35-17 if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might not be recoverable. In accordance with ASC 360, as of September 30, 2012, as the Company\u2019s market capitalization was lower than the carrying value of its assets, management performed an impairment test pursuant to the guidance outlined in ASC 360-10-35-21 and no impairment charges were recognized for the relevant year. As of September 30, 2012, the Company expects these assets to be fully recoverable based on the result of the impairment test. Goodwill amounting to $99,999 as at September 30, 2012 was considered immaterial and not tested for impairment in accordance with ASC 350., 257108=As of September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, inventories consisted of the following:, 447360=The average selling price per ton decreased to $768 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $926 in 2011, representing a decrease of $158, or 17.1%, period-on-period. This decrease was mainly due to decreases in general steel prices and therefore our selling prices during the quarter. Average selling prices decreased across all product categories during the three months ended September 30, 2012., 466641=Cost of sales decreased by $34,681,364, or 82.4%, period-on-period, to $7,423,709 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $42,105,073 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. Cost of sales represented 124.6% of sales revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to 99.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2011. Average cost per unit sold increased to $957 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $924 for the three months ended September 30, 2011, representing an increase of $33 per ton, or 3.6%, period-on-period., 493165=Net loss increased by $3,143,188, or 291.3%, period-on-period, to $4,222,283 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $1,024,783 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. The increase in net loss is attributable to a combination of all the factors discussed above, principally the negative gross margin and the increase in allowance for bad and doubtful debts., 90278=For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, 501564=For the three months ended September 30, 2012, sales revenues generated from the top five major customers as a percentage of total sales was 46%, as compared to 66% in the prior period. The loss of all or portion of the sales volume from a significant customer would have an adverse effect on our operating cash flows. We note that the continuation or intensification of the worldwide economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations to us, resulting in unrecoverable losses on our accounts receivable. We have been strengthening our collection activities and will continue to closely monitor any changes in collection experience and the credit ratings of our customers. From time to time we will review credit periods offered, along with our collection experience and the other relevant factors, to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts, and to make changes to the allowance, if necessary. Delays or non-payment of accounts receivable would have an adverse effect on our operating cash flows., 568705=During its review of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012, our management concluded that our accounting staff lacked sufficient accounting skills and experience necessary to fulfill our public reporting obligations according to U.S. GAAP and the SEC\u2019s rules and regulations., 279561=Land use rights amounting to $1,887,900 (June 30, 2012: $1,877,363) were pledged for short-term loans totaling $27,551,689 at September 30, 2012 (June 30, 2012: $27,246,477)., 511620=Accounts receivable, representing 50.1% of total current assets as of September 30, 2012, is a significant asset of the Company. We offer credit to our customers in the normal course of our business and accounts receivable is stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit periods vary substantially across industries, segments, types and size of companies in China where we principally operate our business. Because of the niche products that we process, our customers are usually also niche players in their own respective segment, who then sell their products to the end product manufacturers. The business cycle is relatively long, as well as the credit periods. The Company offers credit to its customers for periods of 60 days, 90 days, 120 days and 180 days. We generally offer longer credit terms to long-standing recurring customers with good payment histories and sizable operations., 356412=In addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We use words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201coptimistic,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201caim,\u201d \u201cwill\u201d or similar expressions which are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include, among others, those concerning market and industry segment growth and demand and acceptance of new and existing products; any projections of sales, earnings, revenue, margins or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; and any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance, as well as all assumptions, expectations, predictions, intentions or beliefs about future events. You are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions, which, if they were to ever materialize or prove incorrect, could cause the results of the Company to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, among other things, factors such as: plans to expand our exports outside of China; plans to increase our production capacity and the anticipated dates that such facilities may commence operations; our ability to obtain additional funding for our continuing operations and to fund our expansion; our ability to meet our financial projections for any financial year; our ability to retain our key executives and to hire additional senior management; continued growth of the Chinese economy and industries demanding our products; our ability to secure at acceptable prices the raw materials we need to produce our products; political changes in China that may impact our ability to produce and sell our products in our target markets; general business conditions and competitive factors, including pricing pressures and product development; and changes in our relationships with customers and suppliers. You should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2012., 297036=In June 2012, the stockholders of the Company approved the authority of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to effect a one-for-twelve reverse stock split of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock. The reverse stock split became effective on August 27, 2012 and as a result of the reverse stock split, the issued and outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock decreased to 3,880,866 shares, without any change in the par value of such shares. These consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented., 3418=[X] QUARTERLY REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 514806=September 30, 2012, 506429=Our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities will vary from quarter to quarter, and are dependent on factors such as volume of business and payment terms with our customers. As such, we may need to rely on access to the financial markets to provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, the current uncertainty arising out of domestic and global economic conditions, including the continuing disruption in credit markets, poses a risk to the economies in which we operate and may adversely impact our potential sources of capital financing. The general unavailability of credit could make capital financing more expensive for us or impossible altogether. Even if we are able to obtain credit, the incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased debt service obligations. In June and July 2012, we defaulted on the repayment obligations of our short-term and long-term bank loans totaling $43,751,689. We are currently in discussions with our banks regarding the restructuring of these loans for repayment but have not yet agreed on specific terms. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully work out a repayment plan or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the loans. Further, each of these lenders has the right to take possession of the collateral (which collectively constitute substantial assets of the Company) granted in connection with their respective loan agreements. The unavailability of debt financing as a result of economic pressures on the credit and equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our business operations., 486651=Selling expenses decreased by $39,031, or 57.1%, period-on-period, to $29,273 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $68,304 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower transportation costs and traveling expenses period-on-period., 536224=The following table illustrates our credit facilities as of September 30, 2012, providing the name of the lender, the amount of the facility, the date of issuance and the maturity date:, 383950=The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 and as a percentage of revenues., 550332=On June 29, 2011, the Company entered into two short-term loan agreements with Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG, or \u201cRZB,\u201d pursuant to which the Company borrowed an aggregate of $27,551,689 at an annual interest rate of 1.15 times the standard market rate set by the People\u2019s Bank of China. The loans are secured by inventories, land use rights, buildings and plant and machinery, and is guaranteed by PSHL and our former Chairman, Mr. Wo Hing Li. Mr. Li also undertook to maintain a shareholding percentage in the Company of not less than 33.4% unless otherwise agreed to with RZB. Principal and interest under the loans were to be repaid in full on July 31, 2012, but the Company has defaulted on this repayment obligation. The Company is currently in discussions with RZB regarding the restructuring of the loans for repayment but has not yet agreed on specific terms. Any restructuring will be subject to approval by RZB\u2019s governing bodies, and to the Company\u2019s ability to meet certain conditions and requirements that may be imposed by the Bank. Until such agreement is reached, RZB has the right to take possession of the collateral granted in connection with the loan agreement, which action would have a material adverse impact on the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully work out a repayment plan with RZB or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the loan., 510971=Current assets increased by $63,305, or 0.1%, period-on-period, to $115,643,144 as of September 30, 2012, from $115,579,839 as of June 30, 2012, principally as a result of an increase in inventories of $2,099,231, or 13.5%, period-on-period, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $1,184,793, or 2.0%, and a decrease in advances to suppliers of $420,091, or 1.1%, period-on-period., 222762=The Provisional Regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China Concerning Value Added Tax promulgated by the State Council came into effect on January 1, 1994. Under these regulations and the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China Concerning Value Added Tax, value added tax is imposed on goods sold in or imported into the PRC and on processing, repair and replacement services provided within the PRC., 499457=Net cash flows provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2012 were $171,468, as compared to $303,740 provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2011, resulting in a net decrease of $132,272. This decrease was mainly due to an increase in cash outflows for inventories of $2,233,504, a decrease in cash inflow from advances from customers of $3,259,771, a decrease in cash inflows from accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,349,576, and a decrease in cash inflow from other taxes payable of $771,130, which were offset by an increase in cash inflow from accounts receivable of $7,572,397 during the three months ended September 30, 2012., 569232=Management is currently seeking for and plans to appoint qualified personnel as soon as practicable to remediate this material weakness. Our management does not believe that this material weakness had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations or caused our financial statements as of and for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2012, such as to contain a material misstatement., 484156=Direct labor costs decreased by $11,734, or 7.8%, period-on-period, to $139,068 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $150,802 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. Manufacturing overhead costs decreased by $647,660, or 18.5%, period-on-period, to $2,848,880 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $3,496,540 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was mainly attributable to the combined effect of a decrease in utilities of $384,399, or 40.4%, period-on-period, to $566,724 for the three months ended September 30, 2011, from $951,123 for the three months ended September 30, 2011, and a decrease in consumables of $149,033, or 31.7%, period-on-period, to $320,617 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $469,650 for the three months ended September 30, 2011., 359094=The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear in Part I, Item 1, \u201cFinancial Statements,\u201d of this quarterly report. Our unaudited consolidated financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The following discussion and analysis covers the Company\u2019s unaudited consolidated financial condition at September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, the end of its prior fiscal year, and its unaudited consolidated results of operation for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011., 275123=Plant and machinery amounting to $33,724,195 (June 30, 2012: $34,533,411) and $19,075,516 (June 30, 2012: $19,514,340) were pledged for short-term loans totaling $27,551,689 and long-term loans including current portion totaling $16,200,000, respectively, at September 30, 2012 (June 30, 2012: $27,246,477 and $16,200,000, respectively)., 534043=Current liabilities increased by $1,463,012, or 2.2%, period-on-period, to $68,138,888 as of September 30, 2012, from $66,675,876 as of June 30, 2012. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $529,534, or 7.8%, period-on-period, and an increase in advances from customers of $544,998, or 24.2%, period-on-period., 265523=Inventories amounting to $6,817,371 (June 30, 2012: $6,299,566) were pledged for short-term loans totaling $19,571,342 at September 30, 2012 (June 30, 2012: $19,354,534)., 221130=Based on all known facts and circumstances and current tax law, the Company believes that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2012 is not material to its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The Company also believes that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2012, if recognized, would not have a material effect on its effective tax rate. The Company further believes that there are no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible, based on current Chinese tax law and policy, that the unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease over the next 12 months producing, individually or in the aggregate, a material effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows., 503658=Net cash flows used in investing activities for the three months ended September 30, 2012 were $7,424, as compared with $84,886 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. Cash flows used in investing activities substantially decreased period-on-period as majority of the construction of the additional annealing furnaces have been completed., 346792=As of September 30, 2012, the Company did not have any capital commitments (June 30, 2012: $nil)., 3876=For the quarterly period ended: September 30, 2012, 210924=China Precision Steel, Inc. is subject to United States federal income tax at a tax rate of 34%. No provision for income taxes in the United States has been made as China Precision Steel, Inc. had no taxable income in fiscal years 2012 and 2011., 485601=Gross profit in absolute terms decreased by $1,528,719 or 2,474.9%, period-on-period, to a gross loss of $1,466,949 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from a gross profit of $61,770 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. Gross profit margin decreased to (24.6%) for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from 0.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in gross profit margin is mainly attributable to a 17.1% period-on-period decrease in average selling prices and a 3.6% period-on-period increase in average cost per unit sold., 561509=In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (\u201cASU 2012-02\u201d). ASU 2012-02 amends Topic 350 by establishing an optional two-step analysis for impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill. This update allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. Under that option, an entity no longer would be required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset unless the entity determines, based on that qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012 and early adoption is permitted. This standard will become effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2013. The Company does not believe adoption of this new guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements., 4348=[\u00a0\u00a0] TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, 567977=As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hai Sheng Chen, and Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Leada Tak Tai Li, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2012. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, Mr. Chen and Ms. Li, determined that because of the material weaknesses described below, as of September 30, 2012 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective., 189798=Advances to Suppliers \u2013 In order to ensure a steady supply of raw materials, the Company is required from time to time to make cash advances to its suppliers when placing purchase orders, for a guaranteed minimum delivery quantity at future times when raw materials are required. The advance is seen as a deposit to suppliers and guarantees our access to raw materials during periods of shortages and market volatility, and is therefore considered an important component of our operations. Contracted raw materials are priced at prevailing market rates when the advance purchase contracts are entered into. Advances to suppliers are shown net of an allowance which represents potentially unrecoverable cash advances at each balance sheet date. Such allowances are based on an analysis of past raw materials receipt experience and the credibility of each supplier according to its size and background. In general, we do not provide allowances against advances paid to those PRC state-owned companies as there is minimal risk of default. Our allowances for advances to suppliers are subjective critical estimates that have a direct impact on reported net earnings, and are reviewed quarterly at a minimum to reflect changes from our historic raw materials receipt experience and to ensure the appropriateness of the allowance in light of the circumstances present at the time of the review. It is reasonably possible that the Company\u2019s estimate of the allowance will change, such as in the case when the Company becomes aware of a supplier\u2019s inability to deliver the contracted raw materials or meet its financial obligations. As of September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, the Company had made allowances of advances to suppliers of $4,675,112 and $4,623,323, respectively., 281256=The Company acquired land use rights in August 2004 and December 2006 for 50 years that expire in August 2054 and December 2056, respectively. The land use rights are amortized over a fifty-year term. An amortization amount of approximately $37,000 is to be recorded each year starting from the financial year ended June 30, 2009 for the remaining lease period., 524374=June 30, 2012, 514446=The following table reflects the aging of our accounts receivable based on due date as of September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012:, 375815=During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we sold a total of 7,753 tons of products, a decrease of 37,795 tons from 45,548 tons a year ago, largely due to the decrease in sales of low-carbon cold-rolled steel products mentioned above. Despite a downward trend in steel prices during the quarter, our average cost per unit sold increased 3.6% while average selling prices decreased 17.1% period-on-period, mainly due to increases in factory overhead and direct labor per unit sold as a result of the substantially reduced units sold. Decreased sales volume coupled with high costs led to a gross loss of $1,466,949 and a net loss of $4,222,283 for the three months ended September 30, 2012. Total company backlog as of September 30, 2012 was $6,558,731., 185383=Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \u2013 The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of the accounts receivable. Management determines the collectability of outstanding accounts by maintaining regular communication with such customers and obtaining confirmation of their intent to fulfill their obligations to the Company. Management also considers past collection experience, our relationship with customers and the impact of current economic conditions on our industry and market. However, we note that the continuation or intensification of the current global economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations. To reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable, management has made a 50% provision for all accounts receivable that are over 180 days past due and full provision for all accounts receivable over 1 year past due. From time to time, we will review these credit periods, along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above, to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts, and to make changes to the allowance, if necessary. If our actual collection experience or other conditions change, revisions to our allowances may be required, including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income, or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected. At September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, the Company had $4,655,538 and $3,231,613 of allowances for doubtful accounts, respectively., 374857=During the three months ended September 30, 2012, we largely reduced the production and sales of our loss-making low-carbon cold-rolled steel products as part of our strategies to streamline production, and gross loss for the three months ended September 30, 2012 decreased to $1,466,949 from $2,952,641 for the immediate prior quarter ended June 30, 2012. However, tightened credit and slowing growth in China continued to cause a slow turnover of our accounts receivable for the three months ended September 30, 2012, a trend that is strongly correlated to the experience of other companies in the coal and steel sectors in China during the past year., 256128=ASC 330-10-35, \u201cAdjustments to Lower of Cost or Market\u201d, requires us to reduce the carrying value of inventory when there is evidence that the utility of goods will be less than cost, whether due to physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels or other causes. The Company recorded inventory write-downs in the amounts of $400,762 and $396,322 for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts were recognized as a loss in each respective period., 294284=On January 29, 2010, Shanghai Blessford entered into a Senior Loan Agreement with DEG -Deutsche Investitions-Und Entwicklungsgesellschaft Mbh (\u201cDEG\u201d) for a loan amount up to $18,000,000 at an annual interest rate of 4.5% above the six-month USD LIBOR rate. The loan is to be repaid semi-annually over five years starting on December 15, 2011 and is secured by a mortgage on the new cold rolling line and annealing furnaces at Shanghai Blessford\u2019s facilities and guaranteed by the Company., 227514=For the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company\u2019s pension cost charged to the statements of operations under the plan amounted to $64,741 and $69,338, respectively, all of which have been paid to the National Social Security Fund., 435594=During the three months ended September 30, 2012, domestic sales decreased across all product categories although there was a small increase in the sales of the exported low carbon hard-rolled steel products. Low-carbon cold-rolled steel products accounted for 34% of the current sales mix at an average selling price of $583 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to 79% of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of $898 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in sales in this category during the quarter was mainly due to streamlined production to reduce the sales of these loss-making products. Low-carbon hard-rolled steel products accounted for 19% of the current sales mix at an average selling price of $771 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to 1% of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of $919 for the three months ended September 30, 2011, due to an increase in demand in the export market as a result of our more competitive selling prices in the global market during the period.\u00a0\u00a0High-carbon cold-rolled steel products accounted for 43% of the current sales mix at an average selling price of $897 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to 10% of the sales mix at an average selling price of $995 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. The products in this category are mainly used in the automobile industry and the decrease in sales volume period-on-period was a result of the slowing demand for automobiles in the PRC market. Subcontracting income revenues accounted for $9,024, or less than 1%, of the sales mix for the three months ended September 30, 2012, decreased from $1,032,321, or 2%, of the sales mix for the three months ended September 30, 2011, due to reduced demand. The negative quantity was due to the return of one batch of sample products with a small sales revenue., 266633=Cash advances are shown net of allowances of $4,675,112 and $4,623,323 at September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively., 372488=We conduct our operations principally in China through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, Chengtong and Shanghai Blessford, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of our direct subsidiary, PSHL. Most of our sales are made domestically in China; however, we began exporting during fiscal 2007 and our overseas market currently covers Indonesia, Thailand, the Caribbean, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Turkey. We intend to further expand into additional overseas markets in the future, subject to suitable market conditions and favorable regulatory controls., 405987=Sales volume decreased by 39,795 tons, or 83.0%, period-on-period, to 7,753 tons for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from 45,548 tons for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and as a result, sales revenues decreased by $36,210,083, or 85.9%, period-on-period, to $5,956,760 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $42,166,843 for the three months ended September 30, 2011. The decrease in sales revenues period-on-period is mainly attributable to the decrease in production and sales of our low-carbon cold-rolled products in an effort to reduce the sales of these loss-making products., 491657=Total interest expense increased by $188,660, or 28.2%, to $858,588 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, from $669,928 for the three months ended September 30, 2011, due to the accrued late payment penalty interest as a result of the loan default.}",
