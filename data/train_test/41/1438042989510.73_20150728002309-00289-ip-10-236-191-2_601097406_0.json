In the event that 40 identical number (date) combinations are sold for any given drawing, the game system will stop accepting transactions for that combination for that drawing. For each drawing of MyDaY, a liability limit has been set by the Lottery. When the maximum number of wagers has been placed on a specific date combination so that the limit would be met if those numbers were drawn, no further wagering will be allowed for that combination. You will be asked to select another date combination. The winning numbers are announced Monday through Saturday in time for the ten o'clock news. Get winning numbers here, from nelottery.com, on your favorite radio or television station, at a Nebraska Lottery Lotto retailer, in your local newspaper, or on the Players Hotline at 1-800-244-LUCK (5825) or in Lincoln at 402-471-6139.
