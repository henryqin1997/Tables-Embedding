    "textBeforeTable": "A more specific answer can be found in the following table, which assumes you have not yet started to save for retirement: So, how much do you need to save? As much as you can. 3. Save enough. With life expectancy increasing by leaps and bounds, if you give notice at the traditional age of 65, you may want to think in terms of a 30-year retirement. That's a lot of electricity bills and all-you-can-eat buffet brunches. But it's important to remember that retirement is not your investing finish line. You probably still have many years of productive life ahead of you after you retire. While the income and safety of bonds and Treasury bills may seem appealing, approximately half of your portfolio must still be invested in stocks to ensure you can maintain purchasing power and avoid the devastating effects of inflation.

Since each will give you a different answer, try at least three. First, try our suite of retirement calculators on Fool.com, in particular \"Am I saving enough? What can I change?\" and \"How much will my savings be worth?\" You also might find some good tools on your broker's website or as part of your personal finance software. If you start pricing it out now, you won't experience sticker shock when your ticker isn't quite as strong. Our post-retirement expense calculator will help you figure out how much that round-the-world trip, fishing cabin, or class in paperclip art will cost. The good news is that many expenses decline or disappear completely in retirement. Once you've retired, you no longer have to pay Social Security or Medicare taxes; you no longer divert money to 401(k)s or IRAs; and retirement income is often taxed at lower rates. 5. Stop paying for other people's retirements. Unless the person managing the money in your mutual funds is bound to you by matrimony",
