            "Northwestern is a great school. I think there are challenging aspects, particularly socially, but overall I love it. The academics, activities, people, location are great."

The university has purchased some area hotels.I chose to live off campus because they offer apartments and not dorms and you had to share with 5 people. The new apartments require less roommates. They just added a food service option this 2012 academic year, which is a real plus., 78435=We paint a giant rock over and over, but you have to guard it first. Also, along the lakefill are these giant rocks which also get painted. Dillo Day is a concert that goes up at the end of May and lasts all day. Primal Scream happens the Sunday right before finals week when everyone goes outside and yells., 257619=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2998=Northwestern offers so much to students that it seems like too much. There's plenty of different social scenes (Greek life is a big one, but you don't have to be in a frat or sorority to be social), plenty of arts and entertainment, hundreds of student groups, opportunities for work, research and internships, volunteer groups, easy transportation, great dorm life... The professors I've had were generally really accessible, too. Again, the problem with all the NU offers is that it's hard for someone to have a job, be in a sport, be in ten extracurriculars, double major, volunteer, do research *and* have a normal social life without getting three hours of sleep and having no time to eat or relax. A problem I've encountered is that the course listing is difficult for freshmen. Upperclassmen and declared majors get class registration priority, so freshmen and undeclared majors have slim pickings when it comes to classes. I haven't met anyone who got into all the classes they wanted to. I'm ambivalent about the quarter system - it's nice that you only have to take four classes at a time, but when you take a class you like, it's upsetting because it's over so quickly. It's also nice that you get to go back to school in September, but on the other hand, you have to stay around until June. It's really easy to get distracted with all of Nortwestern's small faults when you get used to all it has to offer.}",
