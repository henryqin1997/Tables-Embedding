When I receive from the list the 'from' address is the sender and the 'to' address is is the list address. If I click reply to a message it uses the first address listed, which is the senders and not the list, then I have to go back and replace the sender's address with the list's address. Another mail list I am on lists the 'to' address before the 'from' address and when I click reply it replies to the 'to' address (mail list's) and not the 'from' address (sender's). Do you know if this is yahoo specific, or the way I have my yahoo mail configured? Does this effect anyone else?
