They typically are a collection of sensors in an assembly designed to look and play like the instrument they model. Commercial examples of the non-acoustic traditional controllers which emulate wind instruments include Casio's DH-100 Digital Saxophone controller, Yamaha's WXll and Windjamm'r wind instrument controller, and Akai's WE1000 wind controller. These controllers sense the closing of switches to determine the pitch intended by the player., 52011=Marcian Hoff in U.S. Pat. NO. 4,771,671, dated Sep. 20, 1988, discloses an electronic music instrument that controls the pitch of a music synthesizer with the pitch of a human voice, later manufactured as the Vocalizer by Breakaway Systems (San Mateo, Calif.). The Vocalizer limits pitches to selected ones, similar to an autoharp. The Vocalizer includes a musical accompaniment which dynamically determines which pitches are allowed. If the singer produces a pitch that is not allowed, the device selects and plays the closest allowable pitch., 50450=Tod Machover and his students at M.I.T. have been extending the playing technique of traditional musical instruments by applying sensors to acoustic instruments and connecting them to computers (Machover, T., \"Hyperinstrument, A Progress Report 1997-1991\", MIT Media Laboratory, January 1992). These extended instruments, called hyperinstruments, allow a trained musicians to experiment with new ways of manipulating synthesized sound. Once such instrument, the Hyperlead Guitars, the timbre of a sequence of notes played by a synthesizer is controlled by the position of the guitarist's hand on the fret board. In another implementation, the notes of guitar chords automatically selected from a score stored inside a computer, are assigned to the strings of a guitar. Picking a string triggers the note assigned to the string, with a timbre determined by fret position. Neither of these implementations allows traditional guitar playing technique where notes are triggered by either hand., 47996=Alternative controllers are sensors in a system that typically control music in an unconventional way. One of the earliest, pre-MIDI, examples is the Theremin controller where a person controlled the pitch and amplitude of a tone by the proximity of their hands to two antenna. Some examples of alternative controllers include Thunder (trademark), a series of pressure pads controlled by touch, and Lightening (trademark), a system in which you wiggle an infrared light in front of sensors, both developed and Sold by Don Buchla and Associates (Berkeley, Calif.); Videoharp, a controller that optically tracks fingertips, by Dean Rubine and Paul McAvinney of Carnegie-Mellon University; Biomuse, a controller that senses and processes brain waves and muscle activity (electromyogram), by R. Benjamin Knapp of San Jose State University and Hugh S. Lusted of Stanford University; Radio Drum, a three dimensional baton and gesture sensor, U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,519, dated Dec. 25, 1990, issued to Max V. Mathews; and a music tone control apparatus which measures finger bending, U.S. Pat. No. 5,125,313, dated Jun. 30, 1992, issued to Teruo Hiyoshi, et al., 54319=A more sophisticated accompaniment method has been designed independently by Barry Vercoe (Vercoe, B., Puckette, M., \"Synthetic Rehearsal: Training the Synthetic Performer\", ICMC 1985 Proceedings, pages 275-278; Boulanger, R., \"Conducting the MIDI Orchestra, Part 1\", Computer Music Journal, Vol. 14, No. 2, Summer 1990, pages 39-42) and Roger Dannenberg (ibid., pages 42-46). Unlike previous accompaniment schemes where the musician follows the tempo of the accompaniment, they use the computer accompaniment to follow the tempo of the live musician by monitoring the notes played by the musician and comparing it to a score stored in memory. In Vercoe's system a flute and a violin were used as the melody instruments. In Dannenberg's system a trumpet was used., 46057=A controller is a device that sends commands to a music synthesizer, instructing the synthesizer to generate sounds. A wide variety of commercially available controllers exist and can be categorized as traditional and alternative. Traditional controllers are typically musical instruments that have been instrumented to convert the pitch of the instrument into MIDI commands. Examples of traditional controllers include the violin, cello, and guitar controllers by Zeta Systems (Oakland, Calif.); Softwind's Synthaphone saxophone controller; the stringless fingerboard synthesizer controller, U.S. Pat. No. 5,140,887, dated Aug. 25, 1992, issued to Emmett Chapman; the digital high speed guitar synthesizer, U.S. Pat. No. 4,336,734, dated Jun. 29, 1982, issued to Robert D. Polson; and the electronic musical instrument with quantized resistance strings, U.S. Pat. No. 4,953,439, dated Sep. 4, 1990, issued to Harold R. Newell., 57544=Another system that simplifies the tasks of the person playing music is presented by Max Mathews in his Conductor Program (Mathews, M. and Pierce, J., editors, \"The Conductor Program and Mechanical Baton\", Current Directions in Computer Music Research, The MIT Press, 1989, Chapter 19; Boulanger, R., \"Conducting the MIDI Orchestra, Part 1\", Computer Music Journal, Vol. 14, No. 2, Summer 1990, page 34-39). In Mathews' system a person conducts a score, which is stored in computer memory, using special batons, referred to earlier as the alternative controller Radio Drum.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Although the present invention has been shown and described with respect to preferred embodiments, various changes and modifications which are obvious to a person skilled in the art to which the invention pertains are deemed to lie within the spirit and scope of the invention. The modularity of the schedulers 28 permits each to have their own simultaneous margin 150 and rubato window 170, allowing several people of different skill levels to play together, for example as a string quartet, rock or jazz band. The integration of the controllers 6, schedulers 28, score 4, display 24, and accompaniment sequencer 42, provides a robust music education system that can grow with the developing skills of the player. The ability of the scheduler 23 to reattack notes allows the player room to improvise. Musicians often reattack notes for ornamentations. The polygestural scheduler 34 provides a guitarist with the ability to strum any sequence of stings with any rhythm, and the scheduler allocator 54 provides a smooth intuitive method to switch between rhythm and lead lines. The polygestural scheduler 34 also allows a player to select alternate musical lines from the score. A violinist could play one string for melody, another for harmony, and both for a duet. A bass player could use one string for the root of the chord, another for the fifth interval, a third for a sequence of notes comprising a walking bass line,",
