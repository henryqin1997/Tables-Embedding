    "textBeforeTable": "The best soil type is a mixture of clay, silt, and sand. If your soil is lacking any one of these, you can attempt to add what's missing. Knowing the soil types that you will encounter when building trails will help you develop a solid, stable tread. A lot of information on soils can be found at the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/site/soils/home/) office or at your county extension service office. Soil type and texture have a major influence on soil drainage and durability. Texture refers to the size of individual soil particles. Clay and silt are the soil components with the smallest particles. Small particles tend to be muddy when wet and dusty when dry. Clay and silt don't provide good drainage. Sand is made of large particles that don't bind together at all and are very unstable. Trail construction requires creating a solid, sustainable tread. To do so, make sure that you locate the trail on the contour. Forces such as soil type, annual precipitation, and other factors may influence how long the tread remains stable before maintenance is needed. Tread is the actual travel surface of the trail. This is where the rubber (or hoof) meets the trail. Tread is constructed and maintained to support the designed use for your trail. Tread Back | Next",
    "textAfterTable": "Smooth Very thin and very long--76 mm (3 inches) The tread surface should match the intended use. Easier trails should have a smooth tread surface. Backcountry trails can be rougher and more challenging. Leaving some obstacles in the trail helps slow down users and reduce conflict. Tread is also the travel surface on structures such as turnpikes and puncheon. Tread, whenever elevated, should be slightly crowned (higher in the center than on either side) to drain better. Outsloping An outsloped tread is one that is lower on the outside or downhill side of the trail than it is on the inside or bankside. Outsloping lets water sheet across the trail naturally. The tread should be outsloped at least 5 percent. Loss of outslope is the first maintenance problem that develops on all trails. If you can do nothing else when budgets are tight, reestablish the outslope. Doing so pays big dividends. Removing Roots and Stumps Removing roots and stumps is hard work. Explosives and stump grinders are good alternatives for removing stumps, but chances are you'll have to do the work by hand. Often, a sharpened pick mattock or Pulaski is used to chop away at the roots. If you are relying on some type of winch system to help you pull out the stump, be sure to leave the stumps high enough to give you something to latch onto for leverage. Rule of Thumb",
