When you get closer to it though, your shadow casts onto the painting, canceling the reflection and revealing the Giygas images on the lenses. Each of the lenses is about the size of a quarter. A (bad) picture of the lenses reflecting can be seen here: http://starmen.net/forum/?t=getfile&id=36511&private=0 The 'Zombie Chick' from Threed. This image has been resized for your convenience.
