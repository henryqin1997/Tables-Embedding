            "The most thing that is talked about when it comes to NC A&T is our schools homecoming yeah i know that is once a year but it is the most exciting thing to hear, see and attend. We have the GHOE greatest homecoming ever. It is like one big family all at once hanging, cooking, partying and enjoying the whole entire campus. However besides the main event on campus there are also little things to attend. We have spoken word, game night, movie night and just little informative activities that pop up around campus throughout the year. We also have Aggie fest which is just a week of students coming out to show there talents where you can win prices and start promoting yourself to become the next Mr or Misses of the school or different organizations.",
            "Of course coming in as a freshman the food seems great especially coming out of high school where you use to eat whatever was served that day but in college there is much more selection. What i like about A&T is that they are very diverse when it comes to the food most of the time pertaining to lunch and dinner. Even though my school is an HBCU they cater to each persons wants and needs when it comes to food. There is white bread and wheat bread, whole milk and 2% milk just simple things like that.",
            "As far as living on campus it has its pros and its cons. Living in a dorm is actually fun especially if you are an only child like myself. At NC A&T there are several dorms a person can choose from whether is is a same sex or coed. I stayed in an all girls dorm my freshman year and then an coed sophomore year. All of A&Ts dorms are suitable and clean; of course not as clean as your own personal home but clean enough to adapt to. But a person has to realize all individuals who live there is what helps contribute to the dirtiness or cleanliness. I feel my school did a great job when matching up who would stay with who in the dorm however everyone has a falling out with there roommate here and there.",
            "The down fall about A&T when it comes to the to academics and i am sure this is at many schools. The reality is not all teachers and even students are helpful when it comes to informing you on things that you probably need to know but didn't know how to ask and or find out. Not all advisors are going to help you with choosing your classes in a way that will help your work load or your financial stability. I myself have ran into professors that honestly did not care if a student passed or failed there class. There are professors that are hard on you to help your success while there are others who are just hard because they are irritable.",
            "I know most students come in undecided but i would advise anyone to go ahead and do research on what interest them prior to attending any college. Know what classes you need to take a don't need to take. Become very engaging with your advisor and or mentor. Ask question because there is no such thing as being too knowledgeable. Make you keep all copies of all paper work whether it is from your teacher, advisor or the financial aid department. Ask about organizations and join as many as you can handle. Network for gain in intelligence, success and opportunity but most of all have fun never create too much of a work load that you can not handle.",
            "A&T is one of the greatest historically black universities. This school not only has great faculty that will help you pursue your career but it also has a great home felt environment. A&T is great academically but also very engaging in providing its students with a fun atmosphere."

I The reason why I would give my school a 10 is because there are certain things about the University that are just fantastic. I I'm glad that I attend the University and can not wait until graduation in May of 2015., 50471=North Carolina A&T, is a great school, and has outstanding engineering programs. I am a current Mechanical Engineer major, that plans to graduate in 2016, and i have absolutely no complaints at all about the school; the people here are great and welcoming. North Carolina A&T is a great place to pursue your college career, and you will not regret it; theres always something to do., 591173=The food here is good for the most part. The dinning hall closes at 8:30 p.m. which I believe is too early, but other than that everything is pretty much delicious., 130493=From what I have heard about A&T, they have great academics and proffesors. A&T is currently ranked #12, in the top HBCU's of 2011., 705755=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 3156=I just graduated from A&T in May, and I feel more than ready to begin my Master's of Accounting program at The Ohio State University. Not only am I prepared, but I also managed to get a scholarship for my Master's and for the CPA Exam (which I am already studying for). The classes are challenging, but it is fun to take some of the electives (not all majors have room for electives, so be careful about that)., 304173=Because I am online I only pay 1250 a semester to be a full time student., 218642=Welcome week in august. HOMECOMING in October!!! The Plots are a no go unless you are Greek or are invited and they are with you. And the Greek Pagents., 290046=For prospective students planning to attend North Carolina A&T, I would suggest him or her to stay on top of responsibilities, such as financial aid awards, major changes, class schedules, and payments to the university. The Office of Student Financial Aid can be very slow at verifying awards, causing several students to be forced to take a semester out of school. If he or she (the student) maintains a responsible attitude, this saddening event can easily be avoided. Secondly, I would advise prospective students to prevent themselves from getting too caught up into the campus life. The numerous events that are going on within the campus's area can definitely through students off of their academics; I have noticed this from some students within my class of 2014. Lastly, prospective students must budget and conserve the money that they have as much as they possibly can. As an incoming college student, it is important to save most of the money that is available to him or her for emergencies only. During my freshman year at North Carolina A&T, some friends of mine and I were stranded at a movie theater and neither one of us had a car to drive back to campus. However, with money set aside, we were able to catch a taxi to arrive safely at the university., 243446=I went to the new student orientation April, 6th and I was struck by the sense of community amongst the students. I love the fact that even us incoming freshman were still treated like One of the family. I will be proud to be an Aggie , and I look forward to the experience.}",

Tips for prospective students My tips for prospective students is to stay on top of your work and keep up with your financial aid. Overall, my ideal tip is to have fun and enjoy the campus atmosphere. Bang for the buck For the most part I can honestly say that A&T is worth the buck. You'll have so much fun there that you won't even be concerned on how much money your spending for your education. Did enjoy being here I loved being an Aggie! There were plenty of people that were willing to work with you. The social environment was fantastic and there was so much to do in the city of Greensboro, North Carolina. I also",
