He enjoyed a solid 2009 season for Middlesex, taking 53 wickets at 30.64 in the Championship, and then did well for England Lions in the UAE. With Stuart Broad, Graham Onions and Ryan Sidebottom all picking up injuries early on England's tour to Bangladesh, Finn was parachuted in as cover. Barely 24 hours after arriving in the country he was playing in the warm-up game against Bangladesh A and impressed on his Test debut three days later, displaying good pace and bounce on a docile Chittagong surface., 47361=Jul 29, 2015, 42723=A single Test appearance in 2011 followed, during which he became the youngest Englishman to 50 wickets, but Tim Bresnan and Chris Tremlett moved ahead of him in third-seamer pecking order. An impressive tour of India pushed him firmly into one-day contention, however, and he was a virtual ever-present in limited-overs cricket in 2012, as England briefly topped the ODI rankings but failed in their World Twenty20 defence. Finn won a Test recall against South Africa but a habit of hitting the stumps in his delivery stride became costly when Graeme Smith drew attention to it at Headingley. The umpires decided to call dead ball and Finn was denied Smith's wicket. A few months later, 'Finn's Law' was created, making any wicket taken after a bowler had knocked over the stumps a no ball., 50108=NBC Denis Compton Award 2009, 50169=ICC Emerging Player of the Year 2010, 9584=Born April 4, 1989, Watford, Hertfordshire, 40505=But the trajectory of his career went into reverse in 2013/14. Issues with his delivery stride - a habit of kneeing the stumps led to a Law change making it a no-ball - and control meant he has been in and out of the side. Endless tinkering with his action left Finn visibly bereft of confidence, leading to him being sent home from England's tour of Australia after being deemed unselectable., 48198=Jun 20, 2015, 49015=Jun 17, 2015, 50238=Cricket Writers' Club Young Cricketers of the Year 2010, 67761=4391 runs after 35, and 2354 outside top five (43), 43558=Injury curtailed Finn's involvement in the historic Test series win in India but he was back in the XI in New Zealand, beginning his longest run in the side since his debut. A shortened run-up was experimented with before being abandoned but his rhythm had been affected and, having played just once in England's Champions Trophy campaign, he was dropped after the first Test of the 2013 Ashes. After his tumultuous winter in 2013/14, he rebuilt his confidence with the aide of Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson. Finn was rewarded with an ODI recall against India in August 2014. For all the problems, England remained convinced that Finn was a bowler of rare talent., 59245=The Cricket Monthly: The IPL lasts two months, but through the year talent hunters are scouring India (and the internet) for the next big thing. By Niyantha Shekar TCM July issue, 66839=Since the beginning of 2012, Ian Bell averages 34.69 when batting in the top six; among regular top-order batsmen, only Shane Watson has a lower average}",
