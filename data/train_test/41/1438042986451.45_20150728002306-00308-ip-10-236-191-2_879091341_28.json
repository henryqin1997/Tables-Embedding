Those who are willing to work for what they want, accept responsibility, and have fun all the same time will excel here. Tips for prospective students Get out of the dorm and join as many groups as you can that interest you, provided you don't overload yourself to the point of only stressing about them. Sit next to new people as often as possible-- say hello and get to know everyone. Seize every opportunity. When you've been studying for 10 hours straight, take someone's offer to go watch Iron Man or Inception at midnight in a dorm room. Bang for the buck Even in these tough economic times, the only college names that seem to appear over and over",
