            "Supply Chain Analytics Supply chain analytics is one of the fastest growing business intelligence application areas. Important element in Supply Chain Management is to have timely access to trends and metrics across key performance indicators, while recent advances in information and communication technologies have contributed to the rapid increase of data-driven decision making. The topics covered will be divided into strategic and supply chain design and operations, including -among others- supplier analytics, capacity planning, demand-supply matching, sales and operations planning, location analysis and network management, inventory management and sourcing. The primary goal of the course is to familiarize the students with tactical and strategic issues surrounding the design and operation of supply chains, to develop supply chain analytical skills for solving real life problems, and to teach students a wide range of methods and tools -in the areas of predictive, descriptive and prescriptive analytics- to efficiently manage demand and supply networks.",
            "Data Streams Analytics: Internet of Things In recent years, the progress in sensor technologies, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, smart phones and other smart devices has made it possible to measure, record, and report large streams of transactional data in real time. Such data sets, which continuously and rapidly grow over time, are referred to as Big Data Streams. Analysis of streaming data poses a number of unique challenges which are not easily solved through direct applications of well-known data mining methods and algorithms developed for traditional static data. This course will serve as a first course on the emerging field of \u201cData Streams Analytics\u201d. It will provide an introduction to IoT, sensors & devices, the architecture and environment in which these devices generate data streams, the data quality & data cleaning, data acquisition, and emerging methodologies and algorithms for knowledge discovery from data streams. Topics include: synopsis & sampling techniques, sliding windows, computing the entropy in streams, data streams correlations, change detection, outliers & anomaly detection.",
            "Big Data Seminar The field of Big Data is emerging as one of the transformative business processes of recent times.
