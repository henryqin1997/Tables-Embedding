    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{30694=Occasionally you may try to read or print a 'PDF' file that Ghostscript doesn't recognize as PDF, even though the same file can be opened and interpreted by an Adobe Acrobat viewer. In many cases, this is because of incorrectly generated PDF. Acrobat tends to be very forgiving of invalid PDF files. Ghostscript tends to expect files to conform to the standard. For example, even though valid PDF files must begin with %PDF, Acrobat will scan the first 1000 bytes or so for this string, and ignore any preceding garbage., 35012=Most of the Ghostscript output devices do not have file formats which support spot colors. Instead spot colors are converted using the tint transform function contained within the color space definition.. However there are several devices which have support for spot colors. The PSD format (Adobe Photoshop) produced by the psdcmyk device contains both the raster data plus an equivalent CMYK color for each spot color. This allows Photoshop to simulate the appearance of the spot colors. The display device (MS Windows, OS/2, gtk+) can be used with different color models: Gray, RGB, CMYK only, or CMYK plus spot colors (separation). The display device, when using its CMYK plus spot color (separation) mode, also uses an equivalent CMYK color to simulate the appearance of the spot color. The tiffsep device creates output files for each separation (CMYK and any spot colors present). It also creates a composite CMYK file using an equivalent CMYK color to simulate the appearance of spot colors. The xcfcmyk device creates output files with spot colors placed in separate alpha channels. (The XCF file format does not currently directly support spot colors.), 36340=Overprinting with spot colors is not allowed if the tint transform function is being used to convert spot colors. Thus if spot colors are used with overprinting, then the appearance of the result can differ between output devices. One result would be obtained with a CMYK only device and another would be obtained with a CMYK plus spot color device. In a worst case situation where a file has overprinting with both process (CMYK) and spot colors, it is possible to get three different appearances for the same input file using the tiff24nc (RGB), tiff32nc (CMYK), and tiffsep (CMYK plus spot colors) devices., 43332=To get a proper platform dependent syntax Ghostscript inserts the value of the system parameter GenericResourcePathSep (initially \"/\" on Unix and Windows, \":\" on MacOS, \".\" or \"]\" on OpenVMS). The string ../Resource is replaced with a platform dependent equivalent., 211055=Copyright \u00a9 2000-2010 Artifex Software, Inc. All rights reserved., 153501=With switching to freetype 2 as the default font renderer in April 2010, we added a new switch:-dDisableFAPI=true to revert to the older behavior, just in case serious regression happens that cannot be resolved in a timely manner.}",

There are other utility scripts besides ps2pdf, including pdf2ps, ps2epsi, pdf2dsc, ps2ascii, ps2ps and ps2ps2. These just call Ghostscript with the appropriate (if complicated) set of options. You can use the 'ps2' set with eps files.  Ghostscript is capable of interpreting PostScript, encapsulated PostScript (EPS), DOS EPS (EPSF), and Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). The interpreter reads and executes the files in sequence, using the method described under \"File searching\" to find them. The interpreter runs in interactive mode by default. After processing the files given on the command line (if any) it reads further lines of PostScript language commands from the primary input stream, normally the keyboard, interpreting each line separately. To quit the interpreter, type \"quit\". The -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE options in the examples above disable the interactive prompting. The interpreter also quits gracefully if it encounters end-of-file or control-C.  The interpreter recognizes many options. An option may appear anywhere in the command line, and applies to all files named after it",

Also, since some devices write output files when opened, there may be an extra blank page written (pdfwrite, ps2write, epswrite, pxlmono, pxlcolor, ...). As noted above, when using MS Windows console (command.com or cmd.exe), you will have to double the % character since the % is used by that shell to prefix variables for substitution, e.g., gswin32c -sOutputFile=ABC%%03d.xyz -o option: As a convenient shorthand you can use the -o option followed by the output file specification as discussed above. The -o option also sets the -dBATCH and -dNOPAUSE options. This is intended to be a quick way to invoke ghostscript to convert one or more input files. For instance, to convert somefile.ps to JPEG image files, one per page, use: gs -sDEVICE=jpeg -o out-%d.jpg somefile.ps is equivalent to: gs -sDEVICE=jpeg -sOutputFile=out-%d.jpg -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE somefile.ps Choosing paper size Ghostscript is distributed configured to use U.S. letter paper as its default page size.
