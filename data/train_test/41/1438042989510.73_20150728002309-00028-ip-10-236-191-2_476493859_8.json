This is based primarily on the fact that operating at or above the softening temperature would cause serious agglomeration problems. Indeed BP Chemicals Limited, PCT International Publication Number WO 88/02379, published April, 1988 which discloses use of 0.005% to less than 0.2% of a pulverulent inorganic substance during the reaction, nevertheless cautions against the use of temperatures in excess of the softening temperatures of the produced polyolefin. Moreover, this reference specifically discourages use of quantities of pulverulent inorganic substances in the reactor in excess of 0.2% by weight since as stated therein there is no further improvement in the polymerization or copolymerization process in the gaseous phase and use of amounts in excess of 0.2% deleteriously affect the quality of the polymer or copolymer produced., 26359=The introduction of high activity Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems has lead to the development of new polymerization processes based on gas phase reactors such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,482,687 issued Nov. 13, 1984. These processes offer many advantages over bulk monomer slurry processes or solvent processes. They are more economical and inherently safer in that they eliminate the need to handle and recover large quantities of solvent while advantageously providing low pressure process operation., 37778=In general, the height to diameter ratio of the reaction zone can vary in the range of about 2.7:1 to about 5:1. The range, of course, can vary to larger or smaller ratios and depends upon the desired production capacity. The cross-sectional area of the velocity reduction zone 14 is typically within the range of about 2.5 to about 2.9 multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the reaction zone 12., 47654=The fluid bed reactor may be operated at pressures of up to about 1000 psig. The reactor is preferably operated at a pressure of from about 250 to about 500 psig, with operation at the higher pressures in such ranges favoring heat transfer since an increase in pressure increases the unit volume heat capacity of the gas.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Small amount of resin agglomerates were observed in the product. This run was prematurely terminated due to some mechanical problems associated with the reactor system. From FIG. 3, the true density of this EPDM sample is below 0.86 g/cc, when the curve is extrapolated. From FIG. 2, the softening point of this polymer is 30\ufffd C. This means that the reactor was operated at about 50\ufffd C. above the softening point of the material with the amount of the carbon black indicated. Average particle size of resin=0.069 inches Flow index=5.9 Carbon black content=25.1% by weight ENB incorporation=2.2 % by weight Propylene content=46.3% by weight Carbon black incorporated EPDM resin was produced at a rate of 4 to 6 lb/hr without having any reactor operational problems. Typical samples, which were produced at a C3 /C2 ratio of 1.8, had the following properties: ENB feed rate=150 to 210 cc/hr but typically 210 cc/hr. H2 /C2 molar ratio=0.003 C3 /C2 molar ratio=1.8 Superficial gas velocity=2.2 ft/s Reactor temperature=80\ufffd C. The reactor was operated to produce EPDM granular resin at the following conditions: Production of EPDM at 80\ufffd C. EXAMPLE 13 Carbon black content=10.9% by weight ENB incorporation=4.6% by weight Propylene content=47.4% by weight To determine the critical carbon black content in the product, the carbon black concentration in the reactor was gradually lowered until the fluidization ceased calling for a reactor shut-down.
