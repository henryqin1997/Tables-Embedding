Cells were washed with PBS for three times, then fixed for 30 min with 0.4% paraformaldehyde (2 mL/well) , followed by a 30 min incubation in 0.5% Triton100 (2 mL/well). Washing again, rabbit serum (Fermentas Co. Ltd, Shenzhen, China) was used to block the blank, and then the cells were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with goat anti-mouse mBD1 antibody (Abnova Co., Taibei, Taiwan) and rabbit anti-mouse mBD3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) diluted 1:500 in PBS separately, followed by a 30 min incubation at room temperature with rabbit anti-goat IgG-RBITC (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA) diluted 1:50 separately. Samples were washed three times in PBS after each incubation step. The expression of mBD1-mBD3 fusion proteins was reflected by fluorescence under fluorescent microscope., 19654=Viruses 2014, 6(3), 1237-1252; doi:10.3390/v6031237, 26759=Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of life-threatening respiratory tract diseases worldwide. A human influenza (flu) pandemic could cause 20% of the global population to become ill. In past decades, avian flu H5N1 has emerged among chickens and human in some developing countries, so that close to 30 million people would need to be hospitalized, a quarter of whom would die within a few months [1]. As is well known, in April 2009, tens of thousands of people were infected and more than one hundred died in the new H1N1 influenza (Human Swine Flu) global pandemic within only one month [2]. In March 2013, avian flu H7N9 subtype emerged in China, and hundreds people have been infected. Today, although annual vaccination is the primary strategy for preventing infections, antiviral drugs play an important role in the control of influenza [3,4]. However, some influenza viruses, even including the H5N1, have demonstrated resistance to antiviral drugs such as adamantine derivatives and neuraminidase inhibitors [5,6]. The increasing appearance of resistant strains of influenza virus highlights our need to search for alternative treatment strategies., 114844=\u00a9 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The TCID50 was 10\u22126.1875/0.1 mL, 10\u22125.8750/0.1 mL, 10\u22125.250/0.1 mL and 10\u22125.1875/0.1 mL in the PBS control group, the negative control group, pcDNA3.1(+)/mBD3 group and pcDNA3.1(+)/mBD1 group, respectively. There is no difference between the four groups above. However, the TCID50 titer was only 10\u22123.4815/0.1 mL in the pcDNA3.1(+)/mBD1-mBD3 group. This inhibition was shown to be statistically significant (p < 0.005)., 46351=Homogenates of the right lung tissue were prepared and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected to be lung suspension. After MDCK cells were digested and grown to monolayer in 24-well plates, cell culture media were removed and cells were washed two times in PBS to remove bovine serum. Different lung suspension dilution, from 10\u22121 to 10\u22128 were dropped into 3 wells for each dilution slightly and incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 incubator. CPE was observed under light microscopy. TCID50 titer was obtained through calculating by Reed-Muench method and \u2212log10 of each TCID50 titer was analyzed with SPSS v11.5 software [16].}",
