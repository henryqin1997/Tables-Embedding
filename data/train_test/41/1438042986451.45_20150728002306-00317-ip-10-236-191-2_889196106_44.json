There are three regular dining halls: Straz, McCormmick, and Cobeen. Mashuda is a '50's diner themed hall and Schroeder is an Italian themed hall. The Union has a bunch of different things like a coffee shop, subs, sushi, Mexican, burgers, salad bar, and a bagel place. The only down side to the food is that McCormmick and Schroeder are the only dorms open past 6:30 PM., 464963=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 238067=If you are thinking about Marquette, apply early, before Dec. 1st. If you are worried about paying for this school, work over the summer during high school, apply for private scholarships, and do well in high school (for a incoming freshman, 4-year scholarship offer from Marquette). If you did not attain a high GPA in high school, but do while during your first semester at Marquette, you may be able to ask them to increase your incoming freshman scholarship/grants. It will take time and effort to pay for this school (without any help from your parents) if you come from a low-income background, but if you are dedicated to working hard here, your efforts will be rewarded (trust me, I know)., 74434=The classes are tough but they are really informative. They challenge you to think critically as well as look past the basic information given and how you would apply that to your job. There are classes that everyone has to take like English 1001, Theology, Philosophy, and a science elective, but they are extremely helpful. Also, the teachers know that you would rather be anywhere but in class so they make their classes as interesting as possible and talk about current things that could relate to the topics you are talking about., 430330=Watch application dates and be patient. Very competetive selection process. When I applied, I was one of 22,000 students competing for 2000 spots. I had a 3.8 GPA and a 37 ACT and was weight-listed for the nursing program. I was eventually accepted., 371162=Tons of different choices and types of dining halls. You have traditional buffet styles, an Italian restaurant style, 50's dinner, 4 coffee shops, and a healthy dining hall. With the meal plan you have unlimited swipes for certain halls so you will never go hungry. The downsides would be that most halls close by 6 or 6:30 which is a bit early for the busy college kid.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Go for a campus visit! You'll know right then whether or not Marquette is the school for you. Bang for the buck Being completely honest Marquette is an expensive school and I do struggle to pay every semester to continue to attend but for the connections made with students and professors it is absolutely worth it. You learn so much and meet so many people you are definitely getting your bang for the buck. Am enjoying being here I honestly struggled when I first got to Marquette to make friends. I was shy and unlike most of the students I was from a small public school in the middle of Kentucky, I was worried I wouldn't fit in. But when I finally stepped outside of my comfort zone I met some of the most amazing people who I know will be my friends for life. Besides all the wonderful people and staff, the campus itself is beautiful. Milwaukee is a great city for a university. The city is the perfect size which gives the feeling of a close-knit tie to the community and a feeling of being safe in your surroundings. Another selling point is even though you are in a city, when you are in the middle of campus you can't even",
