            "Electric-Powered Self-Balancing Unicycle With Steering Linkage Between Handlebars And Wheel Forks - A one-wheeled vehicle includes electric motors, a self-balancing system, and steering mechanism, wherein the electric motors and self-balancing system are disposed within the wheel of the one-wheeled vehicle. Side stirrup legs, which have foot pegs suitable for placement of a rider's feet while riding, are pivoted with respect to the wheel forks, such that the side stirrup legs may be rotated backwards and act as a kickstand for the one-wheeled vehicle. The side stirrup legs may be weighted with, for example, one or more batteries may be attached to the side stirrup legs to provide a weight distribution such that the one-wheeled vehicle does not fall forward when parked. A computational resource such as a microcontroller, or microprocessor-based controller, receives input signals indicative of operation of the twist throttle and brake, and responsive thereto produces signals to adjust the tilt angle relative to the acceleration and thereby reduce the need for a rider to lean forward or backwards.",

Hoffmann, West Granby, CT US Patent application number Description Published 20090141850 PRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR PRESSURIZER HEATER SHEATH - A pressurizer whose heater sheaths are conditioned to reduce the residual stresses resulting from cold working during manufacture. After material conditioning, the heater sheath undergoes a surface conditioning treatment to add outer surface compressive stresses. 06-04-2009 Daniel Hoffmann, Irwin, PA US Patent application number Description Published 20130213114 Leak Detector - The invention relates to a leak detector comprising a first sensor for detecting a gas component (helium) in a gas taken in. Because the sensor is susceptible to saturation or contamination, a second sensor is provided. The sensor is a thermal conductivity sensor. The thermal conductivity sensor has a lower detection sensitivity, yet, at a high concentration of the gas component, it does not risk being contaminated. The two sensors together allow for a large detection range, from extremely sensitive measurements to instances with high concentrations of the gas components as those which can occur with gross leaks. 08-22-2013 David J.
