Displacing outwardly, in a controlled manner, a segment of said side-wall so as to convert said segment into two opposed frustrum sections, one above the other, the higher frustrum section making an angle with the plane of said side wall of about 12 and the lower frustrum section making an angle of about 60 also with said plane; and 3. A method of forming in the area adjacent both said side and bottom wall of a single-piece, seamless container body of circular cross-section, a profile of the outer surface of a double seam having five adjacent layers, comprising the steps of: said bottom wall being substantially planar and having a curved periphery joining said second linear segment of said flange to said bottom wall",
