In recent weeks we have learned that several state agencies have to have more money just to get through the current fiscal year, which ends next June., 18245=Another year has come and gone but my heart still feels very sad and lonely. On November 8 last year God called someone home very dearly to me. I know she's dancing with Jesus now and all her worries are gone. And I feel her preence with everyday. But it is still not the same seeing that smiling face and feeling the warmth of her touch. She was everything you would want from a very special lady. I hope she knows that my heart still lones for her every day. Life is not the same anymore but I know she would tell me Libby don't cry for me, stand up adn be srong and take care of yourself.}",
