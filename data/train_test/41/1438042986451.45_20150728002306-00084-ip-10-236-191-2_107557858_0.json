            "It's summer time again, and as usual it's HVSC Update time as well! More and more new SID music is being produced every day and as usual we are glad to collect and bring them all to you, adding some corrections as we find them or when we are reported about fixes to do. Introducing 3SIDs from this release. See SID_file_format.txt for the specifications about the new SID v4 file format. An updated SID player is required. Known players which are already supporting the new format are: ACID64 v3.6, JSIDPlay2 v3.6 and VICE/VSID v2.4.20 rev. 29809. For the full text of the announcement and SID related news please read here.",
            "Although this is not a big update like previous ones, the goal of 46,000 SIDs has been reached right in time for the release. The amount of new SIDs seems less than other updates, but still there are a total of 650+ SIDs made in 2014, showing that the C64 scene is alive and kicking. Keep on composing! This update includes 639 new SID tunes and 168 fixes. For the full text of the announcement and SID related news please read here.",
            "Yet another milestone reached: 45,000+ sids, and that happened just 2 months after the previous update! Looks like the C64 musicians have infinite lives! This update includes 749 new SID tunes and 1479 fixes. For the full text of the announcement and SID related news please read here.",
            "Another milestone reached: 44,000+ SIDs thanks to the never ending love from the C64 scene that still produces an amazing quantity of great tunes for our endless hunger for bleepy music. Keep this spirit alive! This time we have added 825 new SID tunes and included a lot of fixes. For the full text of the announcement and SID related news please read here.",
            "Another update of HVSC has been released! The High Voltage SID Collection now contains 43,856 SID files. This time we have added 747 new SID tunes, 315 fixed tunes and 629 credit fixes. For the full text of the announcement and SID related news please read here.",
            "Merry Christmas everybody! The High Voltage SID Collection now contains 43,116 SID files. That's right, 43k SIDs, another milestone broken, and we even survived the end of the world! This time we have added 906 new SID tunes and 971 credit fixes. For the full text of the announcement and SID related news please read here.",
            "Another update of HVSC is out now! This time we were not only able to break the 42,000 SIDs barrier, but also provided a whopping 3100+ credit fixes to nail down many inconsistencies that were there for many years. For the full text of the announcement and SID related news please read here.",
            "Merry Christmas everybody! The High Voltage SID Collection now contains 41,250 SIDs. A lot of new and fixed SIDs have been included in the update. Also in this release we finally got rid of all PlaySID/Sidplay1 specific SIDs, by replacing all the remaining ones with proper RSID rips. This is quite a milestone. For the full text of the announcement and SID related news please read here.",
            "Another update of HVSC is released. Now we have 40,400 SID files in the collection! You read it well, we went over 40,000 SIDs and this means it took 6 years to reach the new milestone, from 30k to 40k SIDs. This update will also feature the new SID V3 format, so you must watch out for updated SID players supporting it. For the full text of the announcement please read here.",
            "Merry Christmas everybody! Check out another big update of HVSC. The collection contains now 39,626 tunes. For the full text of the announcement please read here.",
            "Yet another HVSC release. This time we have 1045 new and an amazing count of 897 fixed SIDs. Also we have 20 PlaySID/Sidplay1 specific SIDs eliminated. The collection contains now 38,714 tunes. Have fun listening! For the full text of the announcement please read here.",
            "Merry Christmas SID worshipper! Here are some 874 new and 65 fixed sids to ease the christmas stress. The total tune count is boosted to 37,801 tunes, enjoy! For the full text of the announcement please read here.",
            "Not even 4 months have passed and we're ready to flood you with another 900+ SIDs! After getting rid of the PSID specific tunes last update, we've got nothing too revolutionary for you this time. Just a rock solid, straight-in-your-face dose of the sweetest blip-blop you 8-bit greedy bastards can dream of. Enjoy! For the full text of the announcement please read here."
