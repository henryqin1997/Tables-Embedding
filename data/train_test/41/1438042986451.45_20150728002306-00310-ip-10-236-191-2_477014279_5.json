Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. In the organic EL device according to the present invention, the first substrate and the second substrate may be individually inspected after forming the array element and the organic EL diode, respectively, and then only first substrates and second substrates that pass inspection may be attached. Therefore, the production yield for an organic EL device is improved resulting in increased production efficiency and longer expected life spans for organic EL devices. Moreover, a top emission organic EL device with high resolution and a high aperture ratio results from the improved process. In addition, a larger range of materials may be selected for the electrode of the organic EL diode since it directly contacts with a substrate. Furthermore, since the organic electroluminescent layer of the organic EL diode is protected by a substrate, the device is more adequately protected from ambient air and moisture. ) preventing moisture from contacting the organic EL layer may be formed on either the first substrate or the second substrate adjacent to the seal",
