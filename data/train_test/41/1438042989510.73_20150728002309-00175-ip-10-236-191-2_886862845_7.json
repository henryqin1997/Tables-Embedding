            "Campus is very safe. There are campus security phones all over campus, so that they can be reached. It is a semi lit campus in some areas. But the main side walkways and paths people use are very lit. Campus police are around the campus 24 hours a day. I have never felt unsafe being on campus.",
            "There is no Greek life at this school. They do not believe in that.",
            "There are many clubs on campus but most clubs leans towards your major. Some clubs really aren't leaned towards their objective as stated. Always go to interest meetings or contact people who are in the club to get a better understanding and what they stand for. Even though the outreach of getting new members isn't well promoted the campus activities are promoted well. They send out newsletters by email, which everyone receives. They post flyers around campus. They truly want a great turnout. Activities range from free bowling nights, community service activities, sport/football games, and on campus activities; such as humans vs zombies games. There is always something going on.",
            "Shenandoah is good for any type of student who just needs a college to go to. Music and conservatory student will benefit most from this university.",
            "Shenandoah is a great school but it is costly. It does provide free tutoring and MacBook Pros to use to make education process easier while in school. Even if you already have a computer you still pay for the computer given at part of the tuition there is no way around it. Depending on your major the teachers are great as well. Even though it is expensive they do provide opportunities and help to pay for school.",
            "Fun is what you make of it. If you live off campus is can be harder be involved in activities provided on campus. Winchester does not have much to do, so that is why you have to make your own fun and establish good friendships along the way. Other wise if you interested in the Club or party life, you might have to head towards Northern Virginia or DC, which is about an hour away.",
            "Food and dining on campus is okay, but it isn't as great as a home cooked meal from your parents. If you don't have a meal plan the food is overly expensive. There are deals with local restaurants that give discounts to students with your student ID.",
            "I can not describe dorm life due to the fact I have lived off campus while attending Shenandoah. I have seen apartment style dorm. It was small but there were two twin beds and two desk with chairs in them which took up the room. They did have a bathroom area for that room but i did not see it. Room made look bigger depending on how it is arranged.",
            "SU is really into Academics. They want you to keep in contact with your adviser so that you can maintain acceptable grades. The advisers is there to help you in anyway to achieve the needed grades or help. Also the Academic Enrichment Center provides tutors to help with understanding and maintain grades as well.",
            "Always have a visit to the school - to see how the campus is and decided if this is where you want to attend. Eat and drive around campus - to get a feel of how the school is. Visit on a day while classes are held- so you can see the average size of the classrooms and teacher to student ratio. Also ask students walking around campus what they truly think of Shenandoah. If you already know the major talk with some of the teachers and look at the curriculum and requirements to enter and stay into the program. Also ask any questions you may have. Ask about the clubs for the major and what to do in order to be apart of it. Ask to see a dorm room and varies types of dorm rooms - See the types of the dorm room vs the campus apartments. Then decide if the living conditions are acceptable to your personal standards."

It is a small school with a small campus, so if you are looking to party every night, this is not the school for you. If you are looking for a school that will make you achieve your potential, make you employable after graduation, and give you some great friends, then Shenandoah is your best bet. My schedule is nonstop, and my classes are rigorous, but if you are tenacious you can keep up with your studies and practicing what you learn. I",
