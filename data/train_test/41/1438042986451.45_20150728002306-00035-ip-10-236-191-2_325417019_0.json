Test if poultry is cooked with a skewer into the thickest part of the thigh juices should run clear with no sign of red or pink SERVE IMMEDIATELY. Cook at a high temperature (Gas mark 7/425/220) for 30-45 minutes, then lower temperature (Gas Mark 3/325F170) for remaining cooking time. Always wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw poultry. Ensure blood and water from defrosting bird does not drip or contaminate other food, work surfaces, or cutting boards. Separate raw and cooked foods and clean all surfaces/equipment well. Remove giblets before cooking. Preferably DO NOT STUFF bird. Cook stuffing separately otherwise stuff neck area only. Thaw thoroughly in a cool room. See the table below for thawing/cooking times. Check the weight of your bird together with any stuffing against the left hand column then read off the correct thawing and cooking times. Take special care with large birds.

Store in dry, cool conditions. Ensure dairy products (including milk, cream, yoghurt, soft cheese, eggs) are kept refrigerated when not in use. Keep fresh meat and defrosting foods at the bottom of the fridge to prevent dripping onto other foods. Avoid eating pate, soft cheese and foods containing raw eggs if you are pregnant, elderly or have low resistance to infection. You should also avoid giving these foods to babies and young children. Put chilled and frozen foods in the refrigerator or freezer as soon as you can. Try not to overload your fridge - it's essential that you keep turkey leftovers, other cooked meats, trifles etc. refrigerated - store drinks elsewhere if necessary. Keep the refrigerator/freezer at the correct temperature and use a thermometer. Refrigerator below 5C. Freezer below minus 18C.
