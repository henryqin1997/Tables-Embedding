Make sure you go to chapel so you will not be one of those people who are scrounging for chapel credits at the end of November. With your roommate make sure y'all talk your problems out so there's not any built up hostility. When you're filling out the survey for housing do not lie on it because it will only make things hard on you. And when you and your roommate meet go over the boundaries nod expectations so there isn't any misunderstandings., 306843=The best tradition is opening chapel, more commonly referred to as the Harry Potter chapel because all the professors come out in their doctoral robes. They march in all of the flags that represent staff or students from different countries, held by students from that countries as well as all the state flags. There are speeches and singing and it is just a great way to kick off the year., 387319=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 20713=At ACU the classes are always interesting and intriguing. The professors are excellent and are always up to date on current issues and events within their field of expertise as well as others and will combine this into the curriculum. The classes are interactive and this has been increased some by the Global Learning Initiative that was implemented in 2008-2009 school year that gave incoming Freshmen the choice between a paid for iTouch or iPhone (service not included with phone). This increased students ability to communicate with professors and peers which in turn increased student to professor feed back. Thus, increasing the overall learning experience. I have learned a lot while at ACU and look forward to learning much more., 203222=Every February there is an interesting event called Sing-Song. You are able to find videos/more information online. My favorite locations to visit on campus include the computer labs with large Apple computers, the basement of the library, the prayer room (equipped with a waterfall!) in the Bible building, the patio near the fountain lake, and all of the various cafes throughout campus., 97796=There are so many options of getting involved at ACU. SingSong, a lively tradition since 1956, is a time where clubs and classes show off their musical talent for parents, the student body, and visitors every spring time. Another way to get involved is Freshmen Follies, a type of Talent Show specifically for freshmen who want to get to know other freshmen and have a blast on stage. Before the start of their first year, everyone participates in what we call Welcome Week; this is a time where small groups participate in events with each other like the Welcome Week Olympics and perhaps the largest game of Twister in the world! Of course there are so many other ways to have fun and get to know your peers; examples include club activities, dances, intramural sports, etc.}",

ACU also provides a great atmosphere for anyone who wants to grow in their faith. Tips for prospective students The biggest tip I can provide, is to go into your freshman year with an open mind, and the desire to grow as an individual as well as in your faith. I learned so much about myself my freshman year, and after all of growth I did my freshman year, I still desire to grow even more through my next years in college. Another tip I have is to venture out and try new things that you have never done before because maybe you were too shy or too afraid. I was shy most of my years in high school, but I grew",
