Layer 1 is identified by the legend \"L1\" and reference numeral 106 and layer 2 is identified by the legend \"L2\" and reference numeral 206. Layer 1 conforms to the description of FIG. 2. Layer 3 is identified by reference numeral 208 and performs a plurality of functions as described below. Speech 210 is transmitted between the hardware 202 and the user interface 204. Data 212 is transmitted between hardware 202 and the user interface 204.}",

It is intended that all such modifications fall within the scope of the appended claims. As a result of sharing of the overhead of tracing the execution of selected parts of a computer program of a data processing system with a host processor, the data processing systems of devices, such as GSM transceivers, may have their programs traced without burdening their data processing capacity as typified by prior art usages of print messages. MN TCH attaching to TCh: state DSPSpeechLoaded\u2192DSPSpeechActive The host processor trace information 308 produced for the host system is a file of binary data which contains all the strings declared in the trace definition files 302, along with trace control data similar to the trace control data supplied to the transceiver which allows the host processor program to look up the trace id and then correctly unpack the trace message and display the trace string and its parameters in the way defined in the trace control file at step 314. In the example above, this results in the following trace output being generated at step 314: 4) GSMExternalTrace must look up the trace given in trace control tables of the embedded data processing system information 306 so it knows",
