Our colony was named for William Mullins who came on the Mayflower with his wife and two children. \u00a0Only his daughter Priscilla survived the first winter. \u00a0She married John Alden and left numerous descendants. [Webmaster's Note: \u00a0Today, many folks with the surname of Mullins claim to be decendants of William Mullins of the Mayflower. \u00a0However, since his only surviving child was Priscilla, who married John Alden, this is impossible. \u00a0All of the descendants of William Mullins are also Alden decendants, none bear the surname of Mullins (unless it is through marriage to another Mullins line). \u00a0This is also true for the Latham surname. \u00a0William Latham of the Mayflower had no known issue. \u00a0Those with a Latham surname today claiming decendancy from the Mayflower are usually from James Chilton of the Mayflower. \u00a0His granddaughter, Susannah Winslow, married Robert Latham (unrelated to William of the Mayflower).] The Mullins Colony gathers alternately in Ocala and Gainesville three times a year for luncheon meetings with featured speakers. Contact one of the Officers for specific meeting dates and locations in October, January, and April of each year., 7316=Mullins Mainsail - Vol 9, No 3 - Autumn 2012, 1097=The Mullins Colony was organized January 21, 1999. \u00a0The growth from 16 original members to 105 members is indicative of the increased interest in genealogy and history., 8088=Currently the Society of Mayflower Descendants in the State of Florida (FSMD) is divided into sixteen colonies located in different geographic areas of the state. \u00a0Each colony is named after a Pilgrim that was aboard the Mayflower in 1620. \u00a0It does not reflect the ancestory of its members, as some think. \u00a0The members in each colony may have any number of Mayflower ancestors, that may, or may not, have the same name as their respective colony.}",
