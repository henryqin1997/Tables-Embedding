A preferred aromatic ether is benzyl ether. The composition preferably includes from about 1 to about 30% by weight of aromatic ether based upon 100% weight of total composition. The weight ratio of aromatic alcohol to aromatic ether is preferably from about 3:1 to about 1:1 and more preferably about 2.5:1., 32186=An aromatic hydrocarbon cosolvent may be included in the composition. The aromatic hydrocarbon cosolvent may be a mixture of one or more aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. The aromatic hydrocarbon cosolvent improves the stability of the composition thereby increasing the shelf life of the composition. It also improves the rheological properties of the composition and the speed of penetration of the composition into paints and coatings. Furthermore, the aromatic hydrocarbon solvent reduces the surface tension and evaporation rate ofthe composition. Preferably, the aromatic hydrocarbon solvent has a flash point above about 150\ufffd F. and more preferably above about 190\ufffd F. Naphthalene depleted aromatic hydrocarbons are preferable since naphthalene has a noxious odor and is hazardous. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbon cosolvents, include, but are not limited to, Aromatic 200ND available from Exxon Chemicals of Houston, Tex.; Solvesso 200 available from Esso Corporation of Toronto, Canada; metaphenoxy benzyl alcohol; and any combination of any of the foregoing. The composition typically comprises from about 0.5 to about 40% by weight and more preferably from about 1 to about 30% by weight of aromatic hydrocarbon cosolvent based upon 100% weight of total composition. The weight ratio of water to aromatic hydrocarbon cosolvent is typically from about 30:1 to about 1.5:1 and preferably from about 20:1 to about 1.7:1.}",
