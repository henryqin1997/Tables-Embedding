            "There are always police patrolling. I feel safe at night on campus.",
            "Although I didn't rush, there is a lot of sororities and frats on campus. It was weird getting used to at first, but I might rush later on if I have the time.",
            "Relaxed personalities yet still hardworking and determined about educational pursuits",
            "There is a Wildlife Preserve that is awful to explore- there's even a lake.",
            "I was able to finish an entire years worth of credits simply from AP classes and duel enrollment at my local community college in high school! This has put me much farther ahead than most of the other freshman- and will ultimately save me a lot of money on tuition, books, and other fees.",
            "The best thing to do is go to the beach! You could even take a ferry Southport. If the weather isn't nice downtown is always inspirational and awing. Around campus there are many places to sit and relax- inside and out. There are a few popular clubs nearby, and downtown has an unending night life. The rec center here is stunning and perfect for anyone looking to stay fit. There is an indoor and outdoor pool!",
            "Wag gets old before you even internalize you moved away from home, and Food dollars always seem to run out before the end of the semester. Keep up with your meal plan and know how much is left on your account. I recommend the plans with meal swipes per semester, because the others expire weekly which is often wasteful. Food Dollars transfer is left over to the spring semester, but then expire before summer. There are a few good places on campus, and Landwich is a great option. My biggest complaint is in between classes their is extensive lines and traffic.",
            "There are so many options on places to live. Firstly you can live off campus as a freshman which is a viable option. Secondly, you could have a traditional dorm experience at Galloway of the all girl dorm, Belk. My unique place I chose to live is the University Apartments- where there is the convenience of living on campus but with the privacy of an apartment. You have your own room, and share the apartment with three other people. The only downside to this location is the difficultly meeting new people unlike in traditional dorms. I love the variety UNCW has to offer.",
            "If you organize and plan, you can pass your classes without extensive mental exhaustion. Professors vary, but all of them are willing to help and answer questions. Procrastination is your biggest enemy because many important projects/papers tend to be due around the same time. With proper preparation and adequate studying most people can succeed.",
            "Don't slack off at the end of your senior year because doing homework and going to class does nothing but get harder when college hits. I would also recommend applying early if you can. Make sure your recommendation letters are from the right teachers. Here's my biggest tip: Don't turn down UNCW for another school based on prestige. Truly we are without a football team and lack tailgating but it surely makes us unique. It's a beautiful school with amazing professors- and it also takes many more AP credits than similar schools.",
            "Let's admit it- we all are here because of either Wilmington's historic beautiful riverfront downtown, or Wrightsville Beach. Being a Seahawk is amazing, but ultimately you decide how rigorous of socialization you subject yourself to. Although I spent my first semester on the introverted side, I see so many opportunities in the future and like the atmosphere."

You won't regret it. Keep up to date with communication so you don't miss important information or dates. Apply early if you want to get scholarships. The honors college has many scholarships, but you have to apply to the honors college by april 1st to qualify., 360637=GET INVOLVED! Become a well-rounded student, not just academically achieved. Apply for scholarships, especially out-of-state applicants. If you plan to go here, bring an umbrella, rain jackets, summer clothes, and warm clothes-the weather is bipolar. Swimsuits and sunscreen- you can go to the beach in November. Always, always, ALWAYS use Rate My Professor...Always., 114309=Wagsgiving: In November, Wag gets people to cater thanksgiving food. It's a huge event and most of the campus goes. They even have shirts you can buy. Midnight Madness: It's pretty much homecoming. It's super fun, though. They give out free t-shirts and games. Haunted Hallways: Also a huge event. They decorate one of the dorms as a haunted house., 564030=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 393580=I love this school! It is currently October and still pretty hot, and the humidity can get pretty bad, but it is a really nice school! I am in the honors college so I am getting the best of both worlds: a great education and a great campus!, 6489=I am a transfer student from Appalachian State University and I'm just going to let you know, its a complete 180 from there. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and after about a week you know where all the buildings are. All the academic buildings are on this big long walk called Chancellor's Walk so if you're looking for your classroom, start there. During the first week Student Ambassador's are out there helping lost students and giving away free lemonade and water. Oh, and you probably already know this but the weather is gorgeous. It was the second week of November and I was out on the beach-where else can you do that?!, 240418=1. Get involved. I can't stress that enough. I was miserable first semester because I didn't do anything. Now I am having a blast! 2. Step out of your comfort zone. In order to make friends, you have to step out of your comfort zone and approach people! They're all friendly and nice! 3. GO TO EVENTS! Especially during the first few weeks of school, doing this will help you meet people. 4. Bring your car or make friends that have cars. You need a car to get around Wilmington... bikes and skateboards are only good for on campus! 5. Don't let the beach be the only reason you come here. It gets too cold to go in the water November-March, so you'll need things to do in the meantime! 6. MAKE SURE SCHOOL COMES FIRST! enough said. 7. If you live in the dorms, bring blankets. The AC is always blasting and it's freezing. 8. If you're in a big class, make sure you email and introduce yourself to the professor. This way it shows them that you care and they will eventually know your name! 9. Be open minded about classes. Take things that sound interesting to you. You may go in thinking you know your major, but you could be wrong, so have fun! 10. USE THE SERVICES ON CAMPUS! THEY'RE FREE!}",

Wilmington has been such an amazing experience. The professors are extremely helpful and approachable. My favorite class of the week is my 8:00am Tuesday-Thursday which is quite surprising, not many students would love their 8:00am! College is not a cake walk, I'm not going to lie, but if you do the work you will reap the benefits and the grades. I've managed to maintain on Dean and Chancellor's List these past two years.
