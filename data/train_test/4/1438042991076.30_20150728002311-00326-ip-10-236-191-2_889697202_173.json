From football games to Kinnick stadium to theater performances at Hancher auditorium, there is always something for students to do in their free time. The university sponsors many events every week that students may attend free of charge, which is wonderful because everyone knows that college students are not swimming in cash. For example, during Homecoming 2008, the University of Iowa brought in the band Rooney and Chuck Berry to play after the pep rally. Being able to see the old and the new of music for free before a major football game was an amazing experience, and I expect the University of Iowa to continue exciting events such as this in the future., 775443=The flood of 2008 did some damage to the Iowa Memorial Union, but it will be fully restored in 2015 with even more dining options and study spaces for students! Other dining options are available in the dorm halls. It's a little spendy (to be expected with on-campus dining), but the food is good and there are lots of options., 488904=I opted not to go to the dorms because I've heard there's a lot of drama/partying and also being packed like sardines doesn't really sound that appealing to me. Also, the Mayflower dorm floods everytime we have high water - so 1994, 2008 and 2013. Would not recommend living in that dorm - ever.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students The University of Iowa is a great fit for anyone, in my opinion. Outgoing, extroverted students will appreciate the large size of the school while more introverted students would love the attentiveness of the faculty. Jocks will love the fact that Iowa is a Big Ten university and theater buffs will adore the productions put on by the University of Iowa and the opportunity to participate in these productions. Tips for prospective students I would recommend future students to participate in extracurricular activities provided by the University of Iowa. They are a great way to get away from the books and allow you to take a break from all of the studying that is required at college. Bang for the buck The in-state tuition is one of the lowest in the state and many students migrate from the Chicagoland area to receive Iowa's out-of-state tuition. That says a lot, considering there are many great schools in Illinois. The quality of the education students receive at the University of Iowa is amazing, especially for students interested in health care fields. Access to a major research hospital (the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics) provides an excellent incentive to attend this school. Am enjoying being here",
