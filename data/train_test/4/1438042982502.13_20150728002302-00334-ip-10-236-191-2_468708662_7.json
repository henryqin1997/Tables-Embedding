    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{27441=Conductive polymers and electrical devices comprising them are well-known. Conventional conductive polymer compositions comprise an organic polymer, often a crystalline organic polymer, and, dispersed in the polymer, a particulate conductive filler such as carbon black or metal particles. Reference may be made, for example, to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,237,441 (van Konynenburg et al), 4,388,607 (Toy et al), 4,534,889 (van Konynenburg et al), 4,545,926 (Fouts et al), 4,560,498 (Horsma et al), 4,591,700 (Sopory), 4,724,417 (Au et al), 4,774,024 (Deep et al), 4,935,156 (van Konynenburg et al), and 5,049,850 (Evans et al), and copending, commonly assigned application Ser. Nos. 07/788,655 (Baigrie et al), filed Nov. 6, 1991, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,250,228, issued Oct. 5, 1993, and 07/894,119 (Chandler et al), filed Jun. 5, 1992. The disclosure of each of these patents and applications is incorporated herein by reference., 47134=The compositions of the invention can be used to prepare electrical devices, e.g. circuit protection devices, heaters, or resistors. Compositions of the invention are particularly suitable for use in circuit protection devices. Such devices comprise a conductive polymer element which is composed of the composition of the invention and which can have any suitable shape. Attached to the polymer element are at least two electrodes which are in electrical contact with the element and which can be connected to a source of electrical power to cause current to flow through the element. Although the circuit protection devices can have any shape, e.g. planar or dogbone, particularly useful circuit protection devices of the invention comprise two laminar electrodes, preferably metal foil electrodes, and a conductive polymer element sandwiched between them. Particularly suitable foil electrodes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,689,475 (Matthiesen) and 4,800,253 (Kleiner et al), the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Additional metal leads, e.g. in the form of wires, can be attached to the foil electrodes to allow electrical connection to a circuit. In addition, elements to control the thermal output of the device, i.e. one or more conductive terminals can be used. These terminals can be in the form of metal plates, e.g. steel, copper, or brass, or fins, which are attached either directly or by means of an intermediate layer such as solder or a conductive adhesive, to the electrodes. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,801 (Chan et al), and U.S. application No. 07/837,527 (Chan et al), filed Feb. 18, 1992, now abandoned in favor of continuation application, No. 08/087,017, filed Jul. 6, 1993. For some applications, it is preferred to attach the devices directly a circuit board. Examples of such attachment techniques are shown in U.S. application Ser. No. 07/910,950 (Graves et al), filed Jul. 9, 1992. Other examples of devices for which compositions of the invention are suitable are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,238,812 (Middleman et al), 4,255,798 (Simon), 4,272,471 (Walker), 4,315,237 (Middleman et al), 4,317,027 (Middleman et al), 4,330,703 (Horsma et al), 4,426,633 (Taylor), 4,475,138 (Middleman et al), 4,742,417 (Au et al), 4,780,598 (Fahey et al), 4,845,838 (Jacobs et al), 4,907,340 (Fang et al), and 4,924,074 (Fang et al). The disclosure of each of these patents and applications is incorporated herein by reference., 30639=Crystalline fluorinated polymers, also referred to herein as fluoropolymers, have been disclosed for use in conductive polymer compositions. For example, Sopory (U.S. Pat. No. 4,591,700) discloses a mixture of two crystalline fluoropolymers for use in making relatively high resistivity compositions (i.e. at least 100 ohm-cm) for self-limiting strip heaters. The melting point of the second polymer is at least 50\ufffd C. higher than that of the first fluoropolymer and the ratio of the first polymer to the second polymer is 1:3 to 3:1. Van Konynenburg et al (U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,898) discloses compositions for use in flexible strip heaters or circuit protection devices which are prepared from polyvinylidene fluorides which have a low head-to-head content (i.e. a relatively low number of units of --CH2 CF2 ----CF2 CH2 -- compared to --CH2 CF2 ----CH2 CF2 --). Lunk et al (U.S. Pat. No. 4,859,836) discloses a melt-shapeable composition in which a first fluoropolymer of relatively low crystallinity and a second fluoropolymer of relatively high crystallinity which is not melt-shapeable in the absence of other polymers, e.g. irradiated polytetrafluorethylene, are mixed to produce a highly crystalline material suitable for use in heaters and circuit protection devices. Chu et al (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/021,827, filed Feb. 24, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,317,061, issued May 31, 1994) discloses a mixture of a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene (FEP), a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoropropylvinyl ether (PFA), and polytetrafluoroethylene to prepare a composition which has good physical properties and exhibits little stress-cracking when exposed to elevated temperatures.

ETFE is Tefzel\u2122 HT2163, as described in Table I. CB is Raven\u2122 430 powder as described in Table I. Following the procedure of Examples 1 to 7, the ingredients listed in Table VI were mixed, compression-molded into a sheet with a thickness of about 0.51 mm (0.020 inch), laminated with nickel foil and irradiated to 10 Mrad. Circular devices having a diameter of 12.3 mm (0.5 inch) were cut from the laminate and 20 AWG wire leads were attached. Following temperature cycling as in Examples 13 to 16, the values for device resistivity, PTC anomaly height, R0 (initial resistance), and R24 (resistance after 24 hours powered into a high resistance state as described in Examples 13 to 16) were determined. The results are shown in Table VI. It is apparent that, in contrast to Examples 8 to 12, the addition of the ETFE does not enhance the PTC anomaly height for Examples 28 to 30 which contain emulsion polymerized PVDF.",
