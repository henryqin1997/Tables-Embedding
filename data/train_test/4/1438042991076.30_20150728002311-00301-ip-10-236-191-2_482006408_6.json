They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and it's practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the Claims appended hereto and their equivalents. Embodiments of the present invention, a system and method for identifying a TLB entry with a physical page number that is within a specified range has been described. While the present invention has been described in particular embodiments, it should be appreciated that the present invention should not be construed as limited by such embodiments, but rather construed according to the following Claims. In one embodiment of the present invention, specific implementations of identifying a TLB entry that resides in a finite memory range are specific to code morphing software (CMS). In one implementation, code-morphing software is designed to translate x86 instructions into VLIW (very long instruction word) instructions for the underlying hardware engine. In one embodiment",
