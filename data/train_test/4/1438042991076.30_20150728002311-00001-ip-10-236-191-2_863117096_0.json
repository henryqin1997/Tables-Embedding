    "textBeforeTable": "About Color and Availability - Pictured above are some available Pro-D colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. Pro-D plastic is the least expensive. It's great for beginners as entry level discs and pros love them too when they get 'beat up' and 'broken in'. It offers superior grip and comes in a rainbow of colors. The Discraft Pro D Avenger SS is a maximum distance driver with a Stability of 0.5 (slightly overstable). Discraft took the best aspects of the Avenger, its speed and glide, and flatted the edge. The result is a golf disc that flies longer and is easier to control. Throw it hard and flat for a slight fade to the right, then watch the Avenger SS keep on gliding through a smooth, gentle finish. It is a great flat flier for Ams. Pros love it for turnovers. Reviews (0) Description Write a review 0 reviews\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0",
