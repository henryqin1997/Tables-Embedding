Thereby when any one of the generating facilities at running state is repaired, checked or inspected, the message during the inspection other than information required for the running can be effectively prevented from being inputted to the standing man-machine interface means and the disturbance of the running can be prevented before it happens. According to the invention as above described, the output permission switch for the man-machine interface means such as CRT, T/W or the like is installed corresponding to each of the generating facilities, and condition of the output permission selecting switch is added to output requirements to the man-machine interface means and the selection becomes possible, thereby the running of the compound generating plant is not disturbed. Operation of the above system will be described. Data of the gas turbine generating facilities 41 and the steam turbine generating facilities 42 is collected through the data input/output device 48 and stored in the memory 49.",
