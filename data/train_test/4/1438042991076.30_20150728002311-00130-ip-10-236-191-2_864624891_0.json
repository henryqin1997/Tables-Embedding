Server Requirements Deborah Weil-O'Day. Questions? Please contact Please Note as announced with CLM v4.0.6: IBM will be simplifying the approach to high availability for the Rational CLM platform. Customers and IBM are increasingly using other technologies, such as cloud and virtualization strategies, that provide a solution which adapts to business demands for both availability and scale in a cost-effective manner. Please see Approaches to implementing high availability and disaster recovery for Rational Jazz environments for guidance and best practice. IBM will be removing support for WebSphere Application Server based application clustering from the CLM platform. For further details, please contact Support or your Technical Sales representative. The system requirements are broken down into various components including the server-based CLM applications that are deployed on one or more servers and various optional tools and clients. Server Requirements are further broken down into Non-Clustered and Clustered support where applicable. For platform pressures (enhancements and more) please see the CLM Platform Plans and Pressures Dashboard. Please see Planned Platforms Drops for later in 2014 at the end of this article - to help all teams with future platform planning Updates are in this pen. For a short",
