            "I see them making their rounds, and I know there's a number one can call. I've never felt unsafe.",
            "I haven't noticed any, but then again, I also haven't looked",
            "Well I've taken up Jujitsu, and Swing Dance, there's tons of workout groups, and cultural groups, and a great Student Activities Council who has the beat on all activities around campus, (and does events for prizes like gift cards and things you may want in your apartment). With Hilo being as tight knit as it is, if you have a hobby, chances are somebody knows when/where you can find a group.",
            "Great for students who want a relaxed environment where they get to experience being a minority (I don't think there actually is a majority at the campus, it's so mixed!). Meet people from New Zealand, Europe, Japan, Korea, and of course the Pacific Islands.",
            "For experience with cultures -both national and international- its wonderful! If you're looking for a chance to learn in paradise it's way less expensive than any vacation- especially for the length of time you're here! Is it a super tough school where you're locked in your room studying? You know, part of that can be your major, part time management. I personally don't think so, but I'm very careful with my time.",
            "Outdoor Edventure is an outstanding program where they take you for free to various places around the island with other college students. Kayaking, Volcano National Park, Green Sand Beaches, Snorkeling, Hiking, Maunu Kea, and if you get to know some locals (which you will), the entire island opens up to you.",
            "Affordable, yes, does it cover quite everything? Well the 7-day plan I had I still needed a couple hundred more Flexpoints to have a meal called lunch. Sodexo food is great and I will probably buy the food when I'm running between classes, but I'm going to utilize the local grocery stores and my fridge this semester. The all-you-can-eat meals are great at the beginning of the week, but are consistent, and aren't always the best, especially as the week goes on.",
            "I think they are great! They provide basic furniture, bathroom, haven't run out of hot water yet. If you're in apartment style- know to bring your own dishes/utensils/cookware/ect. And know that with a mild climate air conditioning consists of open or closed windows. They can be loud at night, whether it's from the neighbor's music, or the Koki frogs who like to sing all night.",
            "As with all colleges there are good professors, bad professors, and ones who you wonder why they are there. Rate my professor .com is a wonderful tool, also utilizing your fellow students. If you balance your time and homework you can have a great social life and get your homework done.",
            "Hawaii has a very easy going culture, which can make getting technical information a challenge. That said they are super friendly, so get a hold of an office or exchange emails and don't expect an immediate response. Hold your end up on the due dates, and don't try and save it all for last minute.",
            "The fact is, it's Hawaii. If you want to learn about the culture of an outstanding native people with other students from around the world this is a wonderful place to come! If there is interest in the outdoors you have everything from snorkeling to cliff diving to hiking, 9 climate zones and a volcano there's more than enough to explore."
