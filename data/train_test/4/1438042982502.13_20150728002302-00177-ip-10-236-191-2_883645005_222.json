            "The campus police department does a good job when they are needed and the campus and surrounding environment does not feel threatening. The campus police will even escort you to your car or other location if you are feeling nervous.",
            "There are many Greek sororities and fraternities available to those who are interested.",
            "There are many clubs and activities that students can get involved in. Some of these include: the MUSS for sporting events, student groups for ethnic backgrounds or certain lifestyles, and various seminars and presentations for a wide variety of topics.",
            "The University of Utah has a fairly diverse community. There are many groups and clubs on campus, including groups for various ethnicities, the LGBTQ community, religious groups, etc.",
            "The Eccles Student Life Center is a new addition to the campus and includes an indoor and an outdoor pool, a 4 story rock-climbing wall, a fully stocked weight room, a cardio machine room, showers, lockers, Freshens cafe (which has delicious rice bowls), and various sports courts. The center also offers gear rentals and fitness classes. The center is located right next to a Trax train stop, so it is convenient. Also, for most features, it is free to use for students currently enrolled in classes.",
            "In-state tuition is about $4000 per semester to receive an education from a prominent research university. The school is well-known for academics and athletics, as well as other areas.",
            "The campus is just a short drive from many canyons where you can bike, hike, climb, ski, snowboard, fish, hunt, and so much more.

Downtown Salt Lake City has great shopping as well.",

            "It is helpful to visit the campus and get familiar with the surrounding areas. Prepare to be challenged as you will likely have to show you can apply the knowledge you receive, not just regurgitate it onto a paper.",

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{802053=I don't live on the dorms but I wouldn't recommend it. It's overly priced for what you get. Even if you have a scholarship that covers living on campus you have to cough up the money for the food plan, which is like $1500. The food is edible but some people find it to be rather questionable., 702389=Outdoor activities abound! Hiking, skiing (both water and snow), swimming, tennis, canoeing, you name it, you can do it at the U and around in the nearby mountains. Plenty of open space for almost any activity. The U has great recreational facilities. The 2002 Winter Olympics were held in Sale Lake and the facilities are still in use to the public. Lots of outdoor concerts are held all through the valley and many sporting activities, outdoor fairs and festivals are held all year long. Southern Utah is beautiful year round and great for hiking., 34028=The U may overall be a tiny bit more expensive than Utah State but not by much. I am living at home (resident) and taking public transportation so all I had to pay for this semester was tuition which was around $3,000 for 14 credit hours. This amount is easy to take care of with scholarships and Financial Aid which the U offers a lot of. Just make sure to check the deadlines! They may be earlier like in February. Those are on the web and they also have departmental scholarships if you've already decided on a major; you just have to talk to your Advisor for more info. Also, as a student I get tons of free resources such as the gym/field-house use, FREE public transportation services, and academic resources such as career services (clean up your resume) or the writing center (edit a paper). Plus on top of that the U is always giving out freebies at events and discounts to restaurants and such. As a college kid free is my favorite word and the U understand that., 206576=it is a fairly diverse college with students from all over the world. it also has a good reputation in being a research university and is in the pac12. not to forget also that it has good professors, one recent one had won the 2007 nobel prize., 392750=I didn't stay in the dorms, however, I did have friends that did. I was up at the dorms quite a bit. The dorms were built for the 2000 Olympic guests and it shows. Unlike most dorms where four people share one bathroom the dorms here are spacious and have two separate bathrooms. Because the dorms were built in 2000 they are newer and pretty clean. My friends really loved being in the dorms., 892831=Dorm life is so much fun! RHA is the on-campus resident association and they constantly have things going on, like movie nights, ice cream socials, and last year we even held our own Hunger Games! The dorms are also incredibly nice since they rebuilt everything for the Olympics in 2002., 627793=The Olympic torch is outside the stadium, where the 2002 Opening Ceremony took place., 237760=my goodness, they are always having friday night events and wednesday nights there are movies at the post theater and every friday at 12:30 the spanish department puts on a foreign language film (but they keep that on the down-low)., 126517=This year I am living off campus at home. The Olympics were here in Salt Lake back in 2002 so dormitories were built for the Olympians which are now used by students., 926448=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 296813=The dorms on the University of Utah's campus are extremely nice considering they were built to house the participants of the 2002 Olympics. There is plenty of space for both your roommate and you., 242795=There's pretty much a club for everyone. and if you can't find one, you can get six random people together and start your own! Personally, I joined the marching band because they get to perform at all the football games, including bowl games! It's amazing feeling when a huuuge crowd of people cheer as you march onto the field!, 54518=The school is generally well priced, especially for in-state tuition. Housing is a bit pricey but the buildings were all just re-done for the athletes competing in the 2002 olympics. The personal rooms are spacious and the closets are pretty big, every floor has a laundry room and some kind of hang-out or study room.}",

There are lots of awesome hiking and bike trails in the hills behind the University, and we are just miles away from several canyons with numerous world-class ski resorts. There are also many good places for the rock climber or repeller to try his or her skills. The University of Utah is also a really great place",
