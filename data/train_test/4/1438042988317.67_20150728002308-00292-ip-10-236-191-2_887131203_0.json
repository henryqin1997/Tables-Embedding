Twitter started to go crazy over the first bit of information about Patch 1.3 on the PTS and the notes related to it, and before we even had time to read over them all we were slammed by specifics of the 1.3 Legacy perks. Just as we were starting to add that to the info we were already trying to take it we got slammed yet again with server transfers being confirmed to start next Tuesday, June 12th., 51961=June 7, 2012 at 6:29 PM}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Improved Warzone Experience Increases the amount of experience you receive from completing warzones. Advancement This is the section that I was most interested in as an altoholic. Here you have options to increase the rate at which you earn experience with various activities. There are five different categories that you can increase your experience gains from, and each of those five categories has five ranks worth of bonus experience. The bonuses from each rank are cumulative, meaning that their bonuses stack with one another, and you have to purchase the ranks in order. The idea behind this is that you can pick and choose how you want to level each character and you can choose for each character to be different. We\u2019ll see how it all actually plays out in the end, but for right now you need to be aware of that restriction. Legacy Perks 1.3 Are Character-Specific One thing that you must keep in mind with these perks is that they are not unlocked on a global level, instead they are unlocked only for the character that you purchase them with. That applies to all of the 1.3 Legacy perks. As I\u2019ve done with my other Legacy posts, I\u2019m going to give you the scoop on what they do, how they work, and how much you\u2019ll have to pay to get the. I\u2019ll also share my thoughts on cost vs. benefit. Today we had a torrent of SWTOR",
    "textAfterTable": "I see this being a very popular purchase. SWTOR has some of the best PvP you can get in the 10-49 bracket, and I think we\u2019ll see people more than happy to level solely through PvP and class quests.

I\u2019ve mostly avoided flashpoints while leveling because my wife doesn\u2019t like PUG\u2019s, and we almost always play together with just the two of us in the party, so my knowledge of which level ranges this would be effective in and which it wouldn\u2019t restricts my judgement on how popular this one might become. My gut tells me this is going to be a big deal though. Improved Space Mission Experience Increases the amount of experience you receive from completing space missions. Rank Credits Req.
