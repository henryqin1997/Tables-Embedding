It forms a 1-to-1 noncovalent complex with glycoprotein Ib, a platelet surface membrane glycoprotein complex that functions as a receptor for von Willebrand factor. The complete receptor complex includes noncovalent association of the alpha and beta subunits with the protein encoded by this gene and platelet glycoprotein V. Defects in this gene are a cause of Bernard-Soulier syndrome, also known as giant platelet disease. These patients have unusually large platelets and have a clinical bleeding tendency.
