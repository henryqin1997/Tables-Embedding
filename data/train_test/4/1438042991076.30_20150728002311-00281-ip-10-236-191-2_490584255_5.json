In such embodiments, NID 800 may comprise a ringing generator 840, which can be coupled to processing system 832 and in communication with an analog telephone 844. In other embodiments, NID 800 may also include an interface for connecting with a second external medium, perhaps a twisted pair local loop, which could provide analog POTS service, and NID 800 could pass through the POTS signal from that second external medium, allowing connection of an analog telephone to NID 800. NID 800 can also accommodate any of the interfaces discussed above, including, for instance, an IEEE 1394 interface 848, a wireless interface (e.g. 802.11, LMDS, etc.) 852, an Ethernet interface 856, and a coaxial interface 860. NID 800 can also comprise a twisted pair interface 868, which can, in some embodiments, allow NID 800 to provide telecommunication services via the existing telephone wiring at customer premises. These and other interfaces can allow NID 800 to be in communication with a variety of CPE devices as shown on FIG. 7, all of which are described elsewhere and need not be described here. Optionally, any of these interfaces may incorporate a balun (e.g. 864) or line driver, as discussed herein.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{191509=Those skilled in the art will appreciate, based on the disclosure herein, that NID 1100 can provide a robust platform for the transmission of a variety of telecommunication information, including without limitation, voice, data, audio and video information. For instance, with respect to video distribution, NID 1100 can distribute analog and/or digital signals using a variety of interfaces and/or protocols, as discussed above. For instance, video information can be transmitted as IP data using, e.g., interface 1132 b, and set-top box 1164 and/or video appliance 1136 can convert that information to analog information for display to a user. In certain embodiments, only one set of video information (i.e., one \u201cchannel\u201d) will be transmitted by NID 1100, and set top box 1164 and/or video appliance 1136 can submit configuration information to NID 1100 specifying which channel should be transmitted. In other embodiments, NID 1100 can transmit a plurality of channels via interface 1132 b, and set-top box 1164 and/or video appliance 1136 can function to select for display one or more channels from those transmitted., 175075=Depending on the embodiment, certain equipment can be located proximate to each video appliance (e.g., television, computer monitor, etc.) that is intended to receive video signals from the NID. For instance, with respect to video appliances that do not include digital tuners, a set-top box could be used to facilitate the transmission of digital video signals. (Alternatively, RF-modulated analog signals could be sent to the video appliance.) In other embodiments, a set-top box or other device (including even a video appliance itself) can be used to relay configuration information to the NID; such configuration information can include, inter alia, request to change video channels and/or the like. Further, an infra-red receiver (perhaps incorporated in a set top box) could receive signals from a remote control device at the location of a particular video appliance and relay those signals (using any internal transport medium, including the medium carrying the video signals and/or ultra high frequency (\u201cUHF\u201d) carrier waves, to name but two). Alternatively, a remote control device could communicate directly (via UHF, infra-red, etc.) with NID 1000., 186611=Moreover, processing systems 1112, 1124 can also be coupled to dedicated interfaces 1144, 1148. In this way, for instance, processing system 1112 can transmit/receive particular information (e.g., analog and/or digital video) on one or more interfaces 1144, and processing system 1124 can transmit a particular information set (e.g., IP data) on one or more interfaces 1148. In these and other ways, NID 1100 can be used (if desired) to transmit different information sets on different transport media, either in conjunction with or as an alternative to transporting a plurality of information sets on a shared internal medium, as detailed above. Merely by way of example, interfaces 1144 a, 1144 b, 1144 c can be coupled to video appliances 1152 a, 1152 b, 1152 c, respectively. Similarly, interfaces 1148 a, 1148 b, 1148 c can be in communication with computers 1156 a, 1156 b, 1156 c, respectively. In this way NID 1100 (and/or, in some cases, processing systems 1112 and/or 1124) can serve as, for instance, an Ethernet hub and/or an analog/digital video distribution hub for a customer premises wired using a star topology., 189886=In certain embodiments, a NID can include one or more diagnostic indicators, which can provide visual information on the functions and/or performance of the NID. Merely by way of example, NID 1100 includes a signal strength meter 1168 coupled to processing system 1112. Signal strength meter 1168, which can be an analog gauge, LED display and/or the like, can be used to determine the strength of one or more video signals received by NID 1100 and can be used both for troubleshooting purposes and configuration (e.g., tuning of receiver 1104 and/or antenna 1108). It should be appreciated that, while for purposes of illustration, meter 1168 is coupled to processing system 1112 and used to display video signal strength information, other embodiments can include a wide variety of diagnostic indicators, including network activity indicators, power indicators (including battery backup and/or power failure indicators), security indicators, and the like, and such indicators can be in communication with any appropriate component of NID 1100, including without limitation processing systems 1112, 1124, signal integrator 1128, discrimination device 1116, and/or any of the interfaces 1102, 1106, 1110, 1120, 1132, 1144, 1156, 1160. Moreover, any of the information available via such diagnostic indicators can also be made available digitally, such as perhaps via a configuration API, which is discussed elsewhere in this disclosure., 181722=Merely by way of example, the first processing device can decode a QPSK-encoded signal received from a DBS satellite via receiver 1008, perhaps producing an MPEG2 video feed. The second processing device can convert the MPEG2 feed into an NTSC signal for transmission to a television and/or re-encapsulate the MPEG2 feed (perhaps into IP packets and/or with a consolidated distribution protocol, for example). In certain respects, therefore, these processing devices can be considered to comprise one or more \u201ctranslation devices,\u201d the purpose of which is to provide decoding/encoding, reformatting and/or translation of various telecommunication protocols and encoding schemes. Translation devices, therefore, can comprise processors (including digital signal processors), memory and/or buffer devices analog/digital converters (and/or/digital/analog converters), digital and/or analog signal amplifiers/repeaters, RF modulators/demodulators, and the like., 167982=Discrimination device 1036, as well as interfaces 1004, 1012, 1020, 1028, can be in communication with a processing system 1044, which can include a variety of components, including those described above, and can perform any of the functions described above, such as routing, mediation, processing and the like, especially with respect to digital information sets. In certain embodiments, processing system 1044 can serve as a signal integrator to combine all of the signals received from interfaces 1004, 1012, 1020, 1028 and discrimination device 1036 (and, as those skilled in the art will recognize, route signals traveling in the opposite direction to the proper external transport medium). In other embodiments, each interface 1004, 1012, 1020, 1028 and/or discrimination device 1036 can be coupled to a plurality of discrete processing systems, which in turn can be coupled to a separate signal integrator, such as one described in detail below. Optionally, processing system 1044 can be coupled to an aggregator 1040, which can, inter alia, combine disparate information sets, perhaps received on different interfaces, for combined transmission to the customer premises. (Alternately, processing system 1044 could be directly coupled to one or more internal interfaces for transmission of information to the customer premises.), 65453=Other examples of transport media can also include universal serial bus (\u201cUSB\u201d) cable, cable complying with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (\u201cIEEE\u201d) 1394 standard, as well as any medium capable of complying with the many local area networking standards known in the art. Of course, a transport medium need not be a physical medium; it can also comprise any of a wide variety of wireless transmissions, including (but not limited to) infra-red transmissions, radio frequency (\u201cRF\u201d) transmissions, and transmissions complying with standards developed by any of the IEEE's working groups governing wireless communication (e.g., the 802.11, 802.15, 802.16 and 802.20 working groups). Similarly, a transport medium can comprise other wireless technologies, such as point-to-point microwave, including local multipoint distribution system (\u201cLMDS\u201d), microwave multipoint distribution system and/or multipoint multi-channel distribution system (collectively, \u201cMMDS\u201d) transmissions, and satellite, cellular/PCS, and/or ultra wideband transmissions, to name a few., 170377=Aggregator 1040 can be in communication one or more internal interfaces (e.g., 1048 a, 1048 b), which, as discussed above, can provide facilities for communication with any of a variety of internal transport media, perhaps through a balun or line driver. In the illustrated example, interface 1048 a can be a coaxial (e.g., RG6 and/or RG59) cable interface, and interface 1048 b can be a twisted pair (e.g., category 3, category 5, category 6, category 7, etc.) interface, perhaps for connection to the existing telephone wiring at customer premises. Similarly, NID 1000 can be in communication with any of a variety of CPE devices and/or home fixtures (e.g., 1052, 1056, 1060), including those discussed above, and can be configurable and/or addressable., 37071=This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 7,433,465 by Steven M. Casey et al., the entire disclosure of each of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes., 38385=This application is also related to each of the following commonly assigned, copending applications, the entire disclosures of each of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes: Title: \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MONITORING VISUAL INFORMATION,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/377,283, filed Feb. 27, 2003; Title: \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR FORMING PICTURE-IN-PICTURE SIGNALS,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/377,290, filed Feb. 27, 2003; Title: \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROVIDING AND DISPLAYING PICTURE-IN-PICTURE SIGNALS,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/377,281, filed Feb. 27, 2003; Title: \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DELIVERING PICTURE-IN-PICTURE SIGNALS AT DIVERSE COMPRESSIONS AND BANDWIDTHS,\u201d Issued U.S. Pat. No. 7,187,418 issued Mar. 6, 2007; and Title: \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DISPLAYING DATA OVER VIDEO,\u201d U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/377,282, filed Feb. 27, 2003. Each of the aforementioned are filed on a date even herewith., 167215=NID 1000 optionally can include an interface 1032 adapted to be coupled to a twisted pair copper transport medium, which can be, for instance, a telecommunication service provider's local loop. Interface 1032 can also be coupled to a discrimination device 1036, the nature and functions of which are described in detail elsewhere in this disclosure. Discrimination device 1036 can be used to transmit (and/or receive) analog POTS signals to/from a traditional telephone, and (optionally) can be in communication with an aggregator 1040, which, as discussed in detail above, can consolidate a variety of analog and/or digital information sets for transmission throughout the customer premises., 145338=As mentioned above, NID 504 can support a variety of other interfaces and attachments as well. For example, in certain embodiments, NID 504 (and more precisely processing system 508) can comprise one or more fiber optic interfaces, including for example, IEEE 1394 interface 572, as well a variety of standard Ethernet connections, including for instance a category 5 10Base-T interface 576 that can be used, for example, to attach one or more personal computers (e.g., 580) to NID 504, as well as a wireless interface 578. Processing system 508 can also include a coaxial (RG6 and/or RG59) interface, either through use of a balun 588 (to convert, for example, from twisted pair to coaxial cable) or through a direct coaxial connection to processing system 508., 159393=For instance, in some embodiments, fiber optic cable 804 can transport both video (digital or analog) and data information sets. Merely by way of example, in the illustrated embodiment, video information can be transmitted from a distribution point at a frequency of 1550 nm, while data can be transmitted at lower frequencies. Thus, multiplexer 812 a can separate the higher frequency video information from the rest of the transmission and can route the video information via transport medium 816. Conversely, NID 800 can route the lower frequency data information via transport medium 820, which can be in communication with multiplexer 812 b. In some embodiments, multiplexer 812 b can be used to aggregate and/or separate incoming and outgoing signals, for instance those on transport media 824 a and 824 b, respectively, according to light frequency. In other embodiments, a single transport medium 824 could transport two-way data communications; multiplexer 812 b thus can be optional., 177925=NID 1100 optionally can include other interfaces (e.g., 1110) for communicating with a additional external transport media (which could include, merely by way of example, a twisted-pair local loop, which might carry xDSL telecommunication information, a fiber link, a coaxial cable, a wireless link, and/or the like), allowing NID 1100 to provide telecommunication services via a variety of different external media. In some aspects, interface 1110 could be considered to be in communication with a data source (e.g., a source and/or recipient of IP or other data), although, depending on the embodiment, interface 1110 could be capable of receiving any type of telecommunication information and should not be interpreted as limited to receiving data. A data source can include any external transport medium in communication with NID 1100, as well as any transmission of data via such a medium., 180827=Processing system 1112, in certain embodiments, can comprise a processing device (for instance, a digital signal processor) operable to decode a signal encoded by a remote transmission algorithm, producing digitally-formatted video information, for instance, MPEG2 data and/or HDTV signals. If desired, processing system 1104 further can convert the digitally-formatted information to produce analog video signals, for instance NTSC and/or PAL signals, and/or can serve as an RF modulator to enable the transmission of a plurality of such signals on a single medium. In certain embodiments, processing system 1112 can comprise a first processing device for decoding a remote transmission algorithm and a second processing device for translating the resulting digital information to a different format (which can be either digital or analog)., 169490=As discussed above, in one aspect, aggregator 1040 can be used to combine digital and analog information sets (for instance, a POTS information set from discrimination device 1036 and an IP information set from processing system 1044), as well as filter information sets traveling in the opposite direction for routing to the correct component and/or interface. In some aspects, aggregator 1040 can be configured to format one or more information sets according to desired protocols, including Ethernet, HPNA, HPNA+, and/or HomePlug, before and/or after combining information sets for transmission, as well as to convert from such formats when receiving information from the customer premises. Alternatively, processing system 1044 can be configured to perform any and/or all of the functions of aggregator 1040., 82057=Demarcation device 108 can communicate with CPE 120 (which can be located inside customer premises 116) through internal transport medium 124, which can comprise any of the media discussed above. In particular, internal transport medium 124 can comprise the existing telephone wiring in customer premises 116 and, in some embodiments, is capable of carrying voice, data and video information, as well, perhaps, as other types of telecommunication information, using any of a variety of multiplexing schemes. For instance, as described in Edward H. Frank and Jack Holloway, \u201cConnecting the Home with a Phone Line Network Chip Set,\u201d IEEE Micro (IEEE, March-April 2000), which is incorporated herein by reference, the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance (\u201cHPNA\u201d) standards allow for simultaneous transmission of both voice information and Ethernet frames across twisted-pair copper telephone wiring. The term \u201cconsolidated distribution protocol\u201d refers to any transmission protocol or convention that can be used to transmit multiple disparate information types on a shared medium. HPNA can be considered one type of consolidated transmission protocol, as can the related HPNA+ protocol, as well as the HomePlug\u2122 standard, discussed in detail below. Any time multiple discrete information sets are transmitted on a shared/common transport medium (or a shared/common set of transport media), those information sets can be termed, collectively, \u201ccombined information sets.\u201d Often, a combined information set will be formatted with a consolidated distribution protocol, although those skilled in the art will recognize that such formatting is not always necessary; different information sets sometimes can share a common medium without needing to be translated with a consolidated transmission protocol., 182719=As noted above, certain embodiments of NID 1100 can include a second interface 1110 for receiving/transmitting additional telecommunication information, e.g., data, perhaps from a provider's \u201clocal loop\u201d wiring to the customer premises. In some such embodiments, interface 1110 can be coupled to a discrimination device 1116, the nature and functions of which have been discussed elsewhere in this disclosure. In one aspect, therefore, NID 1100 can be configured to transmit/receive, for instance, a combined signal (i.e., a transmission that includes multiple information sets) on interface 1110, and discrimination device 1116 can be configured to separate POTS information in the signal from non-POTS (e.g., xDSL) information (and, of course, to combine information sets for transmission to the external transmission medium). POTS information can be routed to an analog interface 1120, which can, in some embodiments, be adapted to be in communication with one or more analog telephones., 177071=For instance, those skilled in the art will recognize that, in some DBS implementations, a customer premises with multiple video appliances will require a plurality of connections to receiver 1104 (e.g., a plurality of discrete connections to a multiple low noise-block (\u201cLNB\u201d) converters) to provide multiple video feeds to the video appliances. Interface 1104 can accommodate as many such connections as necessary. Further, NID 1100 can include an additional interface 1106 that can be coupled to an off-air antenna (either analog or digital, including HDTV) 1108, CATV connection, and/or the like. In certain embodiments, interface 1102 and 1106 can be the same interface, while in other embodiments, additional interfaces can communicate with additional video sources., 183798=Discrimination device 1116 can also be coupled to a second processing system 1124, which can be used to process any non-POTS information (e.g., video, data, etc.) that travels though discrimination device 1116. (As disclosed above, in other embodiments, a single processing system could provide the functionality of the two illustrated processing systems 1112, 1124). In certain embodiments, processing system 1124 can, inter alia, translate xDSL information to, for instance, IP data and/or format that data into a consolidated distribution protocol for transmission on a shared medium to the customer premises. Thus, processing system 1124 can also incorporate one or more translation devices, which are described above. Processing systems 1112, 1124 can be coupled to a signal integrator 1128, which can combine information sets (in this case, for example, from each processing system 1112, 1124), e.g., for transmission to the customer premises or for consolidated processing, and/or split a consolidated information set (e.g., an information set received from the customer premises) into one or more information sets for transmission to the appropriate processing system, external interface, etc. In some embodiments, signal integrator 1128 can provide conversion to/from a consolidated distribution protocol. In other embodiments, one or more of processing systems 1112, 1124 can incorporate the functionality of signal integrator 1128, and processing systems 1112, 1124 can be coupled to each other. Signal integrator 1128 can also incorporate the functionality of an aggregator, discussed elsewhere in this disclosure., 192770=In many embodiments NID 1100 can be configured to operate in either fashion, and those skilled in the art will recognize that the functionality of the video appliances and/or set-top boxes at the customer premises, as well as the wiring topology of the customer premises, might render one mode more suitable than another. For instance, in a location with a plurality of video appliances and/or set-top boxes connected in bus fashion on a single medium, where each device is capable of selecting the desired channel for display, it may be more suitable to broadcast all of the available channels across the medium and allow each device to select from the broadcast. Conversely, in certain cases, for example, where each video device (i.e., set-top box and/or video appliance) is addressable and/or resides on a different transport medium and/or where one or more video devices are incapable of selecting from among a plurality of transmitted channels, it may be more appropriate to transmit a single channel to each device and/or transport medium, and allow the video devices (and/or separate remote control devices) to transmit requests for the desired channels back to NID 1100. In this way, for instance, a plurality of video appliances 1152 a, 1152 b, 1152 c can be attached to NID 1100 via separate transport media, and processing system 1112 can send a discrete signal to each video appliance. Alternatively, a plurality of addressable video devices could be coupled to interfaces 1132 a, 1132 b (and/or any other interfaces), and a discrete video signal could be addressed to each attached video device and transmitted over a common transport media., 178894=Interface 1104 can be in communication with a processing system 1112, which can include any of the components discussed above, and, also as discussed above, can process received information in any of a variety of ways, including without limitation translating, decoding, encoding, converting, reformatting and/or otherwise processing information received on interface 1104. In embodiments comprising more than one video interface (e.g., 1102, 1106), processing system 1112 can serve as a signal integrator for combining the video information received on each interface. (Alternatively, a separate signal integrator can be coupled to interfaces 1102, 1106 and configured to combine the signals before transmission to processing system 1112 and/or directly to an interface for communicating with the customer premises)., 185590=In further embodiments, discrimination device 1116 can also be coupled to signal integrator 1128, which can incorporate the functionality of an aggregator, described above. In this way, POTS information and non-POTS information (including, for instance, any combination of video, data and audio information) can be distributed to the customer premises on a common transport medium, perhaps formatted according to a consolidated distribution protocol. Signal integrator 1128 can be coupled to a plurality of interfaces (e.g., 1132 a, 1132 b), which can provide connectivity to a variety of different internal transport media, for communication to any of a variety of CPE and/or home fixtures (illustrated by video appliance 1136 and PC 1140). Merely by way of example, interface 1132 a can be a twisted pair (e.g., RJ11) interface, and interface 1132 b can be a coaxial (e.g., RG6, RG59) interface.}",
