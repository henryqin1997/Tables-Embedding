His primary research interest centres on the relationship between design practice and design theory. He has also conducted research in the areas of industrial product design, glass materials processing, design in robotics, and the theoretical principles underpinning design. He has successfully secured funding for various research projects, including an ARC research grant for his Masters thesis based on photovoltaic solar energy-converting roof tiles. The aims of this project were two-fold; first to render theoretical ideas into drawings and images that could communicate to both general and specialist audiences, and second to transform ideas into realisable experiments, outcomes and commercial opportunities. Prior to academia, Dr Dickinson began his career designing sets and special effects for television and film production. He later delved into commercial design, working as part of a collective to design consumer products like clothing, diaries, chairs and light fittings. His diverse and practice-oriented career has made him adept at finding design solutions to problems, which feeds into his teaching of studio and theory-based design courses. Dr Dickinson has supervised many student projects at the Honours and Masters level in areas such as",
