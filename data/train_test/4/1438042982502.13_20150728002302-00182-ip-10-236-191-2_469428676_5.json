The coated bottle was dried in an air-circulated oven at 55\ufffd C. for 60 minutes. The average thickness of the polyvinylidene chloride type resin coatings formed on the inner and outer surfaces of the polyvinyl chloride bottle was 25\u03bc., 88676=The inner surface of an amorphous polyethylene terephthalate preform (bottomed parison) having an outer surface area of 130 cm2, a weight of 62.5 g and an average thickness of 3.60 mm was coated with the polyvinylidene chloride type resin latex described in Example 8 according to the dip coating method so that the amount of the coating was 0.22 g as solids. Then, the coated preform was heated at 100\ufffd C. for 20 seconds and biaxially drawn and blow-molded by using a known biaxially drawing blow molding machine to obtain a biaxially drawn polyethylene terephthalate bottle having an inner volume of 2000 cc and an average total thickness of about 0.50 mm, which had the inner surface coated with the polyvinylidene chloride type resin. The average coating thickness was 1.4\u03bc., 87426=For formation of a protecting layer, a latex of a vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copolymer having an Izod impact strength (ASTM D-256) of 7.7 Kg/cm2 at 5\ufffd C. (2023 ST supplied by Toyo Ink; solid concentration=17% by weight; viscosity=22 centipoises) was dip-coated as the film-forming resin on the inner surface of the vinylidene chloride copolymer layer, and the coated bottle was dried at 100\ufffd C. for 5 minutes in a perfect oven (explosion-proof type). The average thickness of the protecting layer was 10\u03bc. This bottle having the coating layer is designated as \"bottle Nc\". The comparative bottle free of the protecting layer is designated as \"bottle Nm\" and the starting uncoated bottle is designated as \"10 PET\"., 91194=For formation of a protecting layer, a latex of an acrylonitrile/butadiene rubber having an Izod impact strength (ASTM D-256) of 9.8 Kg/cm2 at 5\ufffd C. (Hycar 1552 supplied by Japanese Geon; solid concentration=52% by weight; viscosity=33 centipoises) was coated as the film-forming resin on the outer surface of the vinylidene chloride copolymer layer according to the dip coating method in an amount of 1.3 g as solids, and the coated bottle was dried at 70\ufffd C. for 10 minutes in a perfect oven (explosion-proof type). The coated preform was heated at 100\ufffd C. for 20 seconds and biaxially drawn and blow-molded by using a known biaxially drawing blow-molding machine to obtain a laminated polyethylene terephthalate bottle having an inner volume of 2000 cc and an average total thickness of about 0.50 mm and having a substrate/coating layer/protecting layer structure. The average thickness of the coating was 6.1\u03bc and the average thickness of the protecting layer was 17\u03bc.

Then, an emulsion of a polyvinylidene chloride type resin having a composition shown in Table 2 (dispersion medium=water, emulsifier=Poval, solid concentration=45%) was coated on the bottle according to the dip coating method. The coated bottle was dried at 70\ufffd C. for 10 minutes in a perfect oven (explosion-proof type). The average coating thickness of the polyvinylidene chloride type resin was 11\u03bc., 86574=The inner surface of a biaxially drawn polyethylene terephthalate cylindrical bottle having an inner volume of 1000 cc, a weight of 45 g and an average thickness of 0.54 mm was coated with a latex of a polyvinylidene chloride type resin comprising 83% by weight of vinylidene chloride, 14% by weight of methoxyethylmethyl methacrylate and 3% by weight of methacrylic acid and including 40 parts by weight of trichloroethylene per 100 parts by weight of the foregoing monomers (dispersion medium=water, emulsifier=Poval, solid concentration=47%) according to the dip coating method. The coated bottle was then dried at 70\ufffd C. for 10 minutes in an air-circulated oven. The average thickness of the polyvinylidene chloride type resin coating formed on the inner surface of the biaxially drawn polyethylene terephthalate bottle was 10\u03bc.}",

The peel strength after falling was repeated 10 times was 2.0 Kg/15 mm. The transparency was 3.5% as the haze value. The surface of the container was hardly scratched and the appearance and preserving characteristic were good. A comparative container free of the vinylidene chloride copolymer intermediate layer, which had the same thickness as described above, had an oxygen permeability of 35 cc/day.atm as measured at 37\ufffd C. and the interlaminar adhesion strength was 0.8 Kg/15 mm. After falling was repeated 10 times, the peel strength of the comparative container was 0.4 Kg/5 mm.
