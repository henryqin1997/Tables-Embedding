    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{59540=Rock Hudson was born Roy Scherer, Jr. See how his school mates felt about him. Rock Hudson had much adored and respected his mother. He didn't legally change his name until she passed in 1976. He was always very fun loving. Rock Hudson was a great friend to many. He had a great sense of humor, a great laugh, a wonderful smile, a love for life and he loved to play practical jokes on the people closest to him. He loved to play bridge, work in his garden, build fires in his out door fire places and recite limericks., 128833=\u00a9 2015 Rock Hudson Estate Collection, 63706=Rock Hudson started his acting career in about 1948, won fame with \"Magnificent Obsession in 1953, and was nominated for an academy award for \"Giant\" with Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean in 1957. Even though he lost to Yul Brenner for \"The King and I.\" This finally gained him the respect he deserved from within the Industry. He grabbed another audience when he started doing comedy in 1959 in movies like \"Pillow Talk.\" He was terrified to take on this challenge in the beginning as comedy takes such precise timing and delivery. Something he was not used too at the time. He had been, by that time a much more Dramatic Actor. Everyone could see that he would quickly adapt to comedy, as he had such a great sense of humor. Though Rock Hudson and George Nader never starred in a film together, They did do a photo shoot at the Salton Sea. It was fun for both as it entailed Water Skiing. A sport they both adored. We have stills and film of this event., 64912=We have George Nader's Baby Shoes the Bronzed Shoes and the Real Leather Baby Shoes. We also have Special Edition Numbered Copies of George Nader's Book Chrome. Published in 1978. Chrome, A Gay Science Fiction Novel, sold out at Pick Wick Book Stores its first day of release and quickly became a collectible. It is also used as a Teaching Tool in the U.C.'s. George Nader brought real notoriety and fame to himself when he took his career to Europe in his role as \"Jerry Cotton-F.B.I. Agent\".\u00a0 Jerry Cotton was and still is a bi-monthly, in print since 1946. During the 1960's they produced 8 episodes in which George Nader was the star. \u00a0 If you buy Medley's Kentucky-U.S.A. Whiskey in Germany today, George Nader's picture is on the bottle. He then returned to the United States and continued making films until he was diagnosed with Glaucoma which forced him out of the business as the key lights might have blinded him. He then directed his energies towards being an author. And a Fantastic Author he became. \u00a0 He is also known for many other roles on Television, The Big Screen and Stage.}",
