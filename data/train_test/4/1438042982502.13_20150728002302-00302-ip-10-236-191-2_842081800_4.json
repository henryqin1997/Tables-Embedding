The NRC had published a ration for poultry with 15% pure sucrose in 1994 publication. Several other research papers described the advantage of sugar feeding. The concept of better metabolisibility of sugar than starch supported the development work in AKS., 17529=2600, 40991=Feeding of poultry has become more innovative as the conversion of feed to poultry production is more efficient than ruminant. Unlike dairy, poultry products like meat and egg are energy dependant on synthesis as the major energy component is utilized for oxidative energy. It is assumed that out of 3200 kcals ME 1500 Kcals is used for the body maintenance and 800 kcals for products synthesis. The incorporation of carbohydrates into chicken meat or egg is insignificant as the composition is with the nutrients like water, protein, fat and mineral. Every year the marketing age of broilers decreases by an average of 0.75 days for the same performance. This trend is likely to continue in the same direction for the coming years. Nutrition plays a vital role in enabling this improvement. As the feed cost represents an expensive input (~70-80% of broiler production cost), the poultry producer should be aware of the dynamics of the feed in its influence on final product quantity and quality., 11583=Publication date: 08/28/2008 Technorati Tags: Informasi, 38362=The requirement of energy for poultry is referred as metabolisible energy (ME). 4000 kcals of gross energy from 1 kg carbohydrates will be 3200 kcals digestible energy after loosing 800 kcals in faces. Another 300 kcals is lost through urine to make 2900 kcals as the metabolisible energy (ME). Furthermore 600 kcals lost as heat increment to yield 2300 kcals as net energy (NE). It is assumed that 1500 kcals is the requirement for maintenance and 800 kcals for meat and egg production. (See NRC ,1994). It could be inferred that poultry utilizes 20% dietary energy for product synthesis while 40% is used for its body maintenance., 31647=The dietary fat in poultry ration is found to alter the fatty acids profile in egg. (See table 2). The fatty acid composition of yolk lipids was affected (P>0.05) by the experimental diets. The major effects of the diets were observed in fatty acids C16:0, C18:0, C18:1n9, C18:2n6, C20:4n6, C20:5n3 and C22:6n3. The addition of oils to the diets fed to hens allowed the production of eggs with higher n3/n6 and PUFA/SFA fatty acid ratios than the eggs from control hens. It was concluded that the amounts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in egg yolk could be altered by dietary manipulation. (see M. C. Milinsk, A. E. Murakami, S. T. M. Gomes, M. Matsushita and N. E. de Souza)., 27595=According to Proszkowiec-Weglarz, AMPK plays a central role in sensing cellular energy levels. It begins a series of events that affect food intake and metabolism of fat, carbohydrate, and protein. \u201cAMPK is really a molecular fuel gauge and a master metabolic regulator in cells,\u201d she says. \u201cIt responds to fluctuations in the levels of cellular energy and of specific extracellular nutrients and hormones.\u201d Cells obtain energy from conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). \u201cAMPK senses the ratio of AMP to ATP and works to raise the level of ATP within cells\u201d says Proszkowiec-Weglarz. \u201cOur goal is to learn how the AMPK pathway functions in birds to achieve energy balance, so growers can efficiently produce chickens of optimal weight while minimizing excess fat.\u201d (US Department of Agriculture ,2008.), 35667=The energy content of a diet is usually given as so many calories per kilogram of diet. Thus diets are said to contain, for example, 2800 or 3200 kcal per kilogram. Energy is the fuel that keeps the many different body functions operating, every minute of the day. It is a vital feed component, a costly feed component and the most wasted of the feed components. Hence, everything should be done to enhance the utilization of dietary energy for productive body functions, as improvements readily show up in increased monetary returns which are readily apparent by improved feed:gain or egg mass ratios., 20259=2918 \u2013 3396, 18228=2960}",

The most vital nutrient in the poultry ration is considered \u2018dietary energy\u2019 even though energy itself is not converted into meat or egg in poultry except liponeogenesis. Moreover; it is used as fuel for the synthesis of meat or egg. Therefore 60-65 % of the metabolisible energy in the poultry ration is imputed to carbohydrate. Environmental temperature and the energy content of the feed are key determinants for the feed intake of the bird. Other nutrients are normally adjusted based on the feed intake of the bird. There exists a relationship between energy and digestible amino acids, which if maintained, will enable adjustment of crude protein levels in the diet, thereby reducing the feed cost without compromising performance. Optimum live performance, maximum protein retention and reduced carcass fat content can only be obtained if a proper",

Carbohydrate Digestion in Poultry (S. Leeson and A.K. Zubair) The energy content in sugar syrup could be compared with that of Corn (see table 5.) The net energy available from Corn is less owing to various nutrient loss during digestion and metabolism. Further more there is a loss owing to heat increment. Since the sugar syrup has no indigestible matter the total sugar is converted into monosaccharides and is available to birds with out any heat increment. Table 5.
