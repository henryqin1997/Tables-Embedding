The various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without the use of the inventive faculty. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein. In each of the above embodiments, antenna coupler 100 may be encased in a plastic or other non-conductive housing assembly 300 or the like in order to protect coupling elements 204a-204c, ground pins 206a-206c and ground plane 102 from damage, and to provide support for the structure of antenna coupler 100. Preferably, the housing assembly 300 encasing antenna coupler 100 would have a receptacle on a top face for receiving and securely capturing the portable radiotelephone 200 such that antenna 204 is brought within close proximity to coupling elements 204a-204c, and ground pins 206a-206c are physically aligned with, and securely mate with, the externally accessible grounds on portable radiotelephone 200, i.e., assembly screws 202 and/or battery ground port 206. Clearly, many different designs for the housing assembly 300 may be used without departing from the inventive concept of the present invention. For example, the",
