    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Campus Safety the safety on campus is great. students do feel safe as they attend classes, and have places to go for help, if needed. Clubs and Activities intramurals, gay and straight alliance, and so many other varieties of clubs. Great for these types of students students that are older and coming back to school. students that have just graduated and are worried about the large college experience. actually all students. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus there is a center in lubbock, the byron martin atc building, which students from lubbock can take some of their classes. this accessibility is critical for students from lubbock. there is also the reese campus which is right outside of lubbock, that is nicely located between lubbock and the main campus in levelland. these locations make it so very easy for students to plan their schedule according to jobs and home, especially if your from lubbock. Bang for the buck i feel like coming to south plains college was a major point in my life, because the preparation i am receiving for the future will be very beneficial.",
