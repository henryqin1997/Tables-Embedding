But there's nothing mundane about the type of season he assembled in 2009, hitting .334 with 18 home runs and 66 RBIs in 153 games while displaying improved range defensively and stealing more bases (30) than in 2007 and '08 combined.}",

I think we can learn from all of them.\", 2663=The World Series heads into next month, and the man who already lists Mr. November among his nicknames is counting on the fact that he will be there., 1697=Owing a big part of this season to his hard winter work, Jeter will certainly figure into the discussion for the American League Most Valuable Player Award once this postseason race is all said and done, but for now, that march is well under way., 2211=Setting the table for a club that hopes to vault past the Angels and enter its first World Series since 2003, Jeter hit .400 (4-for-10) in the Bombers' three-game whitewash of the Twins in the AL Division Series, including a game-tying home run in Game 1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Most career playoff homers It's the only way for Jeter, having spent his first 12 big league Octobers playing baseball and usually winning, taking home four titles in his first five seasons. Then came last year, the lost one for Jeter and the Yankees. The Phillies won that World Series, but Jeter never reached for the remote. \"Our goal when we come into the season is to win a championship,\" Jeter said. \"That's how it is every year. You don't go home and celebrate regular-season championships. You don't go home and celebrate getting to the World Series. Our goal is to win it. That's been my mind-set since I've come up, and it never changes.\" George Steinbrenner doesn't show up much in the Bronx anymore, preferring to keep tabs on his players from a cushy pad in Tampa, Fla. But his words spill out of Jeter's mouth at almost every turn. The captain learned a little something from The Boss in those closed-door meetings across the street at the old place, you see.

    "textAfterTable": "\"It's like when you're a little kid and your parents don't let you go outside and play,\" he said. \"You're not going to sit in the window and watch.\" In a clubhouse stocked with players who don't boast the postseason credentials of the so-called \"Old Guard\" Yankees teams, Jeter is a calming influence, the franchise's face and spokesman over the past 14 seasons. \"We have four or five guys in our clubhouse that have been there and done that, and have played extremely well in October,\" Alex Rodriguez said. \"I think all of us can follow those guys. Those guys, especially Derek -- he is our captain and our leader. I think we can learn from all of them.\" Behind closed doors, teammates say that Jeter is a different person, never completely letting his true persona out of the bag. That's calculated -- Jeter's public presence sets the tone for the Yankees, a dapper Wall Street suit in a room full of blue jeans. Most players have pictures of family members or Yankees logos on the computer screens installed at their lockers. Jeter keeps an AccuWeather forecast, always watching, monitoring. It is that work ethic that has allowed him to bounce back. Jeter's resurgence was no better exhibited than the fountain of youth he found in Florida over the winter, having something to prove to all those who flooded the message boards and said Jeter",
