    "textBeforeTable": "Below are elements that are common to research and evaluation projects. This list is not intended to be comprehensive and not all elements are required in order for a project to be considered research or evaluation. Rather, this list of elements can be used to assist faculty in determining whether an activity involves research requiring IRB review. Systematic collection of information about the activities, characteristics and outcomes of programs to make judgments about the program (or processes, products, systems, organizations, personnel, or policies), improve effectiveness, and/or inform decisions about future program development. Evaluative studies are defined as: Systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. Research studies are defined by Federal Regulation as: Research studies involving human subjects require IRB review. Evaluative studies and activities do not. It is not always easy to distinguish between these two types of projects and projects frequently have elements of both. Therefore, the decision about whether IRB review is required should be made in concert with the IRB. Do program evaluations require IRB review? Approvals are generally granted for a year (but may be less) and applications may be renewed through a continuing review process. However, time lapses between the expiration date and renewal may not occur. Continuing reviews should be submitted well in advance of the expiration date. Should a protocol expire prior to undergoing a",

The application is available in IRBNet and should be read with the understanding that the IRB is charged with ensuring that human subjects are protected and informed. To this end, the application should clearly explain the purpose and procedures of the research and how the risks to the subjects have been considered and minimized. There must be adequate resources for informing subjects of what they will encounter and their rights as participants in the study. Subjects must be given the opportunity to make a conscious, well-informed decision about participating, and the confidence to withdraw if they desire. Preparing a thoughtful, thorough, organized protocol will take time. Investigators and research team members must complete training prior to the study commencing. The IRB must evaluate the protocol, comments relayed to researchers, and perhaps revisions made all prior to the start of the research. Please give yourself adequate time to prepare the protocol and for the IRB to consider it. Why does the IRB need a copy of my grant or contract? Federal regulations require that the IRB compare the grant application or proposal to the study protocol to ensure",
