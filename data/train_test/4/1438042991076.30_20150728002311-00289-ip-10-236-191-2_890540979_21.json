            "Despite being in a downtown area, UNL has amazing security and the police number is offered straight off the bat, when joining the college.",
            "Many people choose going Greek. The Greeks at Nebraska may know how to party but they do many charity events and they are very open to all people wanting to join.",
            "UNL has many clubs and activities to join, and all the clubs are close-knit, making it easier to meet people.",
            "Honors kids have an awesome dorm and great resources like study rooms and helpful, easy-to-contact advisers. Students who are excited about Greek opportunities would enjoy Nebraska as well since there are so many. And those with strong religious ties, Nebraska has many strong religious groups that you can join.",
            "The football games are important to the entire campus. You have to go to at least one and participate in the crazy Big Red traditions.",
            "For the cost of a lower level college, you get one that is in the Big Ten. Other Big Ten schools don't offer this quality for this price. Take advantage of this.",
            "At UNL, you are living right next to downtown Lincoln. The city itself may not be vast, however, it's safe and fun, providing for different interests such as parties, museums, restaurants, movies, and more. On campus, there are always different things going on and emails are sent out almost once a week to inform you on fun things to do.",
            "The dining halls offer diverse choices in food and the food choices are different every day. Certain dining halls are better than others, but fresh, local food is the norm at Lincoln, Nebraska.",
            "Every student can feel comfortable at UNL because there are so many different types of places to live. Each dorm is unique and the resident assistants and directors work hard to encourage interaction in the dorms.",
            "Overall you get back whatever you put in to a class. However, at Nebraska, if you put in effort to truly learn, the professors and the students will help you succeed and actually enjoy it. No passion seems off limits at UNL.",
            "Be passionate about your education here because professors will help you, if and only if you try to improve and enjoy your learning experience. Don't be afraid of making friends off the bat either, the people at Nebraska are friendly and welcoming.",
            "The University is small but welcoming, with the ability to have fun in the downtown area. It is full of great professors who are passionate about what they are doing, but they also challenge you to learn. The community of students is diverse but comes together to form Big Red."

I suggest applying before april or as soon as it opens up to assure that you will receive ample support! Good luck!, 154568=UNL gives GREAT scholarships. This is ultimately why I chose to go to UNL for my freshman year. As an out of state student, the price UNL offered me was within $1000 of what an in state school offered me. They also don't have many hidden fees. You get unlimited meals (which are EXCELLENT! The #1 thing I miss about UNL), free internet (don't take this for granted!), along with many other free services., 258518=The campus police are very active on campus and I never felt unsafe. They are very diligent with their work and have great standards to maintaining the safety and justice of the college. My friend lost his glasses sometime in March and they are still updating him well into the summer, so they are very persistant., 596816=The food here is pretty good and is probably what you would typically expect in a dining hall. The staff is usually friendly and the dining halls themselves are really clean. The variety of food is usually not really great, and healthy options are limited. The only really disappointing part of having a meal plan is that on the weekends, you only get two meals (Brunch and Dinner) and brunch doesn't start until 10:30. Also, the variety of food on the weekends is substantially less than what is available on the weekdays., 80068=I am a past student, then I transferred to Southeast Community College, and am returning to UNL in the Fall of 2011. The University of Nebraska Lincoln has really good professors for the most part, but it's best to ask around about which professors to take. I had one that I feel like I didn't learn anything from, but the rest have been really knowledgeable and passionate about their fields which always helps retain interest and increase learning.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot There are a wide variety of classes offered. I'm an English major, and UNL has a great English program. It's home to the Prairie Schooner, which is a highly regarded literary magazine. There are a lot of great poets here and even in my freshman year I learned a lot. There are also a lot of opportunities for customizing your education. You can work with your professors to make sure you're getting what you need out of your classes.
