    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The present invention can be modified as to sidewall and divider web wall materials and characteristics. However, any modifications which functionally produce the same tubular container are within the present invention. The sidewalls and the inner divider web wall can be comprised of a single layer or multilayer laminate structure. The useful materials include polypropylene, polyethylene (high to low density), polybutadiene, ethylene vinyl alcohol, ethylene vinylacetate, vinylidene chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyacrylonitile and laminate structures that use layers of these materials. In many instances the sidewall will be a laminate structure while the web wall will be a monolayer. It is preferred that the divider web wall be as thin as possible which makes a monolayer, and a thin multilayer, useful. However, the divider web wall can be of a multilayer structure depending on the barrier and other properties desired for this wall. FIG. 3 shows the divider wall in more detail in the full construction of the tube. It is seen that the divider wall extends down through the tube to the crimp seal 14. Further, the exit divider wall is shown offset from the crimp seal by about 90\ufffd C. There is a spiraling of the divider wall 18(a) from the crimp seal up to and through the exit divider wall 18. This spiral nature to the divider wall, the general \"S\" shape of the divider wall, and the relatively thin structure of",
