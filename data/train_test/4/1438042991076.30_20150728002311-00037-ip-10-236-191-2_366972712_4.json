If Mrs. Smith looks at the difference between 2007 and 2010, she can see that there is an improvement in the final grades for her students. Although there are many factors that can affect these grades, she can say that the change in her instruction is making some difference in the results for her students. Other factors might have contributed to the huge decline in grades for the academic math students in 2009. You can make this conclusion for Mrs. Smith, as there was a marked improvement in her advanced math course. In 2009, it seemed her instruction methods were working well with the advanced students, but other factors were affecting the academic students.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "The guidance counselor at USA High School wanted to know what future plans the graduating class had. She took a survey to determine the intended plans for both boys and girls in the school\u2019s graduating class. The following data was recorded: What percentage of the college graduates primarily use the internet to follow the news? When college graduates and non-college graduates are combined, which form of the media is primarily used the least to follow the news? How many more of the non-college graduates primarily use television to follow the news than use the newspaper? 20 college graduates and 20 non-college graduates were asked their primary way of following the news, and the results are shown in the double bar graph below. Use the double bar graph to answer the following questions: On what day was there the biggest difference between cars sold by the 2 dealerships? How many more cars did Dealership B sell on Monday than Dealership A? On what day did Dealership A and Dealership B combine to sell the most cars? The double bar graph",
