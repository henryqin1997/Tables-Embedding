You can specify the index-ID with the chmod command to identify which part of the ACL you want to modify. For example, you can identify index ID 3 as A3 to the chmod command, similar to the following: 2:group@:write_data/append_data/execute:deny When an ACL entry is displayed, it looks similar to the following: 0:user:gozer:list_directory/read_data/execute:allow The following example includes an ACL-entry-ID because a specific user (ACL-entry-type) is included in the ACL. group@:write_data/append_data/execute:deny In the following example, the ACL-entry-ID value is not relevant. Identifies whether the access permissions are granted or denied. allow deny | Identifies an optional list of ACL inheritance flags. For a description of the ACL inheritance flags, see Table\u00a08-3. inheritance-flags Identifies the access permissions that are granted or denied.
