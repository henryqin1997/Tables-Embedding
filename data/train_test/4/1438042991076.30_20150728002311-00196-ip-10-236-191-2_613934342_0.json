All but two of the speakers stated strong cases against expanded alcohol sales but it fell on deaf ears. I would like to thank Magistrate Asa Phillips for standing and voting with the concerned voters of Owen County against Sunday sales. Also a hearty thanks to (Owen County Judge-Executive) Carolyn Keith who allowed so many people to voice their fears and she also cast a \u2018no\u2019 vote for the record., 30213=I was unable to attend the county meeting on July 22 as I was in Washington, D.C. to meet with our representatives on behalf of Christians United For Israel. We need to pray for the peace in the Middle East. Especially pray for the peace of Jerusalem. It is the word. I would have asked to speak at the meeting, but I will write my words from I Peter 5:8, \u201cBe sober, be vigilant; because the Devil, as a roaring lion, walk about, seeking whom he may devour.\u201d I pray he may not. I hope to see everyone out on Aug. 12.}",
