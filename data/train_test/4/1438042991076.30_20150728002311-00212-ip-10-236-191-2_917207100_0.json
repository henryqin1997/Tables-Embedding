If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer Founded by the unconventional Martin Margiela, Maison Margiela is a pioneering label in deconstructionist design. Working in completely white studios, where even the light fixtures were draped in white fabric, Margiela revolted against conventional fashion with over-long sleeves and exposed seams and linings and famously redesigned unusual objects like wigs and silk scarves into couture garments. Though currently led by a new design team, Maison Margiela stays true to its avant-garde roots.
