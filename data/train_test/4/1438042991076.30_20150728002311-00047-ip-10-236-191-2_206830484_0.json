Here's the menu; this is not beer and pizza like you're used to..., 9089=The infamous Ides are Tuesday this year and there's an obvious celebratory dish for the day: Caesar Salad. Because the only reason anyone knows anything about the Ides of March is because Julius Caesar was warned to beware of it. Hail yours, properly prepared in the old way, tableside for two, at Cucina Toscana. This is especially appropriate because Valter Nassi is, undoubtedly, Salt Lake City's Emperor of Italian Food. Ave atque vale., 11406=Thursday, of course, is the 17th, St. Paddy's own day, and for that one day the Blue Boar in Midway goes green, serving Irish-inspired dishes including potato and watercress soup, traditional style soda bread and a traditional Irish salad. (Whatever that is. Maybe potato?) Choose corned beef and cabbage, Guinness braised short rib, roasted salmon with Irish whiskey cream and mussel in garlic and stout. For dessert, Chef Eric May will offer Irish cream chocolate cheesecake and chocolate molten cake with caramel cinnamon sauce and Irish cream. The Blue Boar also offers an extensive list of Irish whiskeys and beers. Call 888-650-1400 visit theblueboarinn.com.}",
