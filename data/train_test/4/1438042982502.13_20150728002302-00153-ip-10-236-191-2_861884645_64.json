            "More young police officers are being recruited.",
            "This University is great for students that desire to learn and need a bit of a challenge.",
            "Seems expensive, but I feel that you learn much more and get a better quality education in the small campus environment.",
            "New Orleans is definitely a destination city, so if you're looking to do something for fun, there are plenty of opportunities to find it. The art and history museums are my favorites and you can't forget about Lakeside Mall. There is quite a nightlife downtown on the weekends. No matter what you may choose to do, always make sure you are aware of your surrounding. Stay safe.",
            "New Orleans is really a city full of ethnic diversity with its French, Caribbean, African flair. There is an abundance of soul food, and creole favorites that span from neighborhood corner stores, in to places for fine dining. Manchu's and Cheesecake Bistro tend to be among my favorites. For those that like to stick with the traditional cuisine, no fear for there are plenty of chain restaurants there as well. Maybe takes a chance and try one of the city's most acclaimed Po-boy sandwiches. You won't be disappointed. There is something here for everyone whether you're vegan, kosher, ethnic or looking for something unique.",
            "The dorms get progressively better as you go along your time as a student. First year, if you are living on campus, you will be required to live in a same sex dorm. Second year girls are required to do the same. After that you can live coed or rent houses around the campus if you would like.",
            "Xavier definitely does have a rigorous chemistry program, but that's only because they want to make sure that we are prepared by the time that we graduate. The University stay's true to its mission statement to prepare its students to assume roles of leadership and service in hopes of promoting of a more just and humane society and I find that rather admirable.",
            "Make sure you are ready to work hard and always take advantage of your campus resources. The tutoring centers are very helpful. even if you don't feel that you need it, it is better to be over prepared than lacking.",
            "Xavier University is great school for students looking for a challenging, but fun environment to learn. The small class room professor to student ration work great for those that may have a hard time adjusting to college from high school. Due to the friendliness of professors and locals, there is a homey type of feel to the campus which is nice since you can't get that everywhere."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{263468=Unfortunately the freshman dorms are not awesome. There is a curfew (12:00 Sunday-Thursday and 2:00 Friday & Saturday) and the bathrooms are hall bathrooms. On the upside, the RA's schedule cute get togethers for the floors to mingle., 326909=Considering I was on a scholarship, I thought that the quality of education and resources offered was fair. This is a private institution, so it's pretty expensive: tuition is around $18000 a year + $4000-$5000 room & board + $2000-$3000 fees + around $200-$300 for books. There are also other random things you have to pay for when attending. I'm a chemistry major and was recommended/required to buy a $2 laminated periodic table that could be used on tests, a $35 lab coat, and $5 lab goggles., 114311=When you walk into the communal bathroom and dookie is smeared all over the floor, it really puts into perspective where you are and with whom you live. Freshman dorms especially are horrible. They are separated by gender, come with a very strict 12:30 AM curfew on weekdays and 2:00 AM curfew on weekends, and are just old. The air condition unit in my room would leak, and it wasn't until I and my roommate decided not to clean the water up and let it leak into the hallway, that it was fixed. (They probably didn't want that lawsuit for a slip and fall). I heard of multiple room units that didn't work, which is even more of a problem when you're in a place where temperatures reach 90+ degrees with 100% humidity. There is a janitorial service that cleans the restrooms once a day everyday and they do a decent job, but when you're in a place with a bunch of dudes that still have a high-school mentality, it kinda doesn't look like it was cleaned at all., 141322=The school has a very unique menu when compared to out-of-state schools. There are many cajun dishes that they love to serve, like red-beans and rice, gumbo, dirty rice, and others. Even if you're not from Louisiana, you'll easily get accustomed to the food here. I will write this though: have emergency food items in your dorm!! The cafeteria workers are human, and sometimes the food that they serve isn't as great as what you're used to at home. If you do find that the cafeteria food is bad on a certain day, there are many restaurants close to the campus. Specific ones include McDonalds, KFC, a lot of Chinese restaurants, Popeye's, and other small restaurants. WARNING!!!: the Freshman 15 does exist on this campus!!! Make sure that you have frequent workout regimens, and think smart about what you eat., 384281=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 380982=Other than that, I love the Chemistry courses the most. Xavier makes Chemistry fun and interesting. Warning: Biology not so much. I think they were weeding the CHEM PrePharmacy students in the spring semester in 2015. The first test in biology was an average that is on a very low 60% range. I was one of the lucky few who made a B on their first test., 250060=Xavier is located 10 mins from the world famous Bourbon Street if you ever need a get away from the study life. If the night life isn't your scene there are tons of restaurants to go get lost in the local cajun cuisine. Being one of the first major ports in the New World, New Orleans is rich with French flavor as well as many interesting historic sites.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Always be ready to work when you come to class Always use planner Utilize the fact the professors are constantly there to help to you Organization is the key to a smooth college life and transition Bang for the buck Xavier is definitely worth the money because you can go to no other school and receive a better education. This is true because you are given the chance to succeed. The school works with you no matter any issue you may. Money is never a problem because if you do the work the school will work with you to keep you in school and try to do as much as they can to help you stay in school. Am enjoying being here Xavier is a very small school so the campus is very intimate. You get the chance to know everyone. Our campus is very active there is usually an event going on no matter what day. The Fraternities and Sororities are very active on the campus and give you multiple opportunities to do volunteer work and just to be involved with the community. We are not the biggest party school but campus life is great. Safety is also a top priority on the campus Am learning a lot",
