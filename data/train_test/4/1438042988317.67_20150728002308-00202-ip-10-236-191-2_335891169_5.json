    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{27388=The following table presents the federal tax cost on the fund's historical distributions (see second tab, table 6.) under two scenarios: the current favorable tax rate regime (2010-2012) and under a higher tax regime (with dividends taxed at marginal rates and long term capital gains taxed at a maximum 20%). Keep in mind that distributions can also be subject to state and local taxation, with marginal rates ranging from 0% to 10.3% (an average 5% state tax rate will add an approximate 0.09% to the annual tax cost of holding the fund.) The average is based on the results from 2004-2010, the period comprising the qualified dividend tax regime. The 2004- 2010 average yield (1.83%) is very close to the life of fund average yield (1.74%). The fund distributed capital gains during the 1992-2000 period, averaging 0.16% per annum short term gains, and 0.43% per annum long term gains., 8145=The following table provides a view of the fund's historical distributions expressed in terms of yields. We can see that the fund distributed modest levels of capital gains during its first decade of existence, a period which coincided with a long bull market. The fund has not distributed a gain since 2001, a period marked by two bear markets, and which saw the introduction of an ETF share class in the fund. The fund has distributed 100% qualified dividends, which under the current tax regime, are taxed at lower capital gains tax rates., 18803=Mutual fund distributions will be taxed according to the tax laws governing the investment over the holding period of the investment, which are subject to change. The actual tax imposed will depend upon each individual's tax rate and the timing of purchases and sales. The federal tax rates applicable to mutual fund distributions and investor sales of securities for the period 2008 - 2012 are outlined below. Keep in mind that investment income may also be state and local taxation., 25250=The annual fund accounting figures show that the Vanguard Total Market Index fund turnover ratio usually stays in single digits. The rise in turnover during fiscal year 2005 was due to a shift in the fund's tracking index to the MSCI Broad Market Index. The MSCI Broad Market Index, being a total market index, can be expected to exhibit low, single digit turnover in future years. This low turnover can be attributed to the fact that stock migration out of a total market index can come in only two dimensions:, 26837=A look at realized net gains/losses shows that the fund, with the 2001 introduction of the ETF share class, [11] has realized net losses in eight of the ten years of the 2000-2010 decade (see the second tab, tax attributes in Table 3 above). The period includes the 2000-2001 and 2008-2009 bear markets. These losses produced loss carryforwards. Low fund and shareholder turnover has retained most of these carryforward losses as offsets to potential future gains.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "\u2191 This table indicates the additional cost for the capital-gains tax when you sell, assuming that you pay taxes on the distribution and reinvest the after-tax portion of the distribution; since it is a one-time cost, the effect is annualized. For example, if you hold an investment for 30 years and lose 10% to taxes when you sell, that is equivalent to losing 0.35% every year. Thus, if you sell the fund, your cost will be the sum of the Table 6 and Table 8 costs. However, you would not pay the Table 8 cost on any stock which you either leave to your heirs or donate to charity, and thus may not pay that cost on your full investment. In particular, you might estimate your total tax cost by using the low-return line in Table 8; if stock returns are high, you will have a large taxable account and will reduce the tax cost by taking longer to deplete it or by not spending it all during your lifetime. Taxes are computed at a tax rate of 15% on long-term gains (except in the \"rate rises to 20% column\", which applies if that tax reduction is allowed to expire), and on qualified dividends (except in the \"no QDI\" column, which applies if the tax reduction on qualified dividends expires and the rate is 35%). Although not tabulated, keep in mind that investors in the lower tax brackets (15% or lower) pay lower federal tax",
