    "textAfterTable": "Description Law Any object immersed in a fluid, is supported up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the electric potential difference across the conductor and inversely proportional to the conductor's resistance. Genotype and allele frequencies, within a population, remain constant from generation to generation unless specific disturbing influences are introduced. In a fluid without viscosity, an increase in the flow of the fluid is accompanied by a decrease in the pressure of the fluid. Each planet orbits the sun in an elliptical orbit, with the sun located at one focus of that ellipse. The number of transistors that can fit on a microchip, doubles approximately every two years. A spring's displacement, provided this does not stretch beyond the elastic limit, is directly proportional to the restoring force of the spring. The electric flux through any closed surface is directly proportional to the amount of electric charge enclosed in the surface.",
