Unlike STAT3, where significant medicinal effort has been expended to identify potent direct inhibitors, Stat5 has been poorly investigated as a molecular therapeutic target. Thus, in an effort to identify direct inhibitors of STAT5 protein, we conducted an in vitro screen of a focused library of SH2 domain binding salicylic acid-containing inhibitors (#150) against STAT5, as well as against STAT3 and STAT1 proteins for SH2 domain selectivity. We herein report the identification of",
