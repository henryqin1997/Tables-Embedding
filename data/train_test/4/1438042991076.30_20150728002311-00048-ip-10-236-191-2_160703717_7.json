Kemp, batting .196 in June, is fourth in the National League with 86 strikeouts, but he's also third in the league in runs scored with 52. \"He's played pretty much every day, he's still young and he's still developing,\" manager Joe Torre said. \"He's unpredictable, let's put it that way. Any time he could jump on and hit a home run because of his tools. There are no rules on how consistent young players are going to be until they get enough time in.\", 45127=Billingsley has been on the DL with a groin strain, but has checked out through each of his tests over the last week and will be making his first start since June 11.
