            "I always feel safe at EKU. Lighting around campus is nice and EKU officers can usually be spotted on a regular walk across campus to class. I have never felt threatened or unsafe at EKU.",
            "I personally do not participate in Greek Life at EKU, but I know many people who are Greek and enjoy it. There are a lot of options between sororities and fraternities and they participate heavily in EKU activities, volunteering in the community, etc.",
            "As I stated above, clubs and activities are just unlimited at EKU. There is almost anything for any type of interest and most of them are free of cost, they just require your time. There's never a reason to be sitting at home.",
            "It is great for students who like to be able to have their professors on hand and ask lots of questions. EKU professors encourage questions, unlike other big universities.",
            "The Ravine- (Location)- It's a great relaxing place to hang out on campus. It's an outdoor amphitheater and it's absolutely beautiful. There is always all sorts of activities and people hanging out in the Ravine. There are several hundred year old trees and beautiful landscaping for laying in the grass and studying in between classes.",
            "EKU is well worth the money. I have not been disappointed in the least with my classes or my professors. I probably find at least one reason a week why I like EKU more as I learn things around campus. I just love it and am really going to be sad to graduate!",
            "There are unlimited amounts of activities for fun at EKU. EKU has enormous amounts of intramural teams and club teams, as well as a greek life, if you choose to go greek. They also have wonderful religious groups and political groups and adventure groups. There is a group with activities for just about any type of interest you could possibly imagine.",
            "Food at EKU is probably better than UK. Healthy choices are always an option, which is a big thing for me, and everything is always fresh and delicious. They also have decent fast-food options in Powell, if you like a greasy meal.",
            "Dorms are decent, but they are dorms. Parking on campus can be hard to find.",
            "Academically, EKU classes can be challenging, but if enough time is given to study for each class, it is never impossible to make an A. I have definitely been challenged and my ability to think critically has definitely been stimulated at EKU.",
            "Be diligent and conscientious in your classwork and your homework/study time and come to your professors immediately when you have questions. If you bring your questions to your professors- they will get answered. If you do these things, you should be fine as long as your study methods are rigorous.",
            "Eastern Kentucky University is very centered around students. Every student is treated with the utmost respect and all questions asked are answered. It is easy to get information from faculty about a class or about administration issues at EKU which is one of the greatest difficulties I have had in college and students always feel welcome rather than bothersome."

I have completed a lot of my classes and have gotten extra certifications that I wouldn't have been able to at other schools and I feel that I am actually prepared for my career., 339489=I started here at EKU in Fall of 2013. I love the campus size, classroom sizes, teachers, and most importantly the students here as well. There will always be something to do on and off campus. You're not far from Lexington and Louisville, either. Everyone on campus is here to make sure you become successful. I plan on graduating from here. #ColonelPride, 108227=If you are looking to major in Education then EKU is the school for you. The major courses there are specifically designed to make you feel confident in all content areas. I am set to graduate in December of this year and I feel very satisfied with the education I have recieved.}",
