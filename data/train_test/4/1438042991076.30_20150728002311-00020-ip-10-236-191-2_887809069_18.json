            "Greek Life- Miami is known for it's Greek Life, both fraternities and sororities. The Greek system has students who are very involved with different things on campus. About 30% of Miami is Greek, so if you decide not to rush, you won't feel left out, but if you decide to rush, it is easy to get involved. Christians- There are many different churches and organizations for Christians, which is nice because you don't have to go far to stay involved with religion. People who want a good balance of academic and social lives- Miami really does have a great balance between the two. It is relatively easy to find parties and other fun events on campus (movies, concerts, games), but people still care about academics and doing well in school.",
            "First of all, come on a visit. Talk to students who are here (I promise they are very friendly!). Think about what your major might be because Miami has especially good programs in business, sciences, and engineering (all of their programs are good, but some are known for being awesome). Then if you decide to come here, here are some tips. It's called uptown not downtown (the off campus street with restaurants, bars, and shops). Don't lose your ID (it's used for meals, to swipe in your dorm, and for athletic events). Join at least one club or sports team (clubs are very easy to get involved with and many aren't that much of a time commitment). See professors during their office hours (they enjoy meeting students and they can really help you study for tests).",
            "Since Miami is considered a public Ivy, I would consider the price to be pretty good for a school like Miami. Miami is more expensive than other public schools in Ohio, but it is also considered one of the best public institutions in Ohio. Also, if you live in Ohio, it doesn't seem too hard to get Ohio resident scholarships or federal loans if you need them. Also, the school costs include tickets to athletic events and fees to ride the Miami metro. It comes in handy having those things included in the cost. The bookstore is somewhat pricey, but there are other bookstores to get textbooks and Miami gear.",
            "I think that Miami is a wonderful place for college! First of all, it is a beautiful campus. The trees and brick buildings make the place really wonderful while walking from class to class. Also, it has the college town atmosphere so everything around the campus is geared towards college students and the college students, which is nice. People here are really friendly and I like the atmosphere. Miami does not have a cut-throat academic atmosphere and everybody is willing to help others with their schoolwork and work in groups to study and do homework. Additionally, the professors are approachable and love teaching and talking to students.",
            "I am learning very much here at Miami not only with school work, but also regarding my personality and interests. The classes are challenging and interesting and the professors really care about the students succeeding, not only with good grades, but actually understanding the material. This will be very helpful when taking graduate school tests and applying to graduate schools, which many people do after attending Miami. Also, I've learned that it is okay to come to college undecided and that professors and administrators totally accept and even encourage changing majors."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{399283=Green Beer Day during the first week of March., 47589=Being at Miami, I have learned more than I expected. One reason being that every student is required to take Miami Plan courses, which contribute to Miami's liberal style of education. Not only have I learned more in college than I did high school, but the Miami Plan allows me to take a variety of different classes and learn things that I would not normally learn if I were to take classes that only pertained to my major/minor. For example, I took a southeast Asian art class fall semester 2010 and ended up learning about the different styles of art and along with the religions that go with them: Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. The second reason for my increased knowledge is quality of teaching that Miami provides. U.S. News rated Miami #2 in undergraduate teaching, meaning that the professors compare to those of some of the most prestigious schools in the country. In my experiences, the professors are a fantastic resource because they really focus on making sure that the students understand the information provided to them. Thus, I have been able to learn more in my classes and I feel vastly more educated than I did a year ago as a result of my professors being a great resource. What I love about Miami is how education can roll outside of the classroom. Miami offers undergraduate research, which is a very rare opportunity in undergraduate education. There are also seminars and guest speakers that visit Miami all the time. This past year, the Dalai Lama visited and spoke to students and other guests, which was extremely educational because I was able to learn things from a religious leader's perspective., 768648=On campus are various seals that you can NEVER step on or fail your exams, there is a sundial in the center of campus that you're supposed to rub before your exams to ensure you ace them, but the best (and maybe cutest) of all is the famous arch. On valentines day especially, it is said that if you kiss someone under the Upham Hall archway then you two will be happily in love forever. Needless to say, there is always a line there on February 14th. Then there is a somewhat shocking reality on campus, the sport of choice here is not football, basketball or the usual high school stars--it's hockey. Nationally ranked nearly every year, Miami Hockey is a very, very big deal. Every student waits in line for days before each home game to get tickets and cheer on the Redhawks., 445101=Being that it's an old school, Miami has many traditions. 1809, remember that. That's the year Miami was founded. Commit it to memory. DO NOT STEP ON THE SEAL. It doesn't matter if you fail your next exam or not. It's a matter of respect. So just don't. If you've found love at this school (and you might since our marriage rate is 33%) make sure to give your sweetheart a kiss under the Upham Arch at midnight and you'll be sure to tie the knot. Oh, and if your a male student living in Peabody Hall, watch out for Helen Peabody, or rather her ghost, she's not a fan of guys., 494559=If you want to know where you will be living prior to three weeks before move-in, I would suggest finding a roommate and not going random because they won't give out random roommates until the end of July., 819004=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 677076=Overall, the food is good, but by the end of second semester you never want to eat it again. Try the salads at Dividends in the Farmer School of Business-- they are my favorite! Also, Bell Tower and 1809 are good places to eat on campus with the meal plan! I try to avoid the all you can eat dining halls as much as possible., 504045=Our school was established in 1809, so there are many traditions on this campus. Take a tour, or look on the website to look at all the cool history we have.}",

There is a reason Miami is labeled J. Crew U. Almost all are upper-middle class and affluent, and a high percentage of the student population is caucasian. However, students are typically well-rounded, generally show support for Miami athletics, friendly and open-minded. I think anyone could fit in here. Tips for prospective students 1. Bringing a bike might be a good idea as it makes going uptown or even traveling to class more manageable. 2. Get involved early on--there are numerous organizations and clubs and it is a great way to meet people. 3. Explore the beautiful and scenic Ohio landscape surrounding the campus. 4. Don't expect a lot from the town--the university is the town. Bang for the buck As an out-of-state student,",
