            "The UFPD (police deparment) does an amazing job of keeping this campus safe. We get text messages and emails if there's anything fishy going on. There is also a free van service provided during the evenings if you don't want to walk alone.",
            "Greek life is huge on this campus. It's great, creates wonderful networking opportunities and amazing college memories.",
            "There are more than 800 student organizations on campus. If you seriously can't find one that suits your needs, you can actually start one yourself!",
            "This school is great for all types of students! However, if you're someone who enjoys living a life with high standards in your academia and a huge tendency to surround yourself with a lot of people - you'll love this school. It blends both worlds together.",
            "At the Florida football games, we always stand up, link up and sing We are the Boys of Old Florida. It really ignites that Gator spirit in you!",
            "You can get involved on one of the hundreds of organizations on campus and travel all over Gainesville, Florida, USA or even the world with them! You can also go downtown and check out the amazing restaurants and nightclubs! There is also a huge lake nearby where you can get on a canoeing! We have lots of museums with art and natural history and butterflies. We also have a bat house. Gainesville has a lot land and nature for you to admire. You can go a few miles down and go stargazing. Besides that, if you want to check out some of the larger cities nearby, you can drive to Jacksonville, St. Augustine, Orlando, Tampa or Tallahassee because they are all an hour to two hours away!",
            "There are some great options on campus. The dining areas are usually buffet style and there is a variety of food. It goes from American, Italian, Hispanic, Vegetarian and more! There are also restaurants right across the streets so you can walk to them if you don't want to eat on campus.",
            "The dorms are okay. If you want something cheap, you'll be sharing a lot of things! From your room to the bathroom. If you want something more personal, you'll have to pay for it. Though the physical dorms are not like hotels, they are livable. What makes dorm life amazing are the connections and new friends you get when you live in the dorms.",
            "The academic rigor of this school depends on the major. All in all, it is pretty rigorous but not rigorous to the point where you can't have a social life. Some of the hardest majors are in Engineering, Hard Sciences (Chemistry/Biology etc), and Accounting. Some of the easiest majors are Religion and Family, Youth and Community Sciences. Either way, the degree you obtain from the University of Florida is worth more than just money. It's extremely valuable no matter what major you were.",
            "It may be a little overwhelming at first because it is such a large school in a not-so-large town. However, once you make friends and begin living, you forget that you're away from home and you feel comfortable with this new home. There are so many people at this school - you will fit in somewhere, trust me!",
            "The University of Florida is a large school with so many great opportunities. There are plenty of courses and majors to choose from, opportunities to be involved and so many things to do within the campus itself. You become a proud Gator and you feel the support all around you once you step foot in the school."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors. Aim for an SAT and ACT score within their middle 50% (somewhere between a 1900 and 2100 for the SAT and 27-31 for the ACT) or better, and make sure to take many rigorous classes in high school. Also, show a passion for attending UF in your essays or elsewhere on your application., 582346=i guess we're safe... there's blue emergency lights scattered around the campus, a separate police dept for uf, and scan-card dorms, but rapings and suspects with guns have been reported to the students via email and text just in fall 2011. oh and some shots fired... but i haven't seen anything, which is good. just make smart choices. the person who got raped, got in the car for a ride to campus with an elderly male she didn't know., 613241=there is so much to do at the university of florida! in the reitz union there is a game room with a bowling alley which is always a lot of fun. uf also has gator nights every friday night, where students can go to the reitz union for free and partake in a bunch of activities including midnight breakfast. they also show movies in the reitz union on fridays. there are also about 1000 clubs at uf as well as multiple sororities and fraternities. lastly the gator nation is very big on football. there's nothing like being in the swamp cheering on the gators with your gator family., 911913=There are numerous blue light emergency posts everywhere on campus, and guarantee police assistance within 60 seconds of when the button was pushed. A free snap transportation service is provided, which gives students a ride anywhere on campus after 3:00 AM., 49808=UF is one of the top 50 universities in the US and a great education for a tuition of about $4000 a year and housing is about $2000 for each semester is an amazing deal. If you received Bright Futures you really only have to pay for housing (and of course books and food.) UF also has many research opportunities with top-rated professors available for undergraduates., 48916=Apply as early as possible, way before the November 1st deadline. The earlier you apply, the earlier you can apply for housing (if you are planning on living on campus.) I find that living on campus is really convenient, where you can literally wake up ten minutes before your class and still make it. Off campus has it's perks but it costs about the same as on campus housing and you have to take the bus (which are often times always late.) I suggest living on campus for at least your first year. Also, UF seems to emphasize this quite a lot but GET INVOLVED! Try something new! Get new experiences!, 820345=There are over 1000 student organizations, if we don't have the one you are looking for it is extremely easy to create one yourself., 611633=the university of florida has about 1000 clubs with everything from a quidditch team to clubs for intramural sports., 939581=Dorms are not my thing. I stayed in them and sharing a bathroom with many girls is not what I enjoy. A plus for dorms is that you can meet a lot of people and you are right on campus so classes will be closer, as long as your 7:30 class isn't on the opposite side of campus, you will be able to enjoy every second of sleep., 502966=The campus is gorgeous (besides the weather in August and September, but that's horrible everywhere in Florida)! For being such a large university, it's really easy to get involved in organizations., 322695=The French Fries is a favorite sculpture near the Marston Science Library done by artist John Henry that was placed on campus in February 1989. Though the actual name of the piece is Alachua, named for the county which the city of Gainesville calls home, it still remains a notorious landmark often referred to when giving directions to campus visitors and Freshman. Another popular sculpture around campus, The Potato, is located near Turlington Hall and serves as a popular meeting point. Krishna Lunch, a full vegetarian meal, is served daily in the Plaza of the Americas for dirt cheap, and it is delicious!, 246201=Home to almost 1000 campus organizations, UF offers something for every student that attends. From greek life to skydiving to intramurals, almost anything you can think of will probably exist at the University., 172699=Like I previously mentioned, there are almost 1000 clubs and just about anything you can think of. There are tons of intramural sports and workout facilities all over campus!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The school spirit is so infectious it's crazy. You will love being around for any sporting event whether its gymnastics or football. There is always something to do whether its tubing at Lake Wauburg, floating down the river at Jennie Springs or partying at Midtown. Am learning a lot Most of the professors are always willing to help out and make you want to learn.
