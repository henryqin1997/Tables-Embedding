    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20359=It is known to authenticate documents by including in the document information in two forms; a \"clear\" form which is generally recognizable and an encrypted form which can only be produced with knowledge of a particular encryption key. Thus, U.S. Pat. No. 4,853,961; for: \"Reliable Document Authentication System\"; to: Pastor; issued Aug. 1, 1959, discloses a system wherein a document is authenticated by encryption using a public key encryption system, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,637,051; to: Clark, discloses a postage meter having an indicia which is authenticated by encryption. A particular application of such technology to identification cards is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5, 426,700; to: Berson; for: Method and Apparatus For Verification Of Classes of Documents; issued Jun. 20, 1995, and in commonly assigned, co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 07/979,018; to: Marcus; filed: Nov. 20, 1992; which are hereby incorporated by reference., 37294=Turning to FIG. 3, secure verification transaction record 90 is shown. Record 90 includes source identification 92, which is preferably machine number 80 or similar identification of the source of the record, and time 96, which is preferably provided by secure clock 84 so that the system operator or a third party cannot falsify the time at which the verification transaction took place. Record 90 also includes decrypted text 98 which includes at least personal information relating to person P whose identify is being verified. In a preferred embodiment of the subject invention record 90 also includes decrypted image 100 from decrypter 58 and new image 102 from scanner 72 and transaction information 104 from input 76. Record 90 is then electronically notarized by appending digital signature 108 in a conventional manner. Generally, electronic notarization includes appending secure time information to a message and then digitally signing the message to provide assurance that the message was recorded at that particular time. Such electronic notarization is known and is described in U.S. patent number in U.S. Pat. No. 5,022,080; to: Durst et al.; issued: Jun. 4, 1991, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Other methods (such as digitally signing a document to which information derived from previous documents in a stream of documents has been appended so that the position of the document in the stream of documents is established) for securely establishing the time of recording and content of a message are known and are included within the meaning of the term \"electronic notary\" as used herein.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The preferred embodiments described above have been given by way of example only, and other embodiments of the subject invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the detailed descriptions set forth above and the attached drawings. Particularly, it will be apparent that card C need not include any biometric characteristic but that a degree of security can be achieved using only encrypted text information on card C. Accordingly, limitations on the subject invention are to be found only in the claims set forth below. In another embodiment of the subject invention link 118, which may be any suitable communications link, connects data processor 110 to remote data processor 120 to download data for remote processing. In another preferred embodiment of the subject invention data processor 110 accesses database store 86, using conventional database access the techniques, to generate various reports of verification transactions. For example in a liquor store application data processor 110 might generate specialized customer mailings. Or reports 112 of access by particular persons or during particular time periods can be printed by printer 116 to provide an audit trail of verification activity. Turning to FIG. 3, secure verification transaction record 90 is shown. Record 90 includes source identification 92, which is preferably machine number 80 or similar identification of the source of the record, and time 96, which is preferably provided by secure clock 84 so that",
