            "There are some great sport teams, especially their soccer and volleyball teams. There are plenty of student activities through out the year, and they are clearly displayed through out the school. There is even a farmers market on campus through out the summer and into the fall semester.",
            "They have a great cafeteria with both healthy and other enjoyable foods. Most teachers allow you to bring your food and drink in the class as long as it can be sealed.",
            "You are able to live off campus, but there is housing available. You would need to check with the school for that information though.",
            "Of the classes that I've taken (ranging from Real Estate, to education and languages, and to Nursing) they have all be great in challenging me as a student but not being so difficult that an A was unattainable. Online courses seem to be a little easier if you stay focused. If you are good at scheduling your time then take as many online classes as you can so you can save gas money to pay for your other classes. The instructors are also very helpful in allowing you to use a textbook that isn't the exact edition that is required as long as it is close. So, they help you save money that way as well.",
            "Visit the Joliet Junior College website often. The website is easy to use to look up information on your intended major. You are able to look up all of your criteria for entrance to specific programs, as well as your graduation criteria. Definitely search for scholarships directly on their website as they have a list of over 80 scholarships that you can only apply to through them. There are also plenty of student activities to take part in either as a general student or as an organization's officer. If you want more scholarship opportunities become an officer and serve the student body.",
            "JJC is a great school to attend whether you are freshly out of high school or returning to school as a seasoned adult. There are plenty of sections to choose from during both traditional day classes, as well as evening classes. This may be the oldest public junior college in the United States, but they are very up to date in their technology services, and getting better."

I always saw security guards and campus police in squad cars patrolling., 285941=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 100786=Have never seen/heard about any fights. (From the 2011-2012 Student Handbook): Main Campus-2010: 7 Aggravated Assault/Battery; 80 Theft; 1 Motor Vehicle Theft; 3 Theft from Motor Vehicle; 3 Drug Abuse/Violations; 4 Arrest: Drug Law Violations ZERO: murders, sex offenses, arson, robbery, burglary, liquor law violations, hate crimes, weapons violations, arrests: illegal weapons, arrests: liquor law violations. JJC is a really friendly environment and everybody is very welcoming., 84849=If you live in district, full time can be anywhere from $1500-$2300, much better then $10000-$20000 at a university., 212023=It is an awesome school for money because the classes are relatively low price so to get your general requirements done it is wonderful. It is better than going to a big school and paying thousands of dollars for what JJC offers at maybe two thousand, and that is a high price at our school. Average is about $1500 dollars a semester., 96675=The food is good, but it can be a little expensive. They offer many choices of food. You can consider sub sandwiches, the grill station, healthy foods, grab-n-go items, salad bar and vending. You can also choose smoothies, hot chocolate, coffee and many other drinks. The cafeteria is clean and new. It's a great spot to hang out with friends and to have lunch. You can also dine outside in our picnic area. The cafeteria stay open from 7 am - 7 pm Monday - Thursday. On Fridays it stays open from 7am - 2:30 pm., 95993=There are many fun and exciting activities to get involved in. A wide range of activities to attend are talent shows, dances, theatre productions, sporting events, daytime activities on the bridge and many more. The last week in April for Spring Fling week is not to miss. There many activities going on during that week such as free food, free earth day t-shirt giveaways and fun activities.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Concetta from Bolingbrook, IL 06/29/2011 Reviewer is A past student here. 2 out of 2 people found this review useful. 2 of 67 Categories Comments Great for these types of students JJC offers something for almost everyone. It is particularly great for students who want to save a bit of money before heading off to four-year colleges. It is also great for adults who want to return back to school- there is a wide range of age groups at JJC, so adult learners would not feel out of place. JJC is also good for those that quit, or did not do well the last time they were in school. JJC's open admission policy makes this school a good choice for those looking to give school a second chance and turn their education around. Tips for prospective students I mentioned earlier that I did not learn much from some of my classes. I noticed that the classes from which I did not learn much were usually general education courses, that all students needed to take in order to fulfill their degree requirements. If you want to learn a lot",
