    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6069=In FIG. 81, an alternative embodiment of the combination bone screw and locking cap driver is shown. In this embodiment, a housing is not used. Instead, the driver shaft 1010 holds the cap 610 by friction and the handle 620 for the bone screw driver shaft 1010 is rotated. A ball spring assembly 622 holds the cap driver 1002 up until the bone screw has been screwed into the bone screw receiving hole. Driver 1010 has an elongated portion that once the bone screw has been installed, the ball spring 622 is depressed and the handle 624 associated with the cap driver is permitted to descend for rotation of the cap 610. A tubular housing can be employed to assist in aligning of the cap 610 in the bone screw receiving hole, as indicated above.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{165489=The hollow tubular housing 1002 rests on the top surface of the plate 600 and assists in the alignment of the shaft 1010 in relationship to the plate. Once the bone screw 170 is inserted, the cap driver 1004 is depressed until the threads 608 on the outside of the cap 610 engages the threads 603 of the bone screw receiving hole. The cap driver 1004 is then turned until the cap 610 is securely locked in place., 164053=The housing 1002 has a diameter that permits the locking cap 610 to be held within the inner end of the tubular housing 1002 by a friction fit or to the driver 1004. It is appreciated that other methods of holding the locking cap 610 within the end of the tubular housing 1000 may also be employed., 35542=This application is a divisional of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While specific innovative features may have been presented in reference to specific examples, they are just examples, and it should be understood that various combinations of these innovative features beyond those specifically shown are taught such that they may now be easily alternatively combined and are hereby anticipated and claimed. While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from this invention in its broader aspects and, therefore, the aim in the appended claims is to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of this invention. Similarly, the bone screws described in this application could be used in other parts of the body, again being modified so as to serve their intended purposed, depending on the size of the body part in which they are to be installed. While the plate instrumentation and method have been described in association with attaching a plate to the vertebrae of the spine, it should be appreciated that the plates can be adopted for specification to other parts of the body.
