Core Applications: Proposed set of packages: In order for us to make a release stable, we will need to monitor a set of applications that we believe are essential for people that want to install servers and desktops. All of the monitored applications should work fine, they should be able to compile with no bugs (If the user is compiling), and they will also have binaries available. (The binaries will be compiled with the default and recommended USE flags that Funtoo developers believe give a functional binary). Monitored Set of Applications bootloader (a default bootloader to provide a seamless, fast, and easy deployment experience) kernel (bliss-kernel can become the base of funtoo-kernel - or another kernel you think is good) stage3 (Minimal @system applications needed for a functional Funtoo base system) Core OS: An operating system is not just a stage3 tarball. The stage3 will not boot by itself, but rather needs the user to compile a kernel and install a bootloader. We should have a well tested default kernel that is tested for stability. This will speed up deployments and will provide predictability for kernel modules, and other applications that rely on a kernel. We will also need to provide a way for the system to boot this kernel. Thus a default bootloader should be provided. A Complete Core",
