Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 04/08/2015, 1497=Site description\u00a0Boon Tsagaan Lake is located in Baatsagaan soum. It receives water from the Baidrag River. The lake lies between Ikh Bogd Mountain in the south and the semi-desert steppe of the Gobi Lakes valley in the north. The lake is frozen from December until late April. There is a large area of saxaul forest along the southern shore of the lake, whereas bushy steppe is common in the north. In the southeast, there is a small lake surrounded by dense reeds and tall grasses. This location is called Myangan Shuvuunii Aral (Thousand Bird Island) by locals, because of the high number of birds breeding there. Nomadic animal grazing is the main land use. The site is considered to be suitable for the development of recreation and ecotourism. Pressures include grazing and trampling of lakeside reed beds, and poorly managed tourism. The water level of the lake has fallen as a result of drought. Boon Tsagaan Lake is located within the Valley of Lakes Ramsar Site.}",
