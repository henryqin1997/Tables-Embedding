The Crimson Tide defeated the Gators in the 2009 SEC Championship game (32-13) and during the 2010 regular season (31-6). \u00bb Florida achieved more turnovers vs. Kentucky (two interceptions, two fumbles) than they did in their first three games combined (two interceptions, one fumble). \u00bb The Gators\u2019 405 rushing yards last week was the sixth-best single-game performance in team history and the most the team has accounted for since 1989. \u00bb Muschamp, Saban and Alabama defensive coordinator Kirby Smart all worked together when Saban was head coach of LSU from 2001-04. Muschamp, Saban, Smart, Florida defensive coordinator Dan Quinn and UA tight ends/special teams coach Bobby Williams all worked under Saban with the Miami Dolphins during his short tenure (2005-06). Muschamp and Smart previously worked together at Valdosta State in 2000. \u00bb Saban is 4-4 in his career against UF. \u00bb The Gators\u2019 have half as many upperclassmen (17 seniors, 17 juniors) as they do underclassmen (36 sophomores, 35 freshmen) on the roster heading into the season. \u00bb Florida\u2019s offense has been impressive early this season with only six three-and-outs in 52 total offensive drives and only 11 punts in four games. \u00bb UF\u2019s offensive line has only allowed two sacks this year, making them the only SEC team to give up two or fewer sacks and one of seven teams nationally to average fewer than 0.5 sacks per game. \u00bb The Gators defense has forced the most turnovers in the SEC (311) since 2000. Florida also has the most interceptions in the nation (72) since 2008. \u00bb Florida is fifth nationally and third in the SEC in rushing defense, allowing just 56.5 yards per game. Alabama is third nationally and first in the SEC in the same category, allowing just 45.75 yards per game. \u00bb Conversely, the Gators and Crimson Tide are 1-2 in the SEC and 9-19 nationally in rushing offense with 259.0 and 230.75 yards per game, respectively. \u00bb Florida has had a 100-yard rusher in four consecutive games, the team\u2019s second-longest streak ever. One more game of 100+ rushing yards would tie the school record streak of five games first set in 1999. \u00bb Though the Gators are 18-for-19 (94.7 percent) in red zone conversions, the Gators have only scored touchdowns on 11 of those opportunities. \u00bb UF\u2019s defense has only allowed three first-quarter points through our games. \u00bb Florida is No. 4 nationally in scoring defense (9.0 points per game) and No. 5 in total defense (231.8 yards per game); however, Alabama is No. 2 nationally in both scoring defense (8.0 points per game) and total defense (184.0 yards per game). \u00bb The Gators have blocked a total of two punts in four games so far this season. \u00bb Florida has made 16-straight field goals dating back to the 2010 season, which is the third-longest streak in school history and the longest active streak in the nation. Two more made field goals will give the team its second-longest streak ever behind 28-straight makes from 1984-85. \u00bb The Crimson Tide have the second-most wins (40) since 2008, two more than the Gators (38) in that same period of time. \u00bb Alabama is returning 19 starters and 51 lettermen from its 2010 team. \u00bb The Crimson Tide\u2019s defense has surrendered just 47 first downs through four games while holding opponents to 30.43 percent (21-of-69) on third-down conversion attempts. \u00bb Florida and Alabama are split down the middle when it comes to the four major statistical categories. The Gators top the Crimson Tide in national averages of rushing yards 259.0-230.8 (9th-19th) and points scored 40.3-38.5 (15th-21st), while Alabama leads Florida in passing 225.3-202.8 (64th-79th) and points against 8.0-9.0 (2nd-4th). The teams have not played a common opponent this season., 61270=Need to catch up on the Gators before week four action? No problem. OGGOA has been here all week compiling a ton of information so you can do your homework on the team before its next exam Saturday evening at 8:00 p.m. on the road., 54109=FLORIDA \u00bb Redshirt senior quarterback John Brantley (#12)\u2026who has completed 64.0 percent of his passes (55-of-86) this season for 752 yards and four touchdowns but also threw two interceptions in the season opener against Florida Atlantic. Brantley turned the ball over three time in last year\u2019s loss against Alabama. \u00bb Redshirt senior running back Chris Rainey (#1)\u2026who has 625 yards of total offense this season with five touchdowns (including a punt block return). Rainey is averaging 6.5 yards per carry and 19.5 yards per reception and leads Florida in rushing and receiving this season. He became the first player in school history to have a rushing, receiving and return touchdown in the same game, achieved the school and SEC record for career punt blocks (five), and is the active leader in that category nationally. He has also rushed for 100 yards or more in three-straight games, the first UF player to do so since Fred Taylor last accomplished that feat 14 years ago. \u00bb Senior RB Jeff Demps (#28)\u2026who has averaged 9.4 yards per carry so far this year including a career-high 157 last week. After sitting out most of the team\u2019s second game, Demps now has 320 yards and four touchdowns on the ground this season. He also has the second-most receptions (nine) and fifth-most receiving yards (70) on the team this year. Demps eclipsed the 2,000-yard career rushing mark against Florida Atlantic. \u00bb Sophomore \u201cRB\u201d Trey Burton (#8)\u2026who is the team\u2019s most versatile player and proved that fact last year, scoring 12 touchdowns as a true freshman including 11 on the ground. Burton will line up all over the field for the Gators and could be found as a running back, fullback, H-back, tight end or wide receiver. He has already scored four touchdowns this season and has totaled 135 yards on 22 total touches. \u00bb Sophomore safety Matt Elam (#22)\u2026who is the most valuable member of Florida\u2019s secondary in only his second year. He is tied for second on the Gators in tackles (17) and has created turnovers in three-straight games (fumble, interception, interception). \u00bb Defensive tackles sophomore Dominique Easley (#2) and redshirt senior Jaye Howard (#6)\u2026who have solidified the interior of one of the Gators\u2019 strongest units. Howard is the team\u2019s most experienced player on defense (21 starts), while Easley may be its most dynamic off the snap, with a first-step raved about by teammates and coaches alike. Howard and Easley have combined for 5.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks (Howard) through the first four games. \u00bb Linebackers junior Jon Bostic (#52) and redshirt sophomore will linebacker Jelani Jenkins (#3)\u2026who are 1-2 on the team in tackles. Bostic (26) and Jenkins (17) have eached excelled in different areas for Florida. The former has three tackles for a loss and two sacks while the latter has one sack and four pass breakups on the year. \u00bb Sophomore Buck LB Ronald Powell (#7)\u2026who is tied for a team-high with 2.0 sacks and forced two interceptions via quarterback pressures against Tennessee. Powell has nine tackles on the season including two for losses. \u00bb Redshirt junior Sam LB Lerentee McCray (#34)\u2026who is starting for the first time in his career and is second on the team in tackles for loss with 3.5. He also has two pass breakups and eight total tackles. \u00bb Redshirt junior kicker Caleb Sturigs (#19)\u2026who returns for Florida after missing the final eight games of the 2010 season with an injured back. He is perfect this year on 11 field goal attempts (long: 51) and 18 extra points, leading the nation in both categories while leading the Gators with 51 points scored this season., 56397=After starting out the 2010 season with a 4-0 record, Florida was brought back down to earth when Alabama trounced them 31-6 in Tuscaloosa, AL. The Gators turned the ball over four times in the contest but otherwise held even with their opponent in yards gained and time of possession, snapping their 24-game regular season winning streak as the Crimson Tide rushed for 170 yards including 63 from Trent Richardson and 47 along with two touchdowns from Mark Ingram. Florida\u2019s John Brantley threw two interceptions in the game and fumbled the ball on Alabama\u2019s one-yard-line in the third quarter, negating any chance of a late UF comeback.}",
