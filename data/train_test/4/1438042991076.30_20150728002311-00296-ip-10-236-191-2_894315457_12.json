            "Our campus is in the middle of Fort Wayne and Fort Wayne can be thought of as an unsafe city/community but Indiana Tech is definitely very safe. People that don't attend the school don't walk through because walking through our campus doesn't create any shortcut possibility. There are blue emergency stations scattered around campus that call the police directly if anything bad did occur. Security walks the grounds every once in a while to make sure everything is going squarely. Entering campus housing isn't possible without a code or school ID.",
            "There is one sorority and one fraternity on campus. They're not as popular yet because they started not too many years ago. They hold social occasions and events every once in a while.",
            "There are so many clubs and activities that can be joined. There are clubs that match majors and minors, intramurals for sports you'd like to play other than the sport they play for Indiana Tech or because they don't play anything at all. It's fun and competitive. We have religious clubs. The Fort Wayne Tincaps play in the Spring season and students like to attend those games at the stadium just a few blocks away.",
            "Indiana Tech is great for the students that enjoy the small school feeling. It's great for the students that like that one on one contact with teachers/professors because the professors at Indiana Tech are willing to put in the time with their students that they know by name. Indiana Tech is great for those student that want to come out of college with possible job offers.",
            "These may not be unusual but we have nights of fine dining, red carpet dining, ice cream socials, egg hunts on Easter, Thanksgiving dinners, intramurals and so much more. What makes these traditions traditions is the people that attend.",
            "You're paying quite a bit but if you choose the small school setting you'll probably have a fine time at Indiana Tech. You can walk out of graduation with job offers from your professors, your professors get to know you and you DON'T have to share a bathroom with 30-40 people! Always a plus.",
            "Student life, sorority/fraternity, and other school groups and clubs have social options about once or twice a week. There's bowling, music, corn hole on the warm days and a large grass area in the middle of campus for other fun things like ultimate frisbee, softball, football, etc.",
            "The food isn't great. There is a variety but its' food from a catering company so it's different than some might be used to. If that is the case there is a salad, pizza, sandwich and pasta bar available a every meal.",
            "The dorms are bigger than what most colleges have and each dorm has their own bathroom and shower. A normal room has two bathrooms and one shower that would be shared between up to four people. Handicap rooms are larger than the normal rooms and has two full bathrooms (full bathroom including shower and toilet).",
            "Indiana Tech keeps track of attendance unlike most colleges. They care about their students' success and are very serious about finding them a career that will last them a lifetime.",
            "Be absolutely sure they want to spend the next four years at Indiana Tech and work very hard to do well and get their professors' attention because their professors will have connections that could help them get jobs in the future.",
            "Indiana Tech is a great school for student-athletes. If a student is completely sure they want to attend then it's the perfect school for them as long as their major is taught here. If they're not completely positive about attending they need to do research and decide carefully because credits don't transfer to many other colleges or universities."
