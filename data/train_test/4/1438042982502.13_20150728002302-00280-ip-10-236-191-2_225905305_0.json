    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{97582=As we can see from Table 2, we have some very good pairs to select from for RB2BC. Rather than use Roy Helu as our baseline, I decided to go with Isaac Redman for a few reasons. First, Helu is projected for below average RB2 fantasy points (145.9), so using him as a baseline would make for too many pairs and also give us a false sense of security of getting high RB2 production. I decided to go with the RB23 in Redman as he is more assured of his role and has a solid projected number (161). There are 111 pairs that are worth more than or equal to Isaac Redman (161), by his lonesome. It is interesting to note that three players (C.J. Spiller, Donald Brown and Willis McGahee) all project to be better by themselves than Redman, so that's a strong indication of the running backs to target. I have included Redman by himself as Pair #112 for comparison reasons. Let's also take a look at how often some of these guys show up on the table:, 131445=Table 5: Top 22 PPR RB2BC Options for 2012, 35595=This could get tricky here, but understand the overall goal. The point of RB2BC is to \"free up\" the first 4 rounds of your fantasy draft to pursue 3 receivers (especially in PPR leagues) after grabbing a stud RB in Round 1. This also gives you the flexibility of grabbing two receivers and a stud QB or TE, depending on your personal preference, or even to get RB2 and have the \"RB2BC\" be your RB3. Flexibility is the name of the game here. We all want value in our drafts, and having the ability to grab two RBs in Rounds 5 and 6 to act as our RB2BC gives us that ability., 131525=Lastly, we should focus on the best of the bargain bin - pairs of running backs that include no more than one RB with ADP of RB27, and possibly both backs with ADP of 30 or higher. The trick to RB2BC will be timing, as it is quite possible that 3-4 RBs on the list will be selected in Round 6 and the next 4-5 are unlikely to escape Round 7. That makes it tough to project when and where to draft these guys as they are likely to go in a RB3 run in Rounds 6 and 7. Throw out waiting too long on this RB2BC approach unless you have picks that are very close at the beginning or end of a Round (such as 6.11 and 7.02). Only then can you be certain to get a great duo if you want for Rounds 6 and 7, but I would not take the risk. That is why the recommendation for RB2BC for 2012 is C.J. Spiller and Willis McGahee. Take McGahee in Round 5 and Spiller in Round 6 to pair together for your RB2 committee. Even though you are drafting them both slightly ahead of the round their ADP suggests, the value you get of a top end RB2 is well worth that investment., 132602=Note that there is more than one way to use this strategy. For thoroughness, Table 5 should be your guide on Fantasy Draft Day if you attempt to use RB2BC. Take the top back available from the list in Round 6 and grab the next best back to pair with him and keep on going., 140020=Table 6: Suggested PPR RB2BC Schedule Plan, 37158=After I had all 24 running backs with distributed fantasy points on a weekly basis, I just compared all of the possible RB pairs to find the best duos for RB2BC. So here we are - time for some results.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "This seems pretty simple. If we want to have a duo that puts up RB2 numbers, that means we want RB24 or better production - else we would just draft RB24 (Roy Helu) or higher and forget the whole idea. So here is the list of players with which I started, based on their Average Draft Position (ADP): Criteria #1 - RB25 and Beyond So how to begin? Defenses and quarterbacks are relatively easy to \"committee\" together. There's usually only one QB and certainly only one team defense per NFL club, so the approach is pretty simple as far as picking out which players / teams to try and pair up. When it comes to running backs, the line is not quite so easy to draw, but I needed some basis to pick which players it made sense to try and combine for a decent committee. I decided that I would use the following criteria to decide which players to start with for evaluating: The Ground(game) Rules So with this in mind, I started to think about what else can be done with the committee approach. Tight end? Perhaps. Wide receiver? A possibility, but it might be better to look at third WR options than any other option. What about running back? Hmmm, that's really intriguing. What if you could grab two running backs later in the draft that could combine to perform on a RB2 - or even RB1 - level, based solely on their current projections and their",
    "textAfterTable": "Table 1: Running Backs RB25-RB48 Based on PPR ADP Great, now we have 24 guys to pair up and see how they do. That makes 276 potential committees, so there had better be a decent one (or several, we hope) out of all of those couplets. Now, before I go over the method of how to pair them up and the results, we need one more rule: Criteria #2 - No more than one RB from Round 5 and one from Round 6. This could get tricky here, but understand the overall goal. The point of RB2BC is to \"free up\" the first 4 rounds of your fantasy draft to pursue 3 receivers (especially in PPR leagues) after grabbing a stud RB in Round 1.

Flexibility is the name of the game here. We all want value in our drafts, and having the ability to grab two RBs in Rounds 5 and 6 to act as our RB2BC gives us that ability. Here is the good news - all the running backs on the list above have ADPs that are Round 6 or higher (later). It might even be possible to push this into a Round 6 and Round 7 RB pair. We will have to keep that goal in mind when we look at",
