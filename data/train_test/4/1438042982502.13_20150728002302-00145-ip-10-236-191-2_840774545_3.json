Ezequiel Cabeza De Baca is the only lieutenant governor to be elected as governor in a later term., 43159=As of February 2015[update], six former lieutenant governors were alive.

The Lieutenant Governor is the first person in the order of succession of New Mexico's executive branch, thus serving as Governor in the event of the death, resignation, removal, impeachment, absence from the state, or incapacity due to illness of the Governor of New Mexico. The lieutenant governor is elected on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term. This position was first filled by Ezequiel Cabeza De Baca on January 6, 1912, the year that New Mexico became a state.}",
