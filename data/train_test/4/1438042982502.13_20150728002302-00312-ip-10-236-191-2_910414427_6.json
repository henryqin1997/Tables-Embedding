Actuation stays precise and fluid slogging through mud, bouncing off rocks, rutting through roots wherever you find yourself, whatever conditions you're in. It's dependable. Tolerant. Easiest to set up. Easiest to adjust. And, not coincidentally, the top choice of the top MTB riders. Got it? Good.}",

They precisely paired the different-sized chainrings and redesigned where and how the chain engages with the rings. By aligning the chainring pick-up rivets to the chain pivot pin\u2014rather than the middle of the chain link\u2014you get double the shift opportunities. \u00a0 No more missed shifts, ever. X-Glide puts you in THE RIGHT GEAR, right now. Imagine being able to shift smoothly at any time, no matter what. We\u2019re talking full-power shifts. Up, down, whatever the trail demands. The benefit of the X-Glide drivetrain is simple, yet, when you think about it, incredibly impactful to the way you ride. Flawless shifting means you\u2019ll never again compromise your speed and power in unpredictable off-road terrain.

GXP\u00ae Read More Besides serious weight savings, this bottom bracket means narrow Q-factor, more ankle clearance, greater bearing durability and stronger crank construction.\u00a0",
