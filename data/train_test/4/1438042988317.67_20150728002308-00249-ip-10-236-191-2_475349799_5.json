    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{28054=In U.S. Pat. No. 5,805,066 issued to Murdy on Sep. 8, 1998, an instrument case and alarm is disclosed which provides a reliable alarm system that selectively uses audio, visual and radio alerts to attract attention to the case and instrument. The system advanced is meant for a very special application such as an expensive musical instrument in a carrying case and therefore not suitable, both from simplicity and cost standpoints, for the currently encountered general package delivery problem., 27535=In U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,456 issued to Staehle, Jr. on Aug. 26, 1997, a theft preventive purse comprising an opening with a keypad situated adjacent thereto with the keypad adapted to transmit an access signal for a predetermined amount of time upon entry of a proper code is disclosed. This invention is aimed specifically towards an improved anti-theft purse with the added feature of a panic button in addition to the conventional audible alarm when unauthorized access to the purse is encountered., 28960=In U.S. Pat. No. 5,963,131 issued to D'Angelo et al. on Oct. 5, 1999, there is described a motion sensitive theft detector system for portable articles featuring two way communication between the theft detector unit installed in or affixed to the portable article and the control unit carried by the owner. One of the special features of this invention is the adaptive alarm sequence which allows the alarm to vary in response to frequency and duration of motion so that isolated movement triggers a warning but persistent motion triggers a full scale alarm. It is apparent that the complexity and sophistication of such a theft alarm works best for special situations but not so when a simple, low cost package delivery alarm system is called for., 26834=In U.S. Pat. No. 5,574,429 issued to Streeter on Nov. 12, 1996, a self-contained programmable alarm system securely attached to an article is described. The article is protected by activating an alarm device when the article is moved. Non-position-sensitive, vibration activated switching means are included for activating the alarm device after sensing movement of the article. Although this alarm system can protect against the theft of an article, its implementation is rather complex and expensive to use for solving the current package delivery problem where simplicity and low cost are mandatory in order that such a system can be deployed and accepted by the general public., 28570=In U.S. Pat. No. 5,907,286 issued to Kuma on May 25, 1999, there is described a transport container and managing system suitable for use when valuable goods are transported by a transportation service. Such a system is specifically advanced for delivery services used by banking facilities when valuable goods such as money, jewelry or security articles are transported., 29728=In U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,647 issued to Devine on Dec. 8, 1998, there is described an alarm for detecting the unauthorized movement of an object. The system includes a motion detector, programmable microprocessor and an audible alarm all contained within a housing. The specific objective of this disclosure is to provide a simple and effective motion detection means and to provide an alarm device that can be attached to valuable items, and that will sound an alarm if the item is moved.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets The foregoing detailed description is illustrative of several embodiments of the invention, and it is to be understood that additional embodiments thereof will be obvious to those skilled in the art. The embodiments described herein together with those additional embodiments are considered to be within the scope of the invention. In an alternative embodiment, Alert Unit 5 can send or store messages in a file that can be queried by the addressee or the shipper. Thus, rather than sending a DELIVERY CONFIRMATION signal or a RECEIVED signal to the delivery agent or the sender, either entity can periodically submit a query for any such signals. In this alternative embodiment, the file of messages functions as a log, and this log can be queried on a periodic basis for billing purposes, or if a particular delivery is called into question. It can also be queried by the addressee in the same manner that a person with an e-mail account can periodically check for mail, so that the addressee can check for home deliveries. If the file is linked with information provided by the shipper or the delivery agent, the addressee can also determine the nature of the contents of the parcel that has been delivered to the addressee. This could be particularly useful if an addressee is expecting delivery of multiple items, and is particularly concerned about delivery of a particular item, or grouping of items.",
