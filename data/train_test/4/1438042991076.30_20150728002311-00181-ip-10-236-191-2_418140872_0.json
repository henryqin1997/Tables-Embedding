Kathy Lake, Environmental Specialist for the Madison Metropolitan Sewage\u00a0District,\u00a0offers an overview of the first full year of the project, including a second growing season, with a focus on watershed benefits.\u00a0 Her talk is complemented well with a case study offered by Kenneth Potter, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Wiscosin. Riparian wetlands improve water quality in streams and rivers by trapping sediment and associated phosphorus.\u00a0However, in poorly managed agriculturally regions excess sediment fill in such wetlands, causing ecosystem damage and reducing water quality benefits.\u00a0Removal of this excess sediment would restore the water quality benefits and mitigate the ecosystem damage.\u00a0Concurrent improvements in agricultural land management would limit future ecosystem damage. The 2013 UW Water Resources Management Practicum conducted a study of a potential sediment removal project in the Yahara WINS pilot project Dorn Creek Watershed. The watershed\u00a0drains into Lake Mendota.\u00a0 This talk summarizes the findings of that study.}",
