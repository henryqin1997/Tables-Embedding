Below are my observations about this product. 1) Device is really small, handy and (almost) noiseless --> Wonderful! 2) Actual available storage is 1.81 TB (approx. 1853.44 GB) --> Around 194.56 GB Loss :( But its OK 3) Software is easy to install. But need little techie knowledge to use. (not 100% user friendly) --> Doesn't Matter much as we can learn it! 4) When HDD is connected, windows takes much time to search the drivers --> Issue of Windows ?? 4) It took approx. 5 Hrs 45 Mins to transfer 225GB data via USB 2 port. --> In my sense its good speed for USB2! 5) Transfer cable is too shoft --> Bigger is better! but is not here... Note that, I have connected this HDD to laptop having below configuration. Processor - 2GHz Core2Duo OS - Windows Vista Home Premium RAM - DDR2 3GB USB version - 2 But, overall I am very happy with this product and would definitely recommend it to all my friends., 62852=In size these two models are different. Ultra version is slim, So internal fitting of this is different than \"My Passport\" . I have used the both models. i have seen good performance in both. But with Ultra version we need to take more care than \"My Passport\". Because my Ultra version got crashed after fell down from my hands. So i have chosen \"My Passport\", even if price is little more than Ultra . Was this answer helpful?yes0 Feb 02, 2015}",
