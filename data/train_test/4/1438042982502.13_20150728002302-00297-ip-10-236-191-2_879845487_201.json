            "Ball State is incredibly safe. The campus police are great and emergency phones are easy to find. Ball State is located in the middle of fields, so there is definitely no threat like there is in the city.",
            "Greek life is important to many on campus. There are both fraternities and sororities available. However, sorority girls cannot live with each other.",
            "There are many clubs, especially considering the size of the campus. There is something for everyone whether you enjoy dressing up as animals, volleyball, or swing dancing.",
            "Ball State's teaching college, architecture college, and business school are really great.",
            "There are several statues located on campus that are essential to being at Ball State. The statue that welcomes you to campus, Benny, is said to flap her wings at midnight if you kiss your true love under her. There is also the naked lady, a statue located within the library, that most students meet at for group projects.",
            "Being an out of state student, I would have been able to get a better deal elsewhere. Despite the beautiful campus and the great education, it is very difficult for me to pay for schooling",
            "There are a lot of things to do for fun including various clubs and organizations, sports, and various events held on campus.",
            "The food at Ball State is very good! It does get a little bit repetitive after a while, but there are many places in which to dine. The dining hall workers are friendly and they do their best to get you yummy food.",
            "The dorm I was in was fairly new and state of the art. It was beautiful and the residents were very friendly. However, not all of the dorms are quite this nice. But most people tend to love the other residents.",
            "The classes I take here are definitely more difficult than those I faced in high school. I have to study frequently but I also feel as if I am learning much more.",
            "Don't be afraid to talk to strangers! Every at Ball State is incredibly friendly and you will need a good support group to get you through the long nights of studying. Also, be sure to talk with your professors. Often times, if you are a good student, they will give you slight extensions on projects.",
            "Ball State University has a beautiful campus full of friendly people. The professors are great and there are a variety of majors to choose from. However, the tuition is quite high for out of state students."

I didn't find out that I couldn't afford my first choice school until March (it was out of state, and I was waiting for the results of a scholarship contest sponsored by that school). When I found out I wasn't going there after all, I panicked because it was the only school I had visited. The first school on my what do I do now list was Ball State. I came here, and fell in love immediately!, 590771=This past summer, two of my friends, who were sophomores got a once in a lifetime opportunity to go to the 2012 London Olympics. They got to participate in the events and even meet and interview the USA Olympic basketball team. They are telecommunications majors and this opportunity was provided to them via the Telecommunications department of Ball State University., 1010887=There are tons of things the university puts on for you to have fun. Every Saturday, there is a Late Night program with different themes, and they always have free food. Each season has different events, and many associations put on different things to go to. There is also The Village right outside of Ball State. They have a coffee place and restaurant, but otherwise the street is under construction until 2015., 280283=Food was ranked among top dining halls in the country for 2010, every dorm with the exception of 2 have a place to eat within them. They have daily specials and the quality of the food is suitable to satisfy a students appetite, 1050105=I feel very safe on campus. There are little blue lights that indicate emergency buttons across campus. Still, I do not recommend walking alone at 3 o'clock in the morning.}",
