            "There are plenty of clubs and organizations on campus. I'm a part of the mixed martial arts club, club lacrosse team, and the peer support network. There is something for everyone. Therer are clubs that pertain to interests such as the psychology club, spanish club, and ski and outdoor club. Some clubs even go on trips. Recently, the paintball/airsoft club went to a park and had a blast!",
            "It is a great place for criminal justice and nursing majors. The York hospital is across the road from the school, and the York City Police and Campus Saftey work well with students to help find internships and jobs after school.",
            "Every Thursday night the campus activties board hosts a thursday night movie, usually something that has come out recently. They sometimes show movies before they come out on netflix! It's also ok if you cant see the movie that Thursday, they show it again Saturday night.",
            "There are plenty of things to do for fun. The campus activites board is always hosting events ranging from bingo and casino nights, to guest comedians and more. There is something to do every weekend, and sometimes something to do everyday of the week. There are also local malls less than 15 minutes away for the people who love to shop. There are also plenty of fun places to eat around the city.",
            "Johnson dining hall was just re-amped with a new look and feel. It's going to be a great place to eat during the 2014-2015 academic year.",
            "Dorm life is different depending on what part of campus you're on. Within the freshman dorms, they're made to help individuals grow personally and build relationships with other students that will last through their college career. On west campus, in the upperclassmen dorms, residents get the chance to grow personal responsibility while also being able to build relationships with other residents. The resident assistants are a wonderful staff who are willing to help and guide freshmen through their first year, and also provide fun activities based on college policy.",
            "While some classes may seem boring and others easy, there is definitely a number of classes that will put your academic skills to the test. They are taught by professors with proffesional experience that know what it takes to get the job done. These professors offer a challenging circiculum but are also always willing to help if you need it.",
            "Come prepared to make friends! You will be able to jump into a small community where there are chances to meet someone knew everyday. There are plenty of things during orientation that help you to meet people. also the activities on campus including; greek life, campus activties board, residence life staff, help to branch someones personal and professional connections.",
            "It is a reasonably priced privite school. It has many opportunties to have fun, advance your career, and knowledge while attending. I would reccomend this school to anyone looking for a degree in science."

It's going to be a great place to eat during the 2014-2015 academic year., 7135=The education I am receiving here is excellent, York College was ranked number 13 among the best regional colleges in the North by U.S News 2011 Best College's Edition. For a private college, York is extremely affordable., 295589=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 73255=My favorite teacher stayed in my dorm complex around 1995, so the complex I'm in is a little worn, but definitely a lot better than other college's I visited my senior year. But once you become an upperclassmen there are so many other great options for you!, 156771=Apply early. They offer an application that can be sent in during the Summer of your junior year in high school. It is a great opportunity to get information earlier and be able to meet with prospective professors. For example, I sent my 2012 application in August 2011 and received information in October 2011. I was able to meet with my professors from my major and I had already received my application status saying I was accepted. You do not have to accept the acceptance letter at that time., 141969=not big partiers. Students to like classrooms with a ratio of 1:18 or at most 20. Students that like a sense of belonging to a small community., 113305=There is a wide variety of clubs on campus. There are clubs for majors, causes, religions, and just for fun. They have something for everyone's desires. We also have a wide variety of sports, but no football team. We like to say undefeated since 1787 because we've never had one at all.}",

    "textAfterTable": "You are not paying a lot to be here but you are definately getting your monies worth. It's a wonderful learning environment and you are sure to have a blast. Am enjoying being here There is always something to do around campus. Concerts, Relay for Life, club sports, collegiate sports, a brand new, amazing workout center complete with rock climbing wall. Not to mention the fraternities and sororities which are always doing something. Am learning a lot I have learned so much in my first three semesters here. The classes are generally small, so there is great professor/student ratio's. They are amusing and easy to get along with and are always willing to help. And the Learning Resource Center is always available if you are ever in need of extra assistance.
