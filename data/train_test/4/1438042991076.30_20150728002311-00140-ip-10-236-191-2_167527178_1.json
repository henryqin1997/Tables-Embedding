There's no possible other way to look at it.\"Really? You totally discount the fact that the team's scouting and player evaluation staff actually did their jobs, scouted and evaluated players rather than just reading so-called expert draft analysis, and put together a board of players ranked in the order they would like to obtain them if available? (Quoth Rizzo: \"Respect the board.\") If they were just going to draft for signability according to what some so-called expert said, why even go through the charade of hiring staff and holing them up at the ballpark around the clock for a week prior to the draft? You think Bob Boone, Davey Johnson, etc, work cheap?, 14355=True, Sam. I found this on Forbes, though I don't know how reliable these numbers are. If they are close to accurate, though, it definitely suggests there's room for payroll growth: http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/33/baseball-valuations-10_Washington-Nationals_337401.htmlhttp://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/33/baseball-valuations-10_The-Business-Of-Baseball_Revenue.html, 38971=Feel Wood, I like your take, as is often the case.Walter23, good points, especially #2.It's a shame the Nats chose to be so frugal in drafts prior to 2010. Basically, they talked about wanting to do things the right way, and then even short-changed that approach.But the 2010 draft was great.And it's mostly at this point about building a fan base. And the Nats have bolluxed that during most of the past 5 years. They need to do whatever, even spend slightly foolishly, to try and make baseball moderately relevant in this town.Basically, echoing Sec3, 31248=I've heard the argument about \"arbitrarily spending money\" and people who caution against it. But face it; the difference between a $60M payroll and a $90M payroll is incredibly significant. $30M buys you two decent FA starting pitchers and a right fielder in 2010. Think that would have been nice to have, instead of allowing guys like Olsen, Atilano and Harris put up worse-than-replacement numbers?The problem the Nats have is that they talk a big game but are a few years away from being able to back it up. Cliff Lee isn't going to come here, not now that he's gotten a taste of the post season. We don't have the prospects to tempt Greinke away from KC. Nor do we really have prospects to address any big-name trade rumor (Matt Kemp?). What I think we can do is go after another reclamation project (Wang in 2010, Brandon Webb in 2011), or make a trade w/ Tampa as they try to dump payroll (James Shields or Neiman could be out there and we've traded w/ TB before). A little more success plus a healthy Strasburg makes us a much better FA destination in 2012., 92468=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern. You can also listen to the station on 94.3 FM, 92.7 FM and online at ESPN980.com. Click here for past audio clips., 23763=\"Which also means this: Even if they re-sign Dunn to a contract that pays him $15 million next year, they'd still only be looking at a total payroll of $62 million, down $4 million from last year's number.\"The 2011 payroll is not the issue, with Dunn or with any other high-paid player. Sure, they can pay Dunn $15M for 2011 with ease. But in order to do that, they also have to commit to paying him $15M or more for 2012, 2013 and probably 2014, because he's not going to sign a one year contract. Same goes for Cliff Lee, Jayson Werth or any other desirable free agent. They are all going to command big money over a long term contract. This is what makes signing free agents such a tricky business, because the question must be asked \u2013 what do you do several years down the road when you find yourself saddled with several big contracts for players who are no longer producing, as well as big contracts for players who have come up through your system and are ready to cash in on the big contract? If you find yourself in that situation, it then becomes difficult to acquire whatever good players you still may need to improve your team. Ask the Cubs how this works. Ask the Giants, who are succeeding now even though they have been forced to banish high-paid players like Zito and Rowand from their playoff roster. Not a sustainable long-term situation by any means. What do they do in another year when they are still paying off these dead contracts, handing huge money to Lincecum and Cain and have to look for players to plug their offensive holes? There really is little choice for a team like the Nats who have payroll room but who are also trying to build from within. They can either stay the course they have set, signing free agents to longterm contracts only when it makes sense for the longer term, or they can shoot their wad and sign multiple guys to longterm contracts that might give them some modicum of success next year but which might also leave them hamstrung in a bad place for quite some time after that. There really is no middle ground, so focusing solely on next season's payroll is an exercise in futility. I can guarantee that no such discussion is going on with Rizzo or Lerner. They have set their course, and they are sticking with it., 19583=Daniel Victor, thanks for the link to Forbes for the 2009 data. The Web pages show Nats' 2009 \"operating income\" (\"earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\")of $33.5 million, the 3rd highest in the league after the Red Sox ($40M) and \u2014 the Marlins! ($46.1M). Interesting stuff., 9727=Very nicely laid out Dr Z. Wish we could lob in a $100,000 buyout for our manager as well, but that's a topic for another day.Ted Lilly's apparenntly off the market, signed a 3 year deal with LA (the Dodgers, not the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim).In Free Agent land, the picking seems kinda slim. Several risky SP's with potential upside, and equal potential for a 2011 akin to the 2010 we got out of Marquis and Wang., 40151=\"It's a shame the Nats chose to be so frugal in drafts prior to 2010. Basically, they talked about wanting to do things the right way, and then even short-changed that approach.\"Calling them frugal in previous drafts is a baseless canard. Presumably you're saying this because you perceive them as being cheap because they drafted for so-called \"signability\" rather than taking best player available. But in saying this you discount the work and player evaluations done by the scouting and front office staff employed by the team. If frugality was the primary concern, why hire and pay these people at all, when all that would be required to achieve your same end of \"signability drafting\" would be a subscription to Baseball America? Drafting a real MLB team is not the same thing as a fantasy draft, you know. If you want to place blame anywhere, you could say that the Nats had bad scouts and player evaluators, and that they did not do their job well. But this is a far different kettle of fish than saying they were drafting frugally just because they did not follow BA's analysis (or that of your favorite analysis outfit, if you don't like BA) to the letter., 41977=Feel Wood, after Stasburg in 2009, the next three picks were all about saving money and signability. There's no possible other way to look at it.They drafted Trevor Holder with their 3rd round pick. He went in the 10th round the previous year, and his 2008 season and his 2009 season were almost identical.After 2008 the earliest anyone took him was the 10th round.After 2009 the Nats grabbed him in the 3rd round.If they liked him so much after 2009, fine, take him in the 6th or 7th round. It was all about saving money, staying within some sort pre-established budget. No other way to see it. 2008 2009IP 98 92ERA 4.41 4.48WHIP 1.42 1.34K/9 6.24 7.02W/L 8-4 7-5 Why else is he suddenly worth a 3rd round draft choice?Why else is he signing well below slot?He knew, his agent knew, and the Nats knew he was not a bona fida 3rd rounder., 22653=Sam:I agree with what you say re: Cliff Lee. But Carl Crawford is 28 years old. Unless you think the Nats will still be in the dark years until 2015 or so, how does he not help make them a contender? Seems to be that players like him are the best of both worlds for the Nats- a chance to give the 2011 team a cosmetic lift and give the fans reason to go to the ballpark, while also helping to build for those potential contending Strasburg-Zimmerman-Harper teams in 2013 and beyond., 74655=Anon @ 10:10, It's nice that someone other than me gets this concept.You have to look at Dunn as an overall player not focus on his HR total. Based on the past year he is worth $15 mil per but not for longer than 2 years and if we don't sign him; as you say we can get the lost productivity from other positions so it doesn't have to be Pena or someone like him., 1838=Actually, the more pertinent question may be: How much money do the Nationals have to spend? That obviously depends on how high ownership is willing to raise payroll from its Opening Day 2010 total of $66,275,000. Delving into the numbers and the contracts, though, you come to realize the Nats have plenty of room to work with, even if Read more \u00bb, 47267=Drafting Robby Ray and A.J. Cole in later rounds this past draft and giving them first round money wasn't any part of a \"signability\" stategy. 2009 gave us Strasburg and Storen and next year you're going to learn the name A.J. Morris from the same draft. That's a very good young stable of pitchers that will go a long way in establishing the base for overall improvement., 63655=Great discussion, everyone. I am a big believer in not signing just to sign \u2013 on other web sites I've argued extensively that just aiming at an $80 or $90 million payroll just to aim is stupid, and brought out the Mets, Cubs, Mariners and Tigers as what NOT to do. That said, I do think that you go for free agents with an eye to 2011, 2012 and beyond. So you don't sign the Vinny Castillas or even the Cliff Lees of the world. You do go after the 20-something talent, like Carl Crawford and Yu Darvish. And you go after, yes, Adam Dunn. If you're really brave, you front-load Dunn's contract so that you're paying him more in the first two years (when he's most likely to be most productive) than the last two years. This also frees up money when some players hit free agency and arbitration years.Putting another 100 loss team on the field would throw away the progress that they've made, spiking the stirring TV ratings and watching the season ticket list dwindle below 10,000. At that point it starts to look like a failed franchise.Which is not a good return on investment.John C., 29236=Payroll is a bit of a red herring, in that you do not always get what you pay for (Mets, Mariners, Cubs\u2026). But it's also true that you can draft high for decades, and still have nothing to show for it. Neither one works *if you do it wrong*. Either can work, if you do it well.But they all have a context. Some teams can't afford to wait for ten years for good players to develop. This is one of those teams.The Nats need to improve the product on the field considerably, with a time machine to 2007 if possible. If they can do that without increasing payroll, I'm fine with it. I just don't see any other way to speed up the process, and they *do* need to speed up the process., 51819=Mark: A couple of other things to consider here. Both Strasburg & Harper are 'dead money' along with Kennedy for 2011, as Strasburg is on the DL, and Harper is in the minors. As a result, they need two more players to fill the roster, and the base salary will rise by at least $800k to $48.417M. That's still roughly $17.86M below the 2010 25-man expenditure. The team either needs, or is looking for 1) A top-flight starting pitcher, 2) A left-handed or switch-hitting bat w/power, either at 1B or OF, 3) Improved defense, and 4) Bench strength. IMO, they're not going to get all that through Free Agency alone, even if the Lerners' suddenly jump the ML budget to $80M (yeah, right) for 2011. It's far more likely that Rizzo will have to fill the holes through trades & more 2nd-tier FA signings. In hindsight, locking up Dunn earlier in the year probably would have solved the 1B/LH hitter issue for around $15-16M/year, but they completely screwed the pooch on that one; Rizzo made his off-season harder than it had to be with that non-move., 66425=So how much would Cliff Lee cost, 15 to $20 million. Seems like a lot on the surface, but let's just say that the cheap Lerners agree with that figure and Rizzo tries to do it.Be money well spent, the reason why? Look at what attendance was like for Strasburg games, he added an additional 15 to 20,000 butts in seats buying $5 hot dogs and $8 beers.On top of that the Nats would be big news on a national level and would have a chance to contend in 2011.Of course the possibility of Lee signing with crapy team like the Nats are slim to none and I have to think that a very smart Nolan Ryan will do everything and spend everything to keep Lee signed up with the Rangers. But yes Lee would be great for the Nats at any cost., 78530=@8Ok Sir,First fire Riggs and his staff save Rick E. Nice guy, loser from way back. You will never win with him and he killed the team in June with his lineups in Cleveland and Balt.Second, go to ownership and get a budget of $80 million this year, $90 Million Next and $95 for the 3rd year of a 3 year of a 3 year plan for MLB level salaries. This does not mean cutting back on Player D of draft bonuses. Third Spend the money. Get a winning manager and coaching staff. NOT the cheapest Manager which is what Acta and Riggs were and why they were hired. Then Cut Harris, Kennedy, Maxwell, Wil N. Olsen and all the other dead weight like Mench. Next Trade Morgan for whatever you can get and say good bye to Dunn. Now Spend on CF, RF and 1B either through trades for short term high salary guys or FAs\u2026\u2026 but these three positions need major upgrades both in Defense and Offense (Dunn has too may holes in his offensive game (200K's and bad D is not worth 15 Mil). Lastly, overpay for a top starter and a #3 starter. Names you say\u2026.that is tough to say without being on the inside but those are the needs and priorities. If younger guys like Crawford or proven guys like Lee will sign the go all in at any cost. If you have to settle for older guys then overpay for one or two year contracts like Pudge and Jason M model last year\u2026\u2026but focus on better players you pay what you need to pay. No more Kennedy instead of Hudson moves., 20541=georgie and Sunderland \u2013 My point is this: spending more money doesn't necessarily make your team better. I actually did some research the other day, and, using Cots Contracts data, I found that, over the last 5 years, the correlation to payroll (in real 2005 dollars) to wins is .426. In other words, sure, spending money helps, but there is much more to it than just blindly throwing money out there.Now, that seems obvious, yet many people just go on shouting about how the Lerners are cheap and need to spend more money immediately. That does not mean the team will be better.I firmly believe that the best way to build a contending team is to build from scratch. Bottom up. You go through your dark years, drafting well, trading well, developing well, and then the team becomes good. And THEN you can throw money into re-signing your players and signing mid-level free agents to fill out the roster. The Nationals are not at that stage yet, so spending money on big free agents, at this point, does not make sense. We are still in the \"dark years.\" The team will likely NOT be good next year. At best, it will be average (i.e. 81 wins), and I have my doubts about that.So, yes, if spending less or the same gives you the same product as last year while also developing the product for the future in the minor leagues, then I am completely okay with that. That makes sense. That will help make this team into a contender. Signing Cliff Lee and Carl Crawford will not., 60429=This is a fascinating discussion with several commenters expressing quite divergent viewpoints very convincingly. I think a key point was made by Sec3MySofa (who also has a simply great moniker):\"Some teams can't afford to wait for ten years for good players to develop. This is one of those teams. The Nats need to improve the product on the field considerably, with a time machine to 2007 if possible.\"A few thoughts on why we simply can't be satisfied with another last place finish next year.1. The fan base is hemorraging. STHs are down to 10K or less and will keep falling with Strasburg out this year. Whatever strategy is pursued, it's simply not possible to build a winning team while at the same time trying to deal with the pressures of declining revenue. 2. Increased attendance brings increased revenue brings more flexibility for free agent signings or contract extensions when they are needed. If you assume an average ticket price of $40, each additional 5K of STHs is $16 million more in revenue. That doesn't include increased concessions or merchandise sales. If we had 30K STHs rather than 10K, that's $128 million of revenues over four years, more than enough to sign Dunn and another top flight free agent without breaking a sweat.3. Ryan Zimmerman walks if we aren't contending by 2012. I for one really don't want to see this team rebuilding again in 2013 or 2014 with Zim gone, and it's very hard to go from a cellar dweller to a contender in one year. We need to improve incrementally. That means getting to .500 in 2011, then taking the next step in 2012. I don't see any way that we get to .500 next year without some significant roster improvement through FA signings and/or extensions., 105077=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 49985=Natsjack, fully agree with you.The 2010 draft was outstanding and completely different from previous drafts. Doc \u2013 There's plenty of money coming in, or at least that's what Forbes thinks, and since no one's opening the books, that's the best estimates we got.}",
