            "Ever since Luffy, Kid and Law had their \"debut\" together (not sure of a better word) at the Archipelago I've thought that the dynamic between the three would become a major part of the manga. Indeed, Trafalgar Law has played a fairly major role in the short time since he's been introduced, saving Luffy's life after the war and now becoming a key member of Luffy's first adventure in the New World (Fishman island doesn't count as the New World, right? Eh, sorry). And as we saw in the latest chapter, 674, Kid has appeared again as well. So now that that is out of the way, how do you think the interactions between these pirates will evolve? For example, Trafalgar Law has allied himself with Luffy to take down one of the Four Kings. Do you see the Strawhats and the other crews (admittedly, we really know nothing about Kid's role in the New World) replacing the Four Kings as the strongest competitors for one piece? Other situations? If you're interested, feel free to comment ________________",

            "Maybe they might have one of those strange relationships like shanks and mihawk. (at least luffy and law might) Luffy would be like shanks and law might be like mihawk.",

            "Foreshadowing maybe? Most likely gonna be the next Big Four for their generation. The relationship between Luffy and Law kinda the same as Shanks and Whitebeard.",

            "Yeah, maybe! I'm curious to see if such a thing could develop though, or if this new generation of pirates will be so focused on getting One Piece that they decide to avoid getting into a stalemate like the previous one and work together for a time, until it becomes time to fight for superiority. I guess we still know so close to nothing though hahahahha ________________",

            "I think Luffy and Law's relationship will be more like rogers and whitebeards. I don't think Luffy will ever stay in one place at a time, he will probably rush all the way to Raftel and then challenge the WG or something.I doubt he would stay in the new world enough to be one of the emperors. Maybe the whole current \"4 emperors\" system will collapse with their generation. It seems like a balance act between the emperors and the WG and I think it will be alot of turmoil when Luffy becomes strong enough to go against the admirals on his own.",

            "well in the island (before impel down), we get to see how good they work together (law, kidd and luffy) and they're freaking strong. and even luffy said something like \"your powers is so weird\" and they all were like \"yours is the weirder one\"; so probably they'll not be best friends, but they'll be allies. Just like they enter some trouble, and they'll be behind luffy's back (and let's face it, in those years luffy dismissed the strawhats he didn't get to have respect, so those pirates don't know much about him). LOL, i think in this last chapter luffy has been used. ________________ Curiosity is a cockroach-like thing.",

            "Quote from Selim I think Kid will offer an alliance as well but knowing Luffy he will probably refuse saying something like \"Nah, I don't like you that much\" It might actually be the opposite, Luffy, Law, and Kid worked really well that last time they were together. Plus Luffy seemed enjoy that moment with them, and when that happen.... Well, we all know he acts, he'll most likely see it as fun to team up with them. ________________",

            "Yeah i think Law and Luffy might end up as friends, but i can definitely see Kid being an antagonist, considering he actually is a \"Pirate\" when compared to Luffy, and how in the beginning those were they guys Luffy took out. Even if Kid and Luffy never actually seriously fight, i don't think they will ever fully join forces."
