    "textBeforeTable": "Citada por It is to be understood that the above-referenced arrangements are illustrative of the application for the principles of the present invention. Thus, while the present invention has been described above in connection with the exemplary embodiments of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications and alternative arrangements can be made without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention as set forth in the claims. In still another aspect of the present invention, the high quality liquid product can be blended with more viscous lower quality (e.g. lower API) hydrocarbon products. For example, kerogen oil produced from the impoundments can be blended with bitumen to form a blended oil. The bitumen is typically not transportable through an extended pipeline under conventional and accepted pipeline standards and can have a viscosity substantially above and an API substantially below that of the kerogen oil. The amount of blending can vary considerably depending on the particular quality of bitumen and kerogen oils. However, as a general guideline the blended oil can be from 5% to 95% kerogen oil, in some cases from about 10% to about 40%, and in other cases from about 50% to 80%, with substantially a remainder of the blended oil comprising bitumen. By blending the kerogen oil and bitumen, the blended oil can be rendered transportable without the use",
