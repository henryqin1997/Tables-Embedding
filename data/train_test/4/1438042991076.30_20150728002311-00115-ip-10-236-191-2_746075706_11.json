    "textAfterTable": "Tony Gonzalez, Chiefs - Moving Down Only fell a spot and it is only one game but the Chiefs not only looked punchless in week one, they have a brutal schedule coming up with few signs so far that Gonzo will be able to meet previous season levels of production. Still a great tight end, but not deserving of the #2 spot and may fall a little more if Huard and company do not get their act together soon. Jason Witten , Cowboys - Moving Up With Terrell Owens and Patrick Crayton spreading the field against the Giants, Witten turned in a monster six catch, 116 yard game with one score. That won't happen every week of course but it was a positive sign that the new offense would continue to use Witten and he should have a secure role in the passing game every week. Vernon Davis, 49ers - Moving Down The high potential second year player did almost nothing in the first game and more importantly, the 49er offense looked like it really missed Norv Turner. Davis is another that may fall further if the offense doesn't get on the same page quickly. Zach Miller, Raiders - Moving Up The rookie is only worthy of being a fantasy backup but his first NFL game had six targets and three catches. The Raiders love this kid and the offense intends on making him become a premier",
