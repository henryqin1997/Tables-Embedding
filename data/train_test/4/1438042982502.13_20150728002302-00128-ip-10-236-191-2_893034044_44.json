            "I'm not Greek. No idea.",
            "There are so many clubs for just about anything you can think of. If there isn't currently a club for it, there's a whole department that will help you start it.",
            "Working-adults; kids graduating from high school; anyone that wants to attend school.",
            "There are historic buildings right on campus. Its basically a row of old, turn of the century homes that have been preserved and are being used for businesses on campus.",
            "Excellent bang for the buck. It's the place to go if you don't want to spend $100k on your undergrad!",
            "You mean fun outside of my major? Well, being a musician--there are a plethora of performances on campus; music, theater, jazz, etc. There are sports teams and outside activities going on all the time.",
            "There's plenty of places to eat on campus.",
            "I live off-campus.",
            "If you're a music, performance major, it can be intense. I practice on average, about 4 hours a day just on my own music. Then add in ensemble music, accompanying music and rehearsals. That's before opening a book for any other academic class or music class. Plus, I work and own my own business. Do you think that's rigorous?",
            "Don't underestimate Metro State--it's really an excellent school; much better than I had expected.",
            "Metro State is a great school for the working adult. Its affordable and right in downtown Denver, so its easy to access. The professors are exceptional and are experts in their fields of study; they're very available for students and are dedicated to education."

It is located downtown on a campus shared by CUD and CCD (higher ed schools) completing what is called the Auraria Campus. Amenities include lite rail transportation, public library and easy access to food nearby., 528610=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 127604=Register on the day registration is available. If you take loans, complete everything in April or you will want to kick yourself in August. This isn't high school. The academic work is more challenging but the experience definitely is not. Show up, pay attention, and leave. College is only as hard as you make it., 149530=When I visited this school in March of 2012, I was shocked by the huge campus and the amazing campus amenities (Starbucks on campus? Oh, yeah!). Everyone I met there was so nice and helpful, even the student who had nothing to gain from helping me out. In short, this school seems like a great one and I can't wait to attend!, 120158=If you are willing to push yourself, you can make even the freshman level classes as hard as you want. I had papers that were supposed to be about 1200 words for English comp, but I talked with my teacher to get extended time and ended up writing pieces about 3000 words in length. Now, those papers are being submitted to editors and publisher and will hopefully be in the hands of the public sometime soon! =P, 148771=While I am not currently enrolled in this school, from what I can tell of my March visit here, the academic rigor is above average, because of the wonderful teachers employed by the school and the inventive and original curriculum's they have put together.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The learning level is good. There are a lot of different type of teachers there and from the one I've had they were really cool. Plus if for what ever reason you didn't understand the teacher they all have a wide range of office hours that you can go to. If you still don't get it you can always ask one of the other teachers in that department. Then there's always the old fashion way and that's going in for tutoring from students who might be able to explain it to you in a way you understand. though i wont lie there are some old teachers there and you play a gamble with them. some are old and put you to sleep and there are others that are awesome.
