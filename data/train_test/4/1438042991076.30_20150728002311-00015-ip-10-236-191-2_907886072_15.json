            "Since campus is located in the famous Black Hills, there is always something to do. We have hiking, trails, rock climbing, water activities, snowboarding and skiing. There are tourist attractions near by, such as Mt.Rushmore, Deadwood, Sturgis, Crazy Horse statue, The Badlands, and much more. There is never a dull moment here!",
            "The food is good. There is a variety of selections in the cafeteria, that include vegetarian choices",
            "Dorm life is so much fun. There are so many opportunities just in meeting new people and having fun. Dorms are decent sized, and each room has a sink and a mirror. The restrooms are community restrooms, but the showers have individual stalls. The rooms have wonderful views in most cases, and the windows are big, allowing the room to feel more welcoming.",
            "Professors challenge students to learn on their own, and explore different academic avenues.",
            "Know what you are getting yourself into. College is so different from living at home and from high school. Be smart about money, that will save you so much stress and time.",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students First - if you are person who enjoys getting involved, don't take the General Studies class! It goes into depth about what campus activities are going on and works to get students involved. Second - What you learn is up to you. Your teachers will help you when you need it, but you are in charge of what you learn. Third - Get involved. Join a club or a student organization about something that is important to you. Bang for the buck Some classes are definitely worth the money - tuition isn't as expensive as some state schools, but for a broke college student, it sometimes seems like the tuition could be cut in price. The education is very good, but some teachers are definitely better than others, and some classes are certainly worth the money while others are not. The cafeteria food is also much better than high school cafeteria food, and housing is pretty nice as well. Am enjoying being here Black Hills State University is set in a beautiful area - almost anywhere that a student might need to go is within walking distance, or at least within biking distance. There are many extracurricular clubs and activities for students, and even some opportunities to go to conferences and other special",
