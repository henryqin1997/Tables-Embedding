The inductor section 24 is preferably formed as large turns of relatively stiff wire which support a slug-type tuning section 64 therewithin. The inductors 24,28 and 32 are all formed by U-shaped wire loops which are conductively linked by printed circuit legs. The extension 30 and 34 are also printed on the board 66 adjacent the periphery thereof and are tuned by means of a scalpel or knife by trimming off end pieces until the proper operation is achieved. As was the case with the embodiment of FIG. 1, the radiator/inductor 46 has an extension at one end comprising inductor section 56 and antenna extension 58. At the other end the invention exhibits inductor 60 and antenna extension 62. Again the",
