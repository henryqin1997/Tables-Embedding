            "Students who have great talent they want to perfect, like writing or playing an instrument. Also students who want an open, active, liberal environment to use their skills to change the world.",
            "Tour all of the different dorms to see what is right for you, because the Lower Quad dorms are completely different from the Towers. Also, make sure to see the downtown area or explore the famous waterfalls and gorges with your family to get a feel for the surroundings.",
            "The college gives out great scholarships and provides numerous opportunities for students to get ahead. This includes frequent, sought-after speakers, many on-campus events and concerts, and great internships to L.A, NYC, and abroad.",
            "Ithaca over-accepted in 2009 but the staff and faculty work non-stop to accommodate and entertain the extra people. I love the diverse campus where film students, music majors, drama and journalism kids can all be best friends and learn from each other. Downtown Ithaca is also a perfect place for college kids to shop, eat, and explore, while still feeling the close-knit community.",
            "The professors are all extremely helpful and aim to teach you the most they can. Many professors strive to give us the education we are paying for. Along with interesting, intimate classes, you will learn a lot from the variety of clubs, extracurriculars and sports offered (Girl's Rugby!)."

So everyone should definitely get a Ithaca is Gorges because it is so true. The gorges are great and as a right of passage one must go gorge jumping. Although, I do have to warn you, the waters kinda cold even in September., 25988=Here is my biggest problem with the school, this year (2009-2010) the school overenrolled about 25% more students then the school could accomidate for. All of the lounges were turned into bedroom so there is no where to just hang out or meet people on campus. And honestly there isn't much to do on campus, there are a few clubs you could join but There aren't that many to choose from., 67420=Ithaca over-accepted in 2009 but the staff and faculty work non-stop to accommodate and entertain the extra people. I love the diverse campus where film students, music majors, drama and journalism kids can all be best friends and learn from each other. Downtown Ithaca is also a perfect place for college kids to shop, eat, and explore, while still feeling the close-knit community., 200200=I have been looking forward to coming to Ithaca College since the 9th grade and when I finally came to visit this past April, it was everything that I had hoped for and more! I am applying in the fall and I hope that I get accepted. I'm so excited!, 354687=Dorms are clean and cozy, if relatively small. Freshman housing is taking over more and more of campus now, and past sophomore year you can't live in a double anymore, but other than that the dorms are nice. There is dedicated WIFI for the dorms that was upgraded in Spring 2013, but it still can be rather slow during peak hours (early evenings, typically)., 80051=I know this is generic advice, but get involved with as much as you can. There is so much to do and see around Ithaca and over 200 clubs and activities that allow you to experience that. Ithaca has pretty unpredictable weather. Since I've been there, there has been snow is September and sun in January. You really want to make sure you're prepared for those days when its 30 degrees and raining and then suddenly its 50 degrees and sunny. There is so much to get involved in, not only the school, but the town itself. If you don't get work study, get a job off campus. I volunteer at an animal shelter only 15 minutes away from the school. There are so many festivals and events downtown, so make sure you don't spend all your time on campus. Don't be afraid to take a class you don't know anything about. I know nothing about computers but I am getting ready to take a 3D animation programming class next semester and I couldn't be more excited! Ithaca has so many different fields, it's impossible to not want to try them all., 385705=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 16508=Ithaca offers the top-notch programs in each of its schools and disciplines. Job placement is also very high after graduation and many students also go on to graduate school. The price is high as it is a private school, but IC offers many resources and opportunities for students, including the Fitness Center, the new Athletic and Events Center that will be completed by 2011, and the library. Also, the college offers the chance for students to work on campus., 894=Get to know your professors, they want you to succeed and they will help you with everything. They really get to know you so take advantage of that. Visit in the winter, it gets cold and snowy. The first time I went up to Ithaca in February of 07 there was about 3 feet of snow (no lie) on the ground. Expect a lot of that! Its not as bad as everyone thinks. It snows in the morning and its warmer by the afternoon. Also, explore the town, its full of a lot of little surprises. Ithaca is all about community, if you like chill people, Ithaca is the school for you.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students -Students who like the outdoors- there are lots of hiking trails and gorges to look at and explore -Music students- their music school is amazing - Undecided Students- Ithaca College has a great Exploratory Program where they guide you on classes to take and you are required to take a first year seminar which automatically gets you into a small classroom setting. -Any health major- The School of Health Science and Health Performance which I am a part of helps you plan for your future. They will aid you in getting internships and doing research. Tips for prospective students If you want quiet, do not live in the Towers; the walls are paperthin Save your bonus bucks (snack money with your meal plan) you will want them by the end of the semester As I mentioned before introduce yourself and get to know your professors; they will be happy that you made the effort to get to know them. Study hard, but have fun too. Make sure to not lock yourself in your room all day; everyone is looking for a friend the first few weeks of college so get to know people. Bang for the buck Ithaca College is an expensive school, no doubt about it. I am only able to afford it because of the",
