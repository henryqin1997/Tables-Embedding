He hammered Jennings as the Bucks' point guard drove to the hoop. After landing on his tailbone, he got up slowly and missed the free throw. ... O'Brien argued a no-call and was hit with a technical by referee Brian Forte late in the third. ... The Bucks had 12 offensive rebounds out of the 20 boards they grabbed in the first quarter. The Pacers managed one offensive rebound and five defensive ones., 15154=Mike Dunleavy and Hibbert keyed a 10-2 run to open the third. Hibbert dunked over Bogut, and Dunleavy added six points, including a free throw that tied the game at 58 at the 9:02 mark., 13428=The Bucks have won six in a row over the Pacers, including the last five at the Bradley Center. Bogut was out with a migraine for the first meeting this season, but the Bucks still won 94-90 on Nov. 5 at Indiana., 20293=NOTABLE: Pacers forward James Posey was called for a flagrant-1 foul with 4:03 left in the half when he blocked a driving attempt by Jennings but knocked Jennings to the floor with some hard contact. ... Bogut finished with 11 rebounds, but only one came after halftime. ... Bogut also made 7 of his 10 free throws, a marked improvement over the 5-for-16 effort he had Saturday in a victory over Orlando., 7868=Indiana reached double digits in victories - something it failed to do last season until Jan. 2 - with a 124-100 win over Toronto on Monday night. It was the Pacers' highest offensive output since defeating Denver 144-113 on Nov. 9., 8578=Brandon Rush, selected 13th overall in the 2008 draft, is showing signs of coming around, scoring a season-high 26 points while making 6 of 8 from 3-point range against the Raptors., 9615=Granger shot just 6 of 17 and had 19 points in a 94-90 defeat to Milwaukee on Nov. 5. The Pacers were held to 30 second-half points and shot 38.7 percent overall - their second-worst effort of the season - en route to their fifth consecutive loss in the series.}",
