    "textAfterTable": "11 Songs Album Review Crooked Still isn't reinventing anything on its debut album, which is full of traditional country songs like \"Darling Corey,\" \"Shady Grove,\" and \"Flora\" (aka \"The Lily of the West\"), and some familiar copyrighted ones, such as Robert Johnson's \"Last Fair Deal Gone Down\" and Albert E. Brumley's \"Rank Stranger.\" To the extent there is anything unusual about the quartet's approach, it lies in the instrumentation, which consists of banjo, cello, and double bass, backing Aoife O'Donovan's singing.
