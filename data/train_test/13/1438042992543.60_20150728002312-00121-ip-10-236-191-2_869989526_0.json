    "textBeforeTable": "Try the Omega in Quantum for greater durability, or in Sirius plastic for the best grip/durability combination. The Omega makes a great putter and approach disc because it gives you total control of angle, direction, and pace \u2013 the keys to success in the short game. Even if you\u2019re outside your putting range, the Omega has the precision to get up-and-down. The Millennium Standard Omega AP is a putt and approach disc that flies straight. Compared to the Millennium Omega SS, it is made from stiffer, super grip material for when you want to lay up to the basket. Made to improve your approach game, it's a straight flyer with a great feel and great durability. It's also a tremendous putter for disc golf players who prefer a putter that's more firm but still sticky.
