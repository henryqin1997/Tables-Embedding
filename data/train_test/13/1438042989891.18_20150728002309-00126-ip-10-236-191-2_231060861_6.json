These domains have an immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich fold containing 7 or 8 strands in 2 beta-sheets in a Greek key topology [12042876, 12808037, 14527408]. Although the appendage domains from AP / GGA adaptins and coatomers share a similar fold, there is little sequence identity between them. However, they also share similar motif-based cargo recognition and accessory factor recruitment mechanisms.}",
