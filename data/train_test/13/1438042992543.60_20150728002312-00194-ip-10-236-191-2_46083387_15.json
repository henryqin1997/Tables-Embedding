So we\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow to get more clues about whether the market was bottomed today (or very close) or this is going to be a June 2009 kind of sell off., 95225=As illustrated in the chart below, tomorrow could be a key day: keep selling off then most likely a correction similar to the June 2009 we\u2019ll see, while small red or green then most likely bottomed the market was (is)., 5599=OK, bullish Monday? Plus according to the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac, the first trading of May (that\u2019s the next Monday), Dow up 9 of last 11. And from all the initial evidences I\u2019ve collected so far, it does look like that bulls have some chances the next Monday, not sure, need do more research though., 30051=SEASONALITY: MOSTLY THE MONTH\u2019S LAST TRADING WEEK WAS RED SINCE AUG 2009, 129827=From the weekly T2111 below we can see that the current T2111 reading is at very extreme level which in the past also means a choppy market ahead., 63543=Below are the back test summary for the VIX MA ENV\u00a0trading setup since 2002., 128843=T2111 from Telechart, percent of stocks 2 std dev above MA(200) is a little bit too high. See the blue curve representing SPX, it becomes very choppy whenever T2111 is too high (above the blue horizontal line).}",
