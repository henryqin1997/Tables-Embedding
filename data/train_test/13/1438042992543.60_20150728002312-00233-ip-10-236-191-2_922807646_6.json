            "Study, study, study! You may have breezed through high school with straight A's, but I can assure you that wont happen at MS&T. The curriculum is challenging but worth while. Putting effort into the material you will learn at MS&T will help you to do better in school and succeed in a career.",
            "I came to college to get an education and I am certainly getting that here. For the cost, MS&T is a very great school choice. There are similar schools that I looked at that cost upwards of $45,000 every year! MS&T is an exceptional school for the cost.",
            "Rolla is a very quiet community. The rural setting keeps distractions to a minimum. If a student wants to have fun there are many outdoor activities that are local to Rolla, both on and off campus. If a student likes city life, Rolla is only an hour and a half from St. Louis and about an hour away from Columbia.",
            "The professors at MS&T push students hard to accel. The courses are difficult but worthwhile. There are multiple oppurtunities to recieve help such as Teacher Office hours and study groups. All of these oppurtunities are focused on helping students. You must show that you are doing work, they will not simply do this work for you. Teachers and peers are not the only option for help, graduate students are often willing to help students who seek assistance and show effort. There are some assigned hours that they may help students during, but if you are having trouble they are usually just a phone call away."

The work load seems to really build up sometimes and the Male to Female ratio is 3:1 to name a few.

Greek housing can range from very ornate to run-down depending on different chapters.}",

Students wanting to go into Computer Science Students who like the fact that football players actively talk about the history of lasers as part of a debate between scientists and engineers during lunch. Tips for prospective students Missouri S&T may be continuing to renovate their dorms; if they are doing this the year you are to come in as a freshman, they may put you in the Rolla Inn (they've done this to us this year and the freshmen before me), an old Howard-Johnson inn. It's not... the best... but it builds character. And it's temporary. Regardless of where you stay, though, as advice for anyone going to college for the first time, remember these things: Attend classes. A lot of the classes your first year will have their grade based in some part on your attendance. I know in high school you were told your professors don't care but only your test grades, but I guess they're trying to bridge the two here. Also, MEALS ARE NOT ALWAYS SERVED. If you're going Greek, this may not apply to you, but if you are on campus housing, none of the dining facilities are always open. You have to find which are open when, if you want to",
