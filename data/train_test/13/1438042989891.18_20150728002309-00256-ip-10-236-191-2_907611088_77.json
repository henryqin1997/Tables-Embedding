            "The safewalks back at night are great. Though I find the campus cops annoying as can be, they do make it a safer place",
            "AWESOME! The sororities and fraternities are amazing. The private chefs, the wild parties, and the test files are all a hugeeee way to get ahead. Plus all Greeks help each other. Like this year I was offered 4 different internships just for being in a sorority. It is the best.",
            "Way more to do than time. There is a club and organization for seriously everything. So easy to get involved.",
            "Really any. Just find your place on campus and go with that crowd.",
            "The graveyard is actually very beautiful and cool (and no I'm not morbid). The history is amazing. The Old Well and defending it from Duke is a tradition. The finals libraries raves or the Holy Moli festival all draw a diverse crowd.",
            "The cheap price with the tradition are unmatched.",
            "Go to a basketball game. Tailgate and go to a football game. Join a club. Walk around campus or Franklin street. Go to the gym. Go to a fraternity party. Anything is great and the sports and nightlife are amazing",
            "The cafeteria is meh okay. Then again I am a food snob who wasn't raised on mass quantity meals. The other options like Chick-fil-a are awesome and if you live in Granville the Agora is pretty good with only a small number of students and more options. If you go Greek (aka join a fraternity or sorority) you get a private chef to prepare your meals and skip the campus food plan. The food in sororities and fraternities is unmatched and better than most restaurants.",
            "Granville is the best deal. For $70 more a year you get the chance to bring a car, a swimming pool, your own cafeteria and gym that other dorm kids don't get. It is Greek oriented so if you are going to join a sorority or fraternity it is a must. The other dorms are okay and you get the freshmen experience, but the convenience of Granville and the proximity makes it a must",
            "It is hard. Big classes, professors who don't give leeway and strict grading criteria are part of the game. Work hard and it pays off though.",
            "Volunteer. Make sure you do activities related to your future studies, Job shadow, get involved in research. Make yourself stand out!",
            "UNC is a tradition. It gives you an amazing feeling knowing you are part of something so big. The basketball games, world renowned professors, architecture, and overall beauty are unmatched by any college in the world."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29271=You do a lot of studying for the test, meaning you cram as much information as possible into your head for exams and to get homework done, but it's so much information in a short period of time that you don't remember much of it in the long run. I personally don't feel like I will graduate a well-rounded person with knowledge of many subjects, because the constant onslaught of new info makes it impossible to remember any past info. Plus you don't get a whole ton of real-world experience unless you're wanting to go into science or a research-heavy field (e.g. history). My biggest issue is that the there are so many gen ed credits you have to take. I know all colleges have them, but UNC's are ridiculous (2 Englishes, 2 Maths, 2 Sciences plus 1 Lab, up to level 4 in Foreign Language, 1 Lifetime Fitness 1 Experiential Education, 1 US Diversity, 3 Social Sciences, 1 Literary Arts, 1 Visual and Performing Arts, 1 Philosophical and Moral Reasoning, 1 Word Before 1790, 1 Beyond the North Atlantic, 1 Global Issues) so if you have no interest whatsoever in a class it makes it difficult to stay motivated. By the time you get to college, you know what your general strengths and weaknesses are, so (for example) having to take 2 sciences when you know you struggle with science is miserable. Moreover, some labs like chemistry or biology are about 4 hours long but you only receive one credit hour for it and have a separate exam for it - how does that make sense? This is especially frustrating in light of the fact that you're being forced to spend all that time in lab if you may not want to take it in the first place. However, if you want to learn skills like how to succeed in an interview or to build a resume, their career services is VERY helpful and work with you a lot. All these things considered, I am still only a freshman and so can't really know if you start learning more/learning more practical skills when you start taking upper-level courses. Also, the teachers tend to be very caring and want to help you as much as they can, even if it's a huge lecture class and their only exposure to you is through office hours. Many classes are taught by TAs though, and I've only heard of maybe 2 or 3 good TAs - most people hate theirs and say they are awful teachers., 164681=We protect the old well from NC state students trying to mess with it before football games. Everyone rushes Franklin on Halloween, and at the beginning of the year when the clubs are being advertised. LDOC-Last day of classes means there will be so many parties. Also we rave in Davis Library in huge numbers on Dec 9th., 13579=Set in a small town not far from just about everything, there isn't much not to love about UNC. If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of classes and academic life, just relax on the beautiful and historic campus of the nation's oldest public institution, head to Franklin street for the typical college town experience, or catch a free bus ride to nearby Carrboro and relax in the Bohemian city center. There's also never a shortage of things to do on campus, as students can watch the 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball champions for free in the Dean Dome, meet like-minded people in student organizations, or watch a movie in the student union., 816178=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2663=The great academics are one major plus, but the social scene makes this the ideal college environment! Located in a safe community, this University has everything an undergraduate could ask for. Local places to eat, entertaining attractions, and a world renowned area (Franklin st.) that is home to some of the university's biggest celebrations (i.e: the celebrations of the 2009 NCAA Basketball championship & the 2008 presidential election). It is also a short distance from Durham, home of the famous Minor League Durham Bulls and Raleigh, the states capital! No matter the day of the week, the University of North Carolina is very enjoyable for its students!, 170715=Students who love sex. UNC was rated #1 for the best sex life for Playboy in 2012., 201348=The University of North Carolina is required by state law to admit North Carolina residents as 82% of their prospective feshman class (a fact you wont find on their admissions website). They only accepted 800 out-of-state students in their freshman class of 2013 (from over 20,000 out-of-state applicants). So, unless you're a North Carolina resident, getting in to this school is more competitive than most Ivy League schools!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I have personally learned a great deal in all of my classes taken thus far. Difficult courses like Chemistry 101 and Latin (the hardest in the Classics dept.) have not been a walk in the park, but I've found that I tend to come out of those classes knowing more because they required more out of me! Yet all the courses I have taken have been enriching in their own way, and I have not had a single bad professor yet; everyone is different and gets along differently with others, but I feel that each of the staff at UNC Chapel Hill is easy to get along with when you show an interest in their subject and a willingness to succeed. This, for me, creates the ideal learning environment.
