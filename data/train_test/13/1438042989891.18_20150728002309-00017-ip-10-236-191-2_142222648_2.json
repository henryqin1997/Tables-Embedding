On the team side, it's no surprise to see The Brown Zone taking the top score for the week, followed by Bike Trip and then series first overall Sisters and Misters. Local San Jose Bike Club was fourth. In the men's division, it was a Brown Zone 1-3 as Eric Wohlberg finished in less then 1:12 and Rich Brown was third not more than a minute later.
