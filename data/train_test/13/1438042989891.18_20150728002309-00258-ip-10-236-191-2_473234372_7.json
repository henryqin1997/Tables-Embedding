It is intended that the following claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and apparatus within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby. FIG. 2 illustrates the processing of the nested interface. At step 202, a determination is made as to whether the interface has been set up to be tested. If not, the object of the interface executes normal processing. Otherwise, the interface causes the exception (or exceptions, if so set up) for which the interface has been set up to cause. In particular, at step 106, the component in which the interface to be tested is nested is called. At step 108, it is determined if the component properly handled the exception raised by the nested interface. FIGS. 1 and 2 summarize the operation of an embodiment of the white box testing method described. Referring first to FIG. 1, at step 102 the setup function is executed. Executing the setup function sets up the interface to be tested to raise an exception when the interface is later executed. At step 104, test code is executed. FIG. 1A shows step 104 in greater detail. __________________________________________________________________________Test Case Code Code Under Test Operating System__________________________________________________________________________/*Normal I/O operation*/do-- normal-- read( ); (1)=> file I/O code checks if OSError",
