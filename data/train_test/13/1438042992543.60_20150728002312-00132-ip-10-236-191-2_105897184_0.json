Since the data from that game was not made available through Gameday, most of the players were minor leaguers, and the numbers were not even included on players\u2019 overall stat lines at MLB.com, they aren\u2019t represented in the graphs here either., 41845=Lohse relies on his slider often, throwing it roughly 20% of the time over the course of his career. In his tenure with the Cardinals, it had been a plus pitch (0.65 runs/100 pitches in 2008 and 1.06 runs/100 pitches in 2009) until it fell to -1.77 runs/100 pitches in 2010. This isn\u2019t to say that he\u2019s never struggled with the pitch before \u2013 it had negative run values in 2003, 2005, and 2006 \u2013 but none were as damaging as pre-surgery (forearm) last season., 33313=La Russa initially claimed 6-7 arms were in the fifth starter competition; however, two of those, P.J. Walters and Adam Ottavino, were optioned out of major-league camp Friday. Prospect Brandon Dickson remains after laboring through a three-inning appearance March 8 against the Boston Red Sox.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Since McClellan seems to be the leader for the 5th starter spot I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at his repertoire and see how if might lend itself to starting. \u00a0The robot already did a piece that covers a lot of similar ground, but hopefully there will be a few new nuggets of info in this piece. \u00a0What type of arsenal would lend itself to starting? \u00a0Conventional wisdom would say that he needs enough variety to get through a batting order multiple times, so I\u2019ll continue assuming that is what we are looking for evidence of. \u00a0Looking at McClellan\u2019s pitcher card at Joe Lefkowitz\u2019s site, it appears that McClellan has 4 fairly distinct pitches, a Fastball, Cutter/Slider, Curveball, and Change-Up. \u00a0On it\u2019s face, that would likely be enough to start. \u00a0In fact if you look at the other Cardinals starters they all have 4ish pitches as well. \u00a0Just having four pitches is not the end of the story though. \u00a0How frequently he deploys each pitch, as a proxy for how confident he is in each, is also an interesting data point. \u00a0The following table looks at pitch utilization for Cardinals starters from last season as well as McClellan. \u00a0Data is BIS data from Fangraphs Image by BattlefieldPortraits.com via Flickr",
    "textAfterTable": "The thing that stands out to me is McClellan\u2019s reliance on two primary pitches. \u00a0Clearly some of that is a function of being utilized out of the bullpen and not needing to vary the arsenal as much as he will as a starter. \u00a0I\u2019m not doubting his ability to make said adjustments, just looking at the current factual data. \u00a0It would be interesting to get similar breakouts for his stints as a Spring Training starter. \u00a0That said, the rest of the Cardinals staff relies fairly heavily on two pitches too. \u00a0The following table summarizes and adds an MLB starter average Name Primary Secondary 1st two Brad Penny 47% 29% 76% Chris Carpenter 49% 27% 76% Kyle McClellan 60% 23% 83% Adam Wainwright 46% 29% 75% Jake Westbrook 68% 16% 84% Jaime Garcia 56% 20% 75% Kyle Lohse 59% 19% 78% Jeff Suppan 61% 14% 75% MLB qualified SP 58% 19% 77% So while K-Mac used a 2 pitch heavy arsenal out of the bullpen, it doesn\u2019t appear that his usage patterns are that far off from other starters. \u00a0 In addition to using having and using 4 pitches, there is clearly still the issue of quality. \u00a0Using Fangraphs pitch value calculations McClellan has been average or better with the majority of his\u00a0pitch\u00a0types over the last three seasons. \u00a0All in all it",
