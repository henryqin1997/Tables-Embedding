    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{31334=I was born and raised in large a Michigan county which probably swings at least 2/3 Republican in any election. My extended family is fairly large; uncles, aunts and cousins almost uniformly Republican, almost uniformly \"conservative Christians.\" I found out at an impromptu \"reunion\" last summer (August 2010) that they are actually uniform/unanimous on ONE subject: They are really embarrassed by Sarah Palin. My informal polling resulted in not one positive comment about Ms. Wasilla. I wasn't surprised, but I was very, very pleased -- and relieved., 27642=Republicans may hate Jimmy Carter but there look to be a pretty meaningful percentage of them who don't hate him enough to vote to put Ronald Reagan in the White House. When you combine that with his complete lack of appeal to Democrats and independents he looks virtually unelectable for 1980., 42634=\"a 90% approval rating from the people\" If that were ever true, she sure lost that fast. She's quite unpopular in AK now. \"She will have the chicago machine marxist stuttering his infamous \"uuhh uuuhh\"s in the first 5 minutes of a presidential debate.\" That's certainly not the Palin who got owned by Biden in 2008., 44120=I'm an under 30 Republican who has voted in every election in which I was eligible. Maybe it's because of my age, maybe it's becuase I'm from New England, or maybe it's because most of my family is made up of Democrats- but regardless of the reason, I consider myself a moderate. I strongly dislike Obama and think his policies are wrong for our country, but there is absolutely zero chance I would vote for Sarah Palin over Barack Obama. It isn't that she is more socially conservative than I am- which she is; I would almost certainly vote for any of the other potential names being thrown about over Obama even if I disagreed with some of their positions. While I agree with many in the GOP that Sarah has energized aspects of our party's base and that she is often treated unfairly by the media, that does not change my opinion that she lacks the intelligence and the capacity to understand sophisticated issues necessary to be the leader of the Free World. I may hate Obama, and the thought of voting for him may make me a bit queasy, but the thought of Sarah Palin in charge of the nuclear football is a proposition that is far worse to me. The GOP would be committing electoral suicide by nominating her in 2012. There are several other candidates who share many of her values and her positions that would be more electable than she is. Many of these candidates would also not cause the same negative passions that the mention of Sarah Palin's name elicits. Many in the GOP like Sarah Palin precisely because she is so hated by the left; however, what these people fail to realize is that her sucessful primary candidacy would actually be a a setback to the conservative agenda.}",

As a 20 year old who interacts with many Republicans between the ages of 18 & 30, I can tell you that Sarah Palin is extremely unpopular in this group. I wouldn't say she is viewed as too liberal or too conservative by this group, but just as a bad candidate who isn't intelligent or politically astute enough to be president. Many have told me that if Palin is the nominee, they will not vote for her, so these numbers are no surprise. December 8, 2010 at 1:44 PM",
