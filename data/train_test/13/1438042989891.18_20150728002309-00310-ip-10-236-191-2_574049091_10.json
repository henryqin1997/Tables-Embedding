            "god i'm really stuck! anyone know a manga called Kiichi!!? i've been looking for the raws since forever, i used every site/system/irc i know of but the only place i could get that is yesasia.com or amazon.co.jp now the problem is: A few times before i ordered from yesasia and they tend to send other stuff intead of the indicated item! Or it takes a whole month for them to actually obtain the item. as for amazon.co.jp it's simply a rip off for me...i live in kuwait which means i need to first get the item to go to the U.S. using EMS shipping then get it from the U.S. to kuwait using Aramex shipping, that and i must tell you as i have beared it alot of time is a TOTAL RIP OFF i pay like %150 extra for shipping, the item itself is cheap. heck i'm even considering traveking to get my whole Raw wanted list....and it's all rare to find on the internet, i am not looking for them to scanlate, i want to add them to my humble collection... Phew...um...help? ________________",

Which is why I say Yesasia because if you buy enough at once (and I do) you get free shipping. But since we're on the topic of raws, anyone know where I might be able to get this month's Ribon's magazine? I wanna scanlate Haruta Nana's new series Chocolate Cosmos and the oneshot Love Log, but I couldn't find it on eBay. Might have to ask my friend to see if it's in a shop for me..."
