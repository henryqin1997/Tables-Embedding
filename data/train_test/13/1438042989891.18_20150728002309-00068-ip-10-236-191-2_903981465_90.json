            "Fairly safe; I've never felt unsafe on campus. DPS (Department of Public Safety) is always patrolling at night. There are blue lights every few blocks that you can press for help.",
            "Greek life is HUGE. A large majority of campus is involved in Greek life--social, professional, or academic. It may not be for everyone, and you definitely will not feel left out if you're not in one.",
            "There are plenty, you just have to get out and explore!",
            "If you like to thrift, try Boom Babies on Westcott!",
            "I don't know about unusual, but there is a cemetery that you pass by when you travel between North and South campus.",
            "I gave it an average rating because it is what you make of it. You can attend every event and make it worth the money that you are paying, or decide not to attend. Events hosted by organizations have all been prepaid by your student activities fee. So what's the harm?",
            "Marshall Street, Westcott, Downtown!",
            "The food may be great at first, but after eating the same meals for a year, it does become tiring. This is the same everywhere though. Shaw has the best dining, in my opinion, and usually not as crowded as the most popular Ernie Davis. There is also Marshall Street which has stores such as Chipotle, Bleu Monkey (Japanese), Mok Hwa (Korean), Funk n' Waffles, etc.",
            "We do not call the place we live in dorms, but rather, residence halls since they are not only a place for students to sleep. We have Learning Communities based on various student interests, like Fashion or Health, separated by floors. These are similar to interest groups and students meet regularly to discuss topics in these areas.",
            "This depends on your classes, some are easy and some are hard. In the end, it is all about the amount of effort you put into it. If you work hard, it is not difficult to get an A (A+ grade does not exist).",
            "Definitely attend general interest meetings held by different student organizations! There are so many on campus, and you never know what may interest you.",
            "Syracuse has diverse majors and boasts some of the top schools (major-wise) in the nations--for example, Newhouse School of Public Communications, School of Information Studies, Architecture. The college campus is very scenic and all the academic buildings are within a short walk. It can get very cold in the wintertime, so be ready to bundle up!"

Great sports (except football), but nobody wants to be outside doing anything from November until April because all it does is snow. If you are an outdoors lover, Syracuse is not the place for you., 654471=Everything. There is always something going on. Be it a speaker, a large event, a sports game, a march, a gathering, a movie. There is always something., 194456=The greek life is amazing. If you are interested, rush is a great experience for both girls and guys even if you choose not to pledge. There are 20+ fraternities and 11 sororities as of May 2013. Being in a sorority is a great way to get to know people, to do volunteer services and to get connected., 325753=While Syracuse is the most expensive school I applied to I feel like it is worth it. I am getting a great education and having the time of my life. If I could go back to April 2010 when I was making my decision again I wouldn't do anything differently., 1359=- Plenty of students find SU to be the right fit for them socially and academically, but not financially. Make sure you feel fiscally comfortable with the choice. - Find a club -- and find one early! You will make invaluable friendships in a common interest activity, which can often help not only socially but academically too! - Winter approaches near the end of October, and won't quit often until March or April. Make sure you're comfortable with the climate, and although it gets only moderately cold, the snow really piles up. - Student employment opportunities vary -- foodservice to restaurants, clerical to tutoring. They disappear quickly, so apply ASAP! - If you don't like the color orange, SU may not be right for you., 85921=-For the first few months, food is great. There is a lot of variety in the dinning halls, however, the downside is how early dinning halls close (8:30 pm) in addition to their repetitiveness every week. There are other places to eat (i.e. Pizza Hut, The Varsity, Subway, etc.) off campus., 647675=Mayfest happens at the end of every April. It is so much fun. Everyone has would be outside playing games. There is music coming from all directions and there is a concert held later that day., 779193=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 235377=Syracuse University has a very distinct atmosphere: it is very inviting, yet allows you to feel free in your individuality. Twenty inches of snow is common so snow days are basically non-existent; in order words, don't expect classes to be cancelled during the wintery months of October through March. SU will more than likely have this pull on you that will make you miss it when it is time to vacate for the breaks., 243729=It's 5:47, AND GEORGETOWN STILL SUCKS., 249608=Kissing bench, It's 08:24 and georgetown still sucks., 234809=When moving-in in August, bring a standard size fan. The dorms are not air-conditioned and the sun is working overtime to compensate for the long vay-cay starting in late October, early November. When preparing to trek through piles of slippery, icy snow, invest in a sturdy, reliable, thermo-lite pair of snow boots. Those boots will be as important as your laptop. Please buy some., 384366=The dorms at SU are terrible especially since the dorm fees are expensive. The best 2 dorms to live at are Lawrinson Hall and Ernie Davis Hall. Ernie Davis was completed in 2010 and is the newest dorm on campus. It is also the only dorm on campus that has air conditioning. Lawrinson Hall is the tallest dorm on campus. It has 20 floors and a pent house. The location of lawrinson is not that great but the building makes up for it because all of the floors and rooms are renovated with new carpets and new furniture. There is also a laundry room on each floor at both ernie davis and lawrinson unlike at any of the other dorms. The worst dorm on campus is delplain hall., 375931=A lot of hills! May seem awkward., 87824=1. Come with an open mind! College is a completely different experience and should be looked at as such. 2. Don't be nervous or scared because we were all in the same position once 3.When in doubt....just ask! 4. Get involved early! There are several clubs and student organizations that will most likely have what you are interested in! 5. Meet upperclassmen: they can help! 6. Befriend your professors and TA's! It will pay off! 7. Be sure to go to class! No one will be around to tell you to do so, and when you don't your grade will be affected! 8. Get ready for the winter! It gets pretty cold around October until mid April or May 9. Be prepared to witness a lot of school spirit! 10. Most of all, enjoy your first year! You will love all of your new experiences here at Syracuse, so make the most of them!, 739954=Food is average. You can often find people complaining, but it is really not that bad. Plenty of options. Most dining halls stay open till 7:30 but Ernie Davis stays open till 9!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Syracuse's classes are absolutely fantastic. They have so many classes in so many different majors and almost all the Professors really know what they're talking about and genuinely seem to care about their students. I've only been at SU for a year but I feel like I am really getting prepared everyday to enter the work force.

Great for student with lots of school spirit and students who want to be involved. Tips for prospective students Do not just pick a school because of reviews.
