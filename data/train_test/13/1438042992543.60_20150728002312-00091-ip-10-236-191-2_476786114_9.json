When a resist is formed to have a thickness of 500 nm, an amount of the resist reaching the element upon addition of impurities is small as compared with that added to the first impurity region. In this embodiment, the resist is formed to have a thickness of 1000 nm.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{85339=In a previous process, P is added to the high-concentration p-type impurity region and the low-concentration p-type impurity region such that the high-concentration p-type impurity region contains P in concentration of 1\ufffd1020 to 1\ufffd1021 atomic/cm3 and the low-concentration p-type impurity region contains P in concentration of 1\ufffd1016 to 1\ufffd1019 atomic/cm3, but there has never been caused any problem since a concentration of boron (B) added in this process is made 1.5 to 3 times the concentration of P to have the regions functioning as a source region and a drain region of a p-channel type TFT., 58584=On the other hand, the silicon nitride film in TABLE 1 is formed by using silicon as a target, and deposition gases and flowrates are N2:Ar=20:20 sccm. Also, a deposition gas pressure was 0.4 Pa, a deposition power being 0.8 kW with an RF power source and a circular target having a radius of 6 inch., 76343=Also, measures for removing the catalyst element include measures utilizing a gettering action produced by phosphorus (P). At this time, P is added in doping to a region, in which Ni is to be segregated. In order to favorably perform gettering with P, 1.5\ufffd1020 atomic/cm3 or more is preferable. In addition to phosphorus (P), it is possible to make use of measures, which utilize a gettering action produced by argon (Ar). For example, argon (Ar) of 1\ufffd1020 atomic/cm3 or more is added to a region, in which the catalyst element is to be segregated. Measures for addition of argon (Ar) include, in addition to accelerated impregnation by way of doping, a method, in which argon (Ar) is used as a sputtering gas to form the region by means of sputtering deposition of silicon. The region, to which argon (Ar) is added, may contain phosphorus (P). After formation of the region, in which Ni is to be segregated, thermal annealing can be used for gettering of the catalyst element to the region, in which Ni is to be segregated., 84310=Then a high-concentration p-type impurity region, which defines a source region and a drain region, is formed on the island-shaped semiconductor layer, which forms a p-channel type TFT. Here, an impurity element applying a p-type is added as the gate electrode mask to form a high-concentration p-type impurity region in a self-aligned manner. The impurity region as formed is formed by means of the ion doping method making use of diborane (B2H6). Further, the high-concentration p-type impurity region not overlapping the gate electrode is made to have a boron concentration of 3\ufffd1020 to 3\ufffd1021 atomic/cm3. Also, since an impurity element is added through the gate insulating film and the first gate electrode to an impurity region that overlaps the first gate electrode, the impurity region is formed substantially as a low-concentration p-type impurity region to have a concentration of 1.5\ufffd1019 atomic/cm3 or more., 57999=The silicon oxynitride film in TABLE 1 is formed by using silicon as a target. and deposition gases and flowrates are N2:H2:N2O=31:5:4 sccm. Also, the deposition gas pressure of N2O was 0.4 Pa, a deposition power being 3 kW with an RF power source and a circular target having a radius of 12 inch. While the deposition gas had a flowrate of 4 sccm, a resulting film can be varied in properties by having oxygen flowing in place of N2O or varying a ratio of flowrate of respective deposition gases., 61393=The silicon nitride is formed by the sputtering method. Silicon is used as a target, and deposition gases and flowrates are N2:Ar=20:0 sccm. At this point, in order to maintain a constant temperature of the substrate, heated Ar is flowed on the surface of the substrate at 20 sccm. Also, a deposition gas pressure was 0.8 Pa, a deposition power being 3 kW with an RF power source and a circular target having a radius of 12 inch., 88771=Thereafter, a silicon oxide film, silicon nitride film, or a silicon oxynitride film is deposited to form a third interlayer insulating film 604 by means of the sputtering method. In this embodiment, a silicon nitride film is formed on the third interlayer insulating film to have a thickness of around 100 nm. Silicon is used as a target with deposition gas and the flowrates being N2:H2:N2O=31:5:4 sccm. Also, a deposition gas pressure is 0.4 Pa, a deposition power being 3 kW from an RF power source with the use of a circular-shaped target having a radius of 12 inch., 60002=Deposition of the silicon oxynitride film was made in the order of 100 nm in thickness. Silicon was used as a target, and deposition gases and flowrates are N2:H2:N2O=31:5:4 sccm. Also, a deposition gas pressure was 0.4 Pa, a deposition power being 3 kW with an RF power source and a circular target having a radius of 12 inch.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets Thus an inorganic insulating film or a carbon film is formed on an interlayer insulating film comprising an organic material to thereby enable preventing oxygen and moisture from entering a side of a light emitting element from a side of the interlayer insulating film and deterioration of the light emitting element. Also, it is also possible to prevent mobile ions from being dispersed toward a TFT from the light emitting element thus enabling suppressing variation in the threshold value of the TFT. These make it possible to suppress generation of dark spots in the light emitting element and deterioration of luminance and to enhance reliability of a TFT. A light emitting element having less dark spots and less deterioration can be formed on an organic resin substrate. . FIG. 9 Note that for cases in which the voltage applied to the light emitting element is 10 V or less, preferably equal to or less than 5 V, there is almost no problem of degradation due to the above hot carrier effect, and therefore an n-channel TFT having a structure in which the LDD region 4509 is omitted may also be used in . In particular, the capacitance of the storage capacitor may be smaller for a case of operating the EL display device by a digital driving method than for a case of an analog driving method operation, and therefore the",
