But at the same time, this is as good an outlet as any for the fan base to make its feelings known. A lot of us appreciate having a forum to express our displeasure \u2026 especially since I suspect that some of that displeasure makes its way to the front office, given the high visibility of Mark's web site.To be honest, I find it encouraging that the Nats are developing an engaged, passionate fan base that blows a gasket about lineup decisions for a late July afternoon game in Ohio. I doubt there were many conversations like this going on in 2006 and 2007.Also, it appears we're lighting a fire under the guys today, at least so far!, 53683=What a bunch of whiners! Hello?? We're in the midst of a 24-day stretch with 23 games. Everyone sweat gallons of perspiration last night. Today is a day game in July following the night game.As Todd Boss pointed out: Willingham, Desmond and Pudge == righty only hitters with bad splits.Kennedy, Harris and Guzman == lefty or switch hitters.So, this lineup seems pretty logical, and, actually, fairly smart by Riggs. The righties get to rest against a righty on a day game in the midst a big stretch.But, no . . . the commenters here think only short term: what have you done for me lately, and why aren't the best players playing today, with no thought of the rest of the season.Yes, I agree with a number of others . . . sometimes these comments get pretty predictable., 27445=Knox, looked into Morse. broke into bigs in 2005 and went down with shoulder injury beginning of 2007 game back late 2008 and traded to us last year for Langerhans (thank god hes gone). He also jumped around from infield to outfield, I agree his is clutch late inning hitter as it has been proven time and time again this year. My point is our season is over so lets see what we got for next year. Harris is a career .242 hitter and hitting .182 this year. Maybe Morse is the next Jason Werth. The only reason for playing Harris in my opinion is if they are trying to package him in a trade., 72929=Hey Anon? Do you have a name?Dear Mr. Know-it-All, get your facts straight please?Which facts didn't I have right?And you ignored this part of what I wrote: We're in the midst of a 24-day stretch with 23 games. Everyone sweat gallons of perspiration last night. Today is a day game in July following the night game.So, Mr Manager who do you rest and who do you put in?Gee, how about right handed guys who have been playing almost every day this season? And how about replace them with some lefties? Just for one day.This isn't rocket science.As for trashing Guz specifically \u2014 as noted above, he's fourth in OBP amongst regulars on the team. And his fielding? His UZR numbers at 2B ain't great, but they are higher than Kennedy's., 83905=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

But he hasn't impressed me one bit this week.\"Two words: bone chips., 44416=Dave-Can't speak for others, but every time I heard someone make the slightest negative comment about Zimm during his June slide, I was hear defending him and singing his praises to the heavens. And it happened a lot in June. Same thing goes for those who undervalue Hammer, which happens quite a bit.I'll repeat the positive and the negative. I'm an equal opportunity regurgitator.}",
