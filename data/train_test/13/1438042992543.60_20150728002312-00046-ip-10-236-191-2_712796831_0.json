            "Sony's Corporate Governance Practices",
            "Sony has adopted the \"Company with Three Committees\" system under the Companies Act. Sony's Charter of the Board of Directors (attached as an exhibit 1.3 to this report) requires its board to consist of between 10 to 20 directors. The Companies Act does not require Sony to have a majority of \"independent\" (in the meaning given by the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards) directors on its board; rather, it requires Sony to have a majority of \"outside\" directors (the definition of the term \"outside\" director is summarized below) on each of three statutory committees (the Nominating Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee).",
            "\"Outside\" director is defined in the Companies Act as a person who satisfies all of the requirements (i) through (v) below: (i) a person who is not a director of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries engaged in the business operations of Sony Corporation or such subsidiaries, as the case may be, or a Corporate Executive Officer or general manager or other employee (\"Group Executive Director, etc.\") of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries and who has not been a Group Executive Director, etc. of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for ten years prior to assuming his/her office; (ii) if a person who has been a director, accounting counselor or corporate auditor of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries (excluding a person who has been a Group Executive Director, etc.) at the time within ten years prior to assuming his/her office, a person who has not been a Group Executive Director, etc. of Sony Corporation or any of its subsidiaries for ten years prior to assuming his/her office as a director, an accounting counselor, or a corporate auditor; (iii) a person who is not a director or a Corporate Executive Officer or general manager or other employee of a parent company or any entity which controls the management of Sony Corporation; (iv) a person who is not a Group Executive Director, etc. of a direct/indirect subsidiary of Sony Corporation or any entity the management of which is directly or indirectly controlled by Sony Corporation; and (v) a person who is not a spouse or relative within the second degree of kinship of a director or a Corporate Executive Officer or general manager or other employee of Sony Corporation. Under the Companies Act, a director's status as an \"outside\" director is unaffected by the director's compensation, his or her affiliation with business partners, or the board's affirmative determination of independence. On the other hand, under the Companies Act, a director who has had a career as a management director, corporate executive officer, or other employee of the company, its subsidiaries or other group companies is by definition not an \"outside\" director. Sony's Charter of the Board of Directors includes a provision requiring that each \"outside\" director: (i) Shall not have received directly from Sony Group, during any consecutive 12-month period within the last three years, more than an amount equivalent to 120,000 U.S. dollars, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service); (ii) Shall not be a director, a statutory auditor, a corporate executive officer, a general manager or other employee of any company whose aggregate amount of transactions with Sony Group, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of an amount equivalent to 1,000,000 U.S. dollars, or 2 percent of the annual consolidated sales of such company; and (iii) Shall not be, or shall not have been, a director engaged in the business operation, a corporate executive officer, an accounting counselor, a general manager or other employee of Sony or its subsidiaries*. (* This provision of the Charter is based on the definition of \"outside\" director under the Companies Act.) In addition, the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange require Sony to make efforts to have at least one \"Independent Director\" on the Board of Directors. \"Independent Director\" is defined in the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange as an \"outside\" director who is unlikely to have conflicts of interest with shareholders. According to the guidelines of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, if a person falls in any of the categories listed below, such person, in principle, will be considered to have a conflict of interest with shareholders of the listed company. (1) A person for which the listed company is a major client or a person who executes business of a person for which the listed company is a major client; (2) A major client of the listed company or a person who executes business of a major client of the listed company; (3) A consultant, accounting professional, or legal professional (or, if such consultant, accounting professional, or legal professional is a juridical person, a member of such juridical person) of the listed company who receives a large amount of money or other consideration other than remuneration for directorship/auditorship from such listed company; (4) A person who has fallen in any of categories (a) through (d) listed below until recently: (a) A person who falls in any of (1) through (3) listed above; (b) A person who executes business of a parent company of the listed company or a director who does not execute business of a parent company of the listed company; (c) A corporate auditor of a parent company of the listed company; or (d) A person who executes business of a fellow subsidiary of the listed company. (5) A close relative of a person who falls in any of categories (a) through (h) listed below (only if such person is significant): (a) A person who falls in any of (1) through (4) listed above; (b) An accounting counselor of the listed company; (c) A person who executes business of a subsidiary of the listed company; (d) A director who does not execute business of a subsidiary of the listed company or an accounting counselor of a subsidiary of the listed company; (e) A person who executes business of a parent company of the listed company or a director who does not execute business of a parent company of the listed company; (f) A corporate auditor of a parent company of the listed company; (g) A person who executes business of a fellow subsidiary of the listed company; or (h) A person who has fallen in any of categories (b) through (d) listed above or a person who has executed business of the listed company until recently. As of June 23, 2015, 9 of the 12 members of Sony's Board of Directors qualified as \"outside\" directors. In addition, all 9 \"outside\" directors are qualified and designated as \"Independent Directors\" under the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.",
            "An \"outside\" director, as defined under the Companies Act, is equivalent to a \"non-management director\" under the NYSE rules because an \"outside\" director does not engage in the execution of business operations of the company. Neither the Companies Act nor Sony's Charter of the Board of Directors requires non-management directors to meet regularly without management and nothing requires outside directors to meet alone in an executive session at least once a year.",
            "Sony's Nominating Committee consists of at least three directors. Under the Companies Act, the Committee is responsible for determining the contents of proposals regarding the appointment and dismissal of directors to be submitted for approval to the shareholders' meeting. Unlike listed U.S. companies under NYSE rules, it is not responsible for developing governance guidelines or overseeing the evaluation of the board and management. Under the Companies Act, a majority of its members must be \"outside\" directors, as defined under the Companies Act. Sony's Charter of the Board of Directors requires at least one of the directors on the Committee to be a corporate executive officer.",
            "Sony's Compensation Committee consists of at least three directors. Under the Companies Act, a majority of its members must be \"outside\" directors, as defined under the Companies Act. Sony's Charter of the Board of Directors recommends that at least one of the directors on the Committee be a corporate executive officer. The Charter prohibits the CEO and/or the COO (or a person at any equivalent position) from serving on the Compensation Committee. Under the Companies Act, the Committee is responsible for, among others, determining the compensation of each director and corporate executive officer.",
            "Sony's Audit Committee consists of at least three directors. Under the Companies Act, a majority of its members must be \"outside\" directors, as defined under the Companies Act. In addition, pursuant to the Companies Act, no member of the Committee shall be a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries who is engaged in the business operations of the company or such subsidiary, as the case may be, or a corporate executive officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries, or an accounting counselor, general manager or other employee of any of such subsidiaries. Sony's Charter of the Board of Directors also requires each member of the Audit Committee to meet the independence requirements of the applicable U.S. securities laws and regulations, and requires at least one member to meet the audit committee financial expert requirements. Currently, all the members of Sony's Audit Committee are also \"independent\" as defined in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards, and two members of the Committee are qualified as audit committee financial experts. Sony's Charter of the Board of Directors discourages any Audit Committee member from concurrently being a member of other Committees.",
            "Under the Companies Act, if Sony wishes to adopt an equity compensation plan under which stock acquisition rights are granted on specially favorable conditions, except where all of its shareholders are granted rights to subscribe for such stock acquisition rights or such stock acquisition rights are gratuitously allocated to all of its shareholders, each on a pro rata basis, then Sony must obtain shareholder approval by a \"special resolution\" of a general meeting of shareholders, where the quorum is one-third of the total number of voting rights of all of its shareholders and the approval by at least two-thirds of the number of voting rights of all the shareholders represented at the meeting is required under Sony's Articles of Incorporation.",
            "Sony is required to disclose the status of its corporate governance under the Companies Act, Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related regulations, and the Securities Listing Regulations of the Tokyo Stock Exchange; however, Sony does not have corporate governance guidelines that cover all the requirements described in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards, as many of the provisions do not apply to Sony. Details of the status are posted on the following website: Internal Control",
            "Although this provision of the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards does not apply to Sony, Sony has adopted a code of conduct to be observed by all its directors, officers and other employees. The code of conduct is available at Sony Group Code of Conduct The code's content covers principal items described in the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards."
