            "I feel safe 100% of the time here. Take precautions though. Do not feel invincible but do not worry all the time. Do not travel alone at night, do not do anything you would not do at home; (i.e not locking your door)",
            "Go to Sparticipation and Spartan Remix during Welcome Week! They are great ways to meet new people and see what MSU has to offer.",
            "I have movie nights with friends, go eat at a local restaurant, go shop at the malls, visit other friends and stay in their dorms, go to the movie theater. There is plenty to do in East Lansing.",
            "The food is actually delicious! It almost tastes like back home. It is the closest thing to a home cooked meal and there is such variety!",
            "I love staying in the dorms. Friendly environment, plenty of resources available to students who stay on campus compared to those who do not. It is cheaper to stay in the dorms and you have people close to you that you can relate to. If you like the dorm that you stay in, you can reserve it every year.",
            "Make weekdays strictly for studies. There is very little room for error because there is always someone that will surpass you after one small error. Stay focused and keep your eye on the prize. Work hard now so there will be more time for fun and less hard work in the future.",
            "It will get difficult to stay focused at such a big university that seems like it is all about fun. Put away some time to have fun and engage in a social life, but put more time and effort in getting the best grades possible.",
            "Words cannot express how great I feel about attending Michigan State University. I feel no remorse on choosing to come here. Very friendly with a sense of competitiveness with a lot of school spirit! Go Green!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{70649=many different types of dorms are available. some house only 300 students, while others house nearly 1000. about half have community bathrooms for the entire floor, while the other half have suite-style bathrooms shared between two rooms. floors (or at least wings) are typically separated by gender, although coed floors are available. one dorm (yakeley) houses only females. dorms are arranged into complexes which all have at least one cafeteria. some classes are even held in dorm buildings; this is especially common for students in residential academic programs. dorms are constantly being updated and redone to make them pleasant places for students to live. unique residential options are also available in dorms. for example, there are honors floors for honors college students, and quiet floors with special courtesy hours. students can also choose to live in dorms with other students in their major or college. for example, science majors may choose to live in holmes, while political science students may live in case., 337968=I completed 38 credits from spring 2011 to fall 2012 all while working two jobs 40 + hours sometimes and I have a little girl. Let's say at this point I'm burnt out and scholarships would help a lot., 787033=There are many different sororities and fraternities at Michigan State. Greek Week is sometime in September or October and is a great way to meet new people and possibly join a fraternity or sorority., 1027473=MSU is in the process of building/ renovating many of their dining halls on campus. In 2010-2011, they built Brody Cafeteria, which is the largest non-military cafeteria in the world. There are always so many selections, such as, sushi, homestyle cooking, a deli, a dessert bar, a salad bar, stir fry, etc. After building that cafeteria and seeing the success rate, they began remodeling other cafeterias (at least one in each neighborhood) like that as well. The head chef of MSU Culinary Services is constantly striving to be better, despite the rising reviews every year., 69503=every meal plan is unlimited, meaning students can go to the cafeteria as many times as they want. this is especially nice for late-night snack runs and going to the cafe just to socialize. the university is in the process of updating all the cafeterias. three new cafeterias have opened since 2007, and all look similar to a large mall food court. these cafeterias give students many different meal options and are generally better than the other cafeterias. currently the cafeterias in case, brody, and snyder-phillips halls are the best. this section gets three stars because of some of the older cafeterias that have not yet been updated. the new cafeterias would get five stars. regardless of which dorm students call home, they can eat in any cafeteria. students who live off-campus can also purchase smaller meal plans, and eat on campus at their leisure., 180472=It's great. There is food all the way up until 12:00 A.M in some halls!, 1002695=If you are interested in MSU, keep your GPA up and apply early! MSU had over 30K applications and accepted only 8K for the fall of 2012., 1122862=During finals week there is this thing called the Midnight Scream. At 12:00 am every night the students on campus let out a loud scream. This scream is to relieve the stress of finals week., 335993=I'm a non-traditional student trying to complete my first degree so that I can stop working dead end jobs and help to take care of my daughter like a man should. I am a really hard worker. Working two jobs and manage to complete 38 credits without falling below a 3 point is an accomplishment I can live with, in addition I still make the time for my little girl. I would like some assistance to make life a little easier as it is a challenge. I did much of it by myself but I'm no superhero and so now I am asking for help. I have a bill now for over $1800 for this semester., 46431=currently i am enrolled for 14 credits. Monday and Wednesday and Friday i have college algebra from 10:20-11:10 and then on Monday and Wednesday i have Cse101(computer class) from 12:40 to 2:30. my math class is only challenging because i cant understand my teacher, thankfully the book text is really helpful and the online homework, extra practice and so on, really helps me understand the material i don't get in class, and there are reviews for every test. Cse101 is challenging, but I'm glad that it's giving me a broad understanding of Word, Excel, Access, And web design. Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i have Com225 (intro to interpersonal communication) i really like this class, i have it from 10:20 to 11:40 and its taught by 2 professors that are married, steve and kelly. they are so engaging and are really cool and interesting people. then from 12:40 to 2:30 i have ISS210 (society and the individual) i really like the professor in this class too, he's very versed on the information he teaches, but you really have to pay attention to catch everything he says. its not like in highschool where you can just do the work and in the process you'll get the material, you have to be the one to motivate yourself to go to class and listen and thats how you'll understand the material. then i have Yoga from 4:10 to 5:00. 14 credits isn't too overwhelming i would say, its keeps me busy for the first half of the day, then i really have the rest of the day to do all my work and other extra-curricular activities., 171561=Michigan State is going through a remodeling process with many of the dorms around campus so the quality of living is much higher. The building I am living in was remodeled in 2011 and I love it. Most sophomores preferred to live in this building because it was more convenient than living in apartments., 202325=Apply Early! There's nothing better than feeling the stress and anxiety of the college applications process being over. It's also beneficial to you as a student to apply by the first week of November because MSU is really good about responding promptly. I received my acceptance letter within 3 weeks and it was great to know that I am already getting into schools!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students - Live on campus at least your first year (it\u2019s a requirement, unless you live within 50 miles of MSU; however, even these students should live on campus, not commute). Since MSU is so large, this is the best way to \u201cconnect\u201d with the campus. If you don\u2019t, it may be difficult to \u201cfind your place.\u201d - Bring a bike. - Visit campus before you choose to come here. Visit it several times. Talk to friends who go here, ask them questions, and ask them to show you around. - Try not to live in Brody Complex. It\u2019s where most of the freshmen end up, and it is so far removed from campus. In the winter, you\u2019ll probably end up taking the bus rather than walking because it will be so cold. Be mindful that the other complexes, like South Complex (with Holden, etc.) and Hubbard/East Complex, may also be a bit removed from the other complexes, your classes, or all the \u201caction\u201d (shopping, eating, and, yes, partying) on Grand River (though Brody is the most removed). I would recommend living in the West Circle Complex or Red Cedar Complex (with Snyder-Phillips, Mason-Abbot, and, across the river and in the most centralized location on campus, Shaw). (I am personally partial to the Red Cedar Complex; I live in Abbot.) These are along Grand River, are close to many of your classes, and Snyder-Phillips currently houses the best cafeteria on campus,",
