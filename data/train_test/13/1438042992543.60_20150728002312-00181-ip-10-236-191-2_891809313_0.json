It\u2019s by no means comprehensive, but its likely to be all you\u2019ll need to remember (if you need anything else, you can always check the bash manpage \u2026 ) A brief summary of test operators and the string \u201c=\u201d has non zero length. [ -n = ] This will give misleading output since the shell expands our expression to: fi echo \u201cX=Y\u201d if [ $X = $Y ] ; then Y=\u201d\u201d X=\u201d-n\u201d #!/bin/bash  Another potential trap comes from not protecting variables in quotes. We have already given an example as to why you must wrap anything you wish to use for a -n test with quotes. However, there are a lot of good reasons for",
    "textAfterTable": "Loops Loops are constructions that enable one to reiterate a procedure or perform the same procedure on several different items. There are the following kinds of loops available in bash: for loops while loops For loops The syntax for the for loops is best demonstrated by example: #!/bin/bash  for X in red green blue  do  echo $X  done The for loop iterates the loop over the space separated items. Note that if some of the items have embedded spaces, you need to protect them with quotes. Here\u2019s an example: #!/bin/bash  colour1=\u201dred\u201d  colour2=\u201dlight blue\u201d  colour3=\u201ddark green\u201d  for X in \u201c$colour1\u2033 $colour2\u2033 $colour3\u2033  do  echo $X  done  Can you guess what would happen if we left out the quotes in the for statement? This indicates that variable names should be protected with quotes unless you are pretty sure that they do not contain any spaces. Globbing in for loops The shell expands a string containing a * to all filenames that \u201cmatch\u201d. A filename matches if and only if it is identical to the match string after replacing the stars * with arbitrary strings. For example, the character \u201c*\u201d by itself expands to a space separated list of all files in the working directory (excluding those that start with a dot \u201c.\u201d )",
