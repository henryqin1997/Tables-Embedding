    "textBeforeTable": "About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Champion colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Blizzard Champion plastic - it is Champion plastic with thousands of micro bubbles incorporated into it resulting in weights as low as 130 grams. It provides almost the same flight characteristics and superior durability as Champion models in heavier weights. They fly farther with less effort. Discs weighing less than 140 grams float in water. Speed 13, Glide 5, Turn -4, Fade 2 The Innova Blizzard Champion Vulcan is an understable distance driver that was designed with the less powerful disc golf players in mind. The Vulcan flies similarly to the Katana with less low speed fade. (The Katana is less understable or more stable than the Vulcan.) The lower weights are great for longer shots. The Vulcan makes a great first speed 13 driver for beginners. For skilled players, it's a great long turnover driver. It makes a great long range roller too. The Vulcan is high speed with a bunch of turn! Beginner friendly. 21.2 cm diameter. Reviews (0)",
    "textAfterTable": "\"I really like the Vulcan. It lets me throw old school angles with the speed of a new disc! WOW.\" - Ken Climo \"The Vulcan is my go to distance driver for sidearms. If you have good control this should be a good disc for you!\" - Jessica Weese \"Early test results look good for a new long range driver in my bag. I throw it with hyzer & it comes up to flat with a long, straight flight. The Vulcan is great for a less powerful thrower like myself.\" - Alan Beaver If you are looking for a disc with more Fade, try the Katana more Turn, try the Mamba more Glide, try the Groove \u00a0 Other Speed 13 discs include the Ape, Boss, Daedalus, Dominator, Groove and Katana.
