            "Global Business and Markets This is a comprehensive course in global business and markets providing a broad, multidisciplinary understanding of global business. The theoretical context for engaging in international trade is established, with attention to the current economic and political environment. Then the business level rationale and techniques for initiating trade, as well as the functional area decisions that must be made, are discussed. Topics include: cultural differences; international trade; regional economic integration; international monetary system; entry strategies; strategic alliances; exporting and importing; global production and logistics; global marketing.Post cold war political and economic changes have opened up previously closed borders and have reduced barriers to trade. Concurrently, technological developments in communication, information and transportation technologies have enabled faster and better channels for doing business.This change to an outward looking orientation has resulted in an era of increased globalization. The impact of increasing international trade has provided access to new markets, greater interdependence and foreign competition on domestic turf.More firms, large and small, have become adept at selling across borders. Understanding the fundamentals of international trade prepares managers to grasp more aspects of a firm\u2019s business initiatives.Many of the issues that a business encounters in the global context present difficult choices from and economic and profit point of view and also from a human and cultural point of view. The resolution of these issues rarely has a single right answer. The course material will evoke several of these ill-structured problems so students will have a chance to grapple with the complexities the problems present.",
