Now that's not just customer service, that's kindness. The Carpaccio is the best in the city: elegantly dressed with a discreet drizzle of truffle oil and accompanied by peppery micro-greens and Parmigiana-Reggiano, it could be the signature dish. Here, as in all courses at LE CASTAGNE, high cuisine technique merely showcases the values of Italian cooking: fresh products, depth of taste and a clear, sensible \"discussion\" among only 3-4 flavor ingredients per profile. The minestra of the evening, enhanced with sweet sausage, was beyond delicious. The black ink pasta with frutti di mare was like velvet yet with an al dente bite, and the seafood was perfectly cooked in a light saffron broth rounded with a bit of richness from pancetta. The handsome (Italian Modern) room's high ceiling befits a downtown fine dining venue, and tables with crisp linen create a canvas for clean-lined stemware and sleek, curve-handled cutlery. Delicious food, attentive and kindly service, a complete bar, LE CASTAGNE has it all. It brings a higher level of execution to Italian fare in a district well served with very good Italian BYOs. Also, being full service, LE CASTAGNE avoids the onslaught of the \"young and the entitled\" who take over lower price-point BYOs, ordering little more than a salad as an excuse to guzzle their box wine and cackle as though they're \"family\" at Olive Garden. BRAVISSIMO, LE CASTAGNE. My new favorite Italian Restaurant in the Rittenhouse Square district., 10689=Visited in June 2007. While we had reservations, we were told that the only place available was in the bar area. Service was not quick and we waited about 20 minutes for drinks. The appetizer was good, the rolls were cold and hard, and our main course of pasta was hard and crunchy. You could tell it had been plated in advance and then microwaved. To add insult to injury, the pasta came out before the bottle of wine we ordered. We left most of the pasta and just drank the wine. For a total of $178 for 2 people, this was a poor value., 9538=Posted by in heaven on 02/10/2008}",
