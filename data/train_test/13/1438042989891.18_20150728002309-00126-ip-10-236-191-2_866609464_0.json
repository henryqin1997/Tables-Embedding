    "textBeforeTable": "About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Champion colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About Blizzard Champion plastic - it is Champion plastic with thousands of micro bubbles incorporated into it resulting in weights as low as 130 grams. It provides almost the same flight characteristics and superior durability as Champion models in heavier weights. They fly farther with less effort. Discs weighing less than 140 grams float in water. Speed 13, Glide 5, Turn -3, Fade 3 It is great for fast, long, easy distance off the tee and for huge turnover shots. The Innova Blizzard Champion Katana is a distance driver that is straight to slightly overstable. It was built with the finesse thrower in mind. It's a recommended downwind driver. If you hit the angle right, watch it bolt out of sight. The physical characteristics resemble a Boss with flight characteristics of a Sidewinder on steroids. Makes a good roller.

    "textAfterTable": "\"The Champion Katana went right in my bag brand new. I throw it hard, with a slight anhyzer angle, and low. When it hits the ground it skips really far which I like. I also use it for most of my drives into a headwind.\" - Hannah Leatherman \"I love the Blizzard Champion Katana for side arm flick shots. It goes long and super straight.\" - Sandy Gast \"Possibly my favorite out-of-the-box high-speed driver. It takes a while to turn over and glides really well. Recently, this 52 year old 3'd a 780' hole from 45' behind the pin with 2 Pro Katana drives. I'd say the disc works pretty well.\" - Gregg Hosfeld If you are looking for a disc with more Fade, try the Ape more Turn, try the Vulcan more Glide, try the Groove Other Speed 13 discs include the Ape, Boss, Daedalus, Dominator, Groove and Vulcan.
