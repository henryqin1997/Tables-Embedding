If you have questions about your donation, your local Salvation Army Family Store will be happy to help you. The Salvation Army does not set a valuation on your donation. It's up to you to assign a value to your item. For professional advice, please consult your tax advisor. The Donation Value Guide below helps you determine the approximate tax-deductible value of some of the more commonly donated items. It includes low and high estimates.

    "textAfterTable": "Automobiles We always appreciate vehicle donations. And although we often accept car donations, boat donations, or other vehicle donations in any condition (running or not). Due to differing regulations and other considerations, not all types of vehicles are accepted at all locations, so it's best to contact us first. For more detailed information on how to donate your vehicle, give us a call at 1-800-SA-TRUCK (1-800-728-7825) or start a vehicle donation. Your vehicle donation will be used to help rehabilitate men and women in our Adult Rehabilitation Centers and will result in a tax deduction in accordance with IRS rules. Online pickup scheduling for automobiles is also available in some areas of Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington.
