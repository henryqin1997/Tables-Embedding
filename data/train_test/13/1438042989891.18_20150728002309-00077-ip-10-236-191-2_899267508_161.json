            "Our police do respond quickly and there is a campus wide alert system via email and text, but as this is Tallahassee, there are a lot of muggings that occur because students continually walk alone at night. BE SAFE! That's all I can say.",
            "Extremely strong and active Greek life. If you're not in it, it doesn't affect you as much. If Greeks ostracize others for not being Greek, it isn't obvious or it's behind your back because I never feel targeted and they don't bother me as much. Greeks tend to be with other Greeks and stick to their own group. As with many universities, some are friendly, and some are not. Even if you aren't Greek, non-Greeks can still attend their parties.",
            "There is an organization for everyone. On campus magazines, circus performances, interesting lectures, free movies at the SLC theater, cultural events, multicultural fraternities and organizations, religious organizations and fraternities, Greek life, weekend concerts, Breakfast for a Buck, tailgates, campus TV shows, literary clubs, honor societies, business fraternities, LGBT organizations, feminist organizations, political organizations, etc.",
            "FSU is great for everyone ESPECIALLY if you're into cultural and global affairs, science and research, writing and art, parties, and hot men and women. Not going to lie, we have a very attractive campus population.",
            "On your 21st birthday, your friends are required to throw you into the freezing cold Westcott fountain! True story. Also, every year there is a campus wide Humans versus Zombies game with Nerf Guns that everyone gets really into...it lasts for quite a while.",
            "Compared to other colleges, you definitely get so much for what you pay, as long as you use on campus services and activities. If you have severe financial need, you're completely set with grants and scholarships. However, it is still a public university, and when I graduate I'll be up to my ears in debt.",
            "Like I said before, there is something for every kind of person here in Tallahassee. For all of the partiers, there are fun clubs around town (the Free bus service called the Night Nole runs into the wee hours of the morning to pick up students with their FSU ID card). There are football tailgates in the fall and basketball games in the spring for the sports-minded person. For outdoorsy people, there's the FSU Outdoor Reservation that offers canoeing, rock climbing, volleyball, and kayaking. There is also a strong indie/hipster scene at the university which hosts poetry and book readings, concerts at Club Downunder on campus, and vintage stores around town. Union Productions at FSU sponsors a lot of cool events during the week and on the weekends as well, such as a carnival and snow event during the winter. I've gotten so many free t-shirts!",
            "There are two dining halls: Suwannee and Fresh Foods. They usually have good vegetarian options and their meals aren't so bad. I am a very healthy eater and my boyfriend is the complete opposite, but both of us always manage to find something to eat when we go to the dining hall together. There are other options as well; on campus we have Einstein's bagels, a food court, Salad Creations, Chili's, and Denny's, as well as a multitude of free weekly events that have catering.",
            "Best part about FSU: the social scene. Everyone is very approachable and friendly, but make sure you are open and personable as well!",
            "It is true, some majors and classes are harder than others. However, it doesn't matter if you're an Engineering major or an English major, you will always do better in a subject you love if you put forth the time and effort.",
            "It's fine if you're an Exploratory (Undecided) major like I was freshman year, but it really helps if you know what you want to do from the get go. Choosing classes that are useful are critical and I feel like I wasted so much time because I jumped from major to major. Also, DO NOT SLACK OFF FRESHMAN YEAR. Your GPA will be severely impacted for the rest of your college career; it moves very slowly even if you get straight A's after one poorly graded semester.",
            "Best decision I ever made! Everyone is friendly and there are so many activities for every kind of group here- it's not as purely Greek Life-dominated as everyone thinks it is. It offers a great support system with so many great internship opportunities as well."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{825856=May be challenging depending on courses chosen and study habits. Getting to know your professors always gives you an advantage., 468346=For many students like myself, this is your top, or one of your top choice universities in which you want to attend. I recommend you to study for the SAT/ACT until you feel confident that you can get a solid 1750 on it between all three sections or a 25/26 for the ACT for freshman applicants. Also, build up your GPA and take sequential courses in a specific field of study for example; if you want to take Spanish, they like to see that you took Spanish I, II, AP Spanish Lang, AP Spanish Lit. It truly shows rigor in your high school career and knowledge in a specific subject. Also, if you are a Florida student ONLY you should look into the CARE Summer Bridge Program. Its a program in which all your costs for the summer are covered for your first summer semester and they truly help you transition to college life and how to succeed up at Florida State and anywhere else you wish to attend afterwards. The requirements are a bit more lenient but they truly look for the top of the top in leadership, academics, community service, and overall quality of the person., 571952=Apply for the first deadline. You\u2019ll find out if you got into FSU before you find out about all of your other potential colleges if you apply for the October deadline. This gives you more time to explore opportunities that you want to take advantage of at FSU before you get there! Apply for a living learning community! These communities allow you to live with and take classes with other people in your major or area of interest. There\u2019s many to choose from and they help you find friends and study buddies as soon as you start school! Plus, many of them offer extra opportunities outside of academics, like leadership in an affiliated society or research/career experience opportunities. Once you get to FSU, plan your time wisely. Most assignments are assigned weeks ahead of their deadlines, so start them early and leave yourself plenty of time to edit papers and projects as the deadline approaches. In classes like mathematics, the sciences, and lab classes, you will have smaller, regular homework assignments that you are expected to complete. Make sure that you don\u2019t fall behind on these smaller assignments while working on big projects for other classes. Join an organization that addresses something you are passionate about, like a career-based society, a service organization, or a campus ministry. This will help you meet other like-minded students and develop friendships early on. Having a group of friends with whom you can relate will help you adjust to living away from home., 133174=Come to campus. A lot of students are wary about coming, saying that it may be too far from home, but once you see campus you may change your mind. I would also try to get the highest score possible on your SAT/ACT, so then you can qualify for Bright Futures as well as the FSU scholarships available. I get $1200 a semester from FSU because of my scores. Look around, and if you aren't sure what major you want to take just yet, be an undeclared major for a semester or two until you decide. You can do most of your liberal study requirements then so that you'll still be on track for graduation., 1013101=On your birthday it is tradition to get thrown into a fountain on campus. Another fountain tradition is when the seniors get their class rings they dip them in the fountain at 6:51 pm, because in military time it is 18:51, which is the university's founding year. One more tradition is the one before football games, where Chief Osceola rides in on his horse with a flame-tipped spear, 7044=There are many different programs at FSU so you will be surrounded with experienced and helpful faculty. The university is strong in the liberal arts and hard sciences, but they also have a number of other outstanding programs including criminology, sociology, psychology, law, and business. Orientation at FSU was very informative for both my parents and myself. It was a 2-day learning experience that consisted mainly of talks by various campus reps/student leaders. It was a great start where you can meet people from different backgrounds and experiences. I was drawn to find out more about FSU\u2019s medical program. In 2005, the FSU College of Medicine received full accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. The FSU College of Medicine is now ranked among the top 5 in nation for turning out doctors who choose to specialize in family medicine. Medical students will complete their clinical rotations in the third or fourth year at one of these regional campuses in Orlando, Pensacola, Sarasota, Tallahassee, Daytona Beach, and Fort Pierce. This is extremely important to me since my educational goal is to one day become a medical doctor. This may seem like a daunting task, but I believe that if I work hard and set the right goals for myself I can do it. Also, FSU provides enormous research opportunities that are supported by the school of Computational Science and Informational Technology and the famous the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is the world\u2019s largest magnetic of it\u2019s kind. FSU is an excellent university, but you will need to work very hard., 935208=Campus is very safe. We have safety poles covering the entire campus and the night noel will take you anywhere and pick you up anywhere until 3 o'clock in the morning., 724161=FSU has three dining halls: Suwannee, Fresh Foods, and The Figg. Suwannee is located on the east side of campus, by most of the nicer suite-style dorms. Fresh Foods is located on the west side of campus. The Figg is located in the stadium, and though it is primarily the atheletes' dining hall, all students can eat there between 11 am and 1:30 pm. The Figg has the best food, but Suwannee and Fresh Foods also have a wide variety of selections. In addition to the dining halls, FSU has restaurants on campus. These include Salad creations, Einstein Bagels, Chilli's, Papa Johns, and a few more. There are also many restaurants off campus that are within walking distance., 520528=FSU really gets you to think. Most classes, even at the 2000 level, require a good deal of thought and effort. Sometimes you can get by without actually learning too much, but then what are you really paying for? You get what you give. If you put in the effort to learn, you will. The faculty and staff are extremely welcoming for the most part. They want you to come to office hours; they want you to ask questions. FSU is a friendly, extremely educational environment.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students This school it great for students who are spirited, motivated, determined, and ready to have the best four years of their lives! Tips for prospective students TIME MANAGEMENT!!! It's so important to make sure you dedicate enough time to your studies especially in your first year. Also, probably the most important tip I can offer an incoming freshmen would be to get involved. The best way to shrink the campus and not feel lost is to get involved in a school sponsored club, activity, sport, student government or even a religious organization. Bang for the buck With the current budget cuts in Florida, it is difficult to do many things including getting an education. Luckily, FSU works with the budget crisis committee and so far has not cut anything vital to the education system or the student activities at FSU. A student here can get a great education and have fun for one of the lowest rates in the state. Am enjoying being here Being at Florida State was by far the best choice I could have made for myself. There are so many activities for students that are virtually free, a student can find",
