            "Public safety is open at all times. They offer to take you anywhere you need to go, plus at night they drive around golf carts so you don't have to walk alone in the dark.",
            "You can go swim in the pool, Harding is near several parks. You could play frisbee on the front lawn. There are several things to do in the town of Searcy where Harding is located.",
            "The cafeteria has a salad line, grill line, unlimited drinks. It also has a pizza line and the best fries you could ever have! The student center has a Taco Bell, Burger Studio, Chik-Fil-A, and asian resteraunt and a mini mart.",
            "The dorms could be better. The dorms are alright, but they are not the best.",
            "Depending on your major, the classes will be more difficult. I believe that the classes are adequately difficult. They give you the chance to learn and experience what you love.",
            "When making your schedule, do not pick noon to be your lunch break. You will never get to the food in time. It will be packed. Take oppertunities seriously. Here at Harding, you have so many chances to meet great people and learn so much. You can also study abroad for the same price as in the states.",
            "As a freshman theatre major, I have never felt more at home. Harding's academics, food, adviser's, professors, and campus are the most wonderful things I have ever experienced. I mean where else does the president of the college come sit with you in the student center to ask how you are and how you feel about Harding?"

(August 28th), 102790=The swing in the gardens is a great tradition. --Regular student-led devotionals --Homecoming --Spring Sing Variety Show with over 1000 students participating --Annual Lectureship that connects with churches around the world., 129674=I live in Stephens which is an upperclassmen female dorm (however, freshman overflow can get in and its much nicer than other freshman dorms.) and I absolutely love it. The atmosphere is what's great. You can go down the hall and know everyone and wave to them and stop and genuinely ask about their day. Plus, they aren't tiny by any means. Stephens was remodeled in 2011 and I believe they are planning on building another dorm as well due to the amount of freshman coming in are multiplying each year. The opposite gender is not allowed on any floor except the lobby and they can't be in each other's rooms aside from during open dorm. The goal of this is to make sure we keep Harding's christian mission, and while some people are bothered by this, it has never affected me. I love it. There is also a midnight curfew on week days and one AM on weekends. I've never had a reason to be out past midnight because if you're following your pledge (to not drink, party, go to clubs, etc) then except for midnight walmart trips, going out late at night is pointless. I like not coming home to a drunk roommate or a suitemate with a boy in her bed. The rules are like boundaries. They keep us safe. I know some of you will think that's hogwash and that's fine. It's all about perspective. If you think of the rules as guidelines and less like fences and collars, you will love dorm life. You do have to live on campus until you're 22 or married so basically your whole time here. But honestly, I wouldn't want to live off of campus. You miss too much just being gone on the weekends. Just this past week, we had the Ice Bucket Challenge, Steps Devos constantly, Spider-Man 2 showing, blood drives, etc. :) You will be happier if you live on campus and get involved!, 103309=I am a non-resident student paying out of state tuition at a private Christian university and the cost is only $2000 more a year than if I had attended a state-supported school in my home state., 266673=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "The expense for Harding is completely worth the cost. The knowledge and life skills they equip you with will last a life time. The knowledge you gain about the Bible will be with you as long as you live. Harding takes so much time and effort to make sure that we are comfortable and having a great time year round. Am enjoying being here People wonder what is so great about Arkansas. In Searcy, Harding is the main attraction to the town. The campus constantly has activities going on every weekend. They have already held a concert with Owl City and other popular artists. There is never a dull moment when you go to Harding University. Am learning a lot Harding offers such a wonderful variety of classes to choose from, and the teaching is exceptional. The teachers are extremely caring and understanding to the students' needs at all times. They take their time to go through all of the material, making us experts on each subject we are taking.
