    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{69568=In one preferred embodiment of the active release device, a resistor is integrated into the reservoir or mounted near the reservoir, which upon application of an electric current through the resistor, heats the contents of the reservoir, the cap material or both. In typical embodiments, resistors are located at the bottom or along the inside walls of the reservoirs, or they may be located on or near the reservoir caps covering the small reservoir openings. The resistor generally is a thin-film resistor, which can be integrated with the reservoir during the manufacturing process. Such resistors can be made of metals such as platinum or gold, ceramics, semiconductors, and some polymers. Methods for fabricating these resistors are described, for example, in Wogersien et al. \u201cFabrication of Thin Film Resistors and Silicon Microstructures Using a Frequency Doubled Nd:YAG-Laser,\u201d Proc. SPIE-Int. Soc. Opt. Eng., 3680:1105-12 (1999); Bhattacharya & Tummala, \u201cNext Generation Integral Passives: Materials, Processes, and Integration of Resistors and Capacitors on PWB Substrates,\u201d J. Mater. Sci.-Mater. Electron. 11(3):253-68 (2000); and Vladimirsky et al., \u201cThin Metal Film Thermal Micro-Sensors,\u201d Proc. SPIE-Int. Soc. Opt. Eng., 2640:184-92 (1995). Alternatively, small chip resistors can be surface mounted on the device in close proximity to the reservoir or reservoir cap., 76478=Bioabsorbable stents are particularly desirable in applications such as urological applications, since a second procedure is not required to remove the stent. Furthermore, one of the main problems in using metallic stents in cardiovascular applications is the subsequent restenosis caused by excessive growth of the endothelial wall, which is believed due, at least in part, to irritation caused by the metallic stent on the vessel wall (see Behrend, American J. Cardiol. p. 45, TCT Abstracts (October 1998); Unverdorben, et al., American J. Cardiol. p. 46, TCT Abstracts (October 1998)). A bioabsorbable stent made from, or coated with a appropriate materials should produce reduced or no irritation. Bioabsorbable stents can be fabricated using methods known in the art, for example the methods and procedures described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,792,106; 5,769,883; 5,766,710; 5,670,161; 5,629,077; 5,551,954; 5,500,013; 5,464,450; 5,443,458; 5,306,286; 5,059,211, and 5,085,629. See also Tanquay, Cardiology Clinics, 23:699-713 (1994), and Talja, J. Endourology, 11:391-97 (1997)., 48287=For applications outside of drug delivery, such as diagnostics or fragrance delivery, substrate biocompatibility may be much less of an issue. One example of a strong, non-degradable, easily etched substrate that is impermeable to the molecules to be delivered and the surrounding fluids is silicon. An example of a class of strong, biocompatible materials are the poly(anhydride-co-imides) described in which et al., \u201cSynthesis and characterization of degradable poly(anhydride-co-imides)\u201d, Macromolecules, 28:2184-93 (1995)., 80789=An alternative embodiment of an active release device uses the rupture of the membrane by a mechanical force as the release mechanism. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,167,625 to Jacobsen et al., which describes rupturing means that may be modified or adapted to the devices described herein. One non-limiting example is the rupturing of caps by forceful contact of the cap surface with an array of cantilevers that are fabricated using similar MEMS techniques or any other machining techniques (see FIG. 5). Ultrasonic waves are an alternative method capable of rupturing the cap material in order to expose the release system and release the molecules (see FIG. 6). Actuation of piezoelectric elements on or near the reservoir produces sonic waves that rupture the cap material. The piezoelectric elements can be composed of any material having crystal structure that is non-centrosymetric. Preferred piezoelectric materials are ceramics, such as BaTiO3, LiNbO3 and ZnO (Chiang, Y., \u201cPhysical Ceramics\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, pp. 37-66 (1997)), and polymers, such as polyvinylidene (Hunter & Lafontaine, \u201cA Comparison of Muscle with Artificial Actuators,\u201d Technical Digest of the 1992 Solid State Sensor and Actuator Workshop, pp. 178-85 (1992)). These actuators can be fabricated in the form of thin films using standard techniques such as ion sputtering (Tjhen, et al., \u201cProperties of Piezoelectric Thin Films for Micromechanical Devices and Systems\u201d, Proceedings\u2014IEEE Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, pp. 114-19 (1991)) and sol-gel processing as described, for example, in Klein, \u201cSol-Gel Optics: Processing and Applications\u201d, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1994). The ultrasonic energy can be supplied by components located on the delivery device, in the carrier fluid, or outside of the delivery device. Methods for selecting which reservoirs are exposed include, for example, wave interference using secondary ultrasonic waves. The secondary waves can act to destructively interfere with the primary ultrasonic waves thus restricting the application of energy to only a selected set of reservoirs., 37142=Priority is claimed to U.S. Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Modifications and variations of the methods and devices described herein will be obvious to those skilled in the art from the foregoing detailed description. Such modifications and variations are intended to come within the scope of the appended claims. In renal dialysis procedures, the patient's blood flows through an ex vivo dialysis machine where toxic molecules are selectively removed from the blood, and the \u201ccleaned\u201d blood is returned to the patients body. These toxic molecules, which are normally removed from the blood by the kidneys, accumulate over time due to the decreased or improper functioning of the kidneys. While toxic molecules are removed from the patient's blood as it passes through the dialysis machine, therapeutic molecules and drugs can easily be added to the blood. This leads to a potential method for systemic delivery of multiple drugs or other molecules to a patient using a microchip device located ex vivo. In a preferred embodiment, microchip devices filled with drug molecules are placed in tubing through which blood flows during a dialysis procedure. The microchips can actively or passively delivery one or more types of molecules to the patients blood as it passes through the tubing. This method allows multiple drugs to be delivered accurately and directly into a patient's blood without having to implant the delivery device into the patient's body. H. Renal Applications In a preferred embodiment, release of doses is actively controlled, such as",
