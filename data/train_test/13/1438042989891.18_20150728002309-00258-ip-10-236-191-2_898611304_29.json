Write down the course numbers so you can put them in the into the computer system fast, that will give you a better chance at getting the class you want, because they fill up fast. Also, go to ratemyprofessor.com to see which professors recieved good reviews and bad reviews. This was very helpful for me. Trust me, you do not want a bad professor, they can mess up your G.P.A. big time! If you know anyone has has previously attended LCC ask them which classes and professors are good to take. This was very helpful for me, because I usually ended up with great professors because of advice. You will be studying at least 2 hours a day. I didn't believe this statement when my high school teachers told me, but it's true! If you want that 4.0 grade your going better get used to tons and tons and tons of reading and note taking. You will get use to it after a while. I would suggest doing school work at LCC, because when I do it at home there are way to many distractions and I don't learn as much. When I do my homework at LCC I have no food to eat, no Facebook, and no T.V., so I am forced to do homework. If you take a writing class bug the heck out of your professor. I probably had my professor look over my paper at least 5 times before I turned it in. They are there to help you take advantage of it, it will improve your grade so much, I ended up with the blue ribbon award because of it. If you have a G.P.A. of 3.5 or higher join the Phi Theta Kappa Honors club. You get to do community service, meet a ton of new people, and it looks great on your resume'. If you have class in the afternoon you are not going to find a close parking spot. I would suggest having class in the morning. You need to get to L.C.C. no later than 7:50 if you want to make an 8:10 class, because there is usually a long line to park. When you get your Star Card (Card you use to park with) make sure you PUT MONEY on it! You pay $20 for the card but that doesn't go on the card. If you don't put money on it, the card machine in the parking ramp will eat it and you have to pay for a new one. Talk to your professors before or after class. This is a great way for you to get to know each other and for the professor to put a face with a name. It can also help you get a letter of recommendation from them which can be very valuable. If you want to work at LCC you have to apply online. Go to the LCC homepage and click on the employment link. It should take you to this website: http://lcc.experience.com/er/security/login.jsp, where you can fill out your profile and apply for various jobs that interest you. If you need to rent a book, print a paper, see a math/science tutor, or check out anatomy models, go to the Academic Resource Center (ARC room #455) on the 4th floor of the Arts and Science building. They are open M-TR from 8:00-9:00, Friday from 8:00-4:00 and Saturday from 9:00-3:00. This is a great place to study or get help from tutors for free! If you are interested in playing basketball I know the open gyms for the boys team is from 2:00-4:00 pm, and for girls from 4:00-6:00 pm. All open gyms are in the Gannon Gym which is on the 3rd floor of the Gannon Building. If you lose something just check with the Department of Public Safety (DPS), they are located on the second floor of the Gannon Building., 265092=Food is not easy to find on campus and it requires that students walk 5 or 6 blocks into Washington Square for the closest food. The only available food on campus is found in the vending machines. The Gannon building is under construction as I review this and there should be a cafeteria available by Fall 2014. The food I had here before construction was reasonably priced and tasted good--the personal pizzas are my favorite.}",

Tips for prospective students Come visit the campus! you will be surprised by how large the campus is and how beautiful the landscaping is.with its new Chinese inspired zen garden and pond. don't forget to take a peak at the class rooms as well because there just as nice as the outside. when first starting i would come about an hour before your class during the first 3 weeks because the lines to park are so long! but with in those 3 weeks a lot of changes to classes take place as well as drops so after 3",
