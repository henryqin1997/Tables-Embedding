The hotel we reserved in Rapid City booked our arrival on the wrong date and due to a music festival in town, was now full (as were the other hotels). The guys at WestJet were able to find us a room in town and saved our trip. They took great care of us and our aircraft. Great service and very friendly. Note to other airmen/women: Although the Dollar Rental Car website claims they are located at the Rapid City airport, they're not. Additionally, they are only open until 6 PM.}",
