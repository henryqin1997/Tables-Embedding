Check out the latest news below for more on his current fantasy value., 5207=2015 Preseason Projections}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{60736=2015, 54160=3/5/2013, 62632=Hermida battled injuries for the second straight season but also began flashing the form that made him a preseason Rookie of the Year candidate in 2006. He can hit for average and power with a solid batting eye, but the 20-steal potential he showed in the minors might be gone after his various lower-body problems. Even with Miguel Cabrera gone, the Marlins should have a decent offense, and if Hermida can stay off the DL he'll be a valuable part of it., 61476=The Marlins finally gave up on Hermida this offseason, sending him to Boston for an A-ball lottery ticket and a potential LOOGY. Since his solid 2007, Hermida has regressed in just about every facet of the game, so getting out of south Florida and having a fresh set of coaching eyes taking a look at him can't hurt. There's still some upside here as he'll be just 26 to start the season, but without some major improvement he'll have a hard time finding at-bats in Boston., 57682=7/19/2012, 63779=2006, 62580=2008, 59668=6/19/2012, 64274=2005, 54998=2/4/2013, 63188=What looked like a potential Rookie of the Year campaign for Hermida heading into 2006 got badly derailed by a lingering hip injury and a September ankle tendon strain. The collapse of his batting eye in the majors was especially distressing, but it's completely out of line with his minor league performances and until Hermida gets some more healthy big league plate appearances under his belt he can't be written off as a bust. In fact, if he proves 100% in spring training Hermida will be an almost perfect fit for Post-Hype Sleeper status., 60884=2011, 61424=2010, 64598=2004, 52275=11/7/2014, 55929=8/28/2012, 61998=2009, 63136=2007, 51386=12/11/2014, 62050=Hermida stayed healthy for five straight months but that's about the only progress he made in 2008, as his numbers across the board were far off what the Marlins thought they might get from him over a full season. His name came up more than once in trade talks in the offseason, but assuming he stays in Florida he'll likely shift over to left field. If you're scrambling for a reason to consider him as a post-hype sleeper, he has done better in odd numbered years than even ones., 53214=1/26/2014, 29540=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Advanced Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Games By Position, 64650=The Marlins' first round pick in 2002, Hermida's bat came to life in his first full pro season. A .393 SLG shows he's still got some filling out to do, but he'll be only 20 in 2004. He should hit Double-A late this season, or in 2005, at which point it'll be time to pay attention., 56869=8/22/2012, 58670=6/26/2012, 60936=Hermida signed with the A's in September after hitting poorly with the Red Sox, but opted for free agency after the season and eventually landed with the Reds. Joining a crowded outfield in Cincinnati, it's difficult to envision him in anything more than a platoon role barring a rash of injuries. Given his age, we're at the now-or-never stage in terms of development and he's little more than an endgame dart for those in deeper formats., 50121=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Basic Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Split Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Games By Position}",
