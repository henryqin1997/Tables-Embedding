            "the promethean procession involves freshmen students carrying lit candles across campus. while this goes on upperclassmen try to blow out the student's flames. once across campus students count the number of times their candle has to be re-lit and this signifies the number of years they will spend at morgan.",
            "morgan graduates are hired at greater rates every year. morgan is one of the top four universities in terms of graduates that go on to earn a ph.d. there are many grants and scholarships based on need and merit as well. the major bang for the buck factor is noticed mostly after graduation when employers and graduate schools notice the weight and prestige that morgan brings.",

            "students in dorms are required to have a meal plan for the two on campus cafeterias. the food is hit or miss, to be honest. the rawlings dining hall is the major cafeteria and offers options of two different hot entres, a burger and deli section, a salad bar, pizza line, cereal funnels, waffle makers, and beverages. we are sponsored by thompson hospitality who also work at towson and other maryland schools.",
            "dorm life at morgan is going through a few changes. there are currently four male residence halls and 2 female residence halls. most are old stone establishments that have been renovated. a focus is being made in fully renovating all dorms, adding full campus wi-fi, as well as beautifying the campus. morgan also offers off campus housing in adjacent apartment complexes owned by the school. these are usually more sought after for upperclassmen. the campus community is very neighborly and friendly. eventually students come to feel a home on campus as you get to know everyone.",
            "as an honors student in the earl g. graves school of business and management i can attest to the rigors of academia at morgan. there is a steady course load in each class with focus on cognitive participation from students, not call and answer teaching. there are usually multiple tests and quizzes in a course as well as the midterm and final. most classes also involve a term paper or project to further test your knowledge. a multimedia approach is standard, and most classes will utilize blackboard which is an online web module that allows teaches to post assignments and videos online.",
            "when considering morgan look into applying for university honors scholarships these scholarships require you to maintain a minimum gpa of 3.0 while taking at least 15 honors credits, but they pay considerable amounts of money towards tuition to augment soaring college costs. another tip for prospective students is to consider what morgan can offer in their major. the earl g. graves school of business and management and the school of engineering enroll the most students. lastly, visit campus! take a tour, come on an unofficial visit, stop by, you should literally do all you can to acclimate yourself to campus and campus culture to make sure morgan is the place for you before your first week of orientation.",

Live in the Academic Moment A college education is a classic process-versus-product paradigm. Plenty of students complain about their work or obsess about their G.P.A., but that is just wasted energy and time. \u00c3?\u00c2?\u00c3?\u00c2? Get caught up in any academic ennui. Instead, focus on your assignments, papers and projects for their intrinsic learning value; the grades will come naturally. Don't Study in Your Room Unless you have a spartan single and concentration powers of steel, your room is the worst place to study because of the comfort and the distractions. Given the realities of dorm life, it's far too easy to wander across the hall and talk to your neighbor, or to have Facebook on while you glance back and forth from your book to the screen.

Students looking for ways to earn a degree without paying high cost and having the opportunities to apply for loans and scholarships, don't look no more. .Recognize the environment This is often difficult to do depending on your background. If you grew up in a city or attended a large high school, this will likely be easier than it will be for students with different experiences.

Adjust to the changes in the academic requirements This is a step towards enjoying college that is often difficult for many people, while others may find the transition smooth and fitting. College coursework initially appears harder than other sorts of educational challenges you may have faced. Create your solid friend group Handling any situation in the melancholy torment of solitude is not an environmental condition that will be conducive to your success. After all, forcing one to be alone is a tool that is utilized as a harsh punishment. Morgan has a tradition of producing some of the best and brightest graduates in a wide range of professional disciplines.
