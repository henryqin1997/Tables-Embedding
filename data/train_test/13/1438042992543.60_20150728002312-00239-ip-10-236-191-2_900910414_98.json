            "Since I attend night courses, there is plenty of illumination throughout the campus. There are emergency call boxes throughout the campus to give students and staff the sense of security needed to walk freely to their destination.",
            "I cannot tell of the Greek Life but it sounds interesting enough for me to inquire about from my classmates.",
            "I have not experienced any of these activities but will do so soon as I am do to retire from my beloved Marine Corps soon.",
            "A young and strideful life mixed with the San Diego weather makes for an awesome combination. It is a college experience that is well controlled and supervised.",
            "Unfortunately, work and night classes tend to take away much of my experiences during the daylight activities of the campus. I look forward to these experiences and traditions since that is what most institutions are founded upon.",
            "I won't talk about books because those things are boo-koo expensive. But I do believe that the college supplies are within proper costs. Stadium prices are what is expected.",
            "I have attended the Aztec football games. They are a great time especially when you participate in a tailgate party. I haven't been able to attend a basketball game because of my night classes but I am sure I am destined to attend them with my boy.",
            "Because of my work hours I am only able to take night courses so I am unable to experience the dining facilities.",
            "I live out in town with my family of three. However, I look forward to when my kid joins the alumn. He speaks of attending when his time arrives.",
            "I am very well challenged at this university. I have added more study time even though i work full time in the Marine Corps. However, as I have been taught from my mother, with no struggle there is no victory. At this rate I plan on being victorious.",
            "The best advice I would give is to smile to everyone that walks by you. It is an easily reciprocated gesture and makes it eventually opens people up to conversation.",
            "By far it is the most enjoyable experience. Even though I came from the San Diego Community College District, the atmosphere at SDSU is more mature and willing to befriend a military veteran. I'm proud to hear the good news when the media reports on my university."

The average high school GPA for the class of 2017 was a 3.8., 504193=Go to the gym, play bowling at kearny mesa bowl since the aztec center is closed until fall 2013, go to the SDSU men's basketball games at Viejas Arena or concerts, go to the SDSU Football games at Qualcomm Stadium, and watch sports or listen to music/play video games., 360756=not really big here since the drug bust in 2007. many sororities/fraternities were suspended., 245933=There's a lot to do in San Diego! A cultural feast. Get a copy of the local weekly magazine, The Reader, when you arrive. Balboa Park alone has over 20 museums, biking and jogging paths, huge gardens, Spanish Village with an old California feel and artisans' shops, and hospitality houses from many countries. If you're a foreign student, go there for local information and socializing. The Park also hosts the Earth Fair every April. Movie theatres near campus show an eclectic array of films. The beaches are wonderful for surfing, relaxing and playing with your dog., 454032=The school is becoming increasingly difficult to gain acceptance to. For those hoping to transfer, keep in mind that there is a followup application due in January., 399492=food is tasty, but there could be more options. the associated students building which is set to open fall of 2013 will have great dining choices., 313617=I am an incoming freshman, and I will be attending in Fall 2015. I have some friends that go here, and they say that you should be very careful with the party scene here on campus. There are a lot of parties that you can go to, but always make sure to be careful!}",

The college is full of beautiful nature which includes hundreds of different types of plants, flowers, and trees. In the middle of the school is a coy pond full of fish and turtles, this pond is so relaxing to visit during a break or just to lie down on the grass and take a nap. If you want to go outside the college area there are beaches and parks in very close distance. Students that want or are interested in joining a fraternity or sorority, our Greek system is fantastic and has a huge range from the Pan-Hellenic to cultural fraternities and sororities. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find one that is perfect for you; it\u2019s a great way to be social and make new friends! Active students will enjoy the many different sports SDSU has to offer from division to intramural",
