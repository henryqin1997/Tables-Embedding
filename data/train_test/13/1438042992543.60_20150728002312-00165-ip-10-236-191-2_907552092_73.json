            "There is a police station here on campus and they are dedicated to helping the students feel safe. All 911 calls go directly to them and you can also call if you want an escort across campus at night.",
            "There are so many clubs on campus that it would take me forever to name them all. How about this. If you are interested in any of the clubs here, look them up. I am positive that you will find something that you can get plugged in to.",
            "I think that the most unusual spot on campus is right outside the Student Union Building. They have a modern art structure that looks like a giant metal noodle on a twenty foot pole. The strange thing is that the noodle was built so that it will spin if the wind ever picks up.",
            "Their in state tuition is very comparable to other state universities. Though it still is a lot of money because tuition is constantly going up everywhere, they do their best here to keep things reasonable.",
            "There are plenty of things to do for fun. Whether it's just relaxing and watching a movie on campus at the Procrastinator Theater or if its going to a string quartet recital at the music building. Montana State is also located in Bozeman which is not a huge town but it does have enough fun sights to see (the Museum of the Rockies) and shopping at the mall.",
            "The food is surprisingly good here. The best dining hall is Hannon Hall even though it is one of the smaller ones. They always have various choices in case you do not like the main meal.",
            "Dorm life is a new and exciting time. The dorm staff is chosen carefully so as to help its students feel connected and welcome. They do a great job of doing this. The dorms are also comfortable and nice. They really do become home after a few weeks",
            "Montana State's dedication to making students better makes many of its majors very competitive and difficult. The honors program is especially dedicated to growing its students and gives many opportunities for growing academically. There will always be easy and fun classes but many of them here hold high academic standards.",
            "Study hard. Do not just think that college will be easy and try to slack off. Yes college is fun and you make tons of new friends but still remember the main reason you are here.",
            "I believe that Montana State University is helping me to discover for what major and career I am suited. The staff is also helpful and dedicated to helping its students succeed. I also believe that this college education is growing me and helping me to become the best that I can be."

Students run a 5k race in their underwear every November., 619847=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 585210=If you love to ski/snowboard, and I mean REALLY love the snow, MSU is the place for you. In my first year here, there has been snow cover since november with temps in the -20s. Great, friendly people, and a great atmosphere for learning with lots of outlets for help in every class., 153188=Bring warm clothes! It's a lot colder starting in September than I would have imagined., 512599=If you like the outdoors, MSU is the place for you! Almost every one here rides a bike, skateboards, hikes, skis, snowboards, or all of the above! Also, MSU has a great engineering program, ranking very high in the US. There will also be a new business college in 2015 that focuses especially on those looking into entrepreneurship!, 543495=Get a good winter coat. Bozeman is sunny and beautiful all through september and most of october but after that the temperature drops rapidly, the snow flies, and the skiers come out of hibernation, 217645=There is an undies run in September where everyone goes running in their underwear even when it's snowing., 11810=If you are looking for great research or internship opportunities this is the place to be. Montana State is within the Nation's top tier for this! If you are a minority this would be a great place to go if interesting in the hard sciences, math, engineering, etc. But I would also like to add that with the past few years MSU lost about 9 million in funding. This is significant because programs across campus have been cut completely, some altered(budget cuts), some merged into other programs, and some may lose all funding in 2012., 20575=No doubt, I am learning a ton! The vacations are longer: Winter break is 17-Jan11 and summer starts May 5. Despite these relatively short semesters, the professors pile on the homework and I think that they truly care about theit students., 82463=They start placing people into the residence halls as soon as March so sign up early for housing in order to get the placement you want. Make sure to ask questions because everyone is willing to answer but they won't really double check to make sure everyone is doing fine. Talk to your professors.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck MSU is amazing. The classes aren't huge, so it's easier to know a lot or all the people in your class, and it makes the professor and one-on-one time more accessible, which is a big plus. You are also provided with so many resources: the library has a person for pretty much every department who can help you do research or find what you're looking for, there's a Math Learning Center if you need more help in math, there's a Writing Center so you can have someone edit your papers and help you develop ideas and write better. I'm an out-of-state student as well, but I think MSU is definitely worth the money. I do like living on campus, but it's definitely cheaper to live off-campus, and it's definitely preferable to always eating the residence hall food. Am enjoying being here I love living in Bozeman. It's a great town and the campus is lovely, and it's really easy to find fun things to do. There's a lot of outdoor activities and fun places to explore and new things to try, and most people are very friendly. Am learning a lot My classes here are amazing. Most professors are really flexible with office hours and love to",
