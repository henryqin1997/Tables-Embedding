Some accommodations may be pricey. , more so in some cases places to stay are cheaper in Thailand. For example a stay in a hotel would cost as low as $30 or \u20b11400, a flight to Cebu from Manila and vice-versa will cost $35 or \u20b11645. Transportation is low as \u20b18.50 for the first 4km in a Jeepney. Using the internet for 1 hour in an internet cafe range from \u20b120 to \u20b150 depending on the Internet Cafe's location, a can of coke costs as low was \u20b116 while a copy of the International Herald Tribune costs \u20b170 and Economist as low as \u20b1160. In most restaurants, there is 12% Value Added Tax (VAT) usually included in the unit price but service charge is often excluded and computed separately., 296981=Cities that enforce the UVVRP prohibit cars from being driven between 7:00 am and 7:00 pm on a certain weekday on most national (primary) and secondary roads, although the implementation varies: in Metro Manila (excluding Makati and Pasay), a \"window\" exists between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm where the scheme is not enforced, while in Baguio, the UVVRP is only enforced in the city center, and the scheme does not apply to the rest of the city. In general however, the UVVRP does not apply to minor streets (mostly in residential areas), and those roads remain open to coded cars the whole day. Be sure to check with a local contact or the car rental agency/hotel concierge about whether these rules will apply to your vehicle, especially as foreigners driving can become targets for less scrupulous traffic aides., 400404=During drought seasons (March to May), most of the power-plants are hydro-electrics (as stated above in the climate section), regular black-outs happen during this time, ask if your hotel owns a generator., 263175=Passengers departing the Philippines have to pay a terminal fee (in addition to the Philippine travel tax levied on locals). This fee is included in airfare if flying from Manila. Otherwise, this \u20b1550 fee ($15 if paid in U.S. dollars and except via Clark, where the fee was reduced to \u20b1450 on 5 October 2012) is paid before entering the immigration and pre-departure \"air-side\" area of the terminals., 228222=The climate is tropical, with March to May (summer) being the hottest months. The rainy season starts in June and extends through October with strong typhoons possible. The coolest months are from November to February, with mid-January to end of February considered the best for cooler and dryer weather. Locations exposed directly to the Pacific Ocean have frequent rainfall all year. This includes the popular Pagsanjan Falls southeast of Manila (though the falls will get you wet regardless). The average temperatures range from 78\u00b0F / 25\u00b0C to 90\u00b0F / 32\u00b0C, and humidity is around 77 percent. Baguio, which is branded as the summer capital of the Philippines, tends to be cooler due to its being located in mountainous regions with temperatures at night going below 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F). During summer, the country experience droughts, sometimes at extreme conditions, from March(sometimes early as February) to May(sometime extending to June) water supply drops with most of the power plants being hydro electric meaning during summer, you'll be experiencing regular black-outs (locally known as brown-outs), so it isn't much suggested to travel during the months of March to May., 217054=Prior to the 21st Century, corruption became one of the main problems of the country. The country suffered slightly in the 1997 Asian Financial crisis but led to a second EDSA which overthrew Pres. Joseph Estrada, the then Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (daughter of one of the former presidents) took his place. After her term ended in 2010, Benigno Aquino III (nicknamed \"Noynoy\" and \"Pnoy\"), son of Corazon and Benigno Aquino, Jr., was elected President. Growth in the Philippines is slow but it is hopefully catching up with its neighbours. On 2009, Typhoon Ondoy stormed the country, in just a day it flooded the whole of Metro Manila leaving many casualties., 215560=Filipinos declared independence on June 12, 1898 and fought American colonization for seven long years. Relations between the US and the Philippine territory continued without any major events and the Philippines were granted commonwealth status in 1935. Any time after this point (years or decades - or never), the Philippines could have become a US state or been given independence. Japan invaded the Philippines and the Japanese occupation lasted from 1941 until 1945 when General Douglas McArthur fulfilled his promise and liberated the U.S. territory from the Japanese, with Americans and Filipinos fighting side by side against the Japanese. In 1946, a year after World War II ended with a victory by the Allies, the Philippines were at last granted independence., 334207=Peso bills come in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000. One peso is equivalent to 100 centavos and coins come in 5, 10 and 25 centavo variants in addition to the 1, 5 and 10 peso coins. There are 2 versions of each bill with the newer version in circulation since December 2010 (albeit it is still rare to have them). The newer notes have similar colours to their old counterparts, have the same people at the front (Except for the 500-peso note which also features former President Aquino) but rather than historical sites at the back, these newer notes feature Filipino natural wonders and species unique to the country. The older notes will remain legal tender until 2013., 284711=The Philippine National Railways (PNR) [51] currently operates two overnight intercity services: the Bicol Express between Manila and Naga, Camarines Sur, which resumed on June 29, 2011 after a five-year absence, and the Mayon Limited between Manila and Ligao in Albay. Additional services are expected in the future as the rehabilitation of the PNR network progresses. Train service is comparable to (or slower than, due to delays) buses in terms of speed, but is more comfortable owing to the use of donated Japanese coaches for the service., 333233=As at June 2012:, 332012=It is possible for foreigners to earn casual money while staying in the Philippines, especially in Manila and other bigger cities in provinces. These may include temporary teaching in schools, colleges and other institutions; and working in bars and clubs. Temporary work may also be available as an \"extra\" on the set of a film or television series. Fluency in English is very important in jobs while knowledge of Filipino or Tagalog is considerably low. Recently as of late 2010, the Philippines has overtaken India in the call center industry, and many international companies hire English fluent workers., 396176=CDC[95] advises that risk of malaria exists in areas below 600 meters, except for the provinces of Aklan, Bilaran, Bohol, Camiguin, Capiz, Catanduanes, Cebu, Guimaras, Iloilo, Leyte, Masbate, northern Samar, Siquijor, and Metro Manila. Chloroquine is no longer a recommended malaria preventative for anywhere in the Philippines. In general malaria is not common in the Philippines compared to Africa and the rest of mainland Southeast Asia, and around half of the c. 40,000 annual cases are in a couple of discrete locations. Dengue fever is common in the Philippines and cases rise every year, so it is advisable to apply anti-mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes whenever possible. Rabies is also common among street animals in the country, so get a vaccination for rabies if you haven't already, and if you're traveling with children, vaccinate them as soon as possible as they are of high risk of getting rabies because they tend to play more with animals. Hepatitis A and B is a high risk in the country. Get a vaccine if you haven't had one, as you can contract hepatitis through exposure to contaminated food or water, sexual contact, or contact with blood of infected people. If you plan to visit rural farming areas, Japanese encephalitis is common, and vaccination is recommended. Avoid swimming in fresh water areas where you will have high risks of getting schistosomiasis (unless they are chlorinated). Leptospirosis is often contracted from recreational water activities, such as kayaking, in contaminated water., 284141=Passengers departing on domestic flights must pay a terminal fee prior to entering the pre-departure area, although the fee will be integrated into the ticket price starting August 1, 2012 (tickets issued before that date do not include the terminal fee and the fee must be paid at the airport). Fees vary, with most major cities charging \u20b1200, and smaller cities charging between \u20b130 and \u20b1100. Fees are only payable in Philippine pesos except in Manila and Cebu, where U.S. dollars are accepted., 231679=Filipinos are very Catholic; Christmas is celebrated from September till Epiphany., 212361=When the explorer Ferdinand Magellan set foot on Maharlika (not Philippines yet) soil through the island of Homonhon in 1521, the Philippines was predominantly animist, with some Muslim and Hindu inhabitants mainly in the southern part of the country. Famished, Magellan's crew were treated to a feast by the welcoming islanders who wore elaborate tattoos. Magellan was Portuguese but it was a Spanish Expedition which he led to the islands which were eventually claimed by Spain as its colony. Lapu-Lapu a native chief of Mactan island was against the Christianization of the natives, he then fought a battle with Magellan where Lapu-Lapu won while Magellan was killed. The Philippines was later on named for Crown Prince Philip II of Spain and most of the natives converted to Catholicism. Some Muslims in the south and various animistic mountain tribes, however, resisted Spanish conquest and Catholic conversion., 232927=The Philippines is a multicultural country having Christian, Muslim and Chinese holidays aside from secular holidays. The year is welcomed by New Year's Day on January 1, being a predominantly Catholic country means observing the traditional Catholic holidays of Maundy Thursday and Good Friday during Lent or months around April or May, Araw ng pagkabuhay or Easter Sunday is celebrated 3 days after Good Friday. Araw ng Kagitingan or Day of Valor, Boy scouts re-enact the march every 2 years in honor of this day that is also known as Bataan Day. The Bataan Death March was a 60\u00a0km march and the people who participated in this march were captured, tortured and murdered. All Saints Day is on 1 November and All Souls Day on 2 November. In recognition of the Muslim Filipinos, the Islamic feast of Eid-Al-Fitr (known in the Philippines as Hari Raya Puasa), held after Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, is also a national holiday. This day changes year by year, as it follows the Lunar Calendar. Chinese New Year is also celebrated by the Chinese Community but dates vary according to the lunar calendar. Secular holidays include Labor Day (May 1) and Independence Day (June 12). August 30 is declared National Heroes Day. Some holidays also commemorate national heroes such as Jose Rizal (Dec. 30) and Andres Bonifacio (Nov. 30) as well as Ninoy Aquino (August 21). Metro Manila is less congested during Holy Week as people tend to go to their hometowns to spend the holidays there. Holy week is also considered part of the super peak season for most beach resorts such as Boracay and the most popular ones tend to get overcrowded at this time. Due to its cool mountain weather, Baguio is also where a lot of people spend the Holy Week break. Christmas is widely celebrated on December 25., 214230=The longest revolt against Spanish colonization was led by Francisco Dagohoy in Bohol which lasted for 85 years covering the period of 1744-1829. As a cabeza de barangay or barangay captain, Dagohoy opposed the Spanish colonizers which were represented by priests and civil leaders, which required payment of excessive taxes, tributes. They also oppressed the Philippines' natives by subjecting them as slaves and sending them to prison for disobeying rules. The Manila Galleon trade made contact between the Philippines and Mexico as well as the whole of the Americas, Mayans and Aztecs settled in the Philippines and introduced their cultures which then was embraced by the Filipinos. The Philippines received heavy influence from Mexico and Spain, and the archipelago became \"hispanicized\". Other Asians used the Manila Galleon trade to migrate to the West. During the Spanish rule, people such as the Dutch, Portuguese and British tried to colonize the country, however only the British did so and it lasted for 2 years in the modern-day capital: Manila. The Philippines remained a Spanish colony for over 300 years until 1899 when it was ceded by Spain to the United States following the Spanish-American War., 216415=Up until the 1960's, the Philippines was second only to Japan in terms of development in Asia. Several decades of rule by Ferdinand Marcos plunged the country into deep debt. Poverty was widespread and infrastructure for development was severely lacking. In 1986, the People Power uprising finally overthrew the Marcos government. (The EDSA Revolution - the majority of the demonstrations took place on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, EDSA.) He was replaced by Corazon Aquino, widow of slain opposition leader, Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino, Jr., 258037=What to pay when leaving the Philippines? When leaving the Philippines, departing passengers have to pay a passenger service charge, more commonly known as the terminal fee. This \u20b1550 fee is already included in the price you paid for your air ticket (if purchased after 1 August 2012) if exiting from Manila or collected at the airport before entering immigration if exiting other than from Manila and is payable in Philippine pesos or US dollars. A stub is attached to your boarding pass to indicate that you have paid the fee. In addition, most Filipinos and resident aliens leaving the country are required to pay a travel tax of either \u20b12,700 (around US$60) if flying first class or \u20b11620 (around US$36) if flying in business or economy class. This tax is collected at a designated counter before check-in if the ticket was purchased outside the Philippines or, in most cases, on-line. If the ticket was purchased at an airline ticket office or travel agency in the Philippines, the travel tax is most likely included in the ticket price; check first and ask before paying. Foreign nationals and balikbayans (former Filipino citizens) who are staying in the Philippines for less than one year are exempt from paying the travel tax, as are overseas Filipino workers, Filipino students studying abroad, infants of 2 years or less and employees of government or international agencies on official business. Reduced rates are available for minors (under 12 years), dependants (under 21 years) of Overseas Foreign Workers and journalists on assignment., 299818=When hailing a taxi in the cities, ensure the meter is on and pay the metered fare. A tip of 10 pesos is acceptable. Also, make sure you have small denomination banknotes, as the drivers often claim not to have change in an effort to obtain a larger tip! Please do have coins ready with you. Moreover, don't be surprised if drivers want to bypass the meter during rush hour. (Updated April 2011) Most taxis have the flag down rate of \u20b140 with each 300 meters cost \u20b13.50 while Yellow cab taxis are more expensive with a flag down rate of \u20b170 with each 300 meters cost \u20b14.00., 342414=As stated above, living in the Philippines is cheap, shopping there is also cheap. Sales tend to happen during pay day and last for 3 days and also during the Christmas season (in the Philippines Christmas season extends from September to the first week of January) in Department stores like SM Department Store[83]. Cheaper items are sold at flea markets and open markets where you can bargain the price like Divisoria, Market!Market!, Greenhills in Metro Manila. Ayala Center[84] is often compared to Singapore's Orchard Rd, from Entertainment to shopping, they have it all there, located in the Financial district of Makati. Not far from Makati is Serendra, a Piazza that offers lifestyle and luxury shops and often called the Luxury lifestyle center of Metro Manila. The piazza features modern architecture that will make you think you're somewhere near the world of Star Wars, stare, drool and be amazed at the public art displayed there. Coffee shops and tea shops are found around this area, as well as furniture and clothing stores and is located in Fort Bonifacio Global City, Taguig. The 4 largest mall operators are SM, Gaisano, Ayala and Robinson's with branches around the archipelago., 338173=In 2010, Philippine banks started to charge \u20b1200 per transaction for using foreign cards in their ATM machines, in addition to cash withdrawal and exchange fees already imposed by your bank. Considering small transaction limits, this adds at least 2-4% to the amount withdrawn - thus, bringing in cash and exchanging it to peso in the bank generally will be cheaper., 405793=Keep in mind that the Marcos years (1965-1986) can be a polarizing topic within the Philippines. Visitors will find that the northern Ilokano Population view the regime as an era of stability, while the metropolitan areas in the south of Luzon take strong pride in the people's power or \"EDSA\" revolution that deposed the regime. Either way it is best to assess the speaker's opinion prior to approaching the topic., 282097=Since the Philippines is an archipelago, the easiest way to move between islands is by plane. Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific and Airphil Express have significant domestic operations, linking many major towns and cities with Manila and Cebu, while Zest Airways and SEAIR also serve a few secondary destinations. AirAsia Philippines started it's operation in March 2012, with a few domestic flights to the key destinations. There are also several smaller carriers which serve resort destinations (such as Amanpulo in Palawan), as well as more remote destinations. While larger cities are served by jet aircraft, many destinations and less busy routes are served by propeller-driven planes., 287806=It is possible to pre-book seats on intercity trains by calling the PNR at +63 (2) 319-0044. Pre-booking seats is recommended during peak travel seasons (especially during Holy Week and in September, during the Pe\u00f1afrancia Festival in Naga), where trains can be full. However, the PNR does send a second, all-economy supplementary overnight train on certain days during peak season if traffic demand warrants it. Timetables and fares for all services, including supplementary services, are announced on the PNR's website and also on its official Facebook profile [52]., 288929=The Philippines' road network is centered on Manila. Outside Luzon, larger islands' road networks converge on the largest city or cities (for example, Cebu City for Cebu, Iloilo City for Panay and Puerto Princesa for Palawan), while smaller islands (such as Marinduque, Catanduanes and Camiguin) usually have a road circling the entire island. The Philippines has one highway which is part of the Asian Highway Network: the Pan-Philippine Highway (AH26), also known locally as the Maharlika Highway. The highway begins in Laoag and ends in Zamboanga City, traversing through Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao. However, it is also the only highway in the Asian Highway Network which is not connected to any other highway: it is not possible to enter the Philippines by car., 333914=The Philippine Peso(\u20b1)(PHP) is the official currency and in almost all cases the only currency recognised for normal transactions. The only other currency that would be recognised in rare cases would be the US Dollar. As of May 2011, one U.S. dollar trades at around \u20b143., 408196=There are three major companies operating GSM 900/1800 networks: Globe[105], Smart[106] and Sun Cellular [107]. Your home provider at home should have agreements with one of these providers so check with them before leaving home. Roaming may be quite expensive just as elsewhere however, pre-paid SIM cards of these networks are easy to acquire and cost as little as \u20b130 and provide a cheaper alternative. If your unit is locked to your home service provider, cellphone repair shops in various malls have ways of unlocking (the typical fee to unlock is \u20b1300 but can go as high as \u20b12,000 for certain units like a Blackberry). If you don't have a phone to begin with, a complete pre-paid kit with phone and SIM can be purchased for as little as \u20b11,500. Phones that come with these sot of deals are usually locked to a local network provider, and you would need to have it unlocked before leaving if you plan on using it back home., 298298=Most of the taxi drivers nowadays charge people with fares not based on the meters, especially during peak hours. If you encounter this say \"no\" and say that drivers don't have a right to give you a fare that is double and not based on the meters, this is usually encountered by tourists as well as middle class-elite class Filipinos. If this happens get out of the taxi, threaten the driver you will call the police hotline;Philippine National Police[59] (PNP) tel:(+632)722-0650 start dialing your cellphone to make him believe you are calling the police or either call the MMDA[60](Metro Manila Development Authority) hotline; 136 if you're within Manila, you can also text the police at 2920 and your message must be as follows; PNP(space)(message), for your complaints. In 2009, some taxis have installed meters which give out receipts, ask for a receipt if they have one., 218553=As of 2010, the Philippines has a population estimated at 93 million and growing very rapidly. From its long history of Western influence, 377 years by the Spaniards and 49 years by the Americans, its people have evolved as a unique blend of East and West in both appearance and culture. Filipinos are largely Austronesian (more specifically Malayo-Polynesian)in terms of ethnic origin. However, many people, particularly in the cities of Luzon and the Visayas, have Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Spanish and American mixtures, whereas those living in the provinces are mostly of pure Austronesian origin (known as \"native\"). Many Muslims in the Sulu archipelago near Borneo have Arab, Indian and Chinese mixtures. The four largest foreign minorities in the country are as follows: Chinese, Koreans, and Indian, and the Japanese. Also of significance are the Americans, Indonesians, and Arabs. Pure Spaniards and other Europeans form a very small proportion in the country's population.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "On the Mayon Limited, only reclining air-conditioned economy class (\"deluxe\") and regular economy class are offered. However, unlike the Bicol Express, the Mayon Limited provides service using two different trains: the \"deluxe\" service operates on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while the \"economy\" service operates on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. Passengers on PNR intercity services are entitled to a free baggage allowance of 20 kilograms. It is possible to pre-book seats on intercity trains by calling the PNR at +63 (2) 319-0044. Pre-booking seats is recommended during peak travel seasons (especially during Holy Week and in September, during the Pe\u00f1afrancia Festival in Naga), where trains can be full.

Timetables and fares for all services, including supplementary services, are announced on the PNR's website and also on its official Facebook profile [52]. The PNR also operates the Commuter Express in Metro Manila, a once-daily commuter service between Manila and Bi\u00f1an, Laguna (which is also part of the Commuter Express, but uses different trains), and the Bicol Commuter between Naga and towns in Camarines Sur and Albay.
