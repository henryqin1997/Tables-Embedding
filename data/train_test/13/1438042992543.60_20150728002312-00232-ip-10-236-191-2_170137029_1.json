June 01, 2013 10:26 PM\"Now that is funny because all you can do is laugh. All the people that came out after 2 good Henry starts and the records show he had no High Leverage appearances this season.He creates his own High Leverage but had come into start an inning in High Leverage.Again, on Rizzo., 79875=They were basically healthy in April. They were at the same point, respective of the Braves, that they are in now. You can keep saying that they're great. The evidence says they're not., 92014=David Proctor said\u2026\"Hrod should be gone now, again, if we have depth in the minors, lets see it. Hrod is a testimonial to Rizzo's stupidity\"Find me a GM who hasn't made a mistake.your missing my point\u2026. yes every GM makes a mistake, I have no problem with the Hrod experiment in 2011 and 2012 . The issue is Rizzo never admits a mistake and why that clown is on this roster is stunning, a good GM would have cut him long ago., 157944=In car it hasn't been posted, grade 1 (least severe) lat strain for Stras.http://m.washingtonpost.com/blogs/nationals-journal/wp/2013/06/02/stephen-strasburg-has-a-grade-1-lat-strain/Cueto was out for over a month with the same kind of injury\u2026 hopefully Stras' heals faster\u2026, 103919=Haven't read the first comment on this thread. All I have to say is that I see no scenario where either Danny Espinosa or Henry Rodriguez will provide the clutch performance required by a supposed playoff caliber team.Rizzo, you better tell your Dad and Davey that they are wrong. This isn't 1980. Baseball has evolved. Holding runners, throwing strikes, putting the bat on the ball sound basic but if you allow players on your roster to earn paychecks without the ability to perform those simple tasks, you are cheating all of us.The fans and most certainly the ownership demand more.Both you and Davey need to check your ego at the door and do the things necessary to make this franchise perform up to it's maximum capability.Do it!, 200541=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

Click here for past audio clips., 54681=Look at Mark's post \"No DL for Strass\" He probably needs the DL, but no, Rizzo and Davey will destroy this young man and when they do, they will always say, look at what we did in 2012, we shut him down., 144070=http://www.masnsports.com/nationals_pastime/2013/06/johnson-discusses-nats-missed-opportunities-in-2-1-10-inning-loss.htmlThere are some quotes from Davey. Don't see anything about a sac squeeze., 187160=Njack also has a problem with Davey's endless support of Danny and HROD\u2026.amazingly insightful comments that only someone with his connections and experience could see this early in in just a few 1000 AB's and 100 MBL appearances. Man I wish I had that eye., 108758=I am glad that the last thing I'm reading before going to bed is NatsLady's comment at 11:12. The rest of this thread was pretty hard to take., 213063=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 172942=Fife and Wade (Dodgers' pitchers) both went on the DL in April for bursitis\u2026 Not sure how long they were down\u2026Based on what it is (inflammation of bursae\u2013sacs of fluid that prevent friction where bones meet at a joint) I can imagine it taking time to heal. Seems like even simply walking could aggravate it., 119060=If you don't see the good in this game, I feel sorry for you. Storen (about whom there was so much worry a week ago), perfect. Abad, excellent. Gio (did people say his 2012 was a fluke, yes I heard that), excellent. No errors, including RZ making an overhand throw. LaRoche, clutch double. Desi, clutch single. Suzuki and Span both look tired, though.}",
