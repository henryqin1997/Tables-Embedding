    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{115514=A colloidal silica containing polymer composition was formulated as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,844,976 and 5,073,404 from a combination of a water borne acrylic polymer (NeoCryl A-614, 33 wt. %), a water borne aliphatic polyurethane (NeoRez R-960, 6%), gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (3%), sodium aluminate (2%), crosslinker XL-25SE (2%), a UV absorber (Tinuvin\u2122 1130, 2%), a UV light stabilizer (Tinuvin\u2122 292, 1%), and an aqueous dispersion of colloidal silica (Nalco\u2122 1140, 51%). The silica-containing polymer composition was pressed into the grooves of the grooved film with a smooth round rod and excess polymer was scraped off the surface of the film. The coating was dried and cured at 82\ufffd C. for 5 minutes. Multiple coating passes can be used to more completely fill the grooves. Retroreflectivity of the coated films was measured under the same conditions as before coating., 80284=The resulting coatings were also tested for static water contact angle using a 0.01 ml droplet by essentially the method described by Zisman, W. A., in \u201cContact Angle, Wettability, and Adhesion,\u201d Advances in Chemistry, Series 43, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C. (1964). An ESCA test comprised evaluating the samples for surface fluorine content using a \ufffd inch by \ufffd inch portion of the coated sample using a Fison F Inspector\u2122 ESCA analyzer. The sample was scanned from 0 electron volts to 1100 electron volts, and the results were averaged for four scans., 59068=A thermal stabilizer/antioxidant can also be added to the polymeric material to reduce the amount of yellowing as a result of weathering. Examples of such materials include, but are not limited to, low melting hindered phenols and triesters. Specific examples include 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol commercially available under the trade designation Ultranox\u2122 226 antioxidant from Borg Warner Chemicals, Inc., Parkersburg, N.Y.; octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxycinnamate commercially available under the trade designations Isonox\u2122 132 antioxidant (Schenectady Chemicals, Inc., Schenectady, N.Y.) or Vanox\u2122 1320 antioxidant (Vanderbilt Co., Inc., Norwalk, Conn.). The coating precursor composition can include an amount of the thermal stabilizer/antioxidant to impart the desired result. Preferably, the thermal stabilizer/antioxidant is present in an amount up to about 3% by weight, and more preferably about 0.5-1%, based on the total weight of the coating precursor composition without solvent. Different thermal stabilizers/antioxidants can be used if desired., 98591=Using a procedure analogous to Example 1, a fluoropolymer composition was prepared by mixing 39 wt% MeFOSEMA, 5 wt% Norblock\u2122 7966, 5 wt % silane A-174, 22 wt % acrylic acid, 4 wt % mercaptopropionic acid (HSCH2CH2CO2H), and 25% methylmethacrylate. This fluoropolymer dispersion was blended with CX-WS-300 terpolymer at a 1.0:09 molar ratio of carboxylic group: isopropenyl group of the resulting formulation was further mixed with colloidal silica (Nalco 2329) according to the method of Example 1, coated on a PET film, dried, and cured at 120\ufffd C. for 5 minutes., 66526=A major surface of the article is then treated to convert portions of that surface to a hydrophilic surface. There are a variety of ways in which this can be accomplished. The exposed major surface may be corona treated, oxygen plasma treated (see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,772,488 incorporated herein by reference), chemically treated such as with a chemical etchant or ozone treated. When using corona treatment, the energy level typically is at least 1 joule/cm2 (j/cm2), preferably about 2-20 j/cm2. The corona treatment exposes the silica particles 6 in layer 5 to produce hydrophilic regions while polymer 8, which does not contain silica particles, remains hydrophobic. The type of surface treatment is described or detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/663,965 filed Jun. 14, 1996, entitled Polymeric Article Having Improved Hydrophilizing and Method of Making Same., 102969=Examples 17-21 were prepared by combining a ceramer precursor composition (\u201cceramer\u201d) with a fluorosilane or an acrylate-functionalized fluorochemical. The ceramer contained 45.6 wt % colloidal silica particles Nalco\u2122 1034A (Nalco\u2122 Co. CAS 7631-86-9), 27.2 wt % hydroxyethylacrylate, 11.3 wt % gamma-methylacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, and 15.9 wt % pentaerythritol triacrylate (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,885,332 and 5,104,929). Example 17 was prepared from 97.0 wt % ceramer with 0.5 wt % FOMA. Example 18 was prepared from 96.5 wt % ceramer with 1.0 wt % FOMA. Examples 19 and 20 were prepared from 97.0 wt % ceramer with 0.5 wt % BuFOSEA and 0.5 wt % FC-405, respectively. Example 21 was prepared from 96.5 wt % ceramer with 1.0 wt % FC-405. Example 22 contained 97.5 wt % ceramer. Examples 17-22 all contained 2.5 wt % of the photoinitiator Darocure\u21221173 and contained between 44.0 and 44.5 wt % siO2., 58419=An ozone stabilizer may also be added to the polymeric material. Examples of ozone stabilizers include, but are not limited to, hindered amines such as Irgonox\u2122 1010 available from Ciba-Geigy and phenoltriazine commercially available from Aldrich. The coating composition can include an amount of an ozone stabilizer to impart the desired result. Preferably, the ozone stabilizer is present in an amount up to about 1% by weight, more preferably about 0.1-1.0%, and most preferably about 0.3-0.5%, based on the total weight of the coating precursor composition without solvent. Different ozone stabilizers can be used if desired., 50482=A wide variety of colloidal silica particles are usable in the silica-containing polymer layers of the invention. Many such colloidal silica dispersions are available commercially under such trade names as Ludo\u2122 (available from E.I. Dupont de Nemours and Co., Inc., Wilmington, Del.), Nyacol\u2122 (Nyacol Co., Ashland, Mass.), and Nalco\u2122 (Nalco Chemical Co., Oak Brook, Ill.). Examples of silica sols that have been found useful include: Nalco\u2122 2327 and 2329, having silica particle sizes of about 20 and 75 nanometers (nm) respectively and a concentration in water of about 40 weight percent; Ludox\u2122 AS-40, having a particle size of about 22 nm, an ammonia counterion and a concentration in water of about 40 weight percent. The silica particles preferably have an average particle diameter of 1 to 100 nm, more preferably 5 to 50 nm. Examples of other suitable colloidal silicas are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,394., 44507=The polymeric materials used in the invention should be capable of transmitting light when the article is intended for use on an optical surface such as a retroreflective sheeting or a window. In a preferred embodiment, the polymeric materials are a fluoropolymer or polymeric blend containing a fluoropolymer. An advantage of fluoropolymer films is that they can be highly inert and can remain hydrophobic even after exposure to oxidizing treatments such as corona treatment and plasma oxidation. Fluoropolymers and acrylates are preferred in some embodiments because they tend to have good outdoor stability and are generally inert to microbial attack. Examples of preferred fluoropolymers include: transparent polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blended in a weight ratio between about 80:20 to 20:80, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,042,924; copolymers of PVDF with hexafluoropropylene (HFP); copolymers of PVDF with tetrafluoroethylene (TFE); copolymers of PVDF with chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE); and copolymers of TFE, HFP and vinylidene fluoride (VDF). Multilayer films containing fluoropolymer layers (preferably as a topmost, surface layer) with other transparent polymer layers are also useful. For example, organic polymer films such as PMMA, aliphatic polyurethane, or clear polyolefin copolymer may be combined with a fluoropolymer surface layer. Other, suitable transparent polymeric materials include acrylate polymers, such as PMMA, acrylic rubber modified PMMA, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyolefins and aliphatic polyurethanes., 79965=The abrasion resistance of the coatings was determined by measuring the resulting % haze of a film sample using ASTM D-1044-90 on a Teledyne Tabor Abraser with a 500 g load and a pair of CS-10F Calibrase\u2122. The less haze resulting from the abrasion, the higher the abrasion resistance of the coating., 55633=Examples of photoinitiators that generate a free radical source when exposed to visible light radiation include, but are not limited to, benzophenones. Examples of photoinitiators that generate a free radical source when exposed to ultraviolet light include, but are not limited to, organic peroxides, azo compounds, quinones, benzophenones, nitroso compounds, acryl halides, hydrozones, mercapto compounds, pyrylium compounds, tracrylimidazoles, bisimidazoles, chloroalkyltriazines, benzoin, benzoin methyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin isopropyl ether, benzoin isobutyl ethers and methylbenzoin, diketones such as benzil and diacetyl, phenones such as acetophenone, 2,2,2-tri-bromo-1-phenylethanone, 2,2-diethoxyacetophenone, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, 2,2,2,-tribromo-1(2-nitrophenyl)ethanone, benzophenone, and 4,4-bis(dimethyamino)benzophenone. Examples of commercially available ultraviolet photoinitiators include, but are not limited to, those available under the trade designations Irgacure\u2122 184 (1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone), Irgacure\u2122 369 (2-benzyl-2-N,N-dimethylamino-1-(4-morpholinophenyl)-1-butanone),and Darocur\u2122 1173 (2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one) from Ciba-Geigy. Typically, if used, an amount of an initiator is included in the precursor composition to effect the desired level and rate of cure. Preferably, the initiator is used in an amount of about 0.1-10%, and more preferably about 2-4% by weight, based on the total weight of the coating precursor composition without solvent. Different initiators also can be used if desired., 114509=Grooved films were made by stamping PMMA or a PMMA/PVDF (40/60 wt %) blend. Examples of making grooved films are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,260,220 and 4,906,070. The copper tooling for stamping the square wave grooved films of the invention was made by diamond turning using a precision lathe. A 75 \u03bcm thick film was placed on top of a copper mold and pressed at an embossing temperature of about 205\ufffd C. and a pressure between 200 psi (1.4 MPa) and 1000 psi (7 MPa). After cooling the press, the grooved film was removed from the mold. The films were made with a square-wave pattern (dimensions in \u03bcm: top width\ufffdbottom width\ufffddepth) or with a v-cut. The films were laminated via a clear acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive (Scotch\u2122 Tape 9172 MP) onto retroreflective sheeting LDP-3970 or VIP-3990. Retroreflectivity of these films was measured at an entrance angle of \u22124\ufffd and an observation angle of 0.2\ufffd (see ASTM E810-936). Retroreflectivity of these films is shown in Table III., 54402=Suitable UV absorbers include benzotriazoles, benzophenones, oxanilides, and aryl benzoates. One suitable UV light absorber is Uvinul\u2122 N-539 (2-ethylhexyl-2-cyano-3,3-diphenylacrylate) available from BASF, Parsippany, N.J. In addition to UV absorbers, suitable UV stabilizers include hindered amines and phenolic antioxidants. Suitable UV absorbers and stabilizers include Tinuvin\u2122 292, 328 and 1130 available from Ciba-Geigy Corp. of Ardsley, N.Y. UV absorbers and stabilizers can improve weatherability and reduce yellowing of the coating. Preferably, the ultraviolet stabilizer or absorber is present in an amount up to about 10% by weight, and more preferably about 1-5%, based on the total weight of the coating precursor composition without solvent. Different ultraviolet stabilizers and absorbers can be used if desired.}",
