If you're not seeing the progress you want to see on your ToDo item, let people know, ask for ideas and help. Do as much (or as little) actual work on that item as your expertise and time allow. Help coordinate work on that ToDo item to avoid duplication of effort Keep track of the status of that ToDo item What am I promising to do if I put my name in a \"Contact\" box? Does it have a practical roadmap to reach success? Does it have the specific resources/expertise it needs? Is it making progress or is it stuck? Is the project making good use of the shop space it occupies? How can I help with the injection molding project? What do we need to do to make these machines a practical tool for our members? The intention of these ToDo lists is to maintain current answers to several different questions: ToDo List Notes Injection Molding Shop Consumables Consumables Arburg C4b Arburg ALLROUNDER 150 Equipment Think about what you are doing.
