C1 and C2 must be limited, accurately controlled, and not affected by variables such as metalization etch and dielectric changes. There is a physical/electrical L-C value trade-off required to minimize layout area and maximize filter performance. For a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention, interdigitated, planar capacitors were selected. Such capacitors can be fabricated directly on a MIC ceramic or a MMIC gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate, taking advantage of precision etched edge coupled fingers to obtain precisely accurate center frequency and band-pass electrical performance. A MIC interdigitated capacitor can be used and comprises an approximately 0.127 mm (5 mil) metalization width and 0.127 mm (5 mil) metalization gap. A MMIC interdigitated capacitor uses 5 micron metalization width and 5 micron metalization gap. A nominal capacitance value of up to ten picofarads (pF) is practical and fulfills the requirements for typical 800 MHz band pass filters described in this disclosure. By using 5 micron MMIC technology for example, a 12.7 mm\ufffd12.7 mm (0.5 inches\ufffd0.5 inches) MIC 800 MHz filter layout area can be reduced by a factor of 35, to less than approximately 0.1534 mm (0.06 inches)\ufffd0.3068 mm (0.12 inches).}",

While the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific embodiment, many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, the invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims. Tuning inaccuracy resulting from the use of non-precision capacitor and inductor fabrication. Excessive component losses which are proportionate to the selection of inductor size or transmission line length and width; and Excessive component volume and area resulting from the use of conventional components and fabrication techniques; Thus, transmission line filters for MIC and MMIC applications have been described which overcomes specific problems and accomplishes certain advantages relative to prior art methods and mechanisms. The improvements over known technology are significant. In addition to cost reduction, the filters described and documented within this disclosure solve the following design problems associated with contemporary filter designs: Applications of the present disclosure will be especially useful in current and future applications that require maximum filter performance at a lower cost within an allotted circuit area, particularly in MMIC applications where the cost is directly proportionate to substrate area. The examples shown are appropriate for receivers and transmitters,",
