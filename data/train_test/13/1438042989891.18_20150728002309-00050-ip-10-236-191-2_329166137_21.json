We had a little block party on our little block yesterday. It was all terribly pleasant, and we got to meet a lot of our neighbors for the first time. Hudson the wonder dog probably had the best time of all though. In addition to getting to meet a bunch of kids, which is heaven for her, there was all manner of food spillage to snorfle around for on the street. Potato chips? Whoosh. Pretzels? Whoosh. Cheezy poofs? Whoosh. All right up the canine vacuum cleaner, to the point where she didn't touch her dinner. I know Cheetos have their animated cheetah spokesman, but if there's a chip or pretzel company out there in need of a mascot, have I got a dog for you. Woof!
