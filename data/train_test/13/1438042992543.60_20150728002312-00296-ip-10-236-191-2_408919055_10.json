I did read the other thread by Mr Dobson about his dead E500, but this just went away on it's own I think. Anyways it freaked me out quite a bit today and got me p.o.'ed since there was actually some nice sunshine outside for once. Is this typical behavior for an auto focus camera? Can cold weather aggravate the problem? I don't think it is a locking pin problem as I always hear it click. My E500 that I've just had for a week died on me today",
