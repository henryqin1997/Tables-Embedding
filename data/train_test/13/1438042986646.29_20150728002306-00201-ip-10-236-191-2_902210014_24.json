            "There are TONS of activities paid for by your Student Activity fee, so while there are always parties, there are plenty of alternatives in the MUB to check out!",
            "Our food is ranked something like 18th in the nation for colleges, it's awesome. There is a special section for vegans and there are plenty of options for everyone.",
            "The dorms are mostly pretty nice, although there are a few buildings that students definitely try to avoid with housing. Dorm life is what you make it, if you want to participate, you're always welcome and if you would rather be left alone your privacy is respected. The RAs work very hard to make everyone feel comfortable and create a welcoming environment with biweekly socials and poster boards.",
            "I gave this three stars because the rigor is completely up to you. If you choose to take harder honors classes it will be much harder than if you take regular level classes. The gen eds are all pretty easy, but as soon as you get further into your major that changes.",
            "Take college seriously, even though it's a party school and there IS a party every night, that doesn't mean you have to go to a party every night. Don't take classes with people you already know, it's fun, but if you spend time talking to your friends you'll miss out on the lecture and annoy people around you!",
            "Great school, happy people and lots of parties!"

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{552874=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 428215=The academics of UNH can range, as they do with most institutions. UNH does offer much of everything though and also offers many times to try and get into that class you want. UNH also offers J-term (January Term) or classes during the rest of the university's winter vacation time. Class can range and I'm positive that everyone has found one class that has inspired them, intrigued them, or challenged them; but nonetheless I'm sure they loved it., 148322=College is expensive, that's hard to get around, but I really feel that my money is going to good use. Just since I started in the fall of 2011 I feel that I am a totally transformed person. I have learned so much and feel really lucky to be a student at a university that offers so much., 2055=One the first night that freshmen come to school, there\u2019s an event called \u201cWildActs.\u201d It\u2019s an improv show that focuses on many aspects of college life. There\u2019s a lot of school spirit during Basketball and football games. Also, there\u2019s Jukebox, which brings students to learn about extracurricular activities, raffles, and IHOP gives out free pancakes, and you get a lot of free stuff. Also, there\u2019s an annual parade where everyone, including the school\u2019s fraternities and sororities make floats for prizes. There are endless possibilities-all you have to do is get involved. Every time you go to the MUB, they have events open to the public that are informative. Also they are big concerts near the end of the semester. I was told last year that there was a Snoop Dogg concert, and that this year Lupe Fiasco concert is going to be sold out. Sometimes, they also invite people to give lectures-I met Angela Davis during the Martin Luther King Celebration in January., 12192=I am really enjoying attending UNH. There are so many clubs and organizations to get involved in, ranging from the College Democrats, to the Organic Gardening Club, to Greek Life, to Fencing. There is truly a niche for everyone, and there is always something going on. Aside from academics, concerts and guests are brought to UNH to perform. In December, the comedian Bo Burnham came to the Whittemore Center. The dorms are above average and although campus incidents occur, as is inevitable with a school the size of UNH, I feel safe on campus. There is a free bus for students which travels to surrounding towns such as Portsmouth, Dover and Newmarket, and the nearby train station travels throughout the northeast (Boston, Portland, etc.) Even though UNH is situated in Durham, New Hampshire, I have never felt isolated whatsoever. I enjoy the classes, I enjoy the community, and I enjoy the social aspect of UNH., 250911=DHOP is the place to be on a weekend night around 12:30 am., 227553=The campus' three dining halls are well-placed, and the availability of food is exceptionally good. During the week, at least one dining hall is always open from 7:30 am straight through to 11:00 pm. Food quality is excellent, and eating healthy is definitely an option, aided by nutrition guides. The staff is accommodating to diners with special dietary needs as long as the student is willing to consistently stay in contact with dining hall administrators., 122084=unh has three dining halls that always have freshly cooked food everyday and always have variety. the dining halls often participate in holidays and theme nights (such as valentine's day, mardi gras, march madness, etc), which give the students a refreshing dining experience. one thing that sets unh dining apart from other colleges is that unh dining has a messaging system called \u201cnapkin notes.\u201d with napkin notes, students can write questions, suggestions, and comments on napkins and deposit them into a box to await a response. the napkin notes are then responded to by the dining hall manager an pinned up on a bulletin board outside of the dining hall for everyone to see. i think that it is a very clever way for students to express their opinions and comments directly to the person who is in charge of their food. the manager often takes students' suggestions and does whatever it takes to give unh students pleasant, satisfactory dining experiences., 87694=The tips i have from when i visited were that it is better to have a high GPA and a 1900 on the SATs to get the best scholarships. The lowest score for a scholarship is 1780.}",

Tips for prospective students Trust your instincts and don't be afraid to ask for help. Make use of CFAR, and other academic resources that are free. Don't wait until the last two weeks of classes to try and salvage your grade, get help the second you start struggling. Bang for the buck All I have to say is pic your classes based on the prof. and make use of ratemyprofessor.com, classes are the hardest when you have a professor you can't stand. Am enjoying being here At first UNH was intimidating for me and wasn't even in my top 5 collages and yet their curriculum was just as good as all the other schools",
