If it is clear where they belong, just drop them in, adding labels as necessary. Avoid leaving anything in an unlabeled drawer or bin. If you don't know where something belongs, ask Nate B, or leave a note indicating your intent and he will find or make a place so the parts can remain organized. If there's no cost label and you don't know what a component goes for, find it on http://mouser.com/ and add 10% to cover shipping. If you need change, break your bills with change from the cup in the fridge. However, these funds go to different places, so don't just drop money in the wrong cup. Some drawers are now labeled with prices, usually a cost \"C\" which is what it costs us to restock, and a second value for comparison, like \"RS\" for Radio Shack's price on an equivalent item. These are just FYI, and all we ask is that you cover the cost. Any markup beyond that is up to you, but you can be pretty generous and still save a bundle compared to retail. A buck here and there helps the selection continue to grow! The gray and gray/yellow drawers on the back wall are the electronics \"store\". These components are for anyone who has a use for",
