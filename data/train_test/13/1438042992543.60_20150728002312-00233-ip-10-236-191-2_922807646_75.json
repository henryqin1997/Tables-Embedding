            "Campus safety is one of the best I know. Never had any problems or worries about walking campus alone at late hours as a female student. There have been a few incidents near, but off campus. It's generally not a big concern for many students.",
            "With the guy to girl ratio around 6:1, there are about 3 sororities and about 18 fraternities. Greek life is very social and active around campus. Many Greeks help out with volunteer work and other activities outside of their house. Greek housing can range from very ornate to run-down depending on different chapters.",
            "Many different options and interests to choose from. We have clubs ranging from volunteering committees to working with design teams. Many organizations are very diverse and open to anyone interested. Most students are very involved around campus activities.",
            "Many students here could be classified as nerds/geeks/socially awkward. However, if you are none of the above, you'll still fit in just fine. There's a little bit of every kind of person.",
            "On St. Pat's, we go crazy. You kindof just have to be there.",
            "Definitely worth it. Even as a current student, struggling to get by financially and academically, I would say the experiences you get out of this school is definitely worth how much they are asking (and they aren't asking for a little!). If I could choose again, I would not change a thing.",
            "S&T throws the most amazing parties that you can find just about any night of the week - especially starting Thursday to the weekend. Not much is outside of campus, but on campus usually has multiple events for students during the day.",
            "Food quality could be improved. However, there are many options to choose from along with many meal plan selections.",
            "People are very kind and friendly in the campus community. Many students are accepting and will be open to talk to anyone. Dorms are social and interactive with all students willing to participate.",
            "Definitely the most rigorous school I know. Courses go very in depth and sometimes relearning the material on your own is necessary. Studying 3 hours for every credit hour you take is not over working. Don't underestimate the difficulty of this school.",
            "Be prepared! This school is not very selective when it comes to admitting new students, but when you get abroad, it will not be an easy ride. You have to make sure to focus on your grades and studies - even when the parties here get really crazy!",
            "Missouri University of Science and Technology is an exceptional school for serious and dedicated students. It is a very difficult school, but well worth the knowledge and experiences gained during enrollment. If you attend Science and Technology, you will have great opportunities to obtain internships, co-ops, and successful careers."

The work load seems to really build up sometimes and the Male to Female ratio is 3:1 to name a few. Things like the annual St. Pat's celebration always make up for stuff like that though., 13722=Engineers. This school gives you the knowledge to be successful in whichever area you're interested in.

Among the most popular extracurricular activities here are student design teams. These are teams of students that build engineering marvels: solar cars, solar houses, F1 racing cars, fast human powered machines, satellites, etcetera, etcetera. These are the kinds of students that thrive here at S&T, and the kinds of classmates and peers that you will constantly be interacting with. If a student-run organization that genetically engineers bacteria for competitions is the kind of thing that sends shivers down your spine, this is the place for you. Tips for prospective students Although S&T offers a few majors in History and English, it's really an engineering and science school at its core. I know a few humanities majors here, but usually they attend for reasons other than the curriculum (baseball, living local, etc.) I recommend",
