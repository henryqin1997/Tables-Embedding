            "You are getting a great education for being so affordable. You can't hardly find room and board for the amount you pay for classes per semester.",
            "I didn't do much outside of classes with Sinclair, but meeting people in my classes and hanging out with them in between classes was fun.",
            "Food in the cafeteria is good. Each day they have specials so you don't have the same options each day. They have a few sub shops in some buildings that are further away from the main cafeteria.",
            "Sinclair doesn't have dorms.",
            "My classes were challenging, but I walked away learning something from each class. Teachers are available to help for the most part.",
            "Meet with an advisor to schedule your classes, but try to go to the same one each time. There are a lot of advisors, because there are a lot of students, but it is less confusing to stick with the same one.",
            "Sinclair is a great place to start your college career. The classes are affordable and easily fit into your life. I had a great experience at Sinclair."

The Professors at Sinclair are dedicated and willing to help you out in any level of your academic achievement, and will g go out of their way to make sure you truly understand what you are expected to learn in your field, and also in the prerequisite courses.
