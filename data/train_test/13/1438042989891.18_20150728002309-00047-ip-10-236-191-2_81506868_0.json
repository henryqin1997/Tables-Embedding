You can control the dot to move up and down to avoid the bars by clicking the buttons. Clicking on buttons will cause a voltage change on gpio pins, which will result the movement of dot. Bars are generated according to several patterns. The longer the game lasts, the faster bars are generated and the higher the score you get. Executive Summary (Inline Comment) Score: 10/100 Comments: I'm looking forward to seeing this. 00 Late 00 Demo 00 Conclusions 00 Future Work 00 Work Breakdown 00 Theory of Operation 00 Highlights - Not done 08 User Instructions 00 Installation Instructions - Not done 09 Executive Summary - Good, nice picture  I'm using the following template to grade.
