The RSD halted \u00a0 the process to commission the Hammond, LA-based \u00a0 firm of Holly + Smith to perform a feasibility study \u00a0 for the site. Its findings were made public at an \u00a0 RSD-hosted community meeting on July 21st, while \u00a0 the official consultation process resumed July 29th. \u00a0, 12101=Holly + Smith considered two options for the site, total demolition and replacement with a new school building versus restoration of and addition to the historic building. The firm was not charged with formally designing either scenario, only with assessing current conditions and proposing hypothetical schematics. It found that both options were comparable in most respects, though estimated that the renovation scenario would cost an additional $900,000. The architects neglected to calculate how demolition costs would help to close that gap, but either way, the project would cost between $20 million and $21 million. RSD officials have asserted that either scenario would be completed by 2013.}",
