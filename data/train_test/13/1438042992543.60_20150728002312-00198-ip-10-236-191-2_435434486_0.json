So if you worry about mosquitos, choose a tour during the dry season. Use DEET or Incognito Insect repellent, wear long sleeves and long trousers and you will be fine. The sun is much more powerful than in the Mediterranean, therefore caution and moderation are needed on the tropical beaches of Manuel Antonio, not just suncream!, 30602=Exclusive photographic charter in the Svalbard Archipelago accompanied by Paul Goldstein and Mark Carwardine.
