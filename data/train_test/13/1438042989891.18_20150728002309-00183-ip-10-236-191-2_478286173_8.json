Such variations, if within the spirit and scope of the claims appended hereto, are intended to be protected by any patent issuing hereon. The description of the preferred embodiment as set forth is primarily for illustrative purposes only, and is not meant to be limiting of the scope of this invention. FIG. 5 discloses a slightly modified embodiment of this invention, such modification being more in the cylindrical member forming the core itself, in this particular instance, being in the shape of a cone 3. The cone is formed with a similar type transfer ring 4 approximate its downwardly disposed base, and once again this ring is configured to provide a shallow depression to form the type of cavity for the purposes as previously described. But, it is likewise conceivable that no such cavity may be provided in the vicinity of the transfer ring, but rather, the slip resistant coating may be applied directly to the surface of the cylinder or cone in either a narrow or wide band to form the transfer ring thereat. Also, as previously analyzed, it is likely that the entire surface of this cone, just as with the cylinder, could be coated with this slip resistant material so that the entire device exhibits the attributes of an increased coefficient of friction that",
