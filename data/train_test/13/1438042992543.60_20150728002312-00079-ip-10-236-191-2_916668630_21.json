            "Personally, I think UTK is great for any type of student. Since I've been here I have seen and met so many different types of people on and off campus. Before I moved up here I thought I was going to hate it, but it wasn't until I got into the flow of things that i realized I was actually enjoying college. Big schools aren't for everyone but you won't know unless you give it a shot.",
            "Definitely apply earlier than later. Also make sure you have looked at the available majors offered here so you aren't wasting your time taking classes you don't need or you come here without knowing whether or not your major is being offered. Another thing, I think it would be best that you get your general education classes out of the way the first year so you can spend the remainder of your college career focussing on classes for your major. Overall, I would high recommend that you attend the University of Tennessee!",
            "Prices are a bit expensive but you have to look at the fact of how big this university is and all of the students who go here. I would recommend applying for scholarships while you're still in high school and also while you're attending to help with expenses.",
            "I absolutely love this university. At first, I was worried about the size and amount of student who attend UTK, but that changed after the first couple of weeks. It's very easy to learn your way around campus and everyone is very helpful if you don't know where your class is. My college experience is more than I ever thought it would be since I've been here at UTK. I was thinking about not coming here and staying home for college but I am more than glad I decided to come here.",
            "Since I began classes at UTK I have learned more than I ever thought I would. The classes here are very good. The professors I have had so far make the material very well understood by using real life examples rather than just throwing all of the information in out face and not telling us why it is useful to know it in the future."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{672297=The seal on Pedestrian Parkway is said to be cursed, and anyone who steps on it is said to take longer than 4 years to graduate. The Hill on campus is historic, and has been around since 1794. It is where a lot of science and math classrooms are located. There is the pass the torch ceremony for incoming freshmen. You sit with your entire freshman class in an auditorium and listen to a presentation by your administration. Once this presentation is over, everyone lights an individual candle. It's a really neat experience., 882229=University of Tennessee is a public institution that was founded in 1794. It has a total undergraduate enrollment of 21,214, its setting is urban, and the campus size is 560 acres. USNEWS Report ranks University of Tennessee no. 101 best university in the nation. The school is located in Knoxville, one of the state\u00e2??s largest cities, and is the flagship campus for the state school. Close to 40 percent of students join a fraternity or sorority. The UT sports teams are known as the Vols and the Lady Vols, short for Volunteers. The teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, and football season is a particularly big draw at the school., 212488=Apply before November 1! Definitly increases your chances of scholarships., 693145=They serve breakfast till 2:30 on weekends!, 744585=the whole campus is a tradition--Big Orange Country, Rocky Top. UT is one of the oldest colleges in the country, founded in 1794. everybody knows Rocky Top, and you'll sing it a lot in the fall., 842803=The University of Tennessee has a special alert system set up for cell phones that alerts students when something is happening on campus. I have never felt unsafe on campus, and often times, I am walking alone back to my dorm well after 10:30 p.m. All walkways are always well lit, and campus blue lights are set up everywhere., 988643=I don't like it at all. My friend loves the pizza though, so some people are cool with it. It's expensive, with crappy dining times (like 7-8:30 weekdays/Sunday and 8-2 on Saturday...) and the food is barely ample. I am a bit pickier though., 490300=Since 2007, campus safety has improved greatly! There is a text/email system so that anytime the UTPD are called, all students, faculty, staff, and even parents are notified. Another great thing I love about UTPD is that they are REAL police men and women. I feel protected knowing they could protect me., 663160=I love my roommate and my living situation. The bathrooms stay clean. I just wish we could have heat before the middle of November. It's getting cold in here., 66289=Come for a visit and just have fun. Come with your friends to the campus doesn't feel so large when you first come. When school starts, don't stay in your room, go out and meet everybody cause the fist week is where everybody is new and looking for new friends. Also if your a freshman, get a meal plan (10 meals, not unlimited because you don't get very many dining dollars) and stay in a dorm. Carrick is a great dorm because you share two rooms with 3 other people and this building is in the middle of presidential court which is where everybody hangs out and is where some of the food is. Apply early, either November 1 (for scholarship opportunities) or December 1 (application deadline). Also bring winter clothes after fall break, but keep some summer ones because the weather is really weird here. Also do bring an umbrella and or rain coat because it rains a lot. Bring some good tennis shoes because you walk everywhere everyday and flip flops will hurt you feet after a while., 1038313=1982 World Fair Park, Market Square and Krutch Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, West Town Mall, Holy Land Market on Sutherland Ave., McClung Museum (my favorite place on campus; I've attended free lectures for the public from really intersting people like photojournalist Chris Rainier and egyptologist Salima Ikram), the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, country stars in concert on campus, the Dogwood Arts Festival in the Spring, tailgate parties during football season, SEC games, clubbing on the Strip... Cute little towns like Downtown Dandridge are in close driving distance. Visit the TVA dams if you want to go to the lake. Go fishing. Drive to Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg if you want to do something touristy. Go to Dollywood or Ripley's Aquarium, or go skiing ir ride the sky lift or the really big ferris wheel in Pigeon Forge. And Atlanta, Nashville, and Chattanooga are all a few hours away., 50184=The people on campus and off are amazing, I have never in my life met such kind people! Everyone at U.T. is very helpful, I am going on my official guided 'tour' in April, however, my first visit to U.T. I went on a self-guided tour with my family. My first visit was a bit overwhelming, but a few students took the time out of their busy schedules to show me some of their favorite spots! Go Vols!, 1089527=I lived in Clement my freshman year, it's being remodeled so it won't be open until fall 2015 but I highly recommend it. However, if you're a freshman I would definitely say living in Pres Court will help you meet people and it's a lot closer to the dining hall. UT is in the process of upgrading the on-campus housing in the next few years and from what they've shown us it's gonna be awesome., 864240=There are only a couple of dorms that are really nice, but they are for upperclassman and they fill up ridiculously quick. They just raised their prices this year (2013-2014), so it is now even more expensive to live on campus (about $700 a month). While living on campus is a lot easier and allows you to walk to classes, living off campus is cheaper and has more amenities. Also, commuter parking passes cost less than non-commuter ones, and you can always take the campus busses from your parking area to your classes., 897048=I've had great professors at UT but I've also had a lot of TAs, and I hate that I'm paying so much for tuition and not getting actual professors. There's a lot of construction going on which makes it more difficult to get around campus. Also, they raised tuition 6% again this year, which means they've raised it 26% since I started at UT in 2010., 1066507=Live in presidential courtyard or in the new dorm being built now (today is April 10, 2014, I'm not sure when it will be ready.) Come into school as undecided unless you're really sure what you want to study. I didn't declare a major until Junior year, and I'm still graduating on time. Get involved with extracurricular activities early. You will make great connections and a lot of new friends., 164294=I had a 3.7 GPA, a 23 on my ACT, and a 1480 SAT score and I got in just fine, but there are some requirements., 69059=I am learning so much at The University of Tennessee so far. I just started in the Fall of 2010 and feel like I have learned more than I ever did in high school. My hardest class for the fall semester was Geology (planetary bodies) because the concepts are just difficult to wrap your head around but I learned so much about other planets. I also took a math class that went over everything that was taught in high school and I feel that this will help me in my next 3.5 years and even later in life. My funnest class by far was communication studies. The teacher was vey laid back and the class felt like a family. We did numerous speeches and to be honest I was super nervous at first, but as the semester went on, I felt good when I was in front of everybody. You will definitely learn a lot here at UT and each year it gets harder and harder to get into the school. At times it will be challenging, but you will learn so much here!, 776549=The campus is very safe. I don't have to worry about getting around on campus at any time of the day, whether it's my 8 am class or my 6:45 pm class that ends at 8:35 pm. There are Emergency Call points all throughout campus as well that can be used by anyone, student or not, to instantly call for help or assistance if needed., 1013588=I plan to attend UT in aug. 2014 I have been to the campus on a site visit and I am so looking forward to my future here. Now I am hoping to find some scholarship monies.}",

It is an especially good option for undecided students because U.T. Knoxville curriculum is designed so that when you decide upon a major you do not have extra credit that you do not need, and U.T. career services has division especially for undecided students to help them decide upon a major. The career services also provides help when you wish to find a job on or off campus, so anyone wanting to work while in school would do well in choosing U.T. Knoxville. Tips for prospective students The best tip for students looking at going to UT. Knoxville is to do a college visit because that is the only way you can really get a feel of the",
