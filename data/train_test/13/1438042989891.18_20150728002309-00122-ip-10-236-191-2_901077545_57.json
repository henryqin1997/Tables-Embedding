            "GDS is hit or miss; sometimes they have great food, but too often they are out of condiments, drinks, and utensils.",
            "Unless you live in the honors dorm, you will have a pretty bad experience. Hallways are gross, elevators are broken, and everything is shoddy and in a state of disrepair.",
            "NJIT is middling as far as academics go; not terribly difficult, but definitely not a pushover.",
            "Decent teachers, decent facilities, decent food... you get the idea. NJIT is a decent school, but nothing to write home about. But, it's one of the cheapest schools around, so it's a worthwhile investment for low-income students."

Freshman dorms tend to have more events going on in them, while the Honors dorm tends to have a more social atmosphere. The upper class dorms tend to be somewhere in between. Honors dorm is by far the nicest (just built in 2013 I think and it looks like a hotel) while the others are pretty much the same. In these dorms, yeah you'll see cockroaches, smell weird smells, hear lots of dubstep, but whatever, it's all part of the college experience. If for some reason you decide not to live in one of NJIT's halls, there is a university apartment building right next to NJIT that I hear has reasonable prices.}",

Am enjoying being here It can be a depressing school, weekends are dead, very little parties, but the city is a train ride away. Campus is safe. Food is horrible.
