            "Campus is a pretty safe place to be during daytime or weekdays, but don't leave anything valuable in your vehicle.",
            "Iowa State has so many clubs, it is tough to find an interest that doesn't have a club. Students will always have something to do with their time.",
            "Iowa State is a great place for students who are willing to put work and time into their studies.",
            "The most notable traditions is the Campanile, which is a huge clock tower. Students will take their lovers and kiss at midnight when the bells strike.",
            "This is a great college, reasonably priced. It is a wonderful place to get a degree.",
            "There are so many fun things to do at Iowa State. Most people think partying when thinking about college, but there is so much more. There is a club for almost every interest, a robotics club, politics clubs, business clubs, a club that builds go carts for competition, unicycle clubs, if you want it, there is a club for it.",
            "The dining selections are great, but hilariously overpriced.",
            "Dorm life is great for a first year student, but not for students further along in their career who really need alone time for studying.",
            "The engineering classes at Iowa State are extremely well rounded. If you study hard, do the homework, and really work for it, an A is completely achievable. If you don't study, your grade will reflect it.",
            "Get involved with as many possible activities as you can, find a job on campus, and most importantly, don't be the same person you were in high school. You are in a new place, be whoever you want to be, no matter what you will find friends.",
            "Iowa State University is a great college in that it allows each student to be as involved as they want. Multiple opportunities wait around every corner, in every building, in every lecture, in every club. It is a wonderful place to explore yourself, and to develop professional relationships that will last a lifetime."

Also, there is V.E.I.S.H.E.A which is the largest student run celebration which is hosted in April every year including: music, parades, entertainment, student faculty tournaments and much more!, 261008=veishea, a week long celebration of the founding of iowa state university. starts in mid april. each day there are different events planned, and on saturday there is a parade, concerts, local food and much more. it is basically a mini state fair. campaniling, where you and your partner kiss under the campanile (big clock tower on campus) when the clock hits midnight., 845921=From dorms in Richardson court to the out of campus Maricopa being constructed for the fall of 2013 due to the high rates of returning students and incoming freshmans., 753386=If you are looking for a great college ministry check out The Salt Company. Over 1000 students and a great place to meet great friends and people who truly care. Plus its a campus organization too!, 150980=Dorms are pretty typical. Iowa State is a large campus with lots of housing,they are building a new dorm that should be done by 2017. You can go for traditional housing or suite style, lots of variety but apply early!:), 192522=I'm am loving the campus! I'm starting as a Freshman this August 2011. Though I haven't started, students there for summer classes were helpful and informative, as were the professors at orientation. I can't Wait to attend!, 881032=By the fall of 2014, Iowa State University will officially have the biggest Greek system in the United States. I live in a fraternity, and it is by far, the best decision I have made in my life., 938492=1. National Balloon Festival Indianola, IA summer 2. Des Moines Renaissance Faire 3. Amana Colonies October Fest fall, 270115=the campus is very safe! not only is there a cyclone taxi that runs until 6:00 in the morning and goes all through greek areas. also there are blue towers located strategically throughout campus with a button on them that immediately calls the isu police and/or ames police. i have never felt unsafe at isu as well., 151913=Make sure you apply early! The application opens up in July,make sure you accept your offer of admission and correctly put in data directly from transcript. Also housing fills up quick if you want to live in a specific dorm submit your housing contract ASAP. Like most likely if you submit before January you should be able to live in the place you want., 426988=Apply early for dorms, some were just built in 2004 and are AWESOME!, 147529=I'm not interested in joining greek life this year, maybe next. But I know for girls in June you will get an invitation to attend formal recruitment the week before school starts and you move in early! Great school for greek life if you want in. There's a group for everyone!:), 532851=Voed most interactive greek community in 2010, and 2011 this is due to the large number of participants as well as the many opportunities for paired events with the option to lead if you have the talents to do so.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Ames, IA has one of the lowest crime rates in the U.S., and is generally relaxed. Football and basketball games are an absolute blast, and the town does get a little crazy. The school has a very friendly atmosphere, and it's easy to meet new people. There are all kinds of big events that happen, like E-Week or VEISHEA (if you don't know about VEISHEA yet, Google it), but there are also plenty of small ones. Whether you collect famous toothbrushes or like smashing computers to bits, you can find a student organization to share your passion with others. In short, it's hard not to enjoy Iowa State. Am learning a lot You learn a lot in college, but at Iowa State you can learn anything you could imagine. The professors are true experts in their fields, and do an excellent job teaching. The living experience at ISU leads to a lot of great insights too, especially if you're living in Friley or Helser Halls.
