To the stirred mixtuze was added 240 mI of an 18 molar solution of ammonia in water (3:1 molar proportion of NH3 :Ce) to induce precipitation. The mixture was dried and then calcined at 500\ufffd C. for 2 hours. The proportion of ceria to alumina in the calcined mixture is 1:1. A copper nitrate solution was then added as described in Example 1 in a proportion of 1.5 wt % copper on total ceria/alumina. The mixture was dried and calcined as before. The surface area of the mixture was 110 m2 g-1., 37757=For a \"lean\", i.e. oxidising, simulated exhaust gas, the CO content is reduced to 0.55% and the O2 content is increased to 1%. In our tests on \"lean\" and \"rich\" mixtures the ratio ##EQU1## is 1.02 and 0.98 respectively. Within the conduit is positioned a sampling funnel (2) containing a disc of stainless steel mesh (3) 4 cm in diameter on which is a layer of quartz wool (4). A layer of catalyst (5) is superimposed on the layer of quartz wool. A sample of heated a gas from the mainstream through the conduit is drawn into the upper open end of the funnel at a rate of 2200 to PG,16 2400 ml min-1 (space velocity 20,000 hrs-1). The sample passes through the catalyst, quartz wool and mesh and into an outlet pipe (6) which is connected outside the conduit to a range of analysers (not shown). In these analysers the content of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide and propylene in the catalysed gas is measured. The percentage conversion of these constituents by -he catalyst is calculated and, in FIGS. 2 to 10 is shown plotted against the temperature of the exhaust gas flowing through the conduit. During sampling, the temperature of the exhaust gas is gradually raised from 150\ufffd to 600\ufffd C. at a rate between 1\ufffd and 20\ufffd C. min-1. In FIGS. 2 to 10 the values for CO are indicated by 0, those for NO by \u25a1 and those for C3 H6 by +., 44496=367.9 g of aluminium (III) nitrate, 252.2 g of cerium (III) nitrate and 9.1 g of copper nitrate were dissolved in 1000 ml of distilled water with the aid of a high-shear mixer. Ammonium hydrogen carbonate (380 g) dissolved in 500 ml water was slowly added with stirring. Formation of a light blue gelatinous precipitate occurred, which gradually darkened on standing. The so-formed gel was dried and then calcined at 500\ufffd C. for 2 hours. The resultant green powder had a surface area of 109 m2 g-1., 39266=100 g of hydrated oxides of a cerium containing approximately 2% lanthanum as an impurity, was slurried with 250 ml of an aqueous solution of nitric acid in water (1:4 volume) for 30 minutes to increase the surface area of the hydrated ceria. The slurry was dried overnight and then calcines at 500\ufffd C. for 2 hours. To a sample of the calcined ceria, water was slowly added to determine the point of incipient wetness (i.e. the point after which the addition of further water leaves the water unabsorbed and forming a slurry). To the reminder was then added a corresponding volume of water containing copper nitrate in a proportion equivalent to 2.2 wt % copper on ceria. In this way, the copper nitrate was distributed throughout the ceria using the minimum volume of water. The mixture was dried overnight and then calcined at 500\ufffd C. for 2 hours, to decompose the nitrate to the oxide. The surface area of the resulting copper oxide-containing ceria was 30 m2 g-1.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It can also be seen, by comparing data for formulations A and E (which have equal copper loadings), that formulation A is markedly superior to formulation E, demonstrating the benefit of maximising the intimacy of the Cu-Ce interaction. It can be seen that the formulations containing 1.5-6% copper relative to the combined weight of ceria and alumina have superior catalytic activity to that observed from the formulation containing 24% copper and prepared in the same way. This indicates that catalysts containing even more copper would be even more inferior, and hence that catalysts wherein the weight of copper oxide is less than the weight of ceria are superior. ______________________________________ Conversion Efficiency SurfaceCopper NO CO C3 H6 AreaContent 580\ufffd T25 580\ufffd T50 580\ufffd T50 m2 g-1______________________________________A 1.5 47 335 66 481 96 425 56B 3.0 45 301 70 377 92 400 39C 6.0 50 279 73 373 91 393D 24 45 341 76 514 97 446 5E 1.5 32 401 54 564 96 459______________________________________ 580\ufffd = Percentage conversions at 580\ufffd C.
