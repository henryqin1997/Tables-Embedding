            "there are numerous clubs and activities to join that are open to every student.",
            "going to the wintergreen gorge is a popular place to go here, at behrend, it's also a great sight seeing adventure. just make sure to wear some hiking boots.",
            "the education you get from penn state behrend is worth every penny!",
            "there are events on campus on the weekend. some things to do are go to the movie theater on campus, see a comedian or musician on the weekend, a midnight bingo event, sometimes there are even dances.",
            "behrend's dining option contain decent food but it's a little high on the price range. bruno's is a little pricey, but it's a great area for students and faculty to come together. dobbin's on the other hand is pricey for students who don't have a meal plan but wish to have a nice sit down meal. it's unfortunate that if a student doesn't have a meal plan that it is quite costly to even eat there.",
            "the dorm are what every college student would expect to see in a dorm. the housing offices provide every opportunity to make a comfortable living with the students on campus. the resident assistants are well trained and offer an enjoyable and protective college experience.",
            "the classes that i have attended allowed me to challenge myself and pushed me to achieve and fully reap the benefits of my hard work. behrend's professors put their students to a high standard of learning which allows for a rigorous class setting.",
            "tour the campus of behrend; it's a beautiful place, and it helps to know where everything building is located. make sure to keep in close contact with your advisor, they are your guardian angels and want nothing but to make sure you succeed. always take advantage of the offers behrend provides, there are numerous events that can provide you with a brighter future.",
            "penn state behrend from the moment i stepped onto it's campus the faculty and staff were welcoming and helped me achieve the education i'm pursuing today. behrend puts it's students first and strives to achieve a great atmosphere for everyone attending and working to make behrend the place it is today. the academic opportunities that are made everyday at behrend allow students to make bigger and better future endeavors for themselves."

This includes boots, campus is hilly and you will have to walk in the snow. The Academic and Career Planning Center in the upstairs Reed building is extremely helpful, especially if you don't know what you're majoring in, or you decide to switch majors partway through your schooling. Everyone is so friendly and just wants to help.}",

There are a select few classes with more than say 35 students in them. Great if you want a big university on a smaller scale. Tips for prospective students If you are interested in engineering or business this could be the school for you. The engineering and business programs here are top notch and this is one of the few places that has almost all of the engineering disciplines as well as their technology counterparts. Bang for the buck A little cheaper than going to University Park, with what I consider a better learning experience, what is called the Behrend Experience. Am enjoying being here The winters are long, lots of snow, but the atmosphere is great, and the peninsula is",
