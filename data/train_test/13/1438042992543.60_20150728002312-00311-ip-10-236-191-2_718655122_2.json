Sousa criticised the Dutch midfielder for not attending training on Monday at his request but Bodde insists that it's a simple misunderstanding between him and the club. The official site confirmed that the 27 year-old met with chairman Huw Jenkins and manager Paulo Sousa to apologise and to explain why he didn't appear on Monday. Bodde will now return to Holland to continue his rehabilitation on his knee ligament injury and will return on July 12th. His future with the club is in doubt as he has expressed a keen interest to leave and join a club in the Premiership. Bolton have recently had a bid rejected and Martinez is likely to be interested in signing him at Wigan Athletic., 19762=Date:Wednesday July 1 2009}",
