Since I am going full time, I, like a lot of you I'm sure, feel like skipping your 8:00 am class to sleep a little extra. But everytime I think about skipping I make myself go. And everytime I do go I learn something that will benefit me on my final. The professors are great and will do anything they can to help you learn all you can., 213825=I enjoy the university it is a very pretty campus. There are many opportunities available at U of I. I am impressed with the nursing programs available and am looking forward to beginning my clinicals in August 2013., 49101=uindy is a great investment. they make it easy to get financial aid. the best thing is our student/faculty ratio. at 15:1 you have a teacher that can really care for you and actually be able to teach you. the quality of the education is one of the best in indiana., 280764=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 52689=the university of indianapolis is one of the best universities to attend in indiana. uindy, as the students call it, is a close knit community with around 5000 undergraduate students. the faculty really cares about the students, and with a of 15:1 student/teacher ratio the faculty is always available for the students., 29932=There are not too many activities offered on campus because of the campus being called a suitcase campus where people leave on the weekends. Clubs offer numerous volunteer opportunities that are extremely fun, from walking dogs at the animal shelter to playing with kids. This 2012-2013 year there have been weekend activities sponsored by our Residence Hall Association that have kept me on campus many weekends., 32473=The food is extremely good most days, there are occasional times when the food is a big questionable. You can always count on the grilled chicken and salad bar! There are many vegetarian options. The only problem are the dining hours on weekends which are very limited, but there are fast food places nearby. The dining hours have been extended this 2012-2013 academic year and I have no complaints:)}",

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck It might cost a more expensive, but it is definitely worth it. The professors are always willing to spend time with you and help you with problem material. Also there are many useful resources that are on campus that are available to students. These services include help services for job placement in the future, information concerning majors and minors, and many other services are available. Am enjoying being here There over 50 student organizations on campus. I am probably actively involved in 3 clubs. I also participate in the chapel ministries and play intramural sports. There are always a variety of activities I can participate in. Everyone at school is accepting of other people. Many people spend time hanging out with their friends throughout the day. I am a commuter student, but I spend a majority of my time at school participating in activities or spending time with friends. Am learning a lot I love attending class every day. The professor are there and are willing to teach you every thing they can about the subjects covered during class. Even though I have taken similar classes to some that I took last semester, I still learned a lot more information during my first semester on the discussed",
