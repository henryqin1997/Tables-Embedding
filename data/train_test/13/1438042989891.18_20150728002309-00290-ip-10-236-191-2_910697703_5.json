However, if you and your friends visit after dark, bring bug spray. On another note, every school day from 10:15 AM to around 10:40 AM the majority of the staff and students converge on Hutchinson Auditorium. The first portion of chapel is a devotion: song, a short talk, and prayer. Announcements follow: college activities announced and received with summer- camp enthusiasm. After chapel, many people crowd into the Student Center to check their mailboxes., 47242=One tradition you could say is that since its a private religious college, we go to chapel every morning at 10:15. Its a nice way to connect with everyone and see everyone right away in the morning. Its the best way to start out your day., 76348=Every morning at 10:15 we have Chapel. It usually consists of two to three songs, a prayer, a small lesson, and then announcements followed by the pledge. We also sing the Alma Mater for the college every Friday and visitors in the are may come and celebrate the end of the study week with us. We also have Happy Mail that gets sent everywhere. The advantage of a small college is that al your mailboxes can fit along one wall. You simply write a little piece of mail, go into the mailroom, and personally drop it off in their box., 79105=The dorming halls are where most of the memories happen. Yes, at this college there is a curfew; weekdays: 11:00 and weekends: 12:00, but that is for the safety of the students. But when the dorms are locked and you are confined to your halls, all the memorable moments happen there. And thanks to our wonderful dorm moms, Mrs. Shirley and Mama B, they provide a curfew kitchen on Tuesdays and Wednesdays where all the girls in the dorm rush downstairs to indulge in pretzels covered in nacho cheese, brown sugared grilled cheeses, and many more.}",
