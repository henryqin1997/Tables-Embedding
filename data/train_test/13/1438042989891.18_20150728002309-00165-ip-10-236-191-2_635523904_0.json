Through the 18th and 19th centuries, pioneer villages and towns were decimated by its onslaught, and many succumbed to the\u00a0effects of this dreaded disease called smallpox. Owen County records show that in December of 1902 a smallpox epidemic was raging in the area,\u00a0and many died as it\u00a0made its way from household to household.}",
