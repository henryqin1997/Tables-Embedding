These asset class exposures include U.S. large cap, U.S. mid cap, U.S. small cap, international equities, emerging markets, U.S. and international REITs, core fixed income, short term treasuries, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, high yield corporate bonds and commodities and are represented by exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the index calculation. The original inception date for the Indexes was September 25, 2008 (the Original Inception Date), except the S&P Target Date 2050 Index (the Index), which was May 31, 2011. Subsequently, Standard & Poor's (S&P) decided to provide return information for periods prior to the Original Inception Date. Return information for the Indexes, except the S&P Target Date 2050 Index, is now available beginning from May 31, 2005. Effective March 1, 2010, S&P modified the method used to calculate Index levels and returns for each Index. Prior to March 1, 2010, each Index was reconstituted once per year on the last trading day of May, with effect on the first trading day of June. Reconstitution is the process whereby asset class weights are established for the upcoming year. Effective March 1, 2010, each Index is reconstituted on the same schedule. However, the Indexes are now rebalanced on a monthly basis. Rebalancing is the process whereby the asset class weights that were determined at the previous reconstitution are reestablished. This process takes place after the close of business on the last trading day of each month, with effect on the first trading day of the following month. The Index returns are calculated on a daily basis and will continue to be calculated daily. The performance of the index does not reflect the deduction of expenses associated with a fund or the ETFs included in the index, such as investment management fees. By contrast, the performance of the Fund reflects the deduction of the fund expenses, including sales charges if applicable.
