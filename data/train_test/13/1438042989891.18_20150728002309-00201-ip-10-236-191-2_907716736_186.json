For me anyway, housing and food services did not have you fill out a questionnaire to help assign a roommate to that could be problematic. There was a record number of changes during the 2014 school year., 1017252=Definetly apply early so that you can be enered into the freshman class scholarships which the deadline is February I believe. Also visit the campus because it is perfect for me, but others may find the campus to be out of their style or wants., 352334=The University of Oklahoma has an 18:1 student to teacher ratio. It is very known for the vigorous courses students take each year. With the toughness of the courses the ratio gives each student opportunities to learn more then they would in a big class., 22035=I greatly enjoyed being at this university! I plan on going back in the fall matter of fact! The campus is wonderful and beautiful. I felt like I was at home a week in. The people there are so happy and friendly and all the upperclassmen really do help you out and make you feel welcome. During welcome week there are a load of activities and they even have golf carts to take you to class if you get lost! Which is an awesome idea since the Oklahoma heat in September can be..overwhelming., 810708=Dorm Life is ok. Other than the opposite sex curfew they have it is just ok. P.S. Couch is the place to be. Westside 8th floor 2011., 1059878=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 211603=there's no place better to be than ou for college football. there's a wide variety of intramural sports, from rugby to quidditch, the later of which ou actually hosted the world cup for in 2010. if sports aren't your thing, the union programming board offers a free movie night every friday with screenings of recent movies., 99897=I haven't actually moved in & started attending classes yet (I move in August 15th) but I've been there twice. Once for Sooner Saturday, an event for prospective student & I went to enroll. I love the campus it's so beautiful. The people here are very kind & helpful.}",

Tips for prospective students **Learn your study skills now, trust me it will help. You have to study smart to make the grade. **Make a plan that will help you keep from procrastinating. **Try to move into your dorm at least two weeks or a week-and-half before school. Don't wait the day before class to move in or you wont know where to go. **A college tour is helpful **When you know what your classes are, go at least two or three days before class begins and walk around campus to find your classes, how long it will take you to get to them, and to learn the lay of the land. Trust me this helped me tremendously. Do this at least twice. . **Try to find the quickest way to get to your classes. **Make sure you know where the library is and the open/close time. I think it closes at 2 a.m. some days. **Make sure you know where the Bursar Office is. **You should acquire a bank account. **Make sure you learn how to take the bus around campus.
