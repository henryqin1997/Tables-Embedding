    "textBeforeTable": "About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Pro colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About R-Pro plastic - its special blend of plastic provides maximum grip with increased flexibility in all weather. They are more flexible and consistently softer at low temperatures than most Pro blends. This makes R-Pro ideal for cold weather play. R-Pro Drivers are stiffer while Mid-Range and Approach discs are more flexible. About Pro plastic in general - it starts out being slightly less overstable. Pro discs are more durable than DX. They provide more grip than Champion. They provide more glide than DX, Champion and Star. They retain flight characteristics longer than DX. They range from firm to extremely soft and flexible. Speed 2, Glide 1, Turn 0, Fade 3 It is great for putting, short to medium drives, accurate approaches, and beginners. The Rhyno\u2019s Thumtrac gives it a sure grip and reliable performance in any situation. The Innova R-Pro Rhyno is an overstable putt and approach golf disc that can handle headwinds. Great for players with lots of throwing power as the Rhyno stops on a dime and stays close to the basket.",
    "textAfterTable": "\"...isn't just for putting, I throw most of my short mid-range shots with this disc. It is an awesome sidearm approach disc too.\" If you want a golf disc with more Glide, try the Birdie more Turn, try the XD more Fade, try the Viper Other Speed 2 discs include the Classic Aviar, Aviar Driver, KC Aviar, JK Aviar, Yeti Pro Aviar, Aviar.
