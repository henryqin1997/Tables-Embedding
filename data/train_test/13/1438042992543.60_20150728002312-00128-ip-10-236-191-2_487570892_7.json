No. 09/688,619, filed Oct. 16, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,541,261, which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/032,676, filed Feb. 27, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,693. The entire teachings of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference., 51976=The cartridge pump 46 is comprised of a liquid reservoir 45 and the metering chamber 42. The liquid reservoir 45 shown in this first embodiment 1 is a syringe barrel. The metering chamber 42 is comprised of a compressible elastomeric housing with a one-way inlet valve (not shown) and a one-way outlet valve (not shown), both valves aligned in a downwards direction of fluid flow. When the hammer 26 compresses the metering chamber 42, the liquid reagent contained within is ejected. When the compressive force is removed, the negative pressure created by the expansion of the elastomeric housing, trying to resume its native, non-compressed shape, causes liquid to flow inwards from the liquid reservoir 45. In this manner, repetitive compression of the metering chamber 42 causes repetitive dispensing of small aliquots of reagent. Alternative cartridge pumps are presented in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/887,178 filed Jul. 2, 1997 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/020,983 filed Feb. 10, 1998 which are incorporated herein by reference.}",

Such equivalents are intended to be encompassed in the scope of the claims. Equivalents An alternative potential design is that each temperature control board 79 could be set up with a permanent \u201caddress\u201d formed by adding jumper wires or traces cut on the board. The processor would send out a packet of data which would contain an address segment and a data segment, and the data would be loaded to the board whose address matched the address sent out. This approach takes less time to send data to a particular board, but the address comparison takes extra hardware. It also demands",
