The result increases the operating frequency of a die on the module without diminishing the performance of other die located on the module. It is noted that if the processors 106, 108 have been allocated the same amount of power and the first processor 106 still needs power, the request for more power from the first processor 106 may stay in the power manager 110. The power manager 110 may continuously query the second processor 108 to determine if it may operate at a reduced frequency, which requires less power. If so, the power manager 110 may reduce the power allocation to the second processor 110 and allocate the power to the first processor 106. If the decision of decision block 224 indicates that the second processor 108 has been allocated more power than the first processor 106, processing proceeds to block 226. Block 226 decreases the power allocated to the second processor 108 in order to transfer the power to the first processor 106. This reallocation of power may continue until both the first processor 106 and the second processor 108 have been allocated the same amount of power. Processing then proceeds to decision block 224 where a determination is made as to whether the",
