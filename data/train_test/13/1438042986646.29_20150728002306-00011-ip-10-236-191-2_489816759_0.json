In the Midwest specifically, seeding may present a challenge due to droughts during this time period. Northern states may also be presented with rotation problems due to a shorter growing season. In southern states, fewer obstacles hinder late summer planting; weed control is less problematic and alfalfa can be planted after another crop in early to mid-September.}",
