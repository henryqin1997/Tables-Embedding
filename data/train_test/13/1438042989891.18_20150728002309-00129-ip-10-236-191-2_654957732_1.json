So be simple... I was born and raised in Japan. I moved to the US about ten years ago and I love living here! I want to try new fun activities.. So let me know if u have any suggestions. I love people who are smart, funny, sincere, nice, little bit weird but not too much. I don't like people who are too strict, selfish, too clean and fake. I need to relax after work. Although I know this is POF, I am looking for a serious relationship :) Thank you for reading! (^_-)-? First Date Bars near the beach! Or coffee?",
