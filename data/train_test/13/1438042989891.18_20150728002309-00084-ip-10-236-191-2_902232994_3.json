            "Get involved in something, it keeps you focused. Rather you drink or not, you will probably get carried away with the idea that you are away from your parents for 9 months (like i did), but as long as you make the grades and attend class during the week you'll be fine. Use all the free services Oklahoma State offers you. If you need help in a class, financial aid, depression, sickness, or anything else, there is someone you can go to.",
            "The Colvin Center is recreation center at Oklahoma State. Its one of the top 10 in the country. It offers a huge gym consisting of free weights and just about every machine you would ever need. It also has i think 4 or 5 basketball courts, an outdoor and indoor swimming pool, running track, virtual golf, a rock climbing wall (a big hit- you can either climb when you want, or take a class), racket ball, table tennis, and more. They also offer free aerobic or martial art classes for any student. Education - for an agriculture major, engineering major, or hotel restaurant and Management major, Oklahoma State is a great college for you to go to. Especially if you live in oklahoma with the instate tuition. Oklahoma State has the lowest instate tuition in the Big 12.",
            "Oklahoma State is encompassed by 'The college atmosphere'. On the week days campus is busy, people are everywhere either rushing to class, or just hanging out on the library lawn. The lawn is huge. Alot of people like to go out there and throw a frisbee around, slack line, take a nap in the sun, or just sit and talk amongst friends. During the weekends the parties are great, always something to do it seems like. The hot spot on thursdays is going to the Tumble Weed (a country club) and attached to it is Tremors (a hip-hop club). So rather your a country fan or a hip-hop fan, thats always fun. I hate country and i still go.",
            "While classes can be big at any University, Oklahoma State is freshman friendly. As a freshman, you're bound to have some classes getting as big as 300 students and as small as 10-25, but despite the large difference, every single one of my professors was easily accessible if i needed help in their class. Either by email, phone number (some proffs give out personal contact numbers in small classes), or going by there office to talk to them one on one. Not only this are college professors easy to stay in contact with at oklahoma state, but part of your tuition covers free tutors for any subject matter. And if your an engineering major like i am, you are guarenteed one-on-one tutors for mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, and any other science class. Oklahoma State also offers a writing center for proof reading essays, helping you with research projects, correcting mistakes you may have made, or if you're just terrible at writing essays (like i am), they can help you improve in your writing ability. They also help you with writing your resume for a prospective job."

Houses are usually all gone by June, 432253=It's a beautiful campus with more clubs and opportunities than anybody could ever hope for. Diversity, and creativity are two words to describe life at OSU. With over 1500 students from all over the world and 450 student organizations, there is something for everyone., 316252=One thing I wish I would've done before I got here is wait to come here. I transferred from a jucco in the spring of January 2012 and its been a bumpy ride since then but I'm handling the reins now; so if you transfer make sure you have a plan on what to do and when to do it. If not, wait till the Fall., 467394=I've enjoyed all of the food here on campus, and there are many options to choose from. The restaurants in the dorms are going to be open later than anywhere else so if you're craving something from the union, get it early! Also, go a random times during the day like 3:00 to avoid dinner and lunch rushes., 210724=one of the traditions is going to the student union. another tradition is before a home game the band and all the students march to the stadium ,having a big pep ralley., 737677=OSU police share jurisdiction with Stillwater police so real officers are on campus at all times. The emergency light system also allows students to feel safer when walking alone. OSU is also implementing a new system fall 2013 that has OSU students work in an escort program. If you don't feel safe walking home at night you can call them and they'll send someone to pick you up at your class and walk you back to your dorm., 152104=Tip #1: Rain boots are always helpful when you ahve a test at 5:30 in the afternoon and it is pouring Tip #2: Eat on campus as much as possible, your meal plan only carries over so much. Tip #3: Set aside time everyday for homework and studying. College is not necessarily harder, but definitely time consuming Tip#4: NEVER skip class unless you are seriously ill. The information from class is always helpful on tests. Tip #5: Don't be afraid to ask mom and dad for money. You can't always have all the money you need, but you can't be asking them every week either., 1131950=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 1095864=The amount of food here at OSU is incredible. The student union has many restaurants that handle the student flow pretty well. Around 11:30 until 12:30 the student union is a crazy maze of people, but otherwise very good., 17140=While room and board is a little bit on the pricey side, OSU is the best buy in the big 12, so says the OkState homepage. Where you live on campus determines how much you pay a month. Meal plan is a great deal for freshmen! However, you do have a minimum of $1000 a semester your first year. Meal plan can be spent at any place that sells food including the markets. With the fees that you pay it includes the gym (which is top notch), all of the computer labs and printers (if you have your own printer great.. but you already pay for the ink in the school ones), lab fees depending on your schedule and upkeep of the sidewalks and reconstruction of the buildings., 201623=i am a readmitted student planning on returning in the fall of 2012. i miss the atmosphere and school spirit of osu as it was very uplifting in several ways. oklahoma state is a great school academically as well as the many clubs and activites it has to offer; it is an overall outstanding choice to attend., 352049=OSU received 2011 Big 12's Safest Campus. There are several lights and safety towers all over campus. The police line is always on if someone is walking home at night and would feel more comfortable with them taking them home!!, 637198=First years have a mandatory food card they must purchase, the cheapest being $1000.}",

There are tons of clubs and organizations to help students make friends and stand out. In addition there are tons of sororities and fraternities, but you don't have to be a member of the Greek community to fit in on campus. International students should feel welcome as well! There is a very large number of exchange students and I haven't heard any horror stories from them. Everyone seems to have a great time at OSU! Tips for prospective students I decided to come to Oklahoma State University because of the beautiful campus and extremely helpful people that I met here my senior year when I visited. Over the past year I have found that not everyone is as nice as those I first encountered, but for the most part, the people are very helpful, especially those who",
