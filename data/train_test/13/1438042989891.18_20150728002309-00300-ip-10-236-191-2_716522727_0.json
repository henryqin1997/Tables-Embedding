H. Hitler was documented as painting the Gloriette while is was living in the hostel at Wurlitzergasse, selling the paintings to a nearby picture framer, probably Morgenstern. As this painting is numbered \"17\", it was most likely painted in early 1909, while he was still in a partnership with Hanisch, who sold Hitler's paintings in exchange for a portion of the profits. Just after the break-up of the partnership (which resulted in the arrest of Hansch for embezzlement), Hitler moved into the Mendemannstrasse hostel. This painting was acquired directly from Peter Jahn many years ago. This exact painting is described on pages 161-162 of The Linz File by Charles de Jaeger, described to the author by Peter Jahn as: \"He [Hitler] also told Peter Jahn that he painted simply to earn a living and never regarded himself as an artist; his natural bent was for architectural design. This is apparent in the detail Hitler gives to buildings in his pictures -- especially noticeable, according to Peter Jahn in Hitler's watercolour of the Gloriette summerhouse in the gardens of the palace at Sch\ufffdnbrunn, summer seat of the Austrian emperors. Hitler painted it while he was living at Wurlitzergasse and sold it to a picture-framer in a nearby street. It was common practice at the time to offset a frame that was in the window for sale by putting a pleasant landscape picture inside it, and this particular one was used over and over again. It had remained with the picture-framer's family until discovered by Peter Jahn.\" This painting is from his late 1908 to early 1909 period. The painting is permanently mounted on a 38.5cm by 49.8cm carrier. This was common for frame fillers as are the markings indicating the framing area, seen on the face.

This drawing depicts the skyline of Linz, as viewed from the Urfahr suburbs across the Danube River in a landscape orientation. The bridge, castle, and cathedral, as well as other prominent landmarks of the time are drawn in excellent detail. This particular scene, from this vantage point is described: \"Although Linz resembled a large market town with seven or eight stately buildings to testify to its medieval magnificence, it was the cultural center of Upper Austria. A bridge across the Danube led to the suburb of Urfahr, which lay in the shadow of a small mountain called the Postlingberg. From the mountaintop there unfolded a wonderful panorama of the city and the surrounding plains. It was a view that the young dilettante [Hitler] especially admired.\" And, \"A handful of his architectural drawings made at that time have survived, and they show that he was capable of extraordinarily bold designs....\" Further, in a 1908 letter from Adolf Hitler to a friend, Gustl Kubizek, he asks \".... Would you be so good as to buy for me a copy of \"Guide to the Danube City of Linz,\" not the W\ufffdhrl, but the actual Linz one published by Krakowitzer. On the cover there is a picture of a girl from Linz, and in the background there is Linz seen from the Danube with the bridge and the castle....\" Payne speculates from this letter that Hitler was continuing to work on his plans for the reconstruction of Linz, and that Hitler continued to maintain an interest in this city enough to spend 60 Kronen for this guidebook, not an insignificant sum of money in those early days. This particular drawing was acquired in its original frame, mat, and glass.
