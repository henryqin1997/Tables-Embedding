Various options were considered but parts on hand and flexibility came together in the following: Raspberry Pi running Raspian 2013-09-25 (Render) Parallax Serial RFID Reader (Render) TTL level shifter for 5v RFID reader to talk to 3.3v Pi serial gpio pins (Colin) Solid state relay board (on order) HDMI to DVI Adapter (Render) Random LCD monitor from around the space Powered USB hub (Render) Current goals: Users provide cash or paypal to director who adds to account for thier tag via web interface or 'credit' tags on the pi. On scan, Pi checks database for balance. If sufficient balance, deduct $1 and dispense product. If insufficent balance, then display an unhappy message . Once product is dispensed display the username and balance remaining for 15 seconds. When 'idle' the screen will goto a slide show of comical and ficticious beverages (Duff, Slurm, Nukacola, etc) Curent Status: In prototype. RFID via GPIO working. GPIO relay control working.
