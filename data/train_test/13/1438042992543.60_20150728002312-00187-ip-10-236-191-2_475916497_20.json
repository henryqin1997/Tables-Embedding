Consequently each of the segments prints bi-level cyan, magenta and yellow dots over a different part of the page to produce the final image. The positions of the 8 segments are shown in FIG. 89. In this example, the print head is assumed to print dots at 1600 dpi, each dot is 15.875 microns in diameter. Thus each half-inch segment prints 800 dots, with the 8 segments corresponding to positions as illustrated in the following table:}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{372496=Further, the movement of the actuator 206 results in a slight movement of the actuator slot protection barrier 216 which maintains substantially the small dimensioned meniscus 219 thereby reducing the opportunity for ink wicking along surfaces. Subsequently, the conductive heater 209 is turned off and the actuator 206 begins to rapidly return to its original position. The forward momentum of the ink around meniscus 204 in addition to the backflow due to return movement of the actuator 2026 results in a general necking and breaking of the meniscus 204 so as to form a drop., 107659=As more than 50,000 nozzles are required for a 1600 dpi A4 photographic quality page width printer, integration of the drive electronics on the same chip as the print head is essential to achieve low cost. Integration allows the number of external connections to the print head to be reduced from around 50,000 to around 100. To provide the drive electronics, the preferred embodiment integrates CMOS logic and drive transistors on the same wafer as the MEMS nozzles. MEMS has several major advantages over other manufacturing techniques:, 55475=This Application is a Continuation Application of U.S. Ser. No. 11/442,133 filed on May 30, 2006, now Issued U.S. Pat. No. 7,380,913, which is a Continuation Application of U.S. Ser. No. 10/728,944 filed on Dec. 8, 2003, now Issued U.S. Pat. No. 7,132,056, which is a Continuation Application of U.S. Ser. No. 09/835,702, filed on Apr. 16, 2001, now Issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,742,873, which is a Divisional Application of Ser. No. 09/807,297, filed on Aug. 13, 2001, now Issued U.S. Pat. No. 6,902,255, which is a 371 of PCT/AU99/00894 filed Oct. 15, 1999, all of which are herein incorporated by reference., 215604=In order to print a 6\u2033\ufffd4\u2033 image at 1600 dpi in say 2 seconds, the 4\u2033 print head must print 9,600 lines (6\ufffd1600). Rounding up to 10,000 lines in 2 seconds yields a line time of 200 microseconds. A single Print Cycle and a single Load Cycle must both finish within this time. In addition, a physical process external to the print head must move the paper an appropriate amount., 322869=The area required by an IJ46 print head nozzle, actuator, and drive circuit is 1764 \u03bcm2. This is less than 1% of the area required by piezoelectric ink jet nozzles, and around 5% of the area required by Bubblkejet nozzles. The actuator area directly affects the print head manufacturing cost., 107221=The preferred embodiment is a 1600 dpi modular monolithic print head suitable for incorporation into a wide variety of page width printers and in print-on-demand camera systems. The print head is fabricated by means of Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) technology, which refers to mechanical systems built on the micron scale, usually using technologies developed for integrated circuit fabrication., 217132=Since all 8 segments are loaded with a single SRClock pulse, the printing software must produce the data in the correct sequence for the print head. As an example, the first SRClock pulse will transfer the C, M, and Y bits for the next Print Cycle's dot 0, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000, 4800, and 5600. The second SRClock pulse will transfer the C, M, and Y bits for the next Print Cycle's dot 1, 801, 1601, 2401, 3201, 4001, 4801 and 5601. After 800 SRClock pulses, the Ptransfer pulse can be given., 312821=A combination of very high resolution, very small drops, and high dye density allows full color printing with much less water ejected. A 1600 dpi IJ46 print head ejects around 33% of the water of a 600 dpi thermal ink jet printer. This allows fast drying and virtually eliminates paper cockle., 316328=Ink bleed between colors occurs if the different primary colors are printed while the previous color is wet. While image blurring due to ink bleed is typically insignificant at 1600 dpi, ink bleed can \u2018muddy\u2019 the midtones of an image. Ink bleed can be eliminated by using microemulsion-based ink, for which IJ46 print heads are highly suited. The use of microemulsion ink can also help prevent nozzle clogging and ensure long-term ink stability.}",
