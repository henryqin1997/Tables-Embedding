    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{152540=Usually, insert molded filter are designed such that the direction of flow applies force perpendicular to the peripheral seal area and against the seal area. Because of the total air removal issue, the fluid flow in this instance applies a peel force to the peripheral seal when the membrane is placed from the back. Integrity of the filter membrane 1006 and seal is dependent on the membrane strength and the peel seal strength. A second insert molding of an overseal around the periphery of the membrane 1006 is used to better secure the membrane 1006 and eliminate the possibility of the pressure exceeding the peel force strength. The membrane 1006 ends up sandwiched between two layers of plastic. With the over molding 1010 of the seal, support members 1024 are also added to further support the membrane 1006 against the flow pressure preventing distortion and possible rupture of the membrane 1006. Alternately, this can also be accomplished mechanically. The membrane filter 1006 material may or may not have a polymer screen mesh incorporated into its structure to improve membrane strength., 99058=Referring again to FIG. 6, a three-way valve 220 controls the flow of fluid through output line 226 and return line 236. Water or solution in line 226 is fed to a heater assembly 228. Heater assembly 228 is a temperature controlled, 1300 watt, flow-through heater, such as the Heatron no. 23925 heater. The heater assembly 228 is used for heating dialysate up to body temperature as it is passed to the extracorporeal circuit module 28 (FIG. 1). The heater is also used for heating water up to a disinfection temperature of at least 80 degrees C., and preferably at least 85 degrees C., and maintaining the water at that temperature for more than an hour during the water disinfection of the fluid paths of the machine 22, as discussed in detail below. A thermistor 230 monitors the temperature of the fluids in the line 226. A three-way valve 232 controls the flow of fluid through the tank return line 231 and the output line 233. A dialysate filter such as ultrafilter/pyrogen removal filter 234 is provided for removal of any pyrogenic materials and particulate matter from the dialysate. Suitable filters 234 are the Minntech pyrogen filter and the Fresenius F-80 filter. No dialysate solution goes to the dialysate circuit 402 during dialysis treatment without first passing through the filter 234. The condition of three-way valve 236 controls whether fluid exits from the ultrafilter/pyrogen filter through line 238 or out dialysate circuit input line 406. A flow meter 241 (Xolox part no. 2831F6FF) measures the flow rate of the solutions in line 406., 150441=To achieve tangential flow, our microporous membrane filter 1006 is installed in an essentially vertical orientation. The blood inlet port 1022 is also vertical, as is the outlet 1020. The inlet port 1022 can be from either the top, bottom or side. Our preferred embodiment is having the inlet 1022 enter from the bottom., 162147=The connection terminal of FIG. 38D is applied to the ends to the arterial and venous lines 432 and 492. The terminals are inserted into the preferred manifold port design, shown in FIGS. 39A-C. In FIG. 39A, the connection port 499 there illustrated is the same as the other ports 497 and 493. The 499 is shown in a elevational view in FIG. 39A, and end view in FIG. 39B, and in a sectional view in FIG. 39C The connection terminal of FIG. 38D is installed in the connection port 499 as shown in FIGS. 39D and 39E., 146817=Referring to FIG. 15A, the debubbler 1000 has a front cover 1002, a fluid circuit board 1004, two microporous membranes having a blood contact portion 1006 and a secondary air vent 1006A, a back cover 1008 with pressure transducer opening 1016A and an over molded support portion 1010 having a series of parallel support ridges 1024 separated by adjacent parallel apertures 1115. The fluid circuit board 1004 has a blood chamber 1014 and an optional pressure transducer opening 1016 disposed therein. A retaining ring 504 and pressure transducer comprising diaphragm 506 with metal disk 508 are mounted within the opening 1016 for measuring the blood pressure in the blood chamber 1014. The magnet, rod and strain guage elements of the pressure transducer are described in construction with FIG. 14A-C below., 145523=It is well known that air contact with blood often causes clotting. This is one of the draw backs of traditional bubble traps. Bubble traps also require level sensors and a valving scheme and control system to allow the collected air escape. By using a hydrophobic microporous membrane to allow the air to escape passively, less clotting occurs, less sensing and valving hardware is needed, and fewer set manipulations by the patent or machine operator are needed. In addition, the unit is simpler to clean and sanitize. Thus, an alternative to the air separating and pressure monitoring chamber 472 is a cassette-type debubbler 1000, shown in FIGS. 15A-15D. FIG. 15A is an exploded view showing the front or blood side of the debubbler 1000. FIG. 15B is an exploded view showing the rear or air side of the debubbler 1000. FIG. 15C is a cross-sectional view of the debubbler 1000 through the blood outlet 1020 in an assembled condition, with the unit in a vertical onentation as it would preferably be installed in the extracorporeal circuit 400 (FIG. 13). FIG. 15D is a perspective view of the debubbler 1000 partially broken away in section in the same plane as FIG. 15C. Also for this application the debubbler 1000 is designed to be cleanable, sanitizable and reusable., 149725=Recently, two microporous membrane manufacturers, Pall and Millipore, have introduced PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) also known as KYNAR\u2122 membranes that have superior hydrophobic properties over PTFE and which reportedly do not have the protein and lipid attraction that PTFE has. PVDF is the preferred material for the membranes 1006, 1006A of the cassette-debubbler 1000 of FIG. 15. PVDF has the following properties: sealability to the PVDF microporous membrane, blood compatibility, natural hydrophobia, moldability, heat sealability, translucency and can be compliant under pressure. Polysulfone could also be used as an alternate material with difficulty and with a trade off in properties., 151364=The hole 1034 is covered with the microporous membrane 1006 and sealed around the edges to the fluid circuit board 1004. This can be accomplished several ways. The membrane 1006 can be placed in the part and heat sealed in place at membrane peripheral seal area 1028 or held mechanically in place. The preferred embodiment insert molds the membrane in place. To insure even better seal integrity, the insert molded membrane 1006 can be over molded with support member 1010. Coincident with the over molding would be the addition of suitable support ribbing 1024., 153661=Blood enters the blood side of the chamber 1014 through the inlet port 1022. The flow is directed to the center of the chamber 1014 to gently disrupt the flow pattern and allow the previously entrained bubbles to contact the microporous membrane 1006 and escape. To enhance contact time with the microporous membrane 1006, the distance between the front cover 1002 of the chamber 1014 and the microporous membrane 1006 is preferrably 1/8 inch or less. For typical bubble traps the volume and geometry of the chamber required is considerably larger. This is necessary in order to slow the blood flow down and give the entrained bubbles time to escape the viscous blood., 150782=The covers 1002, 1008 are heat sealed to the ribs 1027, 1026 using a heat seal process. The fluid circuit board 1004 is fabricated preferably by injection molding with ribs 1027, 1026 forming channels on both sides of a central plane 1029 of material. Three holes are provided in the fluid circuit board. The hole 1016 is for the silicone diaphragm pressure transducer. The silicone diaphragm or membrane 506 is to be captured and secured by welding a retaining ring 504 over the edge of the silicone to a mounting structure 1036 on the fluid circuit board 1004., 154743=Air is let in or out through the air port 1012 at the bottom of the cassette via silicone tubing, a connector, a pinch valve and suitable internal machine plumbing. Some condensate is also allowed to exit the cassette through port 1012. In the preferred embodiment of the cassette, the air will be directed through the hole 1038 back to the front of the fluid circuit board, down a channel 1040 (FIG. 15A) and out the bottom of the cassette at air port 1012. The hole 1038 is covered by a microporous membrane 1006A. This membrane could be an extension to the original membrane or a separate piece as shown. The second membrane 1006A serves as a safety mechanism. Should the primary membrane 1006 fail, the patient could suffer a potentially catastrophic loss of blood. With the secondary membrane 1006A, if the primary membrane 1006 raptured, the blood would be stopped by the second membrane. A blood detection sensor (not shown) is provided to sense the presence of blood on the back side of the cassette and the activate an alarm and stop the machine. The blood detection sensor is similar to the blood leak detector 428 described above. Because the volume of space between the two membranes is sterile (ETO or radiation sterilization post assembly), the patient will not be at risk of infection should the primary membrane rupture., 154349=The back side of the fluid circuit board 1004 (FIG. 15B) manages the air that passes through the microporous membrane 1006 and condensate formed during sanitization. Air and condensate is allowed to flow into condensate region 1030 and down and out the exit port 1018 to drain via silicone tubing, a connector, pinch valve and suitable internal machine plumbing (not shown)., 147645=A condensate outlet 1018, a blood inlet 1022 and a blood outlet 1020 are provided at the bottom of the fluid circuit board 1004. An air port 1012 is also provided at the bottom for conducting air passed through the filter 1006A and 1006 out of circuit board 1004. Referring to FIG. 15B, which is a exploded view of the debubbler 1000 seen from the rear or air side, the fluid circuit board 1004 also has a condensate chamber 1032 and bole 1038 covered by membrane 1006A, a membrane peripheral seal area 1028 where the microporous membrane 1006 is sealed to the fluid circuit board 1004, a raised rib 1026 and a channel 1030 for collecting condensate. Condensate is passed out of the unit 1000 from condensate outlet 1018., 86734=Still referring to FIG. 5, a pump 96 (such as Procon part no. CO16505AFV and Leeson motor no. 101389-1) is located in the line 90 to pump the water past a pressure sensor 98 to a reverse osmosis filter 100 (such as Millipore housing part no. SL1P106M4 and Dow FilmTek XUS 50454.00 filter). A flow restrictor 95 is placed across the pump 96 to avoid deadhead failure conditions. A valve 112, flow constrictor FC2 and check valve CV4 are place in return line 110. An adjustable pressure regulator 114 is placed in parallel with the high pressure valve 112 (Honeywell part no. 71215 SN2 KVOONO D5D1C2). The pressure regulator 114 provides back pressure for the reverse osmosis filter 100 to force water to cross the membrane. High pressure valve 112 bypasses flow to regulator 114 minimizing back pressure in certain operating modes and failure conditions. Flow constrictor FC2 provides about 10 psi back pressure to RO filter 100 during the hot water disinfection, described in detail below. Lines 110 and 116 are drain lines which drain water rejected by the reverse osmosis filter 100 through valve 80 to drain line 71., 151946=The membrane 1006 is placed over the hole 1034 from the back side of the fluid circuit board 1004 (FIG. 15B), the back side being the non-blood contact side. Placing the membrane 1006 from the back is necessary because the objective is to be able to eliminate all the air from the chamber 1014 on the blood side (FIG. 15A). If the periphery seal was accomplished from the blood side, then the seal area at the top of the chamber would be higher than the active membrane area, making total air elimination impossible. Total air removal is important for sanitization purposes., 45537=This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/388,275 filed Feb. 13, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,344., 156099=During sanitation, if condensate occurs on the air side of the membranes 1006, it can be removed by allowing the condensate and air to exit the cassette from the bottom via port 1018 utilizing gravity. If condensate occurs on the down stream side of filter 1006A it can be removed by allowing the condensate and air to exit via port 1012. Otherwise a condensate build-up could act as a shutoff valve and block all air passage in or out., 158432=The preferred design of the connection terminals for the lines 432 and 492 is shown in FIG. 37A-C and 38A-D. A preferred design of the ports of the disinfection manifold 494 are shown in FIG. 39A-C. Referring to FIG. 37A-C. an integral inner piece or male luer with luer lock 550 is shown in an end view in FIG. 37A, a cross-sectional view in FIG. 37B, and in a elevational view with a robe 552 in phantom in FIG. 37C. The male luer 550 receives the end of a silicone tube 552 by insertion of the robe over the cylindrical tubing port 554. A secondary silicone oversleeve could also be placed over the tube 552. The male luer 550 has a locking hub 556 with threads 560 disposed on its inner surface. The connector further includes a second elongate spout or tube portion 558 integral with the wall 562 and tubing port 554. A pair of apertures 551 are provided in the side walls of the locking hub 556 to allow air to vent out of the interior of the locking hub 556. At least one aperture is needed on connectors with integral nonrotating locking hubs. The aperture can be anywhere on the locking hub shoulder.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Further, the term \"purified water\" used heroin means water in which impurities have been removed. The technical definition of \"purified water\", such as found in the United States Pharmacopoeia, is not intended. From the forgoing detailed description, it will be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art that many variations and modifications of the preferred and alternative embodiments of the invention may be made, without departure from the true spirit and scope of the invention. The term \"module\", as used herein and in the claims, is intruded to be broadly interpreted as encompassing a component or group of components that perform a specified function, such as treat water or prepare a dialysate solution, whether or not such component or group of components is physically encased within a housing physically apart from other components. Obviously, the selection of components that comprises a \"module\" is a matter of design choice. For example, the dialysate circuit 402 is shown as part of the dialysate preparation module 26, but could just as easily been matte part of the extracorporeal circuit module 28, with suitable connectors in the lines leading to and from the dialysate side of the dialyzer.
