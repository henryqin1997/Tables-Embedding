Below are the clubs that hosted last year and this on the first Friday of interleague, along with the team they played in 2010., 192987=The 15th season of Interleague Play between the American League and the National League begins today. Major League Baseball\u2019s 2011 schedule features 252 Interleague games to be played in two segments: the first this weekend (May 20th-22nd) and the second from June 17th-July 3rd., 75694=In terms of clubs that hosted games in the first series of interleague last season (albeit with different opponents in 2010 than 2011), all clubs, minus the White Sox, drew more on Sunday \u00a0than the same Sunday last season:, 70945=Compared to the first set of interleague games that fell on Sunday last season, 2011 had an average of 33,074, up slightly from last year (0.46%) 32,921., 244671=Rescheduled for Wednesday, July 27, 195017=In terms of win-loss records, the American League posted a 134-118 record in Interleague Play in 2010. The 2010 season marked the seventh consecutive year in which the A.L. earned the edge in the season series, extending its all-time advantage to 1,808-1,652 (.523). The A.L. went 127-125 in 2004, 136-116 in 2005, 154-98 in 2006, 137-115 in 2007, 149-103 in 2008 and 138-114 in 2009 before the 134-118 mark last year., 71321=Look for \u201cInside the Numbers: 2011 First Interleague Attendance\u201d shortly on The Biz of Baseball, 201749=An example is last night\u2019s Tigers-Red Sox game at Fenway Park. Announced attendance was 37,311, and yet the postgame notes read this: 653rd consecutive sellout since May 15, 2003, 194093=In looking at the last weekend of play before interleague began in 2010, average attendance was 33,371 compared to interleague\u2019s average of 33,172, a decline of less than 1 percent (-0.63%)., 136107=(See Inside the Numbers: MLB 2010 First Interleague Attendance), 39625=Welcome to the 2011 Business of Sports Network Autism Challenge, 206343=Won 5 in a row. 26 min rain delay. 653rd consecutive sellout since May 15, 2003, 194466=The Red Sox and Cubs last played at Fenway Park on September 11, 1918, in the sixth and final game of that year\u2019s World Series. Concluding a season that was abbreviated because of the ongoing World War I conflict, the Red Sox won two of the series\u2019 first three games in Chicago. Boston returned home to take Game Four, before the Cubs staved off elimination in Game Five. The Red Sox then closed out the series in Game Six with a 2-1 victory, clinching their fourth title of the decade and their third championship in the preceding four years., 193376=In the first weekend of interleague play across Major League Baseball last season, ballparks had an average attendance of 33,172 compared to an average of 29,404 for weekend games for the same hosting teams over the course of the 2010 season leading up to that point, an increase of 13 percent. When looking at more recent periods, when weather is improving, interleague attendance sees a mixed bag., 195443=In 2010, A.L. Clubs compiled a .269 batting average with 233 home runs, 1,168 runs scored and a 4.16 ERA. N.L. Clubs batted .251 with 242 home runs, 1,098 runs scored and a 4.37 ERA. The Chicago White Sox posted the best record in Interleague play in 2010 at 15-3 (.833), followed by the Texas Rangers at 14-4 (.778) and the Boston Red Sox and New York Mets, each at 13-5 (.722). The New York Yankees hold MLB\u2019s best all-time Interleague record at 144-102 (.585), followed by the White Sox at 143-104 (.579)., 228848=With four postponements\u00a0 on Tuesday, the league has now seen 29 rainouts on the year. If there is one postponement today due to weather, the year will tie 2007 for the most rainouts by this time in the season with 30. Looking at the weather forecast, the chances of that happening on Weds. are very real., 202509=The Red Sox didn\u2019t get a rainout, but it was close. Chalk up another rain delay, this one 26 minutes (The delay began at 9:31 in the top of the 8th inning and the game resumed at 9:57)., 106158=In terms of clubs that hosted games in the first series of interleague last season (albeit with different opponents in 2010 than 2011), all clubs, minus the White Sox, drew more on Saturday than the same Saturday last season:, 136700=However, the \u201cnatural rivalries\u201d that MLB touts, do occur each season. For the Indians, winning is beginning to take hold in Cleveland. With both the 2010 and 2011 \u201cBattle of Ohio\u201d games on the first day of interleague being played in Cleveland between the Indians and Reds, attendance this year was up 37 percent from 23,028 in 2010 to 31,622. On the downside, the \u201cBattle of the Beltway\u201d series between the Orioles and Nationals failed to resonate as a true \u201crivalry\u201d last night. While the 2010 game was played in Nationals Park, this year\u2019s game at Camden Yards drew just 24,442 compared to 27,378 last season. Here\u2019s how they broke out, showing the increase or decrease in attendance from 2010, 31898=Case in point, the Cleveland Indians announced last Friday that they reached a sellout for Saturday\u2019s interleague game with the Reds, the first non-Opening Day sellout since May 24, 2008 when they played the Texas Rangers. But, when the numbers came in, you had to scratch your head., 210297=Peavy first 2011 home start, 101567=The big winner yesterday was the Cleveland Indians. Winning and good weather came together and gave the club their first non-Opening Day sellout since May 24, 2008 when they played the Texas Rangers., 30790=The Florida Marlins got into the artificial inflation act by selling tickets to\u00a0a game already played. The club sold over 3,500 tickets to Roy Halladay\u2019s perfect game when the Phillies visited Florida in June of last season. As noted, because money collected -- even for a game already played -- from this venture counts toward ticket sales revenue, it is subject to Major League Baseball\u2019s revenue sharing rules, which doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot if you\u2019re the Marlins. After all, they\u2019ve been one of MLB\u2019s largest benefactors of revenue-sharing, and one of the most profitable., 118592=First non-Opening Day sellout since May 24, 2008 vs. Texas. Indians report lots of comps and season tix redeems, 217070=Up 1000 from Weds, 134894=Friday saw the beginning of interleague play across Major League Baseball for the 2011 season, and for the most part, the league should be happy with the results., 193834=(See Inside the Numbers: MLB 2010 First Interleague Attendance)}",

Compared to the first set of interleague games that fell on Sunday last season, 2011 had an average of 33,074, up slightly from last year (0.46%) 32,921.

Leading the pack (again) was the Philadelphia Phillies at 105 percent of capacity, followed by the Red Sox (102%), Brewers (intraleague game against Rockies at 102%), and Giants (101%). But, in terms of sellouts, which account for comps, rainout exchanges, etc. you can throw in the Yankees as a sellout game, as well, even as attendance was 404 below seating capacity. On the downside, the Blue Jays, hosting the last place Astros, couldn\u2019t get attendance moving. Last among all games over the weekend, the best that the club could muster was 43 percent of capacity on Sat, with Sunday marking 39 percent, and Friday set at 31 percent of Rogers Centre\u2019s capacity.
