Donate, volunteer, run or just come out and cheer at one of the team RWB events! - it promises to be a great time! All we want to do is HONOR THE FALLEN, by CHALLENGING THE LIVING and if you aren't quite sure about participating, just ask yourself, \"IF NOT ME, THEN WHO...\", 11033=Barclays Military Services Network and Team Red White and Blue have partnered together to provide opportunities for Barclays employees to engage in a variety of sports and social activities with Veterans and their families. Our first event was September 9, 2012, Barclays, Team Red White and Blue participated in the Travis Manion Foundation 9-11 HEROES RUN at Randalls Island New York. It was a great event event. Approximately 15 Barclays employees participated (directly conflicted with Susan B Komen run\u2014we will fix that in 2013) and we were able to raise $3,500 to support Team RWB.}",
