            "For the most part, UCI is very safe. Irvine is considered a very safe area and honestly, you rarely hear of anything being stolen or unsafe. It's really great!",
            "There's a club for everything and people are really welcoming!",
            "People who are NOT looking to party! If you want to study but still have options available for you if you want to hang out, then it's perfect.",
            "Basketball season is intoxicating; also, Octoberfest is a lot of fun! We have lots of fairs and festivals on campus.",
            "I'm from out of state, which does mean that I pay a lot of extra. But it's worth it. UCI is seen as the top up and coming new university in the USA, which means that now is the perfect time to get in before it becomes another UCLA!",
            "I hang out with friends a lot. There are fun events at the ARC and lots of communities have things to do that are fun.",
            "There are a lot of food options on campus and what isn't on campus can be found right across the street in UTC. The best part is that they have vegan and vegetarian options; in fact, UCI was rated as the most vegan friendly school!",
            "The staff for the housing communities as UCI are AMAZING! They try really hard to make living in the dorms a unique experience for each person and since Irvine tends to be fairly safe, it's easy to get comfortable.",
            "Some of the classes can be SUPER hard, but there are also fairly easy ones. Most GE classes are reasonable, but some major requirements can be difficult and there is quite a bit of competition within classes.",
            "Go on a campus tour! They give you a lot of information that's sort of neat about the school. You also get a feel for the atmosphere and some of the people.",
            "Great atmosphere and professors that really want to teach you. It's a pleasure to be here, although it isn't where you want to go if you're looking for a party life. It tends to be rather quiet."

Students usually know they can also shake the Mesa bridge by jumping on it in the middle and that there is a building that can project your own voice back to you if you stand in the right spot. Also, there is a taxidermized anteater (Peter!) in the study lounge., 728083=Keep your GPA up, get a good SAT/ACT score and write a good personal statement! UCI is upping its standards according to my incoming year (2012/2013 freshmen). Many people who seemed likely to get in did not, and UCI under accepted so they had to accept so many appeals., 698467=Dorm life is amazing! You meet different types of people who are easy to get along with and are fun to be around. I currently live in Crickhollow, which I must say is the best hall in UCI dorms of the 2012-2013 school year. Big thanks to our RA Colin for being so great in not only being a resident advisor but also being a mentor to us first years. There several activities at the dorms anywhere from movie and karaoke nights to hall mixer/party. To dorm in UCI is a great experience; Dorm life here makes the transition from high school to college easier and joyful., 222588=I spend a lot of my free time with my friends. I've made amazing friends at UCI and I have the most fun with them whether we're making a run to Cha at 12:50 am, shopping at the Irvine Spectrum, or at a fraternity event in AV., 462156=You can see the Disneyland fireworks at around 9:45 from the top of Engineering Hall., 93939=Well with the 32% increase it is getting a little expensive for a public University but it is a really good research University with enough mediums to help you learn what you are interested in and the quality is worth the money. Also they have a lot of Scholarships to apply for and not only GPA based so it can be a great relief for people who cannot afford College. I know people going to UCI that only pay $2000 all include per quarter. Although it is really expensive for out-of-state students and I would not recommend it for them., 309846=Research-oriented students. UC Irvine has one of the greatest research institutions and is renowned for its research achievements all over the world. If you're in social movements, UC Irvine specializes in social movements. Our Sociology Department has a great, prestigious set of professors who have both contributed to the realm of sociological research and social advocacy. May I recommend you get to know the following: Prof. Caesar Sereseres, Prof. Al Valdez, Prof. Charles O'Connel, Prof. Carter Butts... these are only but a few of the AMAZING faculty we have in the Sociology department. And THAT's just one department within the School of Social Sciences... GO SOCIAL SCIENCES!, 324026=If you are bored, even for one second at UC Irvine, you are doing it all wrong. UCI is a place for fun, learning, and involvement. http://www.uci.edu/features/2011/09/feature_bucketlist_110926.php This bucket list should be a requirement for graduation., 810798=Quarterly Undie run the weekend before finals. Shocktoberfest is a HUGE concert where we've had artists such as TYGA, Kendrick Llamar, etc.. Raggaefest is at the end of Spring Quarter where artist like The Expendables, Iration, Rebelution, and other top Reggae artists., 923332=The Academic rigor is slightly harsh. For English courses, you need to have good grammar in order to enroll to a low division writing class. Also, attendance is mandatory for many class such as Chemistry lab, writing, and discussions., 840202=eat around. and there's lots of beaches, huntington, newport, corona del mar, 22569=Study hard in high school and try to get at least a 3.7 GPA. Participate in as many extracurricular activities as you can. Try and score at least an 1850 in your SATs., 1141747=Brandywhine best place to eat lunch. Lot 5 is the temporary food for Mesa Court (Dorms) while they are building the new dorms and dinning hall (Complete in 2016 I think). Lot 5 has ok food, better than high school for sure. Pippins is in middle-earth(dorms) and has a larger variety, but might get extra protein from bugs in the food. They have panda, subway, wendys, a pub on campus and other dinning venues. Across the street is taco bell, chick-fila, chipotle, Cha, in-and-out, and other eateries. Overall the food on campus is ok, but across the street is best.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here I enjoy going to school here even though I have to admit my first year was a difficult one. I felt I didn't know how to get myself into that large crown of over 20,000 students! I was worried at first that no matter what I did, there was no way to be noticed and no way of finding my own place. After some searching, I found my niche in two places: the Cross Cultural Center and the Public Health Association. I am determined now more than ever that I will be able to find more places that will make UCI my home. I enjoy it more now than I did before because I know now that I am not alone in trying to find my footing. The park, which I mentioned before, called Aldrich Park is located in the heart of UCI and without it, I would not have had some of the best conversations with other students and friends! It is so beautiful and relaxing. I also enjoy the fact that there are so many different places to eat and the Student Center is always bustling with people! You don't have to be bored because you can even meet up with friends and form study groups at one of our three amazing libraries. Even on the weekends there are things to do like drive 8 minutes to the beach and hang out,",
