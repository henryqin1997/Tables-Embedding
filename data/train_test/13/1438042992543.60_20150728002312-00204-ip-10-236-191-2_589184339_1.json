There is a pattern for the player that reassures us his current drought won\u2019t last for too long.

    "textBeforeTable": "What do you think? Who got the better deal: Montreal or Portland? Let us know in the comment section below. Yes, there are certainly some intangibles that are overlooked (e.g. Ricketts 90-plus international caps), but Montreal clearly appear to have gotten an upgrade. Timbers GM and interim head coach Gavin WIlkinson believes that the Timbers received an upgrade as well. Ahead in almost every category, the newly acquired Impact netminder has a higher catch success rate, fewer drops and more saves parried away to safety to name a few. Montreal found a winner in Perkins. Numbers don't lie, and although they are certainly not exempt from an open interpretation, the data speak for themselves. And regarding the goalkeeper swap of Donovan Ricketts and Troy Perkins between Montreal and Portland, the results are fairly persuasive. It's the talking point after every trade in any sport: Who got the better deal? By Ryan Krasnoo OPTA Comparison: Montreal got the better deal 7:11 pm August 07 MLS Regular Season D.C.
