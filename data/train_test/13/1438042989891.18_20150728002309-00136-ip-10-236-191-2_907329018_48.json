            "The Greek life is very popular here however if you don't participate you are not looked down upon because a lot of people do not take part in it.",
            "They have any club you could think of from sewing, to archery. We have swim teams and skiing teams and the best part is all of the different clubs can be found on the schools website that way you can know before you sign on as a full time student.",
            "Great for really every type of student. But I would say the out going and not so easily distracted would be my best pick for here.",
            "We have mountaineer days right in the middle of the downtown campus which is open to the whole public.",
            "There is a bookholders store for any class book that may be needed and the prices are cheaper than any other area on campus.",
            "For fun you could do anything from cosmic bowling to clubs and nightlife. Or even just go to the rec center for a swim after a great workout.",

            "Invest in an ipod for long amounts of time walking. Enjoy every moment and be open for anything.",
            "An uplifting positive attitude for students young and old. Always an event in case homework is finished or some rest is needed. A diverse land for everyone to understand all cultures."

The campus is beautiful covering over 1000 acres and transportation is great , buses and trains (PRT) carries people all over the campus . Transportation is free and tution fee is average , take a campus tour and visit West Virginia University , Lets Go Mountaineer's :), 151166=the backyard brawl is when wvu plays it's biggest rival, pitt. however, 2012 may be the last year for the famous backyard brawl. with both teams switching divisions it is unknown if the games will continue between the two teams., 9410=Learn from my mistakes! I did not decide on WVU until late, as a matter of fact I was set on attending West Virginia Wesleyan College until financial aid fell through I had to re-evaluate my situation. In July I transitioned to WVU. My advice is to apply early and commit early. This will allow you the greatest opportunity to capitalize on all WVU has to offer. Believe me, being the last to schedule and waiting for them to make a room for you is no fun. You will end up with 8am classes and classes at 9pm, you will live in Evansdale and have all your classes downtown. It\u2019s been a hectic first semester, one that you can avoid by committing early., 704435=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 678161=Nestled in the hills of north central West Virginia, WVU is a land-grant university that has served the state since 1867. Despite having a population of over 30,000 students, one can still feel the tie associated with a small school while still living in a modern, urban area. A very diverse social and cultural atmosphere blends with academics that provide opportunities beyond what one can imagine, harboring an environment of creativity while fostering a future of success., 503150=Some traditions: PRT cram, football games, diversity week, couch burning (considering the $1000 fine, this isn't a good idea), etc. Great locations: stadium, coliseum, woodburn circle, free-speech area, etc.}",

Seriously, any stereotype, any click from the athlete to the nerd, from the music major to the chemistry loving geek, from country to hard rock, white, black and every color in between you will fit in at WVU. The diversity here is amazing. I frequently spend my lunch just people watching and enjoying all the variety WVU has to offer. I myself have been challenged to look beyond who I am and reinvent who I will become. At am a musician, playing in the orchestra, a nerd in the honors program, an athlete running and attending spinning classes daily, a teacher working with students at a local school, a mentor for teenagers at the rec center, a room mate and friend to several girls from all over the country. WVU is great for all",
