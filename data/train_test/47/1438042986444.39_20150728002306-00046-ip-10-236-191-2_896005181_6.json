Imagine one\u2019s surprise when the Paddington Antique Centre, an iconic heritage-listed building (originally a Picture Palace movie theatre) on Latrobe Terrace, makes space and \u201ccelebrate[s] Chinese New Year featuring traditional Chinese pieces including Jade ornaments, jewellery, ceramics, cloisonne vases, sculptures, art and more\u201d in its entire front foyer throughout February, 2013.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{154134=In 1849, with the discovery of gold and the ensuing California Gold Rush, over 50,000 people had come to San Francisco to seek their fortune or just a better way of life. Among those were many Chinese, who had come to work in the gold mines and on the railroad. By the 1860s, the residents of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown were eager to share their culture with their fellow San Francisco residents who may have been unfamiliar with (or hostile towards) it. The organizers chose to showcase their culture by using a favorite American tradition \u2013 the parade. They invited a variety of other groups from the city to participate, and they marched down what today are Grant Avenue and Kearny Street carrying colourful flags, banners, lanterns, drums and firecrackers to drive away evil spirits., 150794=In Taiwan, spring travel is also a major event. The majority of transportation in western Taiwan is north-south direction long distance travel between urbanized north and hometowns in rural south. Transportations in eastern Taiwan and that between Taiwan and islands are less convenient. Cross-strait flights between Taiwan and mainland China begin in 2003 as part of Three Links, mostly for \u201cTaiwanese businessmen\u201d to return to Taiwan for new year.[40], 65453=The biggest event of any Chinese New Year\u2019s Eve is the Reunion Dinner. A dish consisting of fish will appear on the tables of Chinese families. It is for display for the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner. This meal is comparable to Christmas dinner in the West. In northern China, it is customary to make dumplings (jiaozi, \u9903\u5b50, ji\u01ceozi) after dinner to eat around midnight. Dumplings symbolize wealth because their shape resembles a Chinese tael. By contrast, in the South, it is customary to make a glutinous new year cake (niangao, \u5e74\u7cd5, ni\u00e1ng\u0101o) and send pieces of it as gifts to relatives and friends in the coming days of the new year. Ni\u00e1ng\u0101o [Pinyin] literally means \u201cnew year cake\u201d with a homophonous meaning of \u201cincreasingly prosperous year in year out\u201d.[14] After dinner, some families go to local temples hours before the new year begins to pray for a prosperous new year by lighting the first incense of the year; however in modern practice, many households hold parties and even hold a countdown to the new year. Traditionally, firecrackers were once lit to scare away evil spirits with the household doors sealed, not to be reopened until the new morning in a ritual called \u201copening the door of fortune\u201d (k\u0101ic\u00e1im\u00e9n, \u958b\u8ca1\u9580).[15] Beginning in 1982, the CCTV New Year\u2019s Gala was broadcast four hours before the start of the New Year., 58366=February 10\u201312 (Singapore), 60953=\u2014Xinwen Lianbo, January 2001, quoted by Li Ren, Imagining China in the Era of Global Consumerism and Local Consciousness[10], 50766=One scheme of continuously numbered Chinese-calendar years assigns 4709 to the year beginning , 2011, but this is not universally accepted; the calendar is traditionally cyclical, not continuously numbered., 159251=Chinese New Year is considered to be the most important festival for Filipino-Chinese in the Philippines. In 2012, it was the first time that Chinese New Year was declared a special non-working holiday throughout the country., 58415=February 10\u201312 (Brunei), 945=Lion dancers at Historic Chinatown Gate, Chinese New Year, Hing Hay Park, Seattle, Washington (February 3, 2011), 64263=In many households where Buddhism or Taoism is prevalent, home altars and statues are cleaned thoroughly, and altars that were adorned with decorations from the previous year are taken down and burned a week before the new year starts, to be replaced with new decorations. Taoists (and Buddhists to a lesser extent) will also \u201csend gods\u201d (\u9001\u795e, s\u00f2ngsh\u00e9n), an example would be burning a paper effigy of Zao Jun the Kitchen God, the recorder of family functions. This is done so that the Kitchen God can report to the Jade Emperor of the family household\u2019s transgressions and good deeds. Families often offer sweet foods (such as candy) in order to \u201cbribe\u201d the deities into reporting good things about the family., 290043=[\u2026] wishing you a prosperous Chinese New Year of the Horse \u99ac and a Happy New Year 2014 with Annual Surplus [\u2026], 34460=New Year\u2019s Day itself was traditionally called Yuandan (Chinese: \u5143\u65e6; pinyin: Yu\u00e1nd\u00e0n), literally \u201cthe first sunrise\u201d, but in 1913 the recently established Republic of China government appropriated that name to refer instead to New Year\u2019s Day in the newly adopted Gregorian Calendar, with Chinese New Year instead being called \u201cSpring Festival\u201d (traditional Chinese: \u6625\u7bc0; simplified Chinese: \u6625\u8282; pinyin: Ch\u016bnji\u00e9), which remains the official name for the New Year\u2019s Day public holiday in both mainland China and Taiwan. Prior to 1913, \u201cSpring Festival\u201d instead referred to lichun, (February 4 or 5), the first solar term in a Chinese calendar year, which marked the end of winter and start of spring., 55311=Chinese New Year is observed as a public holiday in a number of countries and territories where a sizable Chinese population resides. Since Chinese New Year falls on different dates on the Gregorian calendar every year on different days of the week, some of these governments opt to shift working days in order to accommodate a longer public holiday. In some countries, a statutory holiday is added on the following work day when the New Year falls on a weekend, as in the case of 2013, where the New Year\u2019s Eve (February 9) falls on Saturday and the New Year\u2019s day (February 10) on Sunday., 57708=February 9\u201312 (Vietnam), 47016=In the Gregorian calendar, Chinese New Year falls on different dates each year, a date between January 21 and February 20. In the Chinese calendar, winter solstice must occur in the 11th month, which means that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an intercalary month intervenes). In traditional Chinese Culture, lichun is a solar term marking the start of spring, which occurs about February 4., 178340=Back in the 1960s, children in Hong Kong used to say \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86,\u6597\u96f6\u5514\u611b (Cantonese, Gung Hei Fat Choy, Lai Si Tau Loi, Tau Ling M Ngoi), which was recorded in the a pop song Kowloon Hong Kong by Reynettes in 1966. Later in the 1970s, children in Hong Kong used the saying: \u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1,\u5229\u662f\u9017\u4f86,\u4f0d\u6beb\u5acc\u5c11,\u58f9\u868a\u5514\u611b (Cantonese), roughly translated as, \u201cCongratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope, fifty cents is too little, don\u2019t want a dollar either.\u201d It basically meant that they disliked small change \u2013 coins which were called \u201chard substance\u201d (Cantonese: \u786c\u5622). Instead, they wanted \u201csoft substance\u201d (Cantonese: \u8edf\u5622), which was either a ten dollar or a twenty dollar note., 159830=Chinese New Year is also celebrated by Chinese-Indonesians in Indonesia since 1999 when Suharto stepped down. In 2003 the Chinese New Year was declared to be a national day.[45], 52968=According to tales and legends, the beginning of Chinese New Year started with the fight against a mythical beast called the Nian (Chinese: \u5e74; pinyin: Ni\u00e1n). Nian would come on the first day of New Year to eat livestock, crops, and even villagers, especially children. To protect themselves, the villagers would put food in front of their doors at the beginning of every year. It was believed that after the Nian ate the food they prepared, it wouldn\u2019t attack any more people. One time, people saw that the Nian was scared away by a little child wearing red. The villagers then understood that the Nian was afraid of the color red. Hence, every time when the New Year was about to come, the villagers would hang red lanterns and red spring scrolls on windows and doors. People also used firecrackers to frighten away the Nian. From then on, Nian never came to the village again. The Nian was eventually captured by Hongjun Laozu, an ancient Taoist monk. The Nian became Hongjun Laozu\u2019s mount.[9], 80715=Approaching 12 midnight on this day, Hokkiens will be seen preparing for a Jade Emperor ritual (Bai Ti Gong or \u62dc\u5929\u516c) which incenses will be burnt and food offerings will be made to the Jade Emperor and also to Zao Jun, the God of Kitchen who reports to the Emperor on each family. It is the birthday of the Jade Emperor who is the Taoist ruler of Heaven based on folks culture. In actual Taoism, Jade Emperor governs all the mortal\u2019s realm and below., 47990=The dates for Chinese New Year from 1996 to 2031 (in the Gregorian calendar) are above, along with the year\u2019s presiding animal zodiac and its earthly branch. The names of the earthly branches have no English counterparts and are not the Chinese translations of the animals. Alongside the 12-year cycle of the animal zodiac there is a 10-year cycle of heavenly stems. Each of the ten heavenly stems is associated with one of the five elements of Chinese astrology, namely: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. The elements are rotated every two years while a yin and yang association alternates every year. The elements are thus distinguished: Yang Wood, Yin Wood, Yang Fire, Yin Fire, etc. These produce a combined cycle that repeats every 60 years. For example, the year of the Yang Fire Rat occurred in 1936 and in 1996, 60 years apart., 17078=Although the Chinese calendar traditionally does not use continuously numbered years, outside China its years are often numbered from the reign of the Yellow Emperor. But at least three different years numbered 1 are now used by various scholars, making the year beginning in 2012 AD the \u201cChinese Year\u201d 4710, 4709, or 4649.[7], 49957=Many confuse their Chinese birth-year with their Gregorian birth-year. As the Chinese New Year starts in late January to mid-February, the Chinese year dates from January 1 until that day in the new Gregorian year remain unchanged from the previous Gregorian year. For example, the 1989 year of the snake began on February 6, 1989. The year 1990 is considered by some people to be the year of the horse. However, the 1989 year of the snake officially ended on February 8, 1990. This means that anyone born from January 1 to February 7, 1990 was actually born in the year of the snake rather than the year of the horse. Many online Chinese Sign calculators do not account for the non-alignment of the two calendars, using Gregorian-calendar years rather than official Chinese New Year dates., 157977=Chinese New Year in Singapore is accompanied by various festive activities. One of the main highlights is the Chinatown celebrations. In 2010, this included a Festive Street Bazaar, nightly staged shows at Kreta Ayer Square and a lion dance competition.[42] The Chingay Parade also features prominently in the celebrations. It is an annual street parade in Singapore, well known for its colourful floats and wide variety of cultural performances.[43] The highlights of the Parade for 2011 include a Fire Party, multi-ethnic performances and an unprecedented travelling dance competition.[44], 57270=February 10\u201312 (Macau)}",

The calendar is also used in countries that have adopted or have been influenced by Han culture, notably the Koreans, Japanese and Vietnamese.[8] In the Gregorian calendar, Chinese New Year falls on different dates each year, a date between January 21 and February 20. In the Chinese calendar, winter solstice must occur in the 11th month, which means that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an intercalary month intervenes).
