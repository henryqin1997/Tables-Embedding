To manage the enormous and fast-growing amount of personal data available today, regulators and policy makers must carefully design legislation to protect citizens from data misuse while not hampering businesses that use this data ethically. The European Union (EU), as the largest technology policy legislator in Europe, is facing emerging issues regarding data protection raised by mobile applications, social networking platforms, and the mobile Internet., 6140=One of the challenges for the EU is the popularization of social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook and MySpace. In 2009, the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party advocated that the line between the roles of user and data collector needs to be clarified, as personal users are often not aware of their legal responsibilities when sharing data. \u0093An SNS warns users that they should not publish information regarding other individuals without their consent, but users are generally not aware of their potential to become a data controller when they share information,\u0094 comments Sharon Hoeck. \u0093They usually do not understand the implications of the role of data collector and they are also not aware of the extent to which they could be prosecuted should the EU choose to enforce Article 29\u0092s suggestions.\u0094, 5610=\u0093The EU has to respond to new market trends and dynamics,\u0094 says Sharon Hoeck, Research Analyst for Frost & Sullivan\u0092s ICT group. The legislator has begun to react, adapting its privacy laws in a way that attempts to maintain relevance in the context of a rapidly expanding online world. \u0093While laws that were originally laid out in 1995 are still enforced, they have been expanded to oversee the growing disclosure of personal data over the internet and through information and communication technology,\u0094 adds Ms Hoeck.}",
