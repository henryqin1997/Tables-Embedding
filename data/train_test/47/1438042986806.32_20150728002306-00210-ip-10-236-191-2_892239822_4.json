Make sure to have some extra spending money for weekend meals because the dining hours can be kind of inconvenient. Take advantage of the opportunities during orientation to attend club meetings and meet other students. Bang for the buck CU is very, very expensive, however they give out a great deal of scholarships. My tuition is almost totally covered by scholarships and loans. I think the experience is worth the high cost to learn here. Am enjoying being here The small campus makes it easy to get back and forth to class. There are a lot of great resteraunts around Bexley, and a Kroger and CVS fairly close to the campus. Most all the students are really great. There are a number of student organizations available to join, like sororities/fraternities, PRIDE, CUSNA, and so on. The food is alright, especially Mongo Bongo, but the lack of choice can make it seem boring after a while. Overall it's a really great place to go to school. Am learning a lot Capital University is a very challenging school. The professors are very nice and usually will go out of their way to help you.",
