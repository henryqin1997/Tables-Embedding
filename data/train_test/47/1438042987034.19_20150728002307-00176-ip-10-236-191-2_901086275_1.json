            "Snead is great for people who like to be involved, there are plenty of opportunities. Snead is for people who like to know people and be known. It is decently small, but yet there enough people that you can meet someone new every day.",
            "Ask around about the teachers before you sing up for a class. Sometimes the same class will be offered by a teacher who is a lot more fun than the other. I don't suggest buying books on the first day of school, make sure you will actually need the book first. Know where your classes are before you are supposed to be there. Snead's ambassadors are always willing to give tours, so schedule one before you start.",
            "Snead offers many degrees and classes. The price of tuition is cheaper than a lot of other places and the overall experience is terrific!",
            "I started out not wanting to attend Snead because it is a community college. Now that I am attending I don't want to leave! Snead is what you make it. If you get involved and make friends, you will love it!",
            "What you learn at Snead is what you want to learn at Snead. If you put forth a little bit of effort, there is much to be learned."

The dorm life there is nice, but cramped, since 2011 had so many freshmen enrolled (both in and out of state). If you are an in-state student, my suggestion would be to live with your relatives and if you're an out-of-state student, live in the dorms (unless you have relatives living in the state of Alabama as well)., 82558=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Tips for prospective students Don't let the fact that it's easy get to you, because if you do, your grades will start slipping. Even if you don't feel that you need to, STUDY!! Bang for the buck You can take all of your basic classes and then go on to your university and its cheaper!! Am enjoying being here I love my teachers, they are so energetic and try to make the most out of boring lecture days. Am learning a lot",
