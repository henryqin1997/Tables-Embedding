    "textBeforeTable": "A small-town anthropomorphic pet bird's life is taken for a wild ride after he falls in love with an independent spirit from a background opposite to his own. ABSTRACT A macaw hatchling traveling through the northern United States after having been smuggled out of Brazil falls out of a truck in Moose Lake, Minnesota, whereupon he is discovered by a young girl and named Blu. Fifteen years later, his owner - now the proprietor of a bookstore - accepts an offer from an ornithologist friend to fly Blu, the last surviving male from his species, to Rio de Janeiro to mate with a compatible female. Blu ultimately ends up kindling a romance with the fiercely independent and free-spirited Jewel, who takes him along for a ride free of the shackles of captivity in his native land while avoiding smugglers determined to bring the both of them back to America. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Director: Carlos Saldanha Writers: Carlos Saldanha; Earl Richey Jones; Todd Jones; Don Rhymer; Joshua Sternin; Jeffrey Ventimilia; Sam Harper Music by: John Powell Producers: Bruce Anderson; John C. Donkin Keywords: Comedy, 3D (3-Apr-2011) Rio",
