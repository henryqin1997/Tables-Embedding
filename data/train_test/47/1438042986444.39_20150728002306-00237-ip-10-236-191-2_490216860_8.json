This stent includes ratchet means for allowing the selection of an expanded diameter for the stent. Derbyshire teaches that this stent is removable, but to do so the stent must be redilated to release the ratchet catch, and then a forceps is applied to remove the device., 21448=U.S. Pat. No. 4,740,207, issued Apr. 26, 1988 to J. W. Kreamer also teaches a stent device selectively expandable by a balloon catheter which includes a retaining ledge on its inside wall that catches the edge of the expanding stent to hold it in a dilated position. There is no teaching in Kreamer of a means for retraction of the device once it has been dilated to a catch position., 20717=U.S. Pat. No. 4,733,665, issued Mar. 29, 1988 to J. C. Palmaz describes an expandable stent for placement in the blood vessel of an animal. The Palmaz teaching is for a wire mesh stent that is expandable through use of an angioplasty balloon. The stent is to be used as a permanent graft.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Having thus described the preferred embodiments of the present invention, those of skill in the art will readily appreciate the other useful embodiments within the scope of the claims hereto attached. The primary advantages of this second embodiment are: it enables the use of a smaller profile for the stent apparatus of this invention; and, there is little chance of tabs 17 causing a trauma in the walls of the lumen where the stent is placed, because tabs 17 will remain within the coil formed by member 10. Referring now to FIG. 6, there is shown a plan view of a second preferred embodiment of the apparatus of this invention. In this second embodiment, latch wire 15 and tabs or catches 17 are each on opposite sides of member 10 than in the above described embodiment. Thus latch 15 is shown on the outside of member 10, while catches 17 are on the inside. (Mounting means for latch 10 are provided as in the above described embodiment, but are not shown in FIG. 6 for purposes of clarity.) The effective result is that as member 10 expands or uncoils, latch wire 15 will be carried to tabs 17, rather than vice-versa. In all other respects the embodiment of FIG. 6 works in the same manner as the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5. As described above, a latch wire 15 (not shown in FIG. 5) of a corrosion",
