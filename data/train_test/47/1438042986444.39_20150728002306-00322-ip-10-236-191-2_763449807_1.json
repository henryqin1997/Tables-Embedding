In his seminal work \"Portfolio Selection,\" Harry Markowitz makes it clear that the quantitative framework to be used in determining optimal investment solutions should reflect the real concerns and objectives of the client. While applications of the broad vision Markowitz expressed in 1959 were drastically limited by the computational power available at the time, today computer processing capacity is much less of an issue. Markowitz also expressed concerns about the ability of the investor to formulate the inputs required for portfolio selection. Here he was mainly concerned with the large number of covariances required to do portfolio selection. Today the investment problem is largely seen as an asset allocation issue rather than a security selection problem, which reduces the number of inputs., 11959=On Monday, September 27, 1999, on CNBC's program \"Power Lunch,\" a financial planner was addressing the question of why people fail in their investment programs. According to the planner: \"The mistakes most investors make are to fail to define their financial goals and to fail to invest with an eye towards achieving those goals.\" He then went on to say, \"Once the financial goals have been defined, selecting the investments to achieve those goals is easy.\", 40703=Join ThinkAdvisor for this live, interactive webcast and hear from the winners of the 2015 SMA Mangers of the Year on impact investing strategies and..., 9500=Top 10 Best-Funded State Pensions: 2015, 40654=Jun 09, 2015, 46569=\u00a9 2015 ThinkAdvisor.

    "textBeforeTable": "The following is an illustration of the output of a comprehensive wealth management analysis given a client's current asset allocation strategy: So far, we've ignored the concept of risk. In Portfolio Selection, Markowitz introduced the idea that investors should evaluate risk as well as return in determining the most attractive investment solution. This is true in Comprehensive Wealth Management as well. The risk associated with not achieving retirement and estate planning goals needs to be quantified and evaluated. There are several approaches to doing this, including Monte Carlo simulation and Scenario Forecasting. In Scenario Forecasting, RFRs and WPRs are calculated that are associated with one or more downside scenarios. With Comprehensive Wealth Management, financial advisors evaluate risk and return in terms of the most likely RFR and the Downside RFR and the most likely WPR(s) and Downside WPR(s). In evaluating estate planning options, sets of WPRs are generated for various estate planning horizons. Income protection can be quantified by the Life Insurance Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Disability Coverage Ratio (DCR). This can take one of several forms. One of the forms is to calculate a set of financial ratios. Retirement funding can be evaluated in terms of a retirement funding ratio (RFR). RFR is the ratio of projected funding of retirement expenses to a targeted level of retirement expenditures. An RFR of 1.5 indicates that the projected funding of retirement expenses exceeds the goal by 50%. The prospect of achieving estate-planning objectives can be quantified in terms of a",

Other solutions may provide even more attractive tradeoffs. Given adequate computer resources (now under development by several organizations) comprehensive wealth management software can quickly produce a set of alternative solutions for the financial advisor to evaluate. An aggregate scoring of an investment, financial planning, and estate planning solution is also possible where rewards, penalties, and constraints are attached to competing financial objectives. The program would seek out the most attractive set of tradeoffs. The solutions can be summarized in terms of a Financial Success Ratio. Comprehensive Wealth Management recognizes that both client circumstances and investment opportunities change. The objective is to keep the client on course towards achieving his or her financial objectives, which requires that progress towards achieving goals be monitored and periodically reviewed with the client. It also requires that changes in the financial plan and investment strategy be implemented as changing circumstances dictate.
