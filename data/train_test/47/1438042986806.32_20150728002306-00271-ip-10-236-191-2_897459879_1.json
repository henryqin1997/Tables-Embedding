            "Great for students who love campus involvement, there is almost always something going on all over campus. It's also great for both the free minded, and structural based thinkers as Doane will challenge your perspective and change how you see the world. Great for students who want a small college and emphasis on student success, a teacher will always stay after class or come in early to help.",
            "Any student thinking about a smaller college should consider Doane. It is an old school with lots of heritage and tradition. The class size is small and attention on the student is the main focus of the college. A small campus always keeps everyone involved. If you want to be a part of a plethora of activities and meet many new friends than Doane College is right for you.",
            "Doane is an expensive school, but with the expense comes a great education, if you plan on being a teacher no school is better than Doane. With smaller class sizes the teacher really gets to know you and with a smaller staff the teachers you have once you're likely to have again, and they will know exactly how to help you succeed, The teaching staff at Doane is top notch and will do anything to see their students succeed.",
            "The campus is always alive whether it's with school planned activities such as dances, or video game tournament, or student planned activities like intramural sports or cutting loose on the weekends. Doane always keeps you involved and that's why the campus feels more like a community rather than making you feel like you're just a number at a big school.",
            "Doane College is a small college therefore class sizes are small and the material gets relayed and related to you in new and innovative ways. Teachers have more time to focus on the students because of the smaller class sizes. Doane is a great choice especially for teaching, musical, and human sciences majors."

It takes about 5 minutes to walk to every class on Doane Campus. -Students who enjoy school spirit. Doane is proud of not only it's alumni and academics, but it's athletics, and clubs. A majority of Doane students play a sport, so go support! Tips for prospective students -When you decide Doane is for you, don't hesitate to fill out residence hall applications to get your pick, rooms go fast! -Find out where all your classes are BEFORE the day of classes! -Attend Orientation Week! It's a great way to meet the incoming freshmen and get a feel for the campus before the upperclassmen come! -Get a good meal plan. You will be in Crete, NE",
