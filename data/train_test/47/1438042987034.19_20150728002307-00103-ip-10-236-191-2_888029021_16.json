            "I usually go to the REK to work out and play ping pong with my husband. There is also the Student Union room where you can go and hang out with friends while you play pool. Also, there is a park near by that you can go take a stroll at.",
            "Barns and Nobles is an amazing place to read and have a frapiccino with some friends. The food is good, there are a couple of shops that have your favorites. There is also some restaurants near by that aren't that pricey.",
            "I live at home with my mother-in-law. I have never seen them so wouldnt have an opinion on that.",
            "There are easy and hard teachers in every college. Some of the teachers i have had are amazing and work with the students to get where they want to be. But there are those teachers that hate coming to class and give you pop quizzes for no reason.",
            "Riding a bicycle around campus helps on the hot days and helps you get to class faster. Register right away and attend mandatory advising when you have time. Study! Study! Study!",
            "I love the weather, even though it can get a bit hot. The teachers are a great help, always asking and pushing us to become better students. Not a lot of parking, but they are working on it."

For example, Charro Days is a very fun and exciting festival we celebrate at the end of February each year. Students are actually out of school for a couple of days due to this holiday. We have parades, small concerts, carnivals, and many more stuff. This area is highly influenced by the Mexican culture since we are only five minutes away from Mexico., 134920=Yes, students would be curious as to how and why these practices take place. Also, we get to have three mini carnivals, two circuses, and quite a few parades in town. Parades are around mid February and the other parade in December., 272323=The University of Texas at Brownsville, has a very important place in my life, it means the opportunity for a better tomorrow. Nowadays,it is extremely important to have a college degree or technical certification, in order to find a well paid job. I would describe my life in two phases, before and after UTB, my life is better unfortunatelly, I didn't had the money to attend last semester Spring 2013, but hopefully I can attend this Fall 2013., 338562=There are tons of activites and charity organizations on campus! We have outdoor movie nights with free munchies, parties at the doorm pool, and something us ocelots like to call Orange Crush. It is a party the first week of school with games, free food, music, and many other things. Not to mention, we have the 2013 NAIA Volleyball Champions!, 203430=I personally don't live at the dorms, but they used to be an amazing apartment complex that I used to constantly be at, and it was built in 2011., 399742=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Anyone who wants to get away from a hectic city environment and is looking for a more calm and passive atmosphere will probably enjoy this more than everyone else :) Tips for prospective students I would advise prospective students to just enjoy the time they have on campus. UTB is very relaxed and everyone gets along with everyone else here. It's not unpleasant. Bang for the buck Considering that tuition isn't all that expensive in comparison to other colleges in Texas, it saddens me to say that yes. You do get your money's worth! Am enjoying being here This campus isn't all too exciting as far as student life goes. There aren't too many organizations to join and the ones that ARE on campus, aren't very exciting. The dorms aren't very appealing and there really isn't much around campus except for a downtown area. Am learning a lot Despite what many people say about the teachers at this University, I truly believe that I have received a quality education here thus far :)",
