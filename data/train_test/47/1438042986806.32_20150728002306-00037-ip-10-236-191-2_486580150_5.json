The logic module 24 is able to control and hold execution of the subject block in any of these three phases, as is known to those of ordinary skill in the art. This aspect is similar to that in typical existing CNCs, such as the 9/Series CNC available from Allen-Bradley Company, L.L.C., located at 1201 South Second Street, Milwaukee, Wis. In the asynchronous mode, however, the main CNC processor 32 forces the part program execution to stop and provides an error message if, for example, a pre-block or post-block request is received from logic module 24. In this event, the condition causing the error message must be cleared before execution of the part program can be resumed. It should be noted that non-motion \u201csetup-type\u201d blocks may be executed as fast as possible in asynchronous mode. In other words, execution of such blocks is not limited by the communication time between the CNC and the servo subsystem.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It will be understood that the foregoing description is of a preferred exemplary embodiment of this invention and that the invention is not limited to the specific forms shown. For example, the use of synchronous, asynchronous and auto-synchronous modes may be incorporated into a variety of CNCs having a variety of architectures; the logic module and the block execution module may comprise separate processors disposed at the same or separate locations on the same or separate workstations; a variety of synchronization control parameters may be used in a given motion control program to initiate the change of modes during execution of the program; and the specific functions controlled in synchronous mode, asynchronous mode or auto-synchronous mode can vary from one application or architecture to another. These and other modifications may be made in the design and arrangement of the elements described above without departing from the scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. When the mode is changed to auto-synchronous mode, the specific mode utilized for a given block or plurality of blocks is dictated by program block content. Depending on the type of program block (N1, N2, N3 . . . ), CNC system 10 operates either in synchronous mode, as illustrated in FIG. 6 or asynchronous mode as illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8. In asynchronous operation, the execution of program block N1 is initiated at the leftmost side of",
