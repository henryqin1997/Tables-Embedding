I had high expectations for this novel, considering how much I loved Meg Medina's Tia Isa Wants a Car, and I wasn't disappointed.

The fact that there was no central character took a little getting used to but it worked. I was very environmentally minded as a teenager and now having read this I realize how different it is being an environmental minded teen today than it was 15 years ago.
