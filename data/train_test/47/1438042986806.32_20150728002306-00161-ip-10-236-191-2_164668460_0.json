But, maybe in a few years he could come out for a trick play. I wish our team used trick plays a little more, but I don't think it would be Avery being the QB.",

Maybe the team will come together more after this and become a better team instead of two guys scoring and three guys passing the ball. We can all only hope this happens. Or else we are screwed.",
