            "The dining hall is convenient. The chiefs really try to accomodate for special dietary needs. They have gluten-free and vegetarian options for every meal. They also have typical dishes that you can count on being served every meal. They also got a brand new espresso machine this year! Also, there are many other eateries on campus that take points that come with each meal plan.",
            "The dorms are all well kept. The rooms themselves aren't the typical white walled, jail cells that are the norm for most state universities. There is a lot of room for storage and room to debunk the bunk beds or have a refrigerator/ couch. It is community style for four out of five of the buildings, but this makes for closer relationships. On that note, it is not co-ed living. Male and females have separate wings or floors.",
            "Their is a difference between doing homework and studying. All the courses I have taken, and most of what I have heard of, are quite rigorous. Professors take higher education very seriously. I don't think there are any easy A's at this university. You get out what you put in.",
            "Don't be afraid to ask anybody--whether its peers, PA's, professors, or a random person--for hlep.",
            "Seattle Pacific is the ideal small campus meets big city location. Many eateries, hangout/ study spots are either right on campus or nearby. There is always some kind of activity going on."

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students SPU has one of the most successful nursing programs in the nation, so if you're thinking about nursing this is a great school. We also have a popular business school and a fantastic English program. (English students will have great internship opportunities at SPU!) If you don't mind rain, it's a great place for you; if you like getting involved in community service and charity, there are tons of opportunities for that at SPU as well. And if you like books or music, Seattle has a great artsy scene that you'll really enjoy. Tips for prospective students Apply for as many scholarships as you can--it will pay off. Also make sure you apply for University Scholars if you are any good at writing, or if you're just interested in getting better at writing. You'll do a lot of essays but it's worth it to have all the school's best professors inviting you to their office whenever you want help! Apply for housing as soon as possible, and try to get into Ashton or Hill (they are commonly known as the friendliest and best halls). And make sure to schedule an entrance interview; it's not required, but it really helps the admissions office get to know you and helps you get to know the school. Bang for the buck",
