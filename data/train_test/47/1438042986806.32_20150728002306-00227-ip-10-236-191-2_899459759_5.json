            "Fullerton College is great for all types of students. From 16-year-old high school students taking classes to rapidly advance their education, to senior citizens going back to school to finish their education, it is a very diverse school and offers many types of programs. The flexibility of choosing your own schedule allows students to either go to the really early morning classes, or stay up late with the night owls. If you learn at a slow pace, FJC is a cheap and easy way to take your time through school at your own pace. You can take a one-unit class, or 19 units per semester (not suggested\u2026I didn\u2019t get much sleep the one time I did this). If you work full time, you can easily pick and choose times that work with your schedule. Overall, I\u2019d say Fullerton really caters to the all types of students and gives an incredible educational experience. It has many clubs including speech and debate (forensics), science clubs, math clubs, writing clubs, clubs for religious and/or ethnic groups, art club (really cool group of people!), theater/drama club, music clubs, ASB, sports clubs, and much more. Any kind of student can easily fit in at this school, or take classes to fit into their busy schedule. It\u2019s really a great school for anyone, no matter their age, gender, ethnicity, or level of education.",
            "If you\u2019re taking an early morning class (7:30 or 8:00am class), don\u2019t buy the parking permit. There\u2019s always adequate parking on the streets and in the neighborhoods south of Chapman (the neighborhood to the north of Berkley and Chapman has signs posted saying you can\u2019t park there now). Walking is good exercise and can help wake you up before your class starts. Sit up front so you don\u2019t get distracted and can easily pay attention to what your professor is saying. You\u2019ll be glad you did when finals roll around. Join a study group\u2026these may be the very people to save your life on an important test, midterms, finals, or group projects. If you\u2019re petitioning a class and there\u2019s no room and a waiting list, sit in the front, talk to the teacher before and after class, stay all the way through the class (even when the professor says you can leave after signing your name on the wait list), and keep coming until a spot opens up. Students tend to drop classes like hot potatoes in the third week or so of the semester. Just bide your time and be patient. Do the homework. Don\u2019t cheat. Have fun.",
            "$26 per unit...need I say more? Considering the cost of tuition at Fullerton College is so cheap, one would expect the education or overall college experience to be less than satisfactory. However, the opposite is the case. The teachers and faculty are a joy to converse with, very helpful, they actually love what they do, and they\u2019re extremely eager to help students reach their full potential. Despite the 24,000 students on campus, each teacher still takes the time to try to get to know their students on a personal level. Even when the school experienced budget cuts, the students and tuition never seem to suffer from it. The school itself has actually been expanding with a recent addition to the science building. Parking permits cost a whopping $36 per semester, which is a bargain at any other school in the USA. Fullerton starts earlier and finishes later than most schools, giving the students ample opportunity to take classes nice and easy while still receiving a spectacular academic experience. As the oldest community college in California, FJC knows what it\u2019s doing\u2026and it does it well at an ridiculously inexpensive cost to students.",
            "Besides all of the information-rich classes I've been taking here, FJC is just a fun college to be at. The campus is beautiful, the students are friendly, and the professors are warm and welcoming. Also, against all odds, the cafeteria serves good food! I've made some really great friends here and have had so much fun over the past two years. The central location of the school also affords students the opportunity to go out and explore many different options in food, entertainment, and activities. Fullerton is about 10 minutes away from Disneyland (a place where friends from school and I have spent many hours hanging out), 20 minutes away from the beach, and walking distance to student favorites such as Starbucks, Chipotle, Subway, McDonald\u2019s, Pick-Up-Stix, Yogurtland, Panera, Chicago Harv's, KFC, Pinkberry, Thai Basil, Wahoo\u2019s, and many more. The environment on campus always consists of students chattering excitedly, warm Southern California weather, various school activities, and people rushing to and from classes. It is definitely a very fun place to be. I also absolutely loved being on the speech and debate team (forensics) and won several awards for the school. This goes for all clubs and activities readily available on campus. I've made some great friends through forensics and enjoyed every minute I've been at this school.",
            "I absolutely love this school. I've taken Basic Drawing for Non-art Majors, Math, History of Women in the United States, Sociology 101, English 103 Logic and Critical Thinking, Music Appreciation, Nutrition, Spinning (indoor cycling), Japanese, English 100, Astronomy, and many more classes at FJC. All of them have taught me so much about education, specific fields of study, applying myself academically, discipline, academic honesty, perseverance, and life in general. I have yet to take a class that I don't like. All of the learning experiences I've had have made me a stronger, more diligent student. It has also cultivated a passion for learning that I don\u2019t believe I could have encountered in another environment. I\u2019m definitely learning a lot at this school."

I have had great relationships with teachers and been able to keep a good G.P.A. I am now interested in joining the study abroad program for 2014., 397218=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 6857=I've been here since Summer 2009, and all I can say about this college is that I love it. I've taken art/dance history classes, business classes, music, oceanography classes and so much more! This college offers so many wonderful classes but most importantly I am learning so much while I have fun! The professors really care about all of their students, and because some classes are so small, you can work with them one on one. My experience has been amazing here and I am learning more at this college than in high school!, 61872=founded in 1913, fullerton college (formally known as fullerton junior college) is the oldest and largest community college in california. fullerton college has a yearly enrollment of 22,014 students. student life here is mostly clam and quite. fullerton college is known for being the highest ranked transfer institution in california to have more students transferring to universities of california and california state universities. but, i am just sayin, 95358=There's an annual Halloween costume contest in October, which brings out all the creative and brave individuals front and center! The chalk drawing contests on the sidewalks of the Quad allows you to view intricate works of art at ease for no cost!, 295416=$47 a unit as of Fall 2013, 17702=If you\u2019re taking an early morning class (7:30 or 8:00am class), don\u2019t buy the parking permit.

Have fun., 285835=I am going to dorm this upcoming august, I am exited and nervous to find out who I will be rooming with, 363855=After applying and before you sign up for classes, you take assessments for math, English, and reading to see where you place. If you're in AP classes and fresh out of high school, you should do fine. But a lot of people have to start at the begining math and English before they are even eligible to take transfer classes. Try and get early classes so you don't have to worry about parking. By 10:30 am on a Monday, there are no spots left. But after 1:30 pm spots seem to clear up. Bathrooms are ok, just depending on the building you're in. Campus is clean, but people smoke a lot. Like a lot a lot, even though there are no smoking signs so that is kinda annoying. In the big parking structure, people don't park the greatest so try to actually park inside the lines. Overall a great community college.}",

And while I won't deny I have bumped into the occasional partiers, I am still surrounded by hard-working and intelligent students that work just as hard as I do, if not more and have 4.0 GPA's. If you want to get a higher education and you can't afford it, this is the school for you, and you can be rest assured that you will find good, hard-working friends and others that love and know how to have fun! Tips for prospective students Study hard. This college has so many opportunities for you to shine and to transfer to amazing schools, EVEN ON THE EAST COAST. Get good grades and join the Honors Program. You won't regret it. Get involved on campus and join",
