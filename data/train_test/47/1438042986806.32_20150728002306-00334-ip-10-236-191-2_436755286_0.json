In colder temperatures you should wear full winter clothing under your overalls: thermal underwear; thin gloves (to wear under provided mittens); jogging bottoms or thermal underwear; at least two warm fleeces and a jacket or ski jacket.

In warmer temperatures you can wear less underneath the overalls., 30635=Exclusive photographic charter in the Svalbard Archipelago accompanied by Paul Goldstein and Mark Carwardine.
