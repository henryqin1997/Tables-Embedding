In FIG. 7, a further modified form of the invention includes a transmitter 200, a portion of which is shown. A sensor 202 with an interior chamber and tubes 204 in a first transmitter body 206 are connected together and the sensor and tubes 204 are filled with a substantially incompressible fluid for coupling pressure to the sensor. The tubes 204 have outer ends which will lead into passageways leading to chambers defined by isolator diaphragms 208 in a second transmitter body 210. Extrusile seals 212 surround the outer end portion of tubes 204 and the seals 212 will be extruded to seal the fluid connection between the sensor 204 and the isolator diaphragm as explained in connection with FIG. 3. Bolts 214 urge the first and second transmitter bodies together to compress and extrude the seals 212. A second set of extrusile seals 216 are provided in the first transmitter body to seal the interior cavity 218 of the first transmitter. Screws 220 are used to force ring 222 against the seals 216 to compress and seat the seals. The ring 222 operates similarly to ring 110 in FIG. 5 to extrude the seals into place. The",
