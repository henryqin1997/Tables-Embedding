    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{3945=Brooks' self-titled first album was released in 1989, featured his first hit single, 'If Tomorrow Never Comes', which was soon followed at number one by 'The Dance'. Interestingly, Brooks has stated that of all his songs, 'The Dance' remains his favorite. Garth Brooks' second album, No Fences was released just one year later in 1990 and reached the number one spot on the country music Billboard charts, as well as the number three spot on the pop Billboard charts. Brooks gained momentum by touring. Garth Brooks tickets sold quickly as he set himself apart from other current country stars by utilizing a wireless microphone that allowed him to run around the stage in the style of iconic rockers. Between 1991 and 1998, Brooks released another seven top albums, and in 1999, Brooks released the pop album Chris Gaines, which was not well recieved. Garth Brooks continued to produce albums, and in 2005, he officially retired from touring., 5401=In an emotion-filled tribute, Brooks became the newest member of the Country Music Hall of Fame on October 21, 2012, with his hero George Strait welcoming him to the group. At the close of the ceremony Brooks offered a hint about a return to the road \"some day coming up.\" He told the Wall Street Journal he would still play honkey-tonks if he could, adding, \"Cause that's the place. No arena or stadium show has ever equaled a honkey-tonk.\", 6598=Brooks is also set to perform at a George Jones tribute event Nov. 22 in Nashville, and a week later will head back to Vegas wrap his residency at the Wynn during the two-hour \"Garth Brooks: Live in Las Vegas\" special set to air on CBS on November 29. It will officially mark the end of what has become a three-year stay for Brooks in Sin City., 9452=Brooks had laid low since 2001, opting to step away from the spotlight to quietly raise his three daughters until all were college-age. But his reengagement into the music world began in late 2013 with an announcement on his website. Next came press conferences, concert announcements, the crushing blow of seeing five concerts canceled in Dublin, Ireland that would have started his world tour, and the eventual kickoff in the Windy City., 7221=Brooks, a Tulsa native, vowed back in 2001 that he was going to stay off the road and out of the studio until his children were grown. His three daughters are now all young adults, with the youngest, Allie, having turned 17 in July. And if Brooks' upcoming schedule is any indication, he's getting the pipes warmed up for something special., 2897=In 2009, Brooks began touring again, and he is as popular as ever. Garth Brooks tickets still sell out quickly, and his fan base continues to increase. The Recording Industry Association of America has named Garth Brooks as best selling solo artist of the twentieth century. Although this title has been shared between Brooks and Elvis Presley, it appears that the two remain neck-and-neck in sales. In addition to being named the best selling artist of the twentieth century, Brooks is also the recipient of two Grammys, sixteen American Music Awards, eleven Country Music Association Awards, and countless others. Brooks has released a whopping 14 albums, including compilations., 8119=11/24/13: Garth Brooks sure picked the perfect time of year to send a cryptic message to his fans. The Oklahoma country music megastar issued a mysterious message in late October to those signed up for his email newsletter. It had a subject line reading \"First message from Garth\" and text that read, \"The sevens have aligned. It has begun \u2026 thank you for believing.\", 4591=Troyal Garth Brooks, better known simply as 'Garth Brooks' was born February 7, 1962 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. As a child, Brooks sang for family events, but was far more interested in sports. Proving his worth, Garth Brooks received a javelin scholarship to Oklahoma State University, where he received his degree in advertising. After graduating, Brooks began his quest to become a country star, playing in clubs and bars. In 1985, noted entertainment attorney Rod Phelps drove from Dallas to listen to Brooks. Phelps liked what he heard and offered to produce Garth's first demo., 8994=In the midst of all these explosive performances, Brooks has announced another new business venture, GhostTunes, a digital music service he hopes will go head-to-head with iTunes for download sales and music streaming. He remains the top-selling artist in Nielsen SoundScan history, having sold just shy of 70 million albums since SoundScan started tracking retail sales back in 1991., 1921=After retiring from the road 13 years ago, country legend Garth Brooks is back and better than ever. In early January, he announced that he and the band would perform two gigs in Ireland in July. Sadly, those shows were cancelled, but the statement he released left fans speculating: \"Before we go back on tour\u2026, 8591=Brooks' new tour is shaping up to be the most in-demand ticket of 2014 (and beyond). After the Chicago dates, he announced he would reveal performances one city at a time. He booked seven shows in Atlanta and then announced three more shows in Jacksonville, Florida. And where Garth Brooks (and wife Trisha Yearwood) intend to turn up next is anyone's guess, but there's no doubt Garth Brooks tickets will continue to be a hot commodity., 6863=After sold-out performances over the summer, Brooks has returned to the Encore Theater at the Wynn Las Vegas for eight special shows. They began the weekend of October 18, and he will also perform November 8 and 9 at both 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., 6155=Brooks has been performing at the Encore Last Vegas since December 2009, with an arrangement to do only weekend acoustic performances and still be home with his family. That run, which was always described as open-ended, will end on November 17, 2012. Brooks still plans to film an acoustic show there in the summer of 2013, but has not given a specific date he will return to the theater to do it., 7714=So\u2026 is the semi-retired Brooks coming out of retirement? That seems to be the consensus in many media circles, especially after he indicated backstage at Toby Keith's Oklahoma Twister Relief in July that he anticipated making fresh music soon. The enigmatic website message also came just two months after Brooks' country star wife Trisha Yearwood told \"CBS This Morning\" that she and her husband have plans to create a new album and eventually go on tour together.}",
