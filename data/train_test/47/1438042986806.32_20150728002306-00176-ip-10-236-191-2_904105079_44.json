            "The campus has their own police station for your own safety.",
            "There's a small pond that's in front of the gym that's full of turtles. You can bring bread out there and feed them and they'll swarm over and some will climb out of water to eat it. Beware, the squirrels are too friendly and will take bread out of your hands. The Student Union is a hang out area for the students and also TWU just got a pool.",
            "The food was excellent but make sure you go to the new gym they built, because you're definitely not going to go for the healthy option of eating.",
            "Join the Living Learning Community for dorm life. You get to live on the same floor as your major and can ask for help from anyone on the floor. The dorms are extremely small, so find something like a portable shelf that you can have sit above your bed so you have some extra places to place things. Buy stilts to stack your bed because you're going to want to store things under it and I would recommend to buying separation boxes or kits to put your clothes in for the drawers so you can stay more organized and not get them mixed with your roommates. The elevators are slow and certain ones only go to different levels so make sure you read the signs in front of the elevators. You don't want to end up like me who roomed on the top floor in orientation and couldn't get to the room and got frustrated and ended up climbing the stairs.",
            "I honestly cannot tell you about their academics because I haven't taken any of the classes. I have heard that the chemistry classes are impossible there and it's recommended to take them at a community college.",
            "If you visit for orientation, bring something to entertain you. There is no cable or television, and the wii-fi is poor in the building. Bring a book or a laptop so you can read or play games. The toilets don't have much sucking power, I hope you don't mind flushing a few times and in the future, you might want to clean your toilet often if you are living in the dorm. The campus is small and easy to maneuver around, you definitely do not need a car but a bike might be helpful if you want to ride over to the UNT campus. TWU has convenience stores for you to buy what you need.",
            "I love the feel of the campus at Texas Woman's University. The architecture is lovely and it brings you back in time to the days of a school where only the elite would study. The dorms are small and slightly crowded and the elevators are terrifying and confusing at first but the options they have for living there are nice. When you first step on campus for orientation, you are immediately greeted with smiles and the energy and activities they have planned for you are fun."

If you get one of the ones with the meals and only some dining dollars you will regret it. You can only use those meals at the Underground and the majority of the time, that food sucks. When you get the University Meal Plan you get 1500 dollars that you can spend on anything at the university so its much more worth it., 67638=TWU is pretty cheap, even for out of state students.

They have several programs that would fit for anybody. Currently, I am a senior graduating in May and my past fours years at TWU have been great. They have great staff in all departments, very friendly and always willing to help., 694006=There are a few activities to join like right now I am in boot camp it 6:30 a.m.-7:30a.m. they have sports for boys and girls and wild out doors activity., 35790=Tuition does go up every year, but what college doesn't?

Students who do not find homecoming and football games important Commuter students: TWU is a great school for commuters who live in the area. Students with a family or Nontraditional students: This school is no stranger to nontraditional students. I had a woman in my class who was 55 and we are great friends today! We also have a daycare and a playground for children. However, I would not recommend the daycare because I have heard that they cost too much money and only watch your children for a small amount of time. I still say this school is great for students who have a family because our classes teach so much about family structure, and child development. Tips for prospective students Find friends that have your same goals in mind. Watch who your friends are because you do not want to have conflict in a small school this can make things uncomfortable and awkward when you run into someone you just got into argument with the previous day. Keep yourself busy by joining various organizations and communities around school. This makes you feel better about not going to parties and getting drunk every Friday night.
