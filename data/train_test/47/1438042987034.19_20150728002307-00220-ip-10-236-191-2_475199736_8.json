Alternatively, combustible fuel may be pre-mixed with combustion air and introduced into combustion chamber 18 through inlet plate 11. A plurality of combustible fuel inlets 17 may be provided in the side walls of combustion chamber 10. Combustible fuel inlets 17 preferably comprise high velocity tangential nozzles, whereby combustible fuel is injectable directly into combustion chamber 18 at a high velocity to provide good mixing of the combustible fuel with combustion air. Suitable types of combustible fuel include methane, propane, and other fuels that produce a transparent flame under high temperature conditions, and suitable combustible fuels are well known to the art. Suitable input pressures and velocities for combustion air and combustible fuel are known to the art and may be determined upon routine experimental investigation. A small amount of steam may be introduced into combustion chamber 18 along with the combustible fuel to insure transparent flame formation. Combustible fuel and combustion air are preferably injected into combustion chamber 18 in amounts sufficient to achieve a firing rate of about 1000 to about 5200 Btu/h-in2, and most preferably to achieve a firing rate of about 1500 to about 3000 Btu/h-in2.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made to the apparatus and process of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and that this invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown in the drawing and described in the specification. The difference in temperature between the calculated adiabatic combustion temperature and the measured combustion temperature without the top plate is due to heat losses from the combustion chamber. The experimental data presented above clearly shows that internal radiant recuperation provides significantly higher combustion temperatures in the combustion chamber, and may achieve super-adiabatic combustion temperatures. The combustion temperatures of the experimental system were intentionally limited by maintaining the excess oxygen stoichiometric ratio above about 1.3 and by providing inlet and outlet plates having a relatively low emissivity. It is reasonable to expect increased internal radiant recuperation at lower excess oxygen stoichiometric ratios due to higher adiabatic combustion temperatures.
