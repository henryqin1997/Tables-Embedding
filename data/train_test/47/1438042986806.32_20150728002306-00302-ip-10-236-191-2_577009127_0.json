They are alot like Boston in concert. They just kind of stand there and do their thing. Personally, that doesn't bore me....but if it bores you then why not just put in the cd's. The whole thing about \"live\" shows to me is to SEE the artists that you love the music of. If the music sounds like the record, that's a bonus. Can't you just be happy that you got to see a band you grew up with live? Don't you have any emotion for the people in these bands? Why does it have to sound like the original recordings? You have to remember, the bands we grew up with do not have the payroll they once had. They can't afford the best sound guys in the business anymore plus they are older and possibly slower. Chances are better than not that our bands will not sound like they once did in concert. Are you saying that Loverboy doesn't care? They purposely put on a bad show just to waste your money? You should save your money so you can buy",
