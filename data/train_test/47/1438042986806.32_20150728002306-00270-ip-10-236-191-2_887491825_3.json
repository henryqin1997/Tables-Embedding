    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor I don't care what anyone else says, the classes here are just as challenging as any state college. They can be frustrating at times, but not too much to keep you lost throughout the course material. I also haven't had one professor yet that I didn't understand or had a problem comprehending when listening to them in my classes. Tips for prospective students If you're ever lost just go to the nearest help desk (which can be located in every building) and they can direct you to the classroom that you're having a hard time finding. The professors are extremely helpful and friendly so don't be afraid to ask for help whenever you need it. I don't know how many times I've been saved thanks to my professors. In three sentences For a community college it is a very inviting and friendly place to go for fresh out of high school students. The professors are all very friendly and work well with the students in helping them succeed in their classes. The campus isn't too large or too small to be crammed or to get lost in and the classes are just diverse enough to get any students attention in what the college has to offer. Login to rate or flag",
