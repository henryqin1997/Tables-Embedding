This is advantageous in that it permits a nosepiece to be selected which will not mar or otherwise damage the particular type of material with which it is in contact, for example. The removable nosepiece also makes it possible to use different types of screwdriver bits or other work contacting elements and substantially facilitates the replacement of these elements., 34258=4.
