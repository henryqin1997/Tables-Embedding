It's nearer 3:2., 165626=Unfortunately chroma runs wild on the Oly XZ-1's sensor, especially on higher ISOs (1600/3200). Most people might not need it, but the combination of fast lense and high ISO is needed for stopping down fast movement (playing kids indoors)., 179951=You're welcome, Richard, and thanks for listening.. and you're right that LX5's 'oversized' multi-aspect ratio sensor confuses things a bit. It's worth to note though, that the active/effective sensor height gets smaller when using the 3:2 and 16:9 aspect ratios. The LX5 has the largest active sensor size/area when shooting 4:3 images (where the extra width isn't used)., 325802=Neat writeup and I agree 100% that this segment is particularly competitive. There certainly are enough different cameras to suit different tastes and styles of photography at different price points. Good for us, consumers. BTW I bought an LX3 more than 2 years ago and still enjoy using it, particularly for the bright, 24mm wide end of its Leica branded zoom. Panasonic is rumoured to be working on the LX5 successor to be released in 2012 and at the time I will look again at what the competition offers., 176081=The sensor sizes used in the article, and in DPR's specs, are not entirely accurate. The 7.89x5.81mm used for 1/1.63\" sensors, and the 7.49x5.52mm used for 1/1.7\" sensors, don't match with the 4:3 aspect ratio, and if comparing the actual FL and the equivalent FL on for example the Olympus XZ-1 (1/1.63\") and Nikon P7100 (1/1.7\"), then the crop factor of both cameras are app. 4,67x, meaning that the sensor sizes in practice are the same (app. 7.41x5.56mm on both cameras)., 354753=Yes, it's on the list for early 2012.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "A resolution of 10MP has been more or less standard for the high end of the compact camera market for a couple of years now, and two of the three cameras in the main part of this roundup (the Canon PowerShot G12 and Nikon Coolpix P7100) share the same 10MP CCD sensor. There are plenty of differences between them though, particularly in terms of their lenses and movie modes.\u00a0 Key Specifications Compared Samsung TL500 Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 Olympus XZ-1 If you head to page five of this article, you'll see a brief overview, including sample images and useful links, of the other three cameras in this class (all of which we've previously tested in full): Nikon Coolpix P7100 Fujifilm X10 Canon PowerShot G12 For the purposes of this roundup, I'm\u00a0restricting my coverage to those compact cameras which offer full manual control over exposure, are capable of shooting raw files, and have flash/accessory hotshoes. There are six cameras on the market which meet these criteria, and all six are covered, but the fullest treatment is reserved for those cameras which offer optical viewfinders (and arguably the ultimate in enthusiast-friendly ergonomics) in addition to their rear LCD screens: The Cameras We've tested all but two of the cameras in this market segment in detail (the studio and real-world samples you'll see from the Fujifilm X10 and Nikon Coolpix P7100 were shot especially for this roundup, ahead",
    "textAfterTable": "* At full resolution Why Shoot Raw? The addition of raw mode is one of the most obvious things that distinguishes cameras in the high-end, enthusiast, 'luxury' class of compact cameras from more mainstream consumer-oriented models. There are other features, too, which are traditionally the preserve of these higher-end products (like full manual control, a hotshoe, and fast, wide lenses) but raw mode is perhaps the most important. Some consumer-level compact cameras offer raw capture, but slow operational speed in this mode, and sometimes dubious image quality gains often make it much less useful than you might think (or hope). The benefits of shooting in raw mode, compared to JPEG, are many and various. Raw files contain more data, so you can make more extreme tonal adjustments to them before you start to see a penalty in image quality. You can adjust the white balance of images shot in raw mode easily, and save as many JPEG copies as you like without fear of degrading the original file.\u00a0 A classic example of a JPEG gone wrong - shot accidentally using the wrong white balance preset. As you can see from the 100% crop on the right, this image (shot with the Canon PowerShot G12) also exhibits noticeable CA",
