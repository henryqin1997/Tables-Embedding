    "textBeforeTable": "Stats Edit She has shown some taijutsu skill, being able to react fast enough to defend herself from Itachi Uchiha's attacks despite only recently breaking out of her own reflected genjutsu. In the anime, it was shown that she is even able to enter the subconsciousness of a person to see their true nature. She could use her hair to cover her entire body to mask her prescence, further supplementing the technique by travelling through objects, allowing for a better approach. She also seems to be very proficient at using f\u016binjutsu as seen when she used the Evil Sealing Method to seal Yakumo's kekkei genkai. Other Skills Edit While the full extent of Kurenai's abilities are predominantly unknown, her skill with genjutsu is so vast that it is said to rival even those of Itachi Uchiha.[2] Most of her techniques focus around flora; primarily using large trees to bind opponents as well as flower petals for various reasons. She is also able to simultaneously affect multiple opponents with her techniques, as seen during her fight with Kisame Hoshigaki and his",
    "textAfterTable": "Part I Edit Ch\u016bnin Exams Edit Kurenai and the other j\u014dnin stop Neji from attacking Hinata again. During the Ch\u016bnin Exams, Kurenai watched her pupils from the sidelines. After Shino's battle, she commented on how it suddenly became cold in the room, in reference to his rather merciless defeat of Zaku Abumi. During Kiba's fight with Naruto, she thought to herself that Naruto couldn't possibly beat Kiba, only to be surprised again and again as Naruto took everything Kiba threw at him and finally defeated her student. She bore Naruto no ill will after this and even acknowledged him as a strong opponent. During Hinata's fight with her cousin, Neji Hy\u016bga, she remembered the terrible relationship Hinata had with her father. She also noted the stark contrast between the current Hinata, who refused to give up, and the former Hinata, who would give up easily. When Neji was sent into a blind rage and tried to kill Hinata, Kurenai helped stop him along",
