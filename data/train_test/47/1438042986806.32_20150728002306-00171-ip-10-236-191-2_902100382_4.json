The annual Thanksgiving Dinner is a major one, where students come to the Dining Center in groups and are served by their professors. Tables get one whole turkey and unlimited amounts of mashed potatoes, stuffing, corn, bread, and other holiday treats. Also big is Sprinfest, our annual celebration before the last week of classes. The whole campus comes out to enjoy concerts, inflatables, and free give-aways.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Greek Life Greek life is big on campus. We have 11 fraternities and 5 sororities. The sororities do not have houses although the fraternities do, although many of the sisters live together anyway. You rush your sophomore year, to give you time to get to know the school before you make any decision to join or stay independent. The parties are open to everyone and it makes an impression on campus, although it is not exclusive. The Greeks and independents get along and help out with one another's activities really nicely. Its a good mix on campus. Clubs and Activities Gettysburg has a MASSIVE amount of clubs and activities going on at any time. A club fair is held at the beginning of every year so that everyone can see what is offered. We have an equestrian team, a fencing club, a rugby club, along with many intermurals and varsity sports. There are pre-med and pre-vet clubs, history clubs, science clubs, ROTC, dance ensembles, a cappella groups, musical ensembles, you name it, we've probably got it, and if we don't you can create one. Great for these types of students If you're prepared to work really, really, really hard, this is the place for you. There is an air of familiarity between the students and professors because they work well together",
