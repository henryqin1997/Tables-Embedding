We then find (for \u03bb=6300A) that Do should be 0.4 mm, leading to a maximum diameter of 0.6 mm at the edges. The laser and lenses must be located outside of the area, so that the distance to the focus after reflection from scanners and dihedral mirrors is about 1000 mm., 73750=The measurement technique described in connection with FIG. 10 provides digital measurements of each angle to one part in 2048 or 11 bits. Since the range of Ax and Ay is about 0.4 radians, the quantization error introduces an angular uncertainty of 0.4/2048 radians or about 0.2 milliradians, mr. Thus, random errors of about 0.01 inches are to be expected., 48362=Thus, the problem reduces to forming a 0.4 mm waist at a distance of 1000 mm. A single lens would suffice if the laser divergence were 0.4 milliradians, mr. The divergence is approximately 0.8 mr, so that a beam-expander is required. This is made as follows. A lens of focal length F1 brings the beam to a focus with waist diameter D1 as expressed in equation 9., 25711=This is a continuation of applicant's Ser. No. 336,461, filed on Dec. 31, 1981, now abandoned., 56333=Referring to FIG. 7, using the same reference numerals as FIGS. 3A, 3B and 3C for identical items, a small lens 16 collects the return light and focuses it onto the photodiode 17 connected between a negative voltage and ground. The photocurrent may be estimated as follows. It has been assumed that approximately 0.02 percent of the 0.5 mw laser power is returned to the detector. This is about 0.1 micro-watt. The photodetector 17 has a sensitivity of about 0.2 amps/watt at the laser wavelength, hence there will be about 0.02 microamps of signal current. At the output of the amplifier 34, the voltage signal-to-noise ratio is in excess of 100:1, although this is lowered somewhat by the fine-grained structure arising from the beaded retroreflective strips 13 and 15. Proper shielding and grounding techniques are required to avoid corrupting the signal with logic-circuit switching noise. In some cases, it may be desirable to place an interference filter in front of the photodetector to eliminate noise from ambient lighting., 49016=A second lens of focal length F then forms a magnified waist at the desired 1000 mm distance. The final waist location L and diameter D are given as expressed by equations 10, 11 and 12. ##EQU5##, 27882=A 1971 National Aeronautics and Space Agency Technical Note describes the use of two beams located at separate points on a single line and employs reflection from a special stylus, that has a cylindrical mirror so that the retroreflected beam is confined within the scan beam and thereby permitting the shaft angle of the scan beam mounting to be usable in determining the position of the indicator member., 49546=A simple design procedure is to make an initial choice of F, the focal length of the second lens. Replace D in equations 11 and 12 with the desired waist diameter Do and L with the 1000 mm focusing distance. After some manipulation, one finds the required intermediate waist diameter D1 to be as expressed in equation 13. ##EQU6##}",

The capabilities of the invention provide both high accuracy and greater flexibility than previously available. ##SPC1## ##SPC2## ##SPC3## Y=(S)(TAN (A1) TAN (A2))/(TAN (A1)+TAN (A2)) Equation 29 X=(S/2)((TAN (A1)-TAN (A2))/(TAN (A1)+TAN (A2)) Equation 28 A start pulse is easily obtained from the detector, as the mirror will reflect the laser light directly into the detector lens before scanning the surface. The stylus coordinates can then be obtained by a simple trigonometric calculation using the angle from each scanner and the known scanner separation distance S. Thus, if the angles measured by the scanners are A1 and A2, then the X and Y coordinates of the stylus are set forth in equations 28 and 29. Referring next to FIGS. 17A and 17B, the preferred optical system is provided. In the light of the principles set forth, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that two similar scanners 60A and 60B are mounted on a support 61 such as a bar, a definite distance apart. The left scanner 60A is shown in FIG. 17B wherein a source 10 provides a beam which is swept by",
