            "Party! Upperclassmen dorms have great parties, frat's and sports teams mostly but there are people who just throw them to throw them! Halloween is crazy, and after the Red Sox won the world series it was unbelievable. You can go to Red Sox, Bruins, and Patriots games for reduced ticket prices. There are shuttle buses that take you to Harvard Square and you can take the T from there to get anywhere in Boston! Party, Sports games, Bars/Clubs, Sightsee, and shop! Boston area offers it all!",
            "Well the dining hall is below average and you have to get creative. There are places for you to spend discretionary money on like a burrito place, Einsteins which is bagels, and a sandwich place too and a sub place. Falcon Market has lots of snacks.",
            "Freshmen have it rough but that is anywhere you go. Upperclassmen housing is awesome. No cars for freshmen but there is the shuttle and the T.",
            "The classes are tough but feasible. Mostly a business school. Freshman and sophmore year you'll take general business courses and your prerequisites and juniors/seniors take classes for their majors. Alot of opportunities for internships!!!",
            "Study hard throughout the semester rather than cramming for finals. Pace yourself.",
            "Excellent business connections. Classes that make you challenge yourself where you will learn material relevant to you in life. A place to make friends and have a good time."

    "textAfterTable": "What to do for fun During the week, Bentley offers a variety of intramurals and clubs that keep the students active. I suggest forming a team on your freshman dorm floor or joining something with a friend. The fitness center is also always open very early and closes around midnight which allows students plenty of opportunity to work out. On weekends, campus is usually up and about with music and students everywhere. Fraternities also have parties off campus which are a must for any freshman. Fraternity and Sorority life have been growing gradually over the past few years and offer another fun opportunity for students. Food and Dining The main dining hall on campus is Season's and it is known to get old after a couple weeks for upperclassmen like myself. They offer a variety of options in terms of sandwiches, pizza, and a salad bar. But after a while you get tired of the same thing. However, Bentley offers discretionary options that are included in your meal plan. All freshman must take the unlimited swipe plan which gives them about $350 in discretionary. This can be used at places such as Currito (basically Chipotle or Qdoba), Yella's (fresh sandwiches and pizza), and Einsteins (fresh baked bagels, coffee, and breakfast/lunch sandwiches). All of the discretionary options are much preferred over seasons for students but make sure you allocate your allowance wisely!",
