            "There is campus security (police officers) and security cameras on surveillance at all times, but the campus is small and everyone can pretty much see everything. I've never had, nor seen an issue with security.",
            "There are no sorority's at this particular school.",
            "As said before, there are a bunch of clubs you can join, all that basically pick and choose what they want the club to be and how it operates. Students are chosen as leaders and the group decides what kind of activities they want to get involved in and raise money for themselves.",
            "Great for students with a busy work/ life schedule. There are morning, afternoon or night options available.",
            "There are clubs for practically every program available, and you don't have to join a club that is only relevant to your program. For example, if you are studying Computer Graphics you can still join the Animal Health Club and participate in their activities such as dog washes, trips to the zoo for behind the scenes tours, and volunteering with club mates at local shelters.",
            "With this being a commuter school there is no dining area or cafeteria, but there are a lot of fast food places near by. And, they do have the occasional student appreciation day and events where there is a cookout and free food provided.",
            "There is no dorm life at this school in particular. It is a commuter school.",
            "With the one course a month style of the programs here that leaves little time for a lot of information to cover. So, it is important to make sure you personally are keeping up with all the information and are speaking up when you don't understand.",
            "Always get to campus early, not only for parking but for library access to print off the millions of power points you'll encounter and to give yourself a head start with the course material. Even if you don't understand it at the time, go over the material that will be discussed in class the following day, then review it again after class. It will really help the information stick.",
            "Courses become fast-paced once in your core classes, which can be good or bad depending on the individual student. There are a great deal of hands-on opportunities that make it a really great experience. With this type of one course a month school it is important to be self-reliant and make sure to manage your time to get everything from the program."

I also, was nervous because I work a part time job, and attend school in the evening. So, I didn't think I could handle that. But, the staff at Brown Mackie Made me very comfortable, and helped me overcome this nervousness.

If you don't pass your classes here, with all of the tutoring available, then this means you are not applying yourself., 82572=I have only enrolled. Will not start until July 2.
