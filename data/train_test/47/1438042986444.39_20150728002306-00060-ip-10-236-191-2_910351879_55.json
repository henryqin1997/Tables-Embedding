For example, Charro Days is a very fun and exciting festival we celebrate at the end of February each year. Students are actually out of school for a couple of days due to this holiday. We have parades, small concerts, carnivals, and many more stuff. This area is highly influenced by the Mexican culture since we are only five minutes away from Mexico., 134920=Yes, students would be curious as to how and why these practices take place. Also, we get to have three mini carnivals, two circuses, and quite a few parades in town. Parades are around mid February and the other parade in December., 272323=The University of Texas at Brownsville, has a very important place in my life, it means the opportunity for a better tomorrow. Nowadays,it is extremely important to have a college degree or technical certification, in order to find a well paid job. I would describe my life in two phases, before and after UTB, my life is better unfortunatelly, I didn't had the money to attend last semester Spring 2013, but hopefully I can attend this Fall 2013., 338562=There are tons of activites and charity organizations on campus! We have outdoor movie nights with free munchies, parties at the doorm pool, and something us ocelots like to call Orange Crush. It is a party the first week of school with games, free food, music, and many other things. Not to mention, we have the 2013 NAIA Volleyball Champions!, 203430=I personally don't live at the dorms, but they used to be an amazing apartment complex that I used to constantly be at, and it was built in 2011., 399742=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
