It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the scope of the invention, which is set forth in the following claims, to the precise form or forms described. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the teaching above. The exemplary embodiments were chosen to explain the principles of the invention with its practical applications and to thereby enable others skilled in the art to make and use the invention in various other embodiments and with various modifications. Some embodiments of the present invention may provide a management interface for requesting privileged node status. For example, a system administrator may direct packets to a network address and port monitored by a server program running on the packet processor. The server program may implement common network protocols such as HTTP or TELNET or it may implement a customized protocol. In addition, the server program may provide a secure means of communicating with devices over the network. For example, the server program may use one or more encryption algorithms to encode and decode packets representing requests for authentication. In this way, the authentication application may recognize authorized users and securely grant or remove privileged node status through the exchange of secure packets. The packet processor may request credentials from the sender of the",
