Parent and Child Aquatics is an introduction to the water for young children and a water safety course for parents. Parents must be in the water with the child as it helps to develop swimming readiness by teaching children how to have fun in the water. The goals ofParent and Child Aquatics are to provide experiences and activities for parents and children to learn how to enter and exit the water in a safe manner, feel comfortable in the water, submerge, explore buoyancy in a front and back position, change body position in the water, and learn about choosing and using life jackets. Non-toilet trained children must wear a swim diaper. 106010\u00a0-\u00a0Parent and Child Aquatics Showing: 1\u00a0to\u00a0250 Total Results: 250 Activity Search Results Enroll Now Enroll Now Display Option: Listing Detail Summary Availability Option: All Classes Only Available Classes Available Nonresident Classes Keyword search Options: Match At Least One Word Match All",
