            "Well, I attend school in the comfort of my home. I was in a class with a lady who had a daughter who attended the main campus in San Diego and she never informed us if her daughter was sexually assaulted, robbed, or kidnapped, so I am assuming this branch of National University is a peaceful and serene environment. Also, it is quite safe to walk on campus at night.",
            "I am not sure they have fraternities and sororities, but if it is a public institution they might have students who make up fraternities such as Kappa Alpha Psi and Omega Psi Phi.",
            "I am an English major, so National University has a social organization for aspiring English teachers and writers.",
            "National University is great for students who are self-motivated and possess an unwavering desire to obtain a substantial amount of knowledge. Also, it is suitable for individuals who are introverted, but find pleasure communicating with others through electronic messages and posting their thoughts and opinions in classroom discussions which are also called discussion boards.",
            "Well, I have never been on the campus of National University's main campus. Sadly, I only attend its interactive campus.",
            "National University is an affordable academic institution. The courses are set at a reasonable price and their financial aid department is committed to helping its students fund their education.",
            "I love to read and write which coincides with one another. Also, I love to write poetry, listen to soulful music, spend my time on Facebook and other social networks, and go shopping.",
            "Although I miss dining in on campus during my undergraduate years, I love the fact that I can eat my mother's delicious home cooking and go out for Chinese food sporadically.",
            "National University is an online school, so a student who attends this academic institution would probably live with their parents are live on their own.",
            "All of my classes are in the length of four weeks, so I would advise anyone to study hard and strive to work up to their full potential. These courses can be challenging, yet rewarding at the same time.",
            "I would advise anyone who is desiring to attend this school to develop a strong relationship with your classmates and professors through communicating with them on a regular basis. Also, I would encourage you to do your best in your courses, so that you can take more than one class at a time. National University is an online school and if you don't have a high grade point average you can only take one class at a time which will cause you to be in school longer than students who attend a public four year institution.",
            "I am currently attending National University in hopes of obtaining a Master's of Arts in English. I am so elated that I selected this academic institution to pursue a higher education. Because I am a proud student at National University, I am able to learn the information and skills I need to become an extraordinary and unforgettable English professor at a Historically Black College or University."

    "textAfterTable": "i found a great beginning to my education at national university with my admissions counselor. he was able to refer me to my financial counselor and plan my academic schedule completely. In three sentences national university has a comprehensive administration set up that makes registration and educational planning easier than i've seen at any other institution. i was able to become enrolled and begin my education path easily after a 10 year break, with classes that weren't over my head and instructors that answered all my questions and were very approachable. i would definitely recommend national university to any of my friends or family for furthering their education.
