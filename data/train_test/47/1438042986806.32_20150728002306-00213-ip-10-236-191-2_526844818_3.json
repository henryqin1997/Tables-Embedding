The addition was part of the schedule realignment, replacing the fall race in Atlanta with a night race at Chicagoland., 230540=Starr won the 2004 Camping World 200 presented by Honda Power Equipment leading just the final lap. Had it been 2005 or later, the Texan never would have gotten the chance. Starr won on a fourth green-white-checker restart \u2014 the final time a NASCAR national series used multiple green-white-checker finishes. \"In typical truck series fashion, the race ended with a bang,\" said Starr, recalling the series of accidents that set up his pass of Chad Chaffin. \"So much of a bang that it resulted in a rule change.\" Ironically, the 174th lap of the race is the only lap Starr has led in eight Gateway starts., 237738=This week marks the third time in the last seven races Benson has defended a 2007 victory. He's batting .500, winning at The Milwaukee Mile and finishing fourth on Aug. 20 at Bristol Motor Speedway., 246828=NASCAR Raybestos Rookie of the Year Standings After 16 Races of the 2008 Season: 1. Colin Braun, 157 2. Donny Lia, 144 3. Justin Marks, 129 4. Brian Scott, 120 5. Marc Mitchell, 100 6. Scott Speed, 80 7. Andy Lally, 62 8. Phillip McGilton, 38, 232835=Darnell was among the fortunate, having competed previously at the track in another series. \"I felt pretty relaxed my first go-round in a truck,\"said Darnell, who was closing in on a possible top-five finish in 2006 before an accident ended his race. \"The track will definitely take you by surprise if you don't do your homework.\", 239507=Kyle Busch hadn\ufffdt been in the #51 Miccosukee/NOS Energy Drink Toyota since O\ufffdReilly Raceway Park at Indianapolis back in July but that didn\ufffdt seem to matter Aug. 20 at Bristol Motor Speedway., 241518=The series isn\ufffdt completely new to the area. The now defunct Chicago Motor Speedway hosted the trucks in 2000 and 2001. Joe Ruttman captured the checkered flag the first year and the following season Scott Riggs made the trip to Victory Lane. In an area where the number of NASCAR fans continues to grow each season, it\ufffds an addition to the schedule everyone positively welcomes. \ufffdGetting back to Chicago is a great plus for the series,\ufffd said series director Wayne Auton. \ufffdIt\ufffds just one more avenue for fans to become NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series fans.\ufffd\ufffdThe layout of the mile-and-a-half track is like no other that we currently race at,\ufffd Auton said. \ufffdAnd under the lights, it will all make for an exciting race.\ufffd}",
