    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38776=Aeromotive's Phantom in-tank fuel pump conversion uses its Stealth 340 turbine-style fuel pump. It is an excellent way to convert a muscle-car fuel tank to either carbureted or high-pressure EFI applications. This kit creates its own in-tank reservoir, combining the black rubber base with the yellow fuel cell foam. This kit can be retrofitted to virtually any muscle car. We performed a complete how-to in the Oct. '13 issue (\"The Phantom Knows\")., 34694=We modified this gasoline 750-cfm Holley with a set of E85-calibrated metering blocks from Quick Fuel and used this carb on the Blue Collar 454 dyno test, where the budget Rat made 589 hp (Feb '13). The conversion is easy if you have experience with rebuilding Holley carbs. It's also a good idea to convert to larger 0.130-inch-diameter needle and seat to accommodate E85's greater fuel-flow requirements., 35756=Holley just introduced these new E85 calibrated HP carburetors at the end of 2013. The sizes range from 600\u2013950 cfm and offer several new features including 20 percent larger bowl capacity, 0.130-inch needle and seat assemblies, 50cc accelerator pumps, and all-aluminum construction that is nearly 40 percent lighter., 32774=Our focus will be on E85 carburetors for this story, although there is also plenty of potential on the fuel-injection side of things. It is possible to convert a standard Holley carburetor over to E85, and Quick Fuel offers an affordable kit that replaces the metering blocks, accelerator-pump squirters, and air bleeds on a typical 4150-style Holley carburetor to recalibrate it to flow the roughly 25\u201330 percent more fuel required. Or if you'd rather not bother, Holley and Quick Fuel both offer new E85-calibrated carburetors. Holley's new alcohol-ready HP carbs come in a new black finish that helps prevent corrosion. Just like Holley's HP series for gasoline, these carburetors are ready to run right out of the box. As far as tuning is concerned, we've found that E85 engines are not nearly as sensitive as gasoline when it comes to wide-open throttle (WOT) air/fuel ratios. Alcohol engines (both ethanol and methanol) will deliver excellent power at much richer ratios without suffering a power loss. The general rule of thumb for E85 engines is to shoot for a range between 7.0:1 and 8.5:1 air/fuel ratio. Most aftermarket air/fuel ratio gauges can be calibrated to display these numbers.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Parts List With E85's greater demand for fuel volume, the pressure regulator, fittings, and even the fuel lines will need to be evaluated to meet the volume required. Most fuel-pressure regulators utilize a rubber diaphragm that's exposed to the fuel, and budget regulators are likely to use a rubber that's incompatible with alcohol fuels. Let's hit the big problem square on. Aeromotive tells us its testing reveals that commutator wear accelerates because of E85's reduced lubricity. As parts wear, material ends up trapped in the downstream fuel filter, meaning the filter(s) must be serviced more frequently than is typical for gasoline filters. Plus, Powell says it's imperative that any paper fuel filter be replaced with stainless filters when using E85. Aeromotive's testing has shown that alcohol breaks down the glue used to adhere the paper to the metal end caps, which both reduces the filter's efficiency and causes big problems downstream when this effluvia ends up in the carburetor or fuel injectors. The typical E85 filter recommendation is to use a 100-micron stainless filter before the pump followed by a 40-micron stainless filter on the outlet side. Aeromotive and Holley both recommend using a coarse filter before the fuel pump to reduce inlet restrictions, which improves pump efficiency. Filter size is also important: a larger filter allows longer service intervals due to its larger surface area. Never use those small, disc-type fuel filters because they clog easily and will then overwork the pump",
    "textAfterTable": "7/12 The standard vertical design (left) pushes fuel through the bottom pump portion, separating the pump's electrics from the fuel. Modern horizontal versions (right) push fuel directly through the spinning pump, keeping it cool. Both of these Holley versions are E85 compatible. 8/12 This is a large- surface-area, 40-micron stainless steel filter that Aeromotive recommends using downstream of the pump for E85-fueled engines. Paper elements should not be used. Also note that budget filters do not use Viton rubber O-rings. Regulators should also be rated for use with E85. 9/12 TechAFX offers this PTFE hose in -6, -8, and -10 sizes. The black, non-conductive inner liner is impervious to any fuel you want to use. This hose does require specific TechAFX fittings that use a special sealing ferrule. 10/12 Most high-quality filters and pumps use straight-thread",
