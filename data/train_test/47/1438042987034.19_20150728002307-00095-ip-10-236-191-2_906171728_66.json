            "The library is awesome. In addition they have a nice gym that all students have access to. School is not far from the downtown area which is also a nice perk.",
            "They have so many meal options. Multiple cafeterias! The food is made on the spot when you ask for it, and always fresh. Great coffee shops too.",
            "I only had a dorm for awhile but they are very nice. The Dorms are pretty spacious. And you share bathrooms but only with like 2 people.",
            "You get your money's worth. Many of the teachers there have been teaching for years and years! So they are good at what they do and have excellent classes they have worked on and constantly improved for years and years.",
            "A strong purpose statement is good for these guys. Also I would suggest taking basic classes at a community college first, because this school is expensive!",
            "I went to this school for their psychology program and I feel that was an excellent decision. The small classes made the transition from community college to this school really awesome. The teachers care very much about their students here."

They encourage students to meet with them as much as possible and because professors are required to have office hours they can't say no if you ask to meet with them. They make time to help. This also means there are some difficult times ahead, I'm not going to sugar-coat the work you have to complete. As long as you pay attention and ask for help when you need it you'll do very well. And allow me to just add that in 2010, every single student who applied for Med School after attending St. Edward's got in. 100% of those that applied. They will make sure you know you're stuff before you leave their school with a BA., 98314=It's a beautiful campus with wonderful professors. However, it has terrible management if tuition keeps going up $1000 every year and they force us to pay for food we don't want (you have to pay the meal plan or you can't register). At least the professors work hard to get us the grants we need to improve and expand our programs., 331745=Visit the campus and talk to current students there to see if it really is the best option for you. They have a Scholar Weekend in February or March where you can stay in the dorms and really experience campus life. It's a great way to meet prospective students and see what life on campus is like., 384188=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 312879=Some dorms (east, Moody) are really run down. buy the new ones, Dujarie, BM, and Johnson are nice. Get to know your RA's in case you get locked out of your room at 2:00 am!!!, 325768=There are three cafeterias: The Huddle (Tex-med and BBQ), Hunt Hall Cafe (cafeteria, coffee shop, convenience store), and South Congress Market (Cafeteria). There are also two Jo's coffee shops on campus, and another coffee shop may be added to the new library that will open in fall 2013. Students may tire of the menu after living on campus, but there are many off campus food options close by, which is why I give four stars., 64962=St. Edward's is a private institution so... It can get pricey. Tuition has increased for the Fall 2012 school year so you may have to pull out loans just to attend. It costs more to come here than say, attending UT Austin (a public university) but you may benefit by having smaller classes and greater use of campus resources., 95847=They don't know how to make business, so they force you to buy a meal plan regardless of whether you live on campus or not. And even though you have to pay out of your own pocket, if you have left over money they will not reimburse you, they'll just keep it (freshmen end up with about $1000 leftover). At first you think, oh so much to choose from!, and then you realize it's basically the same thing every day.}",

St. Edward's keeps an Austin wierdness about it, so if you do not fit in at the moment, you can probably fit in here just by being different. St. Edward's is also very big on giving back, so if you love to volunteer or help others they offer many opportunities. St. Edward's is very welcoming to any student, and if you are curious if you would fit in just come and see it! They allow you to stay the night with a student, and love to give tours! Tips for prospective students Once you get here, get involved! Do not be intimidated; everyone truly wants you to get involved. When you have classes, do not be afraid to talk/ask your professor anything. Get out of your shell - meet others. Keep up with your grades... even though Austin offers a lot of freedom and opportunity, especially with",
