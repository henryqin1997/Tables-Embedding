            "There are emergency poles almost every forty feet on campus. These poles have a button on them that you can press that alerts an officer on campus. I've never used it, but they say an officer will be there within 5 minutes, no matter where you are on campus.",
            "There are plenty of sororities and fraternities to choose from. They seem like they always have events going on. They have some very intricate and unique sorority and fraternity houses alike.",
            "There are literally hundreds of clubs on campus. If you need to meet some new people, this is the way to do it. There is even a Quittich club where the member literally play the game out on a soccer field on campus. Love it!",
            "This college is great if you like good music, open-minded people, chickens, or greek life.",
            "Since it is the University of Arkansas, our mascot is the razorback pig. There is a fountain of a razorback drooling right near the admissions office. Our oldest building, also our most beautiful, is Old Main. We sing to her in our Alma Mater.",
            "The tuition price is not too steep (around $10,000 a year), and it is a very renowned school for what it is. The business school is ranked in the top 10 of the nation. There is a huge gym and elaborate bus system included in tuition. Those are definitely plusses!",
            "Dickson Street is like our downtown in Fayetteville. It is where all the bars and clubs are. Concerts are happening almost every night around town. George's is the center for fantastic music. Fayetteville is a bicycle friendly community, so that's always fun.",
            "The cafeterias are mediocre, like cafeterias in general. The selection of restaurants is really diverse, and you can find it very easily around campus.",
            "There are some older dorms that can be pretty funky and cramped. There are also really nice dorms, but they cost a tad more. There's really no in-between.",
            "I don't have to study to hard, and I am a B average student.",
            "Bring you walking shoes, because Fayetteville is very hilly and quite large. Also, don't forget to smile :)",
            "This university has a diverse, smart, and eclectic student body. The classes never fail to impress me, and neither does the sheer beauty of the campus."

However, I do not like the fact that the U of A is raising tuition fall 2011 by 7%. Haven't they heard about the great recession? It is already difficult to pay for college, now it is even harder., 1010554=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 553336=Taking a class in Old Main is a must, but be careful not to step on the Class of 1900 on your way in, it's bad luck. And Spoofer's stone has a rather romantic history of lovers and proposals., 949718=The food is okay. Overall, nothing to get excited about but decent. I will say, however, that Chartwells does a terrible job making dining options available to students. Dining halls close at 7:30 PM on weekdays and 7 PM on weekends (including Fridays). While meal trade/alternative dining options remain open later into the evenings, almost all are fast food. A healthy diet and the late-nights typical of college simply don't coexist at this university., 374897=I will attend the University of Arkansas in the fall of 2012. The application process is so simple and there are always people you can contact that are ready and willing to help you. The only downfall is the price., 41454=Eating at the dining halls on campus can get pretty old after a while, but when you go home and realize how convenient it is to have your food made and ready to go at all times, you may reconsider. There are three dining halls on campus and various other restaurants that you can go to and even do meals trades for. The meal trades are great because they stay open until 11:00 and it gives you a way to switch things up and not go to a dining hall every single night. Overall, I do think the dining halls have pretty good quality food. I have eaten on other college campuses and I have to say that the U of A is probably the best in comparison. Lots of options for anyone, including vegetarians, those with food allergies, etc. You can even special request certain things from the chefs and they will make them for you (usually vegetarian). The restaurants on campus include Quiznos, Starbucks, Burger King, Chik-fil-a, Sub Generation, the Wok, a burrito bar, and a pasta place. Overall, good food but definitely not a bang for your buck. Meal plans are great, but pretty pricey!, 123599=part of the walkway in front of the old main building is supposedly haunted. here at the university of arkansas, the names of students and the years in which they graduated are literally etched into the campus sidewalks. apparently, all the students who graduated in 1842 died soon after leaving college. for this reason, it is considered bad luck to walk over the part of the sidewalk where their names are inscribed., 100521=The University of Arkansas has great teachers that are interested in your education. The class sizes are relatively small, especially in the honors college. My largest freshman lecture class had 350 students as opposed to over 1000. The teachers have great office hours and are flexible. There is a very broad range of degrees and topics to be studied., 5220=My tip for prospective students would be to start everything early. I recommend applying for the University of Arkansas in September. It's not hard, and the admission staff is there to help every step of the way. Also, take advantage of the scholarship opportunities! The priority deadline for scholarship applications is early November. Making this deadline will give you the best chance at receiving one. When one is a junior and senior in high school, one needs to participate in as many things as possible. Involvement looks great on scholarship applications. When one actually begins the freshman semester, I strongly recommend getting involved in every opportunity that comes one's way. This is a great way to meet new people and learn new things. Most of all, enjoy you time at the University of Arkansas. It truly is a great environment., 859167=The top of the line greek life, for example, 1600 girls rushed this past fall and boys rush is almost exactly the same. Top of the line parties...did I mention Juicy J came last year... 10 sororities and 10 fraternities., 826353=We call the HOGS all the time! All the people that graduate from here get their names engraved in the sidewalk, it's super inspirational to get to walk to class on the names of those that came before you, and you get to look forward to seeing your name engraved there one day too! Just be sure not to step on the class of 1900 as a freshman, there's a superstition that then you won't graduate!, 183440=There is this place called Old Main and right in from of Old Main is a sidewalk with the first graduation class on it an goes on and on until the current year. A legend says if you step on the year 1914 you will die in four years. No one steps on that year!}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot I knew college was going to be hard, and I was afraid I wouldn't learn very much because of this. I was terrified of being left behind in my classes. In reality, this is not how the University of Arkansas conducts their education. The professors here are extremely skilled in teaching students. They make difficult material well understood for students like me. Also, the university has tons of tutoring places at all times during the semester. All of the tutors are extremely knowledgeable and courteous. I don't feel nervous to get help from anyone. Gregson Hall has tutoring for almost every subject. This is very convenient for me because it is right across the road. There is a quality writing center and math labs for tutoring and test taking. All of these places are wonderfully staffed and comfortable. I actually surprise myself when I think about how much I am learning at the University of Arkansas.
