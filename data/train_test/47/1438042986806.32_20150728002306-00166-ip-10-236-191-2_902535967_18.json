    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students SPU has one of the most successful nursing programs in the nation, so if you're thinking about nursing this is a great school. We also have a popular business school and a fantastic English program. (English students will have great internship opportunities at SPU!) If you don't mind rain, it's a great place for you; if you like getting involved in community service and charity, there are tons of opportunities for that at SPU as well. And if you like books or music, Seattle has a great artsy scene that you'll really enjoy. Tips for prospective students Apply for as many scholarships as you can--it will pay off. Also make sure you apply for University Scholars if you are any good at writing, or if you're just interested in getting better at writing. You'll do a lot of essays but it's worth it to have all the school's best professors inviting you to their office whenever you want help! Apply for housing as soon as possible, and try to get into Ashton or Hill (they are commonly known as the friendliest and best halls). And make sure to schedule an entrance interview; it's not required, but it really helps the admissions office get to know you and helps you get to know the school. Bang for the buck",
