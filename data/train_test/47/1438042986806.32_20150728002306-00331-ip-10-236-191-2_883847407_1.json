    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23465=5/31/12 - The Baltimore Orioles have signed outfielder Adam Jones to a six- year contract extention. The contract is worth $85.5 million in total and includes a no-trade clause that will keep Jones in Baltimore through 2018. Jones is having a career year batting .314 with 16 home runs and a .983 OPS. Jones' offensive numbers have improved every year he has been in Baltimore and is continuing that streak this season. Jones has been a big reason for the Orioles sitting in first place in the AL East. An All-Star in 2009, Jones is making a case to return to the Mid-Summer Classic., 26514=After starting off the 2012 season with an unlikely 3-0 record, the Baltimore Orioles were swept by the New York Yankees this week to bring their record to an even 3-3. After a strong start on opening day, young Jake Arrieta struggled against the Yankees, giving up 4 runs through 6 and 2/3 innings. Overall, however, his 1-0 record, 9 strikeouts and 2.63 ERA lead the young pitching staff. Offensively, the team has been led by catcher Matt Wieters, who after failing to live up to the hype last season, has begun his campaign with a .364 batting average, 2 home runs and 3 RBI's. The team will face off against the Toronto Blue Jays this weekend., 14295=10/14/14: The Orioles have been a strong team all season, but really came around in the second half to win the AL East walking away. After dispatching the Detroit Tigers in the ALDS, the Orioles are only four wins away from getting to the World Series. They face an uphill climb, though, as the Kansas City Royals took the first two games of the series in Baltimore. Game 3 of the series was scheduled for Monday night, but was postponed due to rain. Games 3, 4, and 5 are scheduled to be in Kansas City, but a couple of wins will bring the series back to Baltimore. Game 6 would be Friday, October 17 and Game 7 would be Saturday October 18., 28414=Baltimore Orioles tickets ensure that fans see the Orioles playing top contenders throughout the entire MLB season. The Orioles have their work cut out for them in an always-tough American League East. With matchups with great teams like the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and non-divisional meetings with the Texas Rangers and Minnesota Twins throughout the season, the Orioles will have plenty of opportunity to test themselves against top talent in 2011. Be a part of this great tradition and don't miss the action!, 11113=2/5/15: The Orioles signed pitcher Mark Hendricksonto a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training last week, which on its own is not a very interesting item. But Hendrickson himself is a fascinating subject. He is now 40 years old and likely to hear his teammates call him 'grandpa', and he actually is a grandfather. He also stands 6\"9' and uses a sidearm delivery. He has not pitched in the majors since 2011 and did not even start his professional career in baseball. He played in the NBA from 1996-2000. So while there may not be much of a chance of him making the team, he will give broadcasters and scribes something to talk about., 16224=Miguel Gonzalez out dueled Freddy Garcia and helped lead the Baltimore Orioles to a 5-4 victory over the New York Yankees on Monday at Yankee Stadium. Gonzalez pitched 6.2 innings, allowing four earned runs on six hits and zero walks. He also added 8 strikeouts over the course of 111 pitches to earn his third victory of the season. Offensively, Wilson Betemit blasted his 12th home run of the season in the third off Garcia, while Nick Markakis, JJ Hardy and Omar Quintanilla all also drove in runs in the wining effort. Overall, the team managed 13 hits off Yankees pitching, but were just 1-5 with runners in scoring position., 20523=Like the Nationals, their NL counterparts who play just a few miles down I-95, the Baltimore Orioles are also in first place in their division heading into June, with a 29-22 record. Despite a hot start to the 2011 season, the Orioles soon fizzled out and fell back to the pack. However, that crash has yet to happen so far, two months into the 2012 season. The Orioles have kept pace with the Tampa Bay Rays and have managed to stay a few games ahead of the New York Yankees thanks to great pitching from Jason Hammel who is 6-2 with a 3.04 ERA and Adam Jones who leads the team with a .314 average, 16 home runs and 34 RBI. The AL East-leading Baltimore Orioles have signed left-handed pitcher Jamie Moyer to a minor league contract. Moyer, 49, was released last week by the Colorado Rockies a month after becoming the oldest starting pitcher in major league history to win a game. Moyer posted a 2-5 record and a 5.70 ERA with Colorado. Moyer has been sent to AAA Norfolk, but the Orioles hope he can add depth to a major league rotation behind Jason Hammel and Wei-Yin Chen. Moyer sat out the entire 2011 season recovering from Tommy John surgery. Moyer previously pitched for the Orioles from 1993-95. The 32-25 Baltimore Orioles took two out of three games from the division-rival Boston Red Sox this week and moved back into a first-place tie with the Tampa Bay Rays in the AL East. Their 7-0 loss to the Red Sox on Thursday night prevented them from sweeping the Sox and also snapped their seven-game winning streak in Boston. The Orioles, who are tied for first despite having a -4 run differential on the season thus far, will open a three-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday night at home. They will send Jake Arrieta to the mound against Joe Blanton and the reeling Phillies. While the Yankees and Rays have been swapping positions at the top of the AL East, the Baltimore Orioles have been quietly stalking and waiting for their chance to pounce into the division lead. With a five-game winning streak of their own, including this week's sweep of the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Orioles find themselves at 37-26 and only a half game behind the division-leading Yankees. The Orioles will start a three-game interleague set against the reeling Atlanta Braves on Friday night at Turner Field, with Brian Matusz going up against the Braves' Tommy Hanson. The Baltimore Orioles are chasing the New York Yankees, only 2.5 games behind the division leaders, but they didn't gain any ground this week as they were swept by the New York Mets. The Orioles failed to score a single run in the series until the 8th inning of the third game on Wednesday night. They then pulled to within one run, at 4-3, and loaded the bases in the 9th inning but failed to push any more runs across the plate. The 39-30 Orioles will head into a weekend series with their National League neighbors, the Washington Nationals., 19880=Like the Nationals, their NL counterparts who play just a few miles down I-95, the Baltimore Orioles are also in first place in their division heading into June, with a 29-22 record. Despite a hot start to the 2011 season, the Orioles soon fizzled out and fell back to the pack. However, that crash has yet to happen so far, two months into the 2012 season. The Orioles have kept pace with the Tampa Bay Rays and have managed to stay a few games ahead of the New York Yankees thanks to great pitching from Jason Hammel who is 6-2 with a 3.04 ERA and Adam Jones who leads the team with a .314 average, 16 home runs and 34 RBI., 11791=1/28/15: The Baltimore Orioles have executive Dan Duquette under contract. The Toronto Blue Jays wanted him. That creates some friction. After trying to get the Orioles to bend on their employee, it seems that negotiations have broken off. Baltimore, reportedly, asked for 2014 draft pick Jeff Hoffman and two other prospects. Toronto was not willing to pay that price, so Duquette will not be the next CEO of the Blue Jays. Of course, many negotiations have been said to stall, when, in reality, there are those working behind the scenes to make it happen. So let's just call this a pause for right now., 10410=2/18/15: It is one thing to get a player to a team by luring him with money. It is entirely different when the player wants to be with the club. It can be a hard sell for a smaller market team to entice top tier players. The Orioles should feel fortunate with shortstop J.J. Hardy. He is a player who wants to be in Baltimore and was able to reach a four year extension back in October. That kept him off the open market and away from potential suitors like the New York Yankees or Los Angeles Dodgers. Overall, the Orioles did not do too much this offseason, but they really did not have to. The rest of the AL East will improve this season, but Baltimore should still be competitive., 19282=The AL East-leading Baltimore Orioles have signed left-handed pitcher Jamie Moyer to a minor league contract. Moyer, 49, was released last week by the Colorado Rockies a month after becoming the oldest starting pitcher in major league history to win a game. Moyer posted a 2-5 record and a 5.70 ERA with Colorado. Moyer has been sent to AAA Norfolk, but the Orioles hope he can add depth to a major league rotation behind Jason Hammel and Wei-Yin Chen. Moyer sat out the entire 2011 season recovering from Tommy John surgery. Moyer previously pitched for the Orioles from 1993-95., 27845=It's been tough sledding for the Baltimore Orioles in recent years, but the team looks to take big steps forward in the AL East in 2011. Last season didn't begin the way the Orioles planned, but encouragement and hope came with the hiring of Buck Showalter, who managed the club to a 34-23 finish. The club will look for marked improvements from young guns Matt Wieters and Adam Jones in 2011 but solid contributions need to be made throughout the team for it to win games next season., 13043=1/7/15: Give the Orioles credit for taking advantage of the situation last season. With both the Yankees and Red Sox having down years, Baltimore ran away with the AL East, though were eliminated in the playoffs before reaching the World Series. Repeating as the AL East champs will be much harder for Baltimore than winning it in 2014. On paper, the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays all look much better than in the past season, so the competition is back in the division. The Orioles also let Nick Markakis leave for the Atlanta Braves via free agency, though that may be a good move considering the money that was involved., 24066=5/25/12 The Baltimore Orioles have withstood quite a few tests early on in this young 2012 season and still sit atop the AL East with a 28-17 record as we inch closer to June. Led by Adam Jones with a .311 batting average, 11 home runs and 29 RBI, the Orioles have stood tough and battled against the likes of the Yankees, Rays, and Red Sox to claim their top spot in the division, but the question is whether or not they can maintain this solid play throughout the summer. The Orioles are winners of 6 of their last 10 and will head into this weekend with a three-game set against the Kansas City Royals., 27240=The Orioles are most remembered for the teams they put on the field on the late 1960s and early 1970s. These teams included Hall-of-Famers Brooks Robinson, Frank Robinson, and Jim Palmer and won four pennants and two World Series titles. Nowadays, the Orioles are most known for their stadium, Camden Yards, which draws fans from all over. Camden Yards, which opened in 1992, started a trend of new stadiums. A trip to Camden Yards is a must for a true baseball fan so check out Baltimore Orioles tickets today., 29245=While the 2014 National League Championship Series is being regarded as somewhat villainous - the Giants and Cardinals now have a combined seven LCS appearances in the last five seasons - the latest installment of the ALCS has two perpetual underdogs guaranteed to break one of the two longest World Series droughts in American League\u2026, 13709=10/22/14: The Baltimore Orioles became the toast of the American League and trendy pick to win the World Series. They blew out the rest of the AL East, which (of course) includes the Yankees, Red Sox and Rays. They easily took down the Detroit Tigers in the ALDS - barely letting the Tigers into any game. But they were swept by the upstart Kansas City Royals in the American League Championship Series (or the semi-finals for lay people). It is unfortunate for the team and the fans, but they can take heart in a great season and should be contending again come 2015., 25889=The Baltimore Orioles have continued their hot start to the 2012 MLB season and currently sit atop the American League East, tied with the Tampa Bay Rays for the division lead. With the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays both just a game out, the team will have to continue to push if they want to hold onto that top spot. Staff ace Jason Hammel leads the squad with a microscopic 1.73 ERA through four starts and Adam Jones has been pacing the offense with a .309 batting average. The team will host the Oakland Athletics this weekend in a three game set before heading to New York to face the Yankees.}",
