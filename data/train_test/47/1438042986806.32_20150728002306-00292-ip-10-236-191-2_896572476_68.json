            "They have their own police department, stationed in front of the school, it's comforting to know that its their if anything happens while I'm attending.",
            "They have lots of activities planned, and some clubs to join. Near the dining area they have a mini arcade with a pool table, and a television set with a PS3, Wii and Xbox.",
            "They have several food stalls including Subway, Jamba Juice, Taco Bell, a pizza place, a cafeteria looking stall and they're opening a Panda Express. The area has a charging station for phones and electronics, which I thought was a neat feature of the dining area.",
            "Haven't lived or been in the dorms. The outside seemed quiet and calm.",
            "I can't say much on this factor, since I haven't attended the university yet.",
            "Ask questions! I can't stress this enough. In fact, keep a list of questions in mind, write them down, and don't assume anything. Second important point, check your e-mail/to-do-list often. I didn't check my account for a week and already I had an important paper that needed signing, luckily I turned it in on time. Third, and just as important as the top two, remember/check due dates. Due dates are no joke, if you miss a date there are consequences, like not paying registration fees on time. Missing fees result in removing your classes from your schedule. Overall just have a good time at school, you'll meet people with similar career goals and these are the people who you'll probably end up working with.",
            "So far, from what I've seen from visiting, the staff is very friendly and super helpful. Several times I needed help getting around and asked many questions, they answered them and provided extra information. The outside is an average campus, the focal point for me was the newer library with its glass windows and four floors for every type of student."

Whether it's a back up or you've been planning to come here all along, it's a great school to have as an option. The admission rate is about a 2.4 average, so it's not too hard to get in to Dominguez, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep your grades up., 321883=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 38730=there is also active greek life on this campus, but not so active since 2009., 51744=The bar has taco Tuesday! The 1910 restaurant has a buffet. You can never really go wrong with Subway. If those choices do not satisfy your fancy, there are other fast food places in the dining hall. If you want there are plenty of places to eat within a couple miles that offer student discount if you are a Toro! Wingstop 10% off your order.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Older, professional nursing students who wish to pursue a masters in nursing for FNP. They also have other Masters in Nursing for administration and education I believe. Tips for prospective students The paperwork requirements are very detailed, start early filling out and gathering your documents or you could be left out of matriculation. Bang for the buck Although the tuition price is increasing, it is still a bargin for a masters-level education, which I very much appreciate. Am enjoying being here I am not physically on campus much, but have noticed the student union, which seems to be tuned in to outreach. Am learning a lot The current learning experience is via distance learning, it is suprisingly rigorous. There are some weekends that you attend for some of the classes. This makes it easy for working professionals such as myself. Login to rate or flag the reviews D'andre from Perris, CA 12/29/2009 Reviewer",
