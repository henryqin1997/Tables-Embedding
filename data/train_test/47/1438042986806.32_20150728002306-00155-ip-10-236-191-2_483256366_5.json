According to the embodiment of the present invention, since the selection of the portion of the image formed by the first image forming lens, to be enlarged or reduced, can be effected by the adjustment of only the deflecting element provided between the image re-forming lens and the image forming surface, the adjustment of the image magnification can be easily carried out by a simple structure. Moreover, according to the embodiment of the present invention, a selected portion of the image formed by the first image forming lens, other than the center portion, can be easily enlarged or reduced on the image forming surface by the image re-forming lens. Furthermore, since the image pick-up surface comprises of a CCD, it is easier to move the CCD than to move an image forming surface formed by a film or the like. Moreover, according to the present invention, in a compound camera which is provided with an image forming surface, located at an in-focus position behind the first image forming lens, an image re-forming lens, and an image pick-up surface, located at the in-focus position of the image re-forming lens, the adjustment of the magnification of the",
