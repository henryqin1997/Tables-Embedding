Daily vertical temperature gradients often approached 3 to 4 \u00b0C., 31659=Data that passed the preliminary data inspection and validation process were first processed to correct for coordinate-system conversions and sound-speed re-calculations prior to quantitative automated data editing. The initial automated data-editing process consisted of the application of two filter criteria, one based on a minimal statistical correlation for each sample and the other on minimal number of valid samples per burst. A minimum correlation value of 70 percent was used as the statistical-filtering criterion. The number used for the minimum samples-per-burst criterion was determined by examination and assessment of plots of burst-averaged velocities generated using various values of 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, and 1 (i.e., no minimum) in processing ADV data sets from the SH1, GS-203, and GS-33 sites. As was determined for the 1999-2001 data sets, the 100-minimum filter criterion appeared too inclusive of suspect data and the 300-minimum criterion appeared overly exclusive of apparently valid data. Consequently, for the 10-Hz 1-minute burst sampling conducted at all three ADV sites, a criterion of 200 was determined to be the most appropriate minimum samples-per-burst filter and it was subsequently used to process all ADV data sets. Differences between daily mean horizontal flow velocities computed using the most liberal criterion, one minimum sample, and all others (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600) were found to be small in sensitivity tests conducted with past data (Riscassi and Schaffranek, 2002) and data documented in this report. (For the November 2001 through January 2002 deployments at SH1, GS-203, and GS-33, average maximum mean-daily velocity differences using all seven samples-per-burst filters were calculated. Average maximum differences of 0.11, 0.03, and 0.009 cm/s were found with the largest maximum differences being 0.84, 0.42, and 0.10 cm/s, respectively.), 49675=Yellow Springs Instruments, 1998, YSI precision thermistors and probes: Yellow Springs, OH, 86 p., 49382=Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., 1999, SBE 37-SI MicroCAT conductivity and temperature recorder with RS-232 Interface: User's manual version # 010, 12/1/99, Bellevue, WA, 41 p., 142113=Table C-5.

Horizontal velocity magnitudes generally ranged from 0.4 to 2.5 cm/s at SH1 (fig. 5), from 0.4 to 1.8 cm/s at GS-203 (fig. 6), and from 0.02 to 1.5 cm/s at GS-33 (fig. 7). Horizontal flow directions at all locations generally ranged from 180 to 275 degrees, clockwise with respect to magnetic north (MN). (Declination corrections to Geodetic North are less than the +/- 2 degree accuracy of the ADV compass and, therefore, are not applied to the MN coordinates reported herein.) Horizontal flow directions averaged approximately 235 degrees at SH1, 251 degrees at GS-203, and 194 degrees at GS-33. Corresponding daily mean horizontal-flow velocities are reported in tabular form for SH1, GS-203, and GS-33 in Appendices A, B, and C, respectively., 44752=Figure 6.

During the first two deployments at GS-33 (table 2), the velocity range setting for the ADV meter reverted to the instrument default of \u00b1250 cm/s, instead of a more appropriate setting of \u00b110 cm/s, making the probe less sensitive to detecting very small velocities. As a consequence, no valid velocity data are available from these two deployments. For the initial deployment at SH1 the ADV meter also defaulted to a \u00b1250 cm/s range setting, however, the recorded ADV data were not found to be appreciably noisy and were successfully qualitatively filtered to extract a valid set of flow velocities., 110913=Daily mean flow velocities, water-temperatures, specific conductances, and water depths at station GS-33, Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park, Florida during the 2001-2002 wet season., 5040=Direction of flow is reported in degrees clockwise from magnetic north (\u00b0CW from MN).

Horizontal coordinates are referenced to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83)., 15490=Deployment techniques and procedures used for the 2001-2002 wet season were the same as those documented in Riscassi and Schaffranek (2002) for the 1999-2001 wet seasons. ADV-deployment parameter settings at SH1, GS-203, and GS-33 are provided in table 2. MicroCAT meters were deployed 6 and 13 cm above the plant-litter layer near the ADV meters at GS-33 and GS-203, respectively. Thermistor positions, in relation to the top of the plant-litter layer, and temperature recording intervals at all four monitoring sites are listed in table 3. The ADV recording interval and sample volume location, relative to the top of the plant-litter layer, are provided in table 4 for each ADV deployment. Approximate water depths determined from water levels recorded at nearby hydrologic stations also are listed in table 4., 41925=The following report sections summarize the data collected at all four monitoring sites, SH1, GS203, GS33, and NP202, for all deployments during the 2001-2002 wet season. Daily mean flow velocities measured by ADV meters, MicroCAT measured temperatures, and specific conductances derived from MicroCAT measured conductivities are reported in Appendices A, B, and C., 29788=Editing and filtering criteria used to process the ADV data for the 2001-2002 wet season include those suggested by the instrument manufacturer to detect suspect data attributed to poor signal quality (SonTek, 2001) and those developed during the processing and concurrent analysis of past ADV data (Ball and Schaffranek, 2000; Riscassi and Schaffranek, 2002). The equipment manufacturer suggests minimum signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and statistical-correlation values of 5 dB and 70 percent, respectively, as indicative of good acoustic signal quality (SonTek, 2001). SNR values are derived from acoustic signal strengths measured during the deployment and the ambient electronics noise of the particular ADV meter used. SNR values are used to verify that particulate matter of appropriate size and concentration was present in the water column to produce a reflected acoustic signal that was sufficiently stronger than the ambient instrument noise. Particulate matter concentrations at the ADV measurement sites yielded average signal amplitudes of 84, 96, and 94 counts at GS-203, GS-33, and SH1, respectively, for all deployments. Ambient instrument noise levels of the ADV units deployed at GS-203, GS-33, and SH1 were 66, 72, and 84 counts, respectively. Thus, average SNR values were approximately 8 dB (range 5-20 dB) at GS-203, 10 dB (range 5-25 dB) at GS-33, and 5 dB (range 2-12 dB) at SH1 during all deployments. although SNR values were computed for each burst for all ADV deployments, they were not used as a quantitative automated data-editing criterion. Instead, they were used in the qualitative editing processes as a means to evaluate the reliability of data that passed the quantitative filter criterion but were deemed potentially erroneous or suspect in comparison to other flow speeds and directions measured during the deployment period., 57591=Table A-2. Daily mean flow velocities and water depths at station SH1 during deployment period 10/11/01 1130 - 11/06/01 1230, 44347=Figure 5. Burst-averaged flow velocities, shown as vectors relative to magnetic north, at SH1 in Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park, Florida, during the 2001-2002 wet season. (cm/s = centimeter per second; MN, magnetic north; negative velocity indicates south direction), 6341=A major thrust of the Everglades restoration effort, according to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan available on the website http://www.evergladesplan.org, is to restore the natural functioning of the ecosystem to pre-drainage conditions. This objective requires detailed knowledge of the hydrologic and hydraulic factors that affect the natural flow of water through the Everglades wetlands. The heterogeneous vegetation, small topographic gradient, microtopography, and ridge-and-slough structure of the landscape variously affect flows through the vast mosaic of sloughs, marshes, and wet prairies that make up the Everglades. The data collected in this project document the temporal and spatial variability of the extremely low velocity of shallow water in the heterogeneous wetlands and provide insight into the hydrologic and hydraulic processes that affect its flow through the low-gradient landscape. Shark River Slough is the dominant path of surface-water flow in Everglades National Park (ENP) (fig. 1). It conveys freshwater inflows discharged through culverts and hydraulic control structures along Tamiami Trail to the coastal mangrove ecotone of the southwest Gulf Coast of Florida. Flow-velocity, water-temperature, and conductivity data collected in Shark River Slough during August 2001 through June 2002 (2001-2002 wet season) are presented in this report. These data supplement the data collected during the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 wet seasons documented by Riscassi and Schaffranek (2002)., 111142=Table C-1.

Temperatures were monitored at 5-, 15-, or 30-minute intervals throughout the water column at all four sites, 3-D component flow velocities were monitored bi-hourly at a fixed point in the water column at SH1, GS-203, and GS-33, and conductivities and temperatures were monitored bi-hourly near the top of the plant-litter layer at GS-203 and GS-33. Velocity vectors defining horizontal flow speeds and directions measured at sites SH1, GS-203, and GS-33 are illustrated in the report. Mean daily horizontal flow velocities, water temperatures, and specific conductance values are listed in tabular form in the report appendices.

Thermistor strings were deployed at all four sites. ADV units were deployed at SH1, GS-203, and GS-33. The ADV units at GS-203 and GS-33 were equipped with integrated MicroCAT conductivity/temperature probes. Sites SH1, GS-203, and GS-33 were established in differing vegetative communities as previously described in Riscassi and Schaffranek (2002). The ADV unit installed at GS-33 in August 2001 was intended to provide flow-velocity data to supplement water and air temperature profiling initiated at the site during the 2000-2001 wet season (Riscassi and Schaffranek, 2002). In August 2001, a thermistor string was deployed at the ENP NP202 hydrologic station (fig. 2) to monitor the temperature profile in an area of dense cattails.
