Receiver 4 may also be of the type known in the prior art such as manufactured by National Semiconductor under Model No. LM 1872. Receiver 4 may also be selectively tuned to receive the signals of several different transmitters operating on different frequencies so that the performance of several runners may be monitored from a remote location., 34895=As further shown in FIG. 4, the output of sensor 3 is coupled to radio frequency transmitter 1 which includes means for encoding the output of foot sensor 3 into a transmitted signal. Transmitter 1 may also be of the type already known in the art such as manufactured by National Semiconductor under Model No. LM 1871. Transmitter 1 may operate on any frequency selected from the 27 MHz or 49 MHz band using amplitude or frequency modulation. Battery 2 supplies power to transmitter 1., 35847=Once received and decoded by receiver 4, the transmitted signal is coupled to microprocessor 5. Microprocessor 5 may be selected from various microprocessors known in the prior art, including Model No. CDP 1805AC manufactured by Radio Corporation of America. Microprocessor 5 executes a stored program in prom 6 to process the received signals from receiver 4 into the speed of the runner, distance traversed and calories expended. Microprocessor 5 also maintains running elapsed time and provides normal watch functions such as time of day, data, alarm and stop watch timing signals. The various values calculated by microprocessor 5 are displayed on display 7 through display interface 8. Calibration mode 9, run mode 10 and watch mode 11 of the device are switch selectable through input switch control logic interface 12.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Obviously, many modifications and variations of the above preferred embodiment of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of this disclosure. It should be realized that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiment disclosed, but its scope is intended to be governed only by the scope of the appended claims. In watch mode 11, microprocessor 5 selectively provides to display 7 normal watch function such as time of day, date, an alarm signal when a preselected time occurs and the time elapsed from a predetermined time. Once speed is calculated, microprocessor 5 calculates distance traversed by taking the product of speed and running elapsed time. The number of calories (in kilocalories) expended during the run, is also calculated by taking the product of the body weight of the runner in kilograms, distance traversed in kilometers and the constant 0.98. Running elapsed time, distance traversed and calories expended also may be selectively displayed on display 7. These values may also be stored in the read/write memory associated with microprocessor 5 for virtually an indefinite period of time. A typical run mode sequence will now be described with reference to FIG. 4. Run mode 10 is entered at the start of the run or jog by depressing an appropriate switch, not shown, which is coupled to microprocessor 5 through input switch control logic interface 12.
