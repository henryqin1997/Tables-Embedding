So in 1961, he moved to Agordo in the province of Belluno, which is home to most of the Italian eyewear industry.[7] The new company was Luxottica s.a.s., a limited partnership with Del Vecchio as one of the founding partners.[7] In 1967, he started selling complete eyeglass frames under the Luxottica brand, which proved successful enough that by 1971 he ended the contract manufacturing business.[8], 36972=In December 2013, Luxottica Group paid \u20ac33 million to the Italian Agency of Revenue to settle transfer pricing issues that arose in 2007.[33], 31553=Luxottica also owns EyeMed Vision Care, a managed vision care organization in the United States.[29] As of 2014, it is the second largest vision benefits company in the United States.[30][31][32], 14659=Convinced of the need for vertical integration, in 1974, he acquired Scarrone, a distribution company.[7] In 1981 the company set up its first international subsidiary, in Germany, the first in a rapid period of international expansion.[7] The first of many licensing deals with a designer was struck with Armani, in 1988.[9], 32648=Recent criticism has come upon the high prices of Luxottica's luxury brand named glasses, such as Ray-Ban, Oakley, and several others. A 2012 60 Minutes segment focused on whether the company's extensive holdings in the industry were used to keep prices high. Luxottica owns not only a large portfolio of brands such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, but also retailers like Sunglass Hut and Oliver Peoples, as well as the optical departments at Target and Sears. In addition, by owning the vision insurance company EyeMed, it controlled a portion of the buyers' side of the market as well.[31] CEO Guerra said that Luxottica did have competitors at the retail level in the American market, such as Walmart, and Costco.[31], 17447=On the 1st September 2014, a new organizational structure was announced, composed of two co-CEOs, one focusing on market development and the other overseeing corporate functions. After the exit of former CEO Andrea Guerra, Enrico Cavatorta was appointed CEO of Corporate Function and Interim CEO of Market (until new and permanent appointment to this role).[17][18][19], 16730=The company also acquired Oakley in a US$2.1 billion deal in November 2007,[14] and in August 2011 Erroca for \u20ac20 million.[15], 30578=In 1995, OneSight launched a new technique to help the less fortunate called SeeMore. It is a \"vision van\" which brings services to the less fortunate who are not able to travel. The vision van travels to schools to provide eye exams and eyewear to the kids. In 2004, the vision van helped 6,155 people affected by Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and Texas.[28], 17123=In March 2014, it was announced that Luxottica would partner with Google on the development of Google Glass and its integration into Luxottica's eyewear.[16], 15397=The company listed in New York in 1990,[10] and in Milan in December 2000,[11] joining the MIB-30 (now FTSE MIB) index in September 2003.[12] The listing raised money for the company and allowed it to use its shares to acquire other brands, starting with Italian brand Vogue Eyewear in 1990, Persol and US Shoe Corporation (LensCrafters) in 1995, Ray-Ban in 1999 and Sunglass Hut, Inc. in 2001.[7] Luxottica later increased its presence in the retail sector by acquiring Sydney-based OPSM in 2003, Pearle Vision and Cole National in 2004.[13], 26957=Luxottica had three charitable programs named Give the Gift Of Sight, Pearle Vision Foundation in North America, and the I-Care Community in Australia. These three programs were founded in 1988. Luxottica came to a decision to unite all three charitable programs into one global foundation and called it OneSight. Cincinnati, Ohio and Milan, Italy launched this foundation in December 12, 2008 bringing this new foundation 20 years of experience. \"OneSight, a Luxottica Group Foundation and a nonprofit corporation, is a family of charitable vision programs dedicated to improving vision through outreach, research, and education.\"[27] This charity helps the less fortunate by providing free eye exams along with free eyewear. These charitable programs has helped about 8.5 million people in 40 countries since 1988. Luxottica brings together affiliated and independent doctors, employees, vendors, and donors to volunteer their time using their expertise providing services, the opportunity of volunteering is not available to the public. OneSight is able to achieve giving the gift of sight to the less fortunate through four program areas: Global Eye Care, Regional Eye Care, Community Eye Care, and Preventative Eye Care., 37819=The list of Luxottica shareholders with more than 2% of holdings, represented by voting shares at 23 December 2014.[34], 13255=Leonardo Del Vecchio started the company in 1961,[6] in Agordo north of Belluno, Italy; today the company is headquartered in Milan., 38495=In September 2012, Delfin S.a.r.l. reduced its share of Luxottica from 66% to 62.1%,[35] but later increased its share to 66% again.}",
