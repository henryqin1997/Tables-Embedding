    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students I recommend SPSCC to anyone. Whether you're a junior in high school, just graduated from high school, or continuing your education after 30 years out of the education system, SPSCC is great at plugging you in and making you fit. They have wonderful resources to help you study and know your material, and the teachers are accommodating for all types of students. Especially if you're working a part-time job on top of going to school! There are some classes that are only two or three days a week, and they have hybrid classes (two days in class, the rest of the work online), as well as online courses. The staff at SPSCC will team up to help you however they can so you can be a success. Tips for prospective students I would definitely recommend taking Running Start. Even if you can't enter in your junior year, at least take it senior year. That's $3,000 you save right off the bat, and it's a very refreshing jumpstart into college life. They have a ton of options there to get you plugged in, so don't be afraid to get involved. Also, there are lot of opportunities at SPSCC for community service, so grab hold of those, get letters of recommendation from your supervisors, and apply for the scholarships SPSCC offers pertaining to community service. Get involved with student life and",
