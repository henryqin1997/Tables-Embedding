    "textBeforeTable": "Examples This format can be serialized back to JSON with a submission element with a serialization attribute value of \"application/json\". Elements not in the default namespace and unknown attributes are ignored when serialising to JSON. null produces empty content, and an attribute type=\"null\" is added to its element. true and false are copied across, and an attribute type=\"boolean\" is added to its element. A number is copied across, and an attribute type=\"number\" is added to its element. The content of a string is copied across. Escaped characters are transformed as necessary; characters and escapes that have no equivalent XML character (\\b, \\f, and characters of the form \\uxxxx less than \\u0020) are transformed by adding \\uE000 to them. If a value is an (anonymous) array (either being the top-level value, or itself an element of an array), then each element of the transformed array is given the name \"_\" and an attribute name=\"\" is added to the element. If the value part is an array, then each value in the array is so treated, and each such element is given an attribute array=\"true\". Each name/value member is encoded as an XML element whose name is the name of the member, and whose content is the transformation of the value part of the member. If any character of the element name is not an allowable XML name",
    "textAfterTable": "Note that the mapping is designed to be round-trippable, to allow as natural as possible selectors, and to easily support structural additions and deletions. Example selectors <repeat ref=\"cities\">... <input ref=\"father/given\">... <output ref=\"cities[1]\"/> <output ref=\"g[1]/_[1]\"/> 3.2.2.3 External CSV values When an XForms processor receives a CSV value [CSV], it treats it as follows: A root element <csv/> is created whose content is the transformation of the CSV value. Each row is enclosed in an <r> element. If the first row of the external value contains labels (marked by the header parameter of the media type), then each value in the row is surrounded by an element consisting of the name from the respective header. If the name contains characters that are not XML name characters, they are replaced by the underscore character \"_\"; if the first character may not start an XML name, an underscore is prepended. If the first row of the CSV value does not contain headers, then each value is surrounded by a <v> element. This format can be serialized back to CSV with a submission element with a serialization attribute value of \"text/csv\", with optional charset and header parameters [CSV]. When no header parameter is supplied, it has the same effect as header=absent. Examples",
