    "textBeforeTable": "Names in other languages[edit] Upon being alerted to Mario's arrival at the Koopa Bros. Fortress by Mario, Green Ninjakoopa takes defense precautions and has a key sealed away and guarded. When Mario finds Green Ninjakoopa while he is doing this, the Koopa Bro taunts Mario and flees. He also appears to be the last-in-command of the Koopa Bros. When Mario gets deeper into the Koopa Bros. Fortress, Yellow Ninjakoopa sets a trap for him; when Mario hits a rigged ? Block, a trapdoor opens beneath him and sends him falling into the Koopa Bros.' dungeon; as Mario falls, Yellow Ninjakoopa taunts and jeers at him. However, Yellow Ninjakoopa's plan of trapping Mario in the dungeon backfires, as Mario meets Bombette in the dungeon and also manages to break several other Bob-ombs out of it. He is apparently the third-in-command of the Koopa Bros. Green Ninjakoopa[edit] Black Ninjakoopa is the possible second-in-command of the Koopa Bros. and the one seen apart from his brothers most often. When Mario reaches Koopa Bros. Fortress, it's Black Ninjakoopa who reports this",
    "textAfterTable": "Trivia[edit] Red Ninjakoopa is the only member of the Koopa Bros. to wear an outfit that matches one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' outfits. He and Raphael both wear red. However, prior to the 1987 cartoon, all of the turtles had worn red. Black Ninjakoopa did have a blue outfit (Leonardo's signature color) in the official artwork, though. Their appearance marks the second TMNT reference in the Mario series. The first was an episode of The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3, known as Sneaky Lying Cheating Giant Ninja Koopas.
