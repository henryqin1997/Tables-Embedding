Others are just matters of taste. metric remedy has tests in t dir This distribution contains either a file called 'test.pl' (the old test file) or is missing a directory called 't'. This indicates that it uses the old test mechanism or it has no test-suite. Add tests or move tests.pl to the t/ directory! no stdin for prompting This distribution is using direct call from STDIN instead of prompt(). Make sure STDIN is not used in Makefile.PL or Build.PL. See http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?cpan_packaging Use the prompt() method from ExtUtils::MakeMaker/Module::Build. proper libs There is more than one .pm file in the base dir, or the .pm files are not in lib/ directory. Move your *.pm files in a directory named 'lib'. The directory structure should look like 'lib/Your/Module.pm' for a module named 'Your::Module'. If you need to provide additional files, e.g. for testing, that should not be considered for Kwalitee, then you should look at the 'provides' map in META.yml to limit the files scanned; or use the 'no_index' map to exclude parts of the distribution. meta yml has license This distribution does not have a license defined in META.yml. Define the license if you are using in Build.PL. If",
