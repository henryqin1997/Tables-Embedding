    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Christians who are wanting to live the way God wants them to. People who are looking for a good education. Tips for prospective students Start looking for money/scholarship/grants/etc NOW. Get involved with and go to stuff going on at Freed like: Makin Music, Lectureships, Maroon and Gold Days, and everything else they have to offer. Bang for the buck Freed can be a little more expensive compared to other colleges. But the christian atmosphere can't be beat and the education you will gain from Freed will better prepare you for the future. I'd rather pay a little more for a school like Freed than some community college. Will enjoy being here Freed has a great christian atmosphere and lots of activities to be involved in. If it's just a devotional, sports, or whatever! Will learn a lot I have been able to sit in on a few classes and was blown away every time! The teachers seem to be great and want to help you do well!
