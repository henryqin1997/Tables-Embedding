    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, it is apparent that many modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited by the foregoing description, but is only limited by the scope of the appended claims. Moreover, since the IC card may be provided with an LCD display and include 100 records stored in the memory as transaction history data, it is also possible to display the transaction history data on the display 112 by actuating predetermined keys of the IC card. Still further, since it is possible that only a desired part of the needed transaction processing data is stored in the IC card in advance, if an IC card having only a portion of the data therein is lost, a finder of the card cannot improperly use it since entry of additional necessary transaction processing data is still required. As evident from the foregoing, the IC card transaction system in accordance with the described embodiments of the invention enables a desired part of, or all of, the data required for an individual transaction processing to be pre-stored in an IC card in advance. With the invention, it is possible to insert the IC card into an automatic transaction processing unit and if all financial transaction data has been previously entered into the card to immediately carry out",
