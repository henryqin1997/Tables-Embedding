            "I do not participate in Greek life for a variety of reasons. However the people who do enjoy it.",
            "They are alright, I know lots of people who enjoy them.",
            "Students looking for a close, small community college life. You will definitely get to know people on campus, it is hard not to due to its small size.",
            "Don't step on the seal in front of the library! It's bad luck!",
            "Some students get almost a full ride, others pay almost 25 grand each year. It depends on the student, however I feel that it is worthwhile or else I would have transferred.",
            "Not too much to do on campus, but Columbus is full of fun things to do.",
            "It is college dining. Not as good as home cooking obviously. However, it has improved each year.",
            "I enjoying living in the dorm I am in currently. However there are some improvements that could be made for the other buildings.",
            "Academics at Capital differ in difficulty based on their department I feel like. Some departments such as the sciences are more time consuming and difficult while others are not as demanding.",
            "Get out and be involved during the first few weeks! This is where you'll meet a lot of people very quickly. Make sure you are aware of what classes you need to be taking for your major. It is best to stay on track!",
            "Capital is a great community comprised of professors, faculty, and students who all care about the education process. The professors are easily available to you and want you to learn and be successful! The relationships and friendships I have formed have also been superb."

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot Capital University is a very challenging school. The professors are very nice and usually will go out of their way to help you. The small class sizes mean that you get a lot more personal attention from your professors. They require several university core classes, which force you to expand your learning out of your comfort zone.

Classes rarely exceed twenty people, and the professors actually know students by name. It's a great feeling to know your face isn't one of many just blending in with the masses. The smaller student population allows professors more time to help each individual student which ensures a successful academic career. Login to",
