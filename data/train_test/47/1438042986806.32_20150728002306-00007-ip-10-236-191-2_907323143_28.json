            "LC always has something on campus to do. We usually have concerts. In our planner, we have small statements of what is happening that day.",
            "Food is always up for grabs at LC. We have the cafeteria (which always takes reccomendations), Westover (a great hangout area as well as great wraps and grilled items), and Roly Poly (a wonderful place to hang out and play some pool and snack on a wrap).",

Tips for prospective students Make sure you really want a small school; this means smaller, more personalized classes but it also means more homework because teachers are able to grade more work with a smaller class load. Also, make sure this school has your major before deciding to attend. Even if you are only vaguely interested in something, make sure the school has it. You don't want to get somewhere and then realize you need to transfer; it's a difficult process. Try to get into the Westover Honor Society; it really pays off! Bang for the buck LC offers great scholarships, especially for in-state residents. Make sure you keep pushing the Financial Aid office looking for more scholarships; usually they will offer more if you insist. For the price of the school (or any price really), you are getting a great education. Am enjoying being here The people at LC are very friendly and open.
