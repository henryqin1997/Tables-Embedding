Spending two summers and a fall in Austin allowed Burkhardt and Goatley to gather volumes of material. In order to condense this large amount of material into a workable size for a musical theatre piece, they began by drawing on sketch paper clusters of songs and scenes for the musical. A first draft of the piece was read and sung in May by students, faculty and community members, so the authors could hear what needed to be revised. A second draft is now in progress., 26556=The Sixth Annual Graduate Student Symposium is Thursday, April 4.
