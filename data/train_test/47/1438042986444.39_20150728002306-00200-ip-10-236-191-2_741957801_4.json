Minimum value of 36 spots is R$ 2.8 billion. \u00a0 The rules established by Anatel to this tender has as main goal to guarantee 4 competitors in every region of the country and expand cell phone coverage to every brazilian city. \u00a0 In December will be the auction of 3G frequencies in Brazil.

The cities choice will be made in sequential order, by the 4 winners of the region, so guarantee attendance to 100% of these cities. The 4 operators can also choose a sharing network to attend all of these cities. \u00a0 With these rules Anatel will probably reach the established goals. The operators know they can't be out of technological changes which extend offer of new services with mobile broad band and allows voice minute price decreasing in its service plans with network growth. Not implant 3G while others are doing would be very bad to any operator and competitiveness. \u00a0 What can go wrong with 3G authorization? \u00a0 The big risk would not get to sell all of frequency blocks in any of the regions. In this case, wouldn't be guaranteed attendance of the cities with lesser than 30 thousand inhabitants. \u00a0 This actually can happen if some of these operators decide to implant 3G (WCDMA/HSDPA) with frequencies 850 MHz (Bands A and B) which were free with GSM implantation. \u00a0 Claro has frequencies 850 MHz available in the State: S\u00e3o Paulo and can not change its",
