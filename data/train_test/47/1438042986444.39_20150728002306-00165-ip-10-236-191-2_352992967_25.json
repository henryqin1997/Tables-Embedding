I have not included the new Timeless Isle crafted gear, as it\u2019s low level and has random stats. I assume this list will also come in handy for Enhancement Shaman (though I haven\u2019t included your tier pieces).\u00a0, 13109=I\u2019m only listing one level of loot in this list (Normal). However, there are actually 6 different ilvls for all raid loot excluding Tier pieces (because 5 different ilvls last tier weren\u2019t enough!). Bosses in Siege of Orgrimmar have a small chance to drop Warforged gear in normal and heroic modes (not in LFR or Flex). Warforged gear is 6 ilvls higher than it\u2019s regular counterpart gear. So the new gear levels for raid drops are:, 97089=Valor points burning a hole in your pockets? The first upgrade to get is the Woundlicker Cover for 1250 points. It\u2019s really the only cloak option, so you may as well get this one first., 31855=Tagged 5.4, BiS, gear, Hunter, siege of orgrimmar, 101311=Haste to 2005 > Mastery > Crit > extra Haste, 97454=After that, just upgrade your lowest ilvl pieces. Good choices will likely be Boots of Fungoid Growth (1650 points) since the boots in Firelands were poorly itemized or the Lightning Spirit in a Bottle (700 points) if you\u2019re still using one of the ilvl 378 relics., 33433=Patch 5.4 drops on Tuesday September 10th, and resto Druids have a whole lot of changes to be prepare for and look forward to. I have also updated my Restoration Druid Healing Guide to reflect the 5.4 changes. If you\u2019re looking for a 5.4 gear guide, you won\u2019t find it here \u2013 go visit Juvenate for his 5.4 PVE Gear Guide., 164927=Here\u2019s a sample of what my ideal (normal) gear setup would look like: Chardev profile \u2013 this would allow for the 4 set bonus and still retain 2005 haste., 164656=The secondary stat priority I will be using for T12 is: Haste to 2005 > Mastery > Crit > extra Haste, 38546=This means you need at least 12000 spirit to get the same effect from Innervate that you did in 5.3. With better gear, this is a buff.}",
