            "Community college is great for students who aren't sure what they want to major in because it lets you get your general education requirements out of the way on your own schedule. It's also great for students who just want to save money, regardless of whether or not they know their desired career path.",
            "Now that I've graduated Chandler-Gilbert with my associates degree, I'm transferring to Grand Canyon University. Most of my credits are transferring over, so I really saved myself a lot of money by attending community college first.",
            "Chandler-Gilbert has a few food options: they have a coffee cart, a cafeteria, and many vending machines placed throughout campus. You basically have everything you need at school, and you'll always be able to grab a snack or meal between classes if you need to.",
            "To my knowledge, Chandler-Gilbert does not have dorms. However, they do have a lot of great clubs and activities going on all the time that have the purpose of connecting students during their time at the college. I participated in an online literary magazine, and it was a great experience and chance to interact with my fellow students.",
            "As with any college, academic rigor is really based on the professor. I had classes with difficult assignments and classes with easy assignments. The most important thing to remember is that you never know how difficult a class will be until you're in it, so go into each class with the expectation that you're going to work hard and then you won't be surprised if you have to.",
            "Especially if Chandler-Gilbert will be your first college experience, remember to wait to purchase your books until the first day of class or until talking to your teacher. A lot of teachers don't use the textbooks very often but are still obligated to require them. If your teacher doesn't end up using the book, then you will have saved a lot of money.",
            "Chandler-Gilbert Community College is a great place to start your secondary education if you want to save money. You will be receiving the same quality of education that you would at a public university, but with greatly reduced tuition. Most credits will transfer, and it will definitely pay off in the long run."
