            "Hawkeye Community College is a very nice college for students to get acclimated to new college life. Teachers are personable, classes are small (20 students average), courses aren't too rigorous (but depends on classes taken), and very much affordable. This school is perfect for students planning to take general education courses and transfer to a university and older non-traditional students alike."

You can live there for the summer if you wanted to and you can renew your lease. The rent as of right now (October 2012) is $385 with a $200 deposit when you first move in. Its not really a dorm if you think about it. Its more of an Apt complex. Your dorm is shared between 4 people. You get your own room that is 10x9. There are 2 bathrooms. 2 in each. The kitchen is fully functional. Its comes with a refrigerator, microwave, oven, and a dishwasher. The freezer is a little small. So you will have figure out spacing details with your roommates. The walls are a bit thin so if your neighbors are making really lowed noises you may here them. But otherwise not a bad place to live. The people working in the office are friendly and always willing to help., 98071=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
