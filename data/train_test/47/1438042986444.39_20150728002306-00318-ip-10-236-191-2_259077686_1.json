Need to upgrade laptops and install recent GNU Radio 2009-06-12 Upgraded laptops to Ubuntu 9.04 and GNU Radio 3.2 Problems with example APT receiver since it uses 32k audio but my crap HW can only do 44k1 or 48k. 2009-06-13 I realized that I brought a BNC male/male adapter instead of a female/female that I need to connect my antenna to the TVRX.
