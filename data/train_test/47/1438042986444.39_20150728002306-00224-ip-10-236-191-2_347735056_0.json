While the temperatures haven\u2019t been tickling the triple digits in the past few days, that song title aptly describes most of the month of June., 30108=June is Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Month. No one can argue with the fact that most people should eat more fruits and vegetables. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans stress the wisdom of moving\u00a0to a more plant-based diet, and MyPlate encourages us to fill half our plates with fruits and vegetables at each meal.\u00a0If you\u2019re counting fruit servings, men and women should eat at least 2 cups of fruit every day and children ages between the ages of 9 and 13 should get at least 1\u00bd cups., 40403=Copyright \u00a9 2015 The Brunswick Beacon is your source for local news, sports, events and information in Brunswick County, North Carolina and surrounding areas.}",
