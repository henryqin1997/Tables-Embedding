            "I can at least respect that they have good campus security and the like.",
            "They have the divine nine, but there is VERY little involved in Greek life on campus. They do not have Greek housing.",
            "Those who are looking for small and secluded without all the hustle & bustle, its great, otherwise you might want to look the other way.",
            "While they give out scholarships like no one's business it costs so much that it all you're really looking for is a renewable full-ride to this school.",
            "Just go closer to the more urban part of Charleston, the campus isn't much for big events like you might see at a larger campus.",
            "I ate lunch on campus and the food was awful. Not much variety in the lunch room or on campus at all. The flavor and choices clearly lacked variety and were repetitive, and the guide didn't have a problem confirming this fact. Outside out of their cafeteria they have one Chic-fil-A and a Java City. The best places to eat are about 20-30 minutes out from the school. Unfortunately, the meal plan is included in the room & board. And if you aren't from the area you are required to stay on campus 4 consecutive quarters/semesters.",
            "Despite having the largest suite style dorms in the state of South Carolina, the buildings are dirty and old and look very worn. The hallways are less than arm's length. I don't recommend people who are claustrophobic, like myself, live here. But if you like tight hallways and an either 3 or 2 person room in a suite I guess you're okay. The dorms are first come, first served. A tip is that if you name someone to become your roommate and they are still waiting on your roommate to turn in their paperwork as well you may lose your two-person room. Don't wait!!! Stay on top of your prospective roommate!",
            "The minimums for this school is very low, which makes me wonder what kind of students are they really trying to admit into the school.",
            "If you are looking for a large campus with a lot of students on campus all of the time this isn't the college for you. 3/4 of the student body are commuters, meaning they don't live in the dorms on campus and most stay closer to the more urban part of Charleston. Upon visiting you find that the campus is almost ghost-like or in other words, empty. There are very few people outside or walking around unless it is around the meal times.",
            "The atmosphere was very un-welcoming here. The staff here tries to appear friendly, but come off as awkward and cold. This is a college you will definitely have to visit in order to understand the true vibe of this school, contrary to good reviews."

Clubs and Activities there are a ton to choose from. but they don't do anything usefull for the most part. it is mostly ra-ra we are happy christians sort of thing.
