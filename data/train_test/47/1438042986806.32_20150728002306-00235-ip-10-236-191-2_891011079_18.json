The drum beats to the Apache Cadence 24 hours a day starting on Monday of Homecoming Week and continuing until kickoff on Saturday. The tradition of the drumbeat is that if it does not stop we will win the game on Saturday but it stops we will lose the game. Tradition has held for the past 18 years, with one exception, one time the drumbeat stopped and we tied the game. But it was the worst weather that you can imagine for a football game. It hailed, rained one inch per thirty minutes, and had cloud to ground lightning, with the game being delayed three times due to the lightning. In the 1940's TJC played in many national football games including the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Members of the Tyler Community were interested in knowing if TJC won or lost its game and so they came up with a way for the community to know if TJC won their game. Ramey Tower was visible at the time from Broadway, since the trees on campus, planted by Dr. Potter were very small and Tyler Junior College is located on a hill at the present location. Ramey Tower is lit in gold if we win the game and in white if we lose the game., 42649=Beginning this fall 2010, students and employees will wear their identification cards on lanyards so that others know of their role at the College and so that visitors will be identifiable. There is constantly campus security on bikes and go karts to make sure there is no disruptive problems going on campus. If you do not have or wear your lanyard you will be pulled aside by campus safety. They will ask you to write your name and A# and will call to confirm you are a student to issue you a day pass. If you are not a student, you will be escorted off campus., 208125=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 95641=My courses started on the 27th of August, so I am not the best person to give advice at this time on the Academic Rigor, I will know more on this subject within the next few weeks. But, I am keeping busy and learning a lot and it's just been a little over a week since school has begun.}",
