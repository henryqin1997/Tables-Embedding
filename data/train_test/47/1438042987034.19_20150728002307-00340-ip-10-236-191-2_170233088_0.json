Not a subscriber but did a quick check of (Baseball America's) site and didn't see anything obvious.\"On Oct. 4 NationalsProspects.com reported that Baseball America had named Peacock the No. 4 prospect in the Eastern League.In that post \"Sue Dinem\" quoted from John Manuel's Baseball America chat. Manuel said he sees Peacock as a future No. 3.:Q: [Matt (West Chester, PA)]: I was surprised to see Peacock get grouped together with Turner and Banuelos, let alone rank ahead of both. Considering Peacock\u2019s year and development, has his ceiling jumped from #3 to #2?A: I really like Peacock a lot, and gave him the edge because of my single-minded (probably to a fault) emphasis of guys pitching off their fastball. Peacock went through lineups three times using mostly his heater. I like his fastball command\u2026[it's] electric\u2026 and he\u2019s a good athlete. I like him as a future No. 3 starter, which is convenient as he slots in behind Strasburg and Jordan Zimmermann., 32757=Oct 14, 2011, 4:16 PM EDT, 19177=Oh boy. Can't wait to put my season tix up on StubHub and make a mint off of Red Sox Nation. Oh wait, this game isn't part of the the STH plan? Hmmm.I bet it will be. The 2010 Red Sox exhibition game was, and as I recall they gave STH that one for free, or perhaps half price., 31024=The Nationals also are due to face the Red Sox in interleague play, June 8-10 at Fenway Park., 32302=The new-look Red Sox Nation will be invading D.C. in advance of Opening Day 2012., 31219=This latest matchup will feature some added intrigue, given Boston's recent September collapse and departures of both manager Terry Francona and general manager Theo Epstein., 31900=The Nationals announced today they will host Boston in an exhibition game April 3 at Nationals Park, two days before their season opener against the Cubs in Chicago. Gametime or ticket information hasn't been announced yet., 14784=To Section 222:Updated, 1:50 p.m.: From a Nationals news release:Game time has yet to be determined. As a benefit to 2012 season ticket holders, all those with full, half and partial season ticket plans will receive tickets for the game at half their regular season ticket price. Details for the team\u2019s 2012 season ticket plans are available online at nationals.com/tickets. \u2026Beginning next week, the added Red Sox game will be visible in all existing season ticket holder accounts and included as part of any new 2012 season ticket plan., 31364=This will be the second time the Red Sox have come to town for a pre-Opening Day exhibition; the two teams also met in 2010.}",
