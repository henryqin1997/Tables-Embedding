Traded players' entire salaries are listed with their final team, so some teams' total payrolls are more than the upper limit. The data include players who were on the team at the time salaries were collected, which varies from season to season. In most cases, players had to a play a minimum of 30 games (or would have except for injuries). In some cases, players were not included if they did not play a full season. Tracking a player's salary from year to year might not yield results for every year if he did not play a full season. If a player was on a multiyear contract, the terms for only the current year were used, plus a prorated signing bonus, if applicable. Incentive and award clauses were not included.
