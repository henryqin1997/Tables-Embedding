And it should be a lot of fun. \"Before you enter the program,\" Mitchell says, \"please read this information. It will help you decide if the program is for you.\" Once you arrive at the page, scroll through the listings until you find the 'Adopt pheasant chicks' subhead. Information about the facilities needed to raise pheasants, and tips that will help you raise the birds, are available at wildlife.utah.gov/uplandgame. If you participate, Dean Mitchell, Conservation Outreach Section chief for the DWR, says you must cover all of the expenses to feed, vaccinate and house the birds. The pheasants will be released on state wildlife and waterfowl management areas, walk-in access areas and private land that provides access to public hunters. If you join the program, you'll raise the chicks to adulthood. Then, before the general pheasant hunt starts in November, you'll help release the birds into the wild. DWR staff will then provide the chicks to individuals, families and groups who have agreed to",
