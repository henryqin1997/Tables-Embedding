The Garneau Women's Perfector Long Sleeve Jersey 2 comes in sizes X-Small through XX-Large and in two color options: Flash blue and Black/white. Garneau constructed the Perfector 2 out of their Elite Provent 2 fabric, which has a brushed back knit to provide the right amount of insulation. On the outside of the fabric, a micro-honeycomb pattern ensures that sweat evaporates away from your body. The jersey has a semi-relaxed fit, so you can layer underneath without worrying about restricted movement. In the event that you wear the Perfector 2 as an inner layer, you'll appreciate the friction-minimizing flatlock seams. A full-length zipper allows you to ventilate when needed, and elastic at the hem keeps the jersey",
