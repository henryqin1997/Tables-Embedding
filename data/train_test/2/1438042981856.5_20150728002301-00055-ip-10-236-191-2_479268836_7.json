For example, Huc and Gimeno, French Patent Application No. 84/3181, 1984, and Chvapil and Krajicek, J. Surg. Research, 11: 358, 1963, describe methods for forming synthetic blood vessels. Daniels et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,949,073, and Wallace et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,424,208, disclose the preparation of soft tissue implants. A synthetic tympanic membrane is disclosed by Abbenhaus and Hemenway, Surg. Forum, 18: 490, 1967. The preparation of other collagen-based membranes and films is disclosed by Dunn et al., Science, 157: 1329, 1967, and Nishihara et al., Trans. Amer. Soc. Artif. Int. Organs, Vol. XIII, pp. 243-248, 1967. A number of other collagen-based prostheses are disclosed by Luck et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,233,360 and 4,488,911, and Battista, U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,470. Additional uses of collagen-based implants are reviewed by Simpson in \"Collagen as a Biomaterial,\" Biomaterial in Reconstructive Surgery, C. V. Mosby Co. (L. Rubin, ed.), St. Louis, 1983, pp. 109-117., 13681=This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/991,203, filed Dec. 15, 1992 and now abandoned, which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 07/824,838, filed Jan. 22, 1992, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,764, which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 07/486,558, filed Feb. 28, 1990, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,957., 14529=Various methods and materials have been proposed for modifying collagen to render it more suitable for biological and medical procedures. (See, e.g., Lloyd et al., \"Covalent Bonding of Collagen and Acrylic Polymers,\" American Chemical Society Symposium on Biomedical and Dental Applications of Polymers, Polymer Science and Technology, Vol. 14, Plenum Press (Gebelein and Koblitz eds.), New York, 1980, pp. 59-84; Shimizu et al., Biomat.

Nos. 4,388,428 and 4,452,925, Kuzma et al. disclose polymerized hydrophilic water-swellable compositions made from a mixture of components consisting essentially of inter alia solubilized collagen and ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing nitrogen. (See also PCT Int. Appl. No. PCT/US82/00889, published Feb. 3, 1983 as WO 83/00339). A severe drawback to Kuzma et al.'s compositions which limits their usefulness as biological materials is the presence of significant quantities of acrylamides, known neurotoxins, as ethylenically unsaturated monomers. No recognition of the neurotoxicity of acrylamides is made in any of these patent.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Solutions of substituted soluble collagen were made into lens-like articles by placing aliquots of the solutions in glass molds, 22 mm in diameter by 7 mm in depth. Solutions were then polymerized by UV-irradiation in nitrogen, dried in a laminar-flow hood and then subjected to UV-irradiation, or heated to melt the thick solution, dried, and then subjected to UV-irradiation. Heating seemed to enhance the strength and flexibility of resultant films. Molded films were concave with diameters from 7 mm to 20 mm and thickness form 0.1 mm to 5 mm. Flat films were also prepared by casting the substituted collagen solutions on microscope slides. Thick, lens-shaped films were also prepared by mixing 1-20 milligrams of sodium persulfate into the substituted collagen solutions and then exposing molded material to UV-irradiation for 1-5 minutes, in air. These films were not strong and are easy to tear. FORMED ARTICLES EXAMPLE 6 Procedures described in the previous Examples were used to prepare several combination substitutions. Combinations of reaction agents included: glutaric anhydride/B-styrene sulfonyl chloride/methacrylic anhydride, glutaric anhydride/ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer/methacrylic anhydride, glutaric anhydride/polyvinyl sulfonic acid/methacrylic anhydride, glutaric anhydride/ethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer/styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer. Glutaric substitution was important to provide a clear, colorless solution and clear films. Glutaric anhydride could be replaced by succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride or similar anhydrides, sulfonyl chlorides, or acid halide chlorides. Methacrylic substitution provided plastic-like properties and seemed to be associated with spontaneous",
