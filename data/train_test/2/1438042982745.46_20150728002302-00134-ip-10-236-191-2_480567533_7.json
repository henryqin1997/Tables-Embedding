    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{28374=One existing interface useful for communication between the SCP, SSP, and IP is set forth in a Bellcore publication known as the GR-1129-Core: Switch-Intelligent Peripheral Interface (hereinafter referred to as \"GR-1129\"). GR-1129 directs that communications between the SCP and the IP travel through the SSP. This method of communication between the network elements of an AIN permits the SSP to keep track of billing records and release the SSP-IP voice/data connection when it is no longer required while maintaining control of the original call. Additionally, the SSP can receive subsequent call processing instructions from the SCP for the same call as part of the same initial transaction, however there are several disadvantages to this method of communication between the SCP and IP. The GR-1129 interface limits non-call associated signaling capabilities. For example, the SCP cannot invoke IP resources to initiate call activity independent of the initial call. Additionally, the GR-1129 interface places a significant processing demand on the SSP because all data communications from the SCP to the IP go through the SSP and require the SSP to reformat SS7 messages from the SCP into ISDN messages to send to the IP and vice-versa., 35957=In addition to communicating with the SCP 14 through the SSP 12, the IP 20 and SCP 14 preferably communicate over a second data path 24 that bypasses the SSP 12 and preferably directly connects the SCP 14 and IP 20 through the STP 18. The first data path 22 connecting the SCP 14 and the IP 20 through the STP 18 and SSP 12 preferably implements the Bellcore GR-1129-Core Intelligent Peripheral Interface. The second, or direct, data path 24 permitting communication between the SCP 14 and IP 20 and bypassing the SSP 12 preferably uses a different interface hereinafter referred to as the direct SCP-IP interface., 36591=As described in greater detail below, the presently preferred method of mixed mode SCP-IP communication implements select features of the GR-1129 document which describes the SCP-SSP-IP interface and implements the direct SCP-IP interface discussed herein. A suitable direct SCP-IP interface is set forth in a publication by Ericsson entitled SCP-IP Interface Function Requirements, No. EAU/T/S 1056P8AIN/012 Uen (hereinafter \"the Ericsson interface\"). This document describes one set of interface requirements for direct communication between the SCP and IP without communicating through an SSP. In a preferred embodiment, the direct SCP-IP interface is a selected portion of the Ericsson interface., 51953=The IP resource usage billing function lets the SCP 14 instruct the IP 20 to generate and format records for IP resource billing. Preferably the SCP 14 provides the IP 20 with AMA billing information to coordinate IP record keeping. The SCP-IP AMA interface is preferably based on GR-1299-CORE published by Bellcore., 62362=The above embodiment of a method of processing telephone calls utilizing standard SCP-IP communications through the SSP 12 and direct SCP-IP communications that bypass the SSP 12 is advantageous in that the processing load on the SSP is reduced. An interface mediator 25 located at the SCP 14 preferably controls which data path, direct 24 or indirect 22, that the data will travel based on the service logic that the interface mediator 25 is executing. In one embodiment, the interface mediator may be a collection of service independent building blocks containing messages of all the different types of SCP-IP interfaces to be called upon by the service logic for different types of telephone services offered by a service provider. The service logic for supporting each type of telephone service preferably includes instructions that the SCP will execute dictating when the direct SCP-IP interface, using the direct data path, will be used and when an indirect data path will be used. For example, the service logic for a relatively simple service that plays an announcement and collects digits may include instructions for using the Bellcore GR-1129 interface over the indirect data path. For a more complex service, such as playing an announcement, collecting digits and taking additional action based on the results of the initial call, the service logic may include instructions for the SCP to use both a direct SCP-IP interface and a standard interface such as the Bellcore GR-1129 interface., 53742=In one embodiment, a subset of the GR-1129 interface is used as the indirect SCP-IP interface. The selected portions preferably include messages and parameters necessary to open a transaction via the SSP to the IP, communicate intermediate results without closing a transaction, complete a transaction at the IP, and cancel a resource event. Elements of the GR-1129 interface that are unnecessary include noncall associated signaling, any requirements involving ISDN BRI, and the Connect-- To-- Resource message defined in the regular GR-1129 interface. The subset of GR-1129 selected is optimized for use with the direct SCP-IP interface under the direction the service logic through the use of the interface mediator 25 in the SCP., 54517=Referring now to FIG. 3, a call flow diagram illustrating a preferred method of handling a telephone call using select elements of the GR-1129 interface and the direct SCP-IP interface described above is shown. A telephone call from an end user first arrives at the SSP 12. The SSP 12 recognizes an AIN trigger, knows that the call will require AIN resources, and requests instructions from the SCP 14 (at steps 30, 32). The SCP 14 subsequently instructs the SSP 12, via a Send-- To-- Resource message, to play a message to the end user (at step 34). The message may be any prerecorded message but is preferably a \"dead\" message that plays a period of silence to the end user. The dead message is played to prevent a timeout for the SCP-SSP transaction while the SCP 14 attempts to establish a connection with the IP 20 over the direct SCP-IP interface., 63882=From the foregoing, an improved system and method of communication between elements of an advanced Intelligent Network has been described. The method coordinates the use of an indirect SCP-IP interface and a direct SCP-IP interface. This takes advantage of the strengths of the Bellcore GR-1129 interface and a direct SCP-IP interface to reduce the processing demands on service switching points. Additionally, the use of the direct SCP-IP interface allows for increased functionality and flexibility for expansion over GR-1129 by itself. The presently preferred method provides compatibility between interfaces and is capable of selecting either interface independently or using them in combination on the same network elements.}",
