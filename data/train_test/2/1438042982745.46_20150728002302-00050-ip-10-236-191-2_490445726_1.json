Rockstars, competitions, catty bitches, drama, hot sex, and a whole lot of love. Reno told me it was a little more romantic than they usually write and he was right, but I loved it. Logan and Nick were both strong but vulnerable characters and the whole competition idea was brilliant.

He redeemed himself quickly though and I found myself hooked into the pain he was having upon realizing he'd turned his back on his mate. Kaden was obviously suffering a different kind of pain, both physically and emotionally. He was a fascinating character to me, being a were and a mage and having that awesome power of transmitting emotions. The abuse he suffered was astronomical and I have to say I wasn't all that comfortable with his and Michael's first mating, but as I said Michael redeemed himself in all kinds of ways, in all kinds of support and love. The secondary characters were very interesting, especially Michael's parents' who I instantly loved. The scene of Kathleen and Kaden dancing around the kitchen made me smile and they way they called the younger man \"son\" was truly beautiful. In a lot of ways this may have been a typical shifter story - smaller man/bigger Alpha, love lost and found - but I thought the distinct personalities of the characters and the secondary characters, plus the addition of mages made it both interesting and unique. I look forward to reading more of Nikki's work. ...more",

There were the odd moments where they did have chemistry, where the attraction was believable and didn't seem contrived or fake, but more often than not, I just didn't understand why they were behaving the way they were.

I realize it might be a **spoiler alert** **4.5 stars** This was a wonderful book - passionate, heartwarming, angsty and chock full of drama and love. I realize it might be a hard read for some, subject-wise, but I think Marie handled the religious aspect very well, with honesty and realism. I could feel Levi's pain throughout the book, feel his need to be his own man but also remain part of his family. Jaime is such a sad soul in the beginning and he tugged at my heart more than any character I've read for awhile. The fact that he went into a profession that involves actual physical contact shows how strong he really was on the inside - he just needed the right person to bring that strength out and he definitely found that in Levi. Their relationship was odd and uncomfortable in the beginning, both due to Jaime's fear and Levi's sexual attitude and it was a real relief when they both started conforming to and accepting each other's quirks and ways. Despite the overbearingness and prejudice of Levi's family, I liked how all their different personalities came out and found myself enjoying the scenes with all of them, as well. Great read. :) ...more",

The prologue of the book was uncomfortable to read but completely necessary to set the tone of Chris' plight and to show how he was before he changed his life. My heart ached for him, his history, his situation and his struggle to change. He was a complex, strong but needy, character. The beginning kept me spellbound to find out what was going on and who this emotional, caring man was (Denny) - such a sweet character, so selfless (even though I guess that was his \"job\") - beautiful inside and out.
