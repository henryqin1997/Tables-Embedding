Anybody has detected the same speed difference between normal CH and CH + Bracketing? And... does anybody have a solution, or an idea about how to solve it? I've disabled AF, I've set shutter priority instead of AF priority, I even tried to set the camera to 12bits instead of 14bits, I've played with bracketing burst feature...
