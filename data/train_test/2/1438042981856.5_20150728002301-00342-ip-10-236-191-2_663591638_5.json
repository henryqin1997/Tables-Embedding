Scored from 0 to 6 for quantitative studies and 0 to 5 for qualitative studies, on basis of number of affirmative answers with higher scores indicating better methodological robustness, as follows: Score on SMS Searchable Score on adapted version of the 'Scientific Maryland Scale' (Farrington, Gottfreson, Sherman and Welsh, 2002; see review for more details). Scored 1 to 5 for quantitative studies only, with higher score indicating better methodological robustness as follows: Level 1: Association between a prevention program and an outcome measure at one point in time Level 2: Includes pre- and post- intervention measures (i.e. measures at two points in time) , but with no control group Level 3: Pre- and post-intervention measures (i.e. measures at two points in time) and also treatment and control group Level 4: Pre- and post-intervention measures (i.e. measures at two points in time) and treatment and control group, and also control for other factors that influence outcome Level 5: RCT i.e. Pre- and post-intervention measures (i.e. measures at two points in time) and treatment and control group, with participants randomised to treatment and control group) Note that some studies could have more than one score because they use a range of methods, or use different methods to evaluate different components of the programme. In these cases we have indicated only",
    "textAfterTable": "Negative and Positive indicators Where reported, this field gives information relevant to the implementation and delivery of the intervention, including indicators of lack of effectiveness as well as of successful implementation, under the following categories: attendance & engagement cultural sensitivity/appropriateness successfully reached range of ethnic groups (where intended to be 'inclusive' programme) user satisfaction & perception of 'helpfulness' practical aspects (location & accessibility; cost to users; timing) continuity & appropriateness of staffing (inter)agency working issues (communication, shared values etc) cost effectiveness Works, Promising, and Doesn't Work This field gives information on the reported outcomes (positive and negative) of the intervention as reported in the study. They are listed under one of three headings depending on the findings of the study: Works, Promising, and Doesn't work in relation to any outcome reported in the study (not just the main outcome). The headings are adapted from Farrington et al (2000), and are defined as follows: Works: an intervention with at least one SMS level 3 to 5 evaluation showing statistically significant and desirable results, and the preponderance of all available evidence showing effectiveness Promising: where level of certainty is too low to support generalisable conclusions, but where there is some empirical basis for predicting that further research could support such conclusions Doesn't work: an intervention with at least one SMS level",
