    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{14661=At each junction of an upper shelf 13 or 14 with an end-panel member or 11 there are provided preferably two assemblies 1616. Referring particularly to Figures 6-10, each assembly 16 includes a latch 39 and a leaf spring detent 40 on the end panel member and a keeper .41 on the upper shelf member. The latch 39 preferably is a sheet metal stamping provided with a rectangular base 42 seated against the inwardly presenting surface of the end panel member and with a pair of integral upwardly extending generally rectangular arms 4343 disposed on opposite-sides of the base 42 and spaced from the base 42 and the end panel member. It will beobserved that the upper end portions of the arms 43-43 are tapered, as by cuts 44-44. The leaf spring 40 is provided with a base 45 adapted to overlie the base 42 of the latch 39 and with an integral portion 46 extending laterally from the lower end of the base 45 and then upwardly alongside the latch 39, the upper end of the portion 46 being provided with a hook 47 and a curved lip 48. The latch 39 and leaf spring 40 are secured to the end panel member by wood screws 49-49 projected through alined apertures in the base 42 of the latch 39 and the base 45 of the leaf spring 40., 7433=March 31, 1959 R, D, 7473=KNOCKDOWN COUNTER CONSTRUCTION Filed Oct. 5, 195, 19492=Since the arms 2929 of the part 25 of a lower shelf fitting when fully projected into the associated aperture 38 fit snugly therein so that no appreciable movement is permitted, provision must be made for facilitating the entrance of the arms 29--29 into the aperture 38 when the counter is assembled, particularly since a pair of assemblies 15 is provided at each end of the shelf. For this purpose the arms 2929 are tapered preferably as aforementioned to provide upper end portions of reduced width adapted to serve as pilots, only the lower end portions of the arms 2929 being of such width that the oppositely facing edges thereof will respectively abut the portions 37 of the keeper 27 and the end panel membet. Similarly, since the arms 43-43 of the latch 39 of an upper shelf member when fully projected into the associated slot 50 fit snugly therein so that no movement is permitted between the opposed edges of the slot 50 as aforementioned, provision must be made for facilitating the entrance of the arms 43-43 into the slot 50 when the counter is assembled, particularly since a pair of assemblies 16 is provided at each end of the shelf. For this purpose the arms 43-43 are tapered preferably as aforementioned to provide upper end portions of reduced width adapted to serve as pilots, only the lower end portions of the arms 43-43 being of such width that the oppositely facing edges thereof will respectively abut the opposed edges of the slot 50.}",
