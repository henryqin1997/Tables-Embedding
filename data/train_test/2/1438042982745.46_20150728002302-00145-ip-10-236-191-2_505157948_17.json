Intel provides technical support and warranty services for these processors. One way to identify the boxed mobile product is by a \"BX\" in the order code. OEM order code: Also known as the tray order code, refers to processors sold directly to system manufacturers who integrate the processors in their laptops. These manufacturers provide technical support and warranty services directly to the customer. This article describes Intel\u00ae Pentium\u00ae Processor for Mobile order codes, and provides a list of products and their corresponding order code.
