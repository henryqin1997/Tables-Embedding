Both teams are facing lefties and the Brewers specifically CRUSH LHP. If you are looking for a sneaky stack I would ride the hot hand of the Seattle Mariners once again tonight as they have been on fire over their last 7 games (.295 BA & .375 wOBA) Anyways, tonight I am using the momentum that I have built up the last few days in buying some cheaper pitchers on multi pitching sites. I like Jesse Chavez, Matt Shoemaker and Tyson Ross tonight as value options. You will also notice that I am using some of the same players that have allowed me to cash over $4400 this week alone. Jonathan Lucroy, Rickie Weeks, Brad Miller and Lucas Duda are all featured in then Playbook tonight. Also tonight I am EXTREMELY pleased to announce the Oracle himself, Ray Flowers has signed up to play in the $2 Moonshot over on DraftKings. Click on any of the links to sign up and compete against him (and me!) in this great contest. Best of all is that if and when you beat him, you can Tweet him (@BaseballGuys) and tell him that you are the Oracle now. He'll love it...trust me! Happy Friday one and all!! As we know, Friday's are HUGE night's",
