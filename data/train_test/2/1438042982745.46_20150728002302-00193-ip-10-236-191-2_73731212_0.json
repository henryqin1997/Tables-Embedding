In the table, ORACLE_HOME refers to the Oracle Management Service home directory in which the Oracle Management Service is installed and deployed. Figure 18-1 Directory Structure in the Management Service Home Figure 18-1 shows some of the important directories you should be familiar with in a typical Grid Control installation. You can use this information as you begin to maintain, troubleshoot, and configure the Oracle Management Service installation. Summary of the Important Directories in the Oracle Management Service Home The Oracle Management Agent is installed in a separate Oracle home directory which is at the same level as the Fusion Middleware home directory. In addition to the Oracle Management Service home directory, the installation procedure installs the Oracle Management Agent that is used to gather management data and perform administration tasks for the targets on the Oracle Management Service host. About the Oracle Management Agent Home (AGENT_HOME) Directory Information about the directories that are specific to the Fusion Middleware installation can be found in the Fusion Middleware documentation.

    "textAfterTable": "Understanding the Enterprise Manager Directories Installed with the Management Agent The Oracle Management Agent is installed automatically when you install Oracle Management Service. This local instance of the Oracle Management Agent gathers management information about the targets on the Oracle Management Service host. You can then manage those targets, such as the host itself, from the Grid Control Console. You can install additional Oracle Management Agents using different installation methods. This enables you to install the Oracle Management Agent on the hosts throughout your enterprise. The Oracle Management Agent can then gather management data about the targets on each host so those targets can be managed from the Grid Control Console. When you select the Additional Oracle Management Agent installation type, you install only the files required to run the Oracle Management Agent. Specifically, the Oracle Management Agent files are installed into the same directory structure shown in the agent directory when you install the Oracle Management Service (Figure 18-1). The directory that contains the files required to run the Oracle Management Agent is referred to as the AGENT_HOME directory. For example, to start or stop an Oracle Management Agent, you use the emctl command located in the bin directory of the AGENT_HOME. Similarly, to configure the log files for the Oracle Management Agent, you modify the configuration files in the sysman/config directory of",
