For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and/or steps which perform substantially the same function, in substantially the same way, to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention. Substitutions of elements from one described embodiment to another are also fully intended and contemplated. It is also to be understood that the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale, but that they are merely conceptual in nature. It is the intention, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the claims appended hereto. Further, it is know in the art that any analogue signals can be converted to digital signals before transmission and converted back to analogue signals, if necessary, for display and analysis. In a further embodiment, the sensor data can be compressed prior to transmitting the sensor data 104 (step 316) and then it can be decompressed prior to the displaying the sensor data 104 (step 318). Compressing the sensor data 104 can assist in",
