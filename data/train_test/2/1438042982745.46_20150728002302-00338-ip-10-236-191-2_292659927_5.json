    "textAfterTable": "10(hardest) scratches all common materials 1. Your task is to determine the relative hardness on the Mohs\u0092 scale of two everyday objects\u0097a penny and a steel pocketknife. You also have samples of gypsum, fluorite, and quartz. By experimentation, you determine the following: The penny scratches gypsum, but it doesn\u0092t scratch quartz, fluorite, or the knife blade. The knife scratches gypsum, fluorite, and the penny, but it doesn\u0092t scratch quartz. What is the hardness of the penny? What range of Mohs\u0092 values can the knife blade have? ANS: The penny has a hardness of 3. The knife has a hardness of either 5 or 6. 2.\u00a0 Discuss the unique characteristic of silica that is represented in the diagram below. ANS: One silicon attaches to four oxygen atoms to form one tetrahedron. A tetrahedron has the ability to share oxygen atoms with other tetrahedron molecules. This structure allows elements to combine chemically and structurally in a vast number of ways and accounts for the diversity in silicates. As shown in the diagram, silica tetrahedra can form single chains, double chains, or a tetrahedral sheet. \u00a02. Which is a more reliable method of identifying a mineral\u0096streak or color? Explain. ANS: Streak; a mineral\u0092s streak rarely changes, even if it is weathered or its external color varies slightly.",
