Personally, I love FDU and everything they offer, but the college is definitely pricey- more for some than others. Some find it cheaper than a state school. It really does depend on whether you are a New Jersey resident or not and what you can academically qualify for. So try to keep your grades up high your senior year of high school! A high SAT score (Math & Verbal are the only ones FDU considers- a score of 1050 or higher) and at least a 3.0 GPA, and you can qualify for a good scholarship. However, as others have mentioned scholarships and awards are consistent and you can work out a payment plan so that you are paying at a rate that is right for you., 154557=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

Bang for the buck While the tuition goes up every year, the scholarships and financial aid are good and consistent. Am enjoying being here There are tons of activities on campus for all types of interests. Am learning a lot I have not had a large class since i started. The classes close at 30 students so each student gets the attention they need. Most of the professors have real world experience about what they are teaching.
