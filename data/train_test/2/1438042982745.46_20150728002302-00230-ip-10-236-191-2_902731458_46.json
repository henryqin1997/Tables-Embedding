However, make sure to apply before the priority deadline, usually in early December. Look up additional scholarships on the website., 43041=It is best to apply early to the University, usually before their priority deadline in mid December. Your application will be viewed early and as a result given a better chance to be accepted into your college of choice and potential for University scholarships. After choosing to attend to the U of M, it is definitely worth it to live in the dorms for the first year. In the dorms, you have the opportunity to meet alot of people while getting adjusted to campus life. Also, don't worry if you are nervous. Everyone else is in the same boat you are. Just be yourself and be open to new things. It is definitely beneficial to go to class. It may be tempting to just skip some classes, but you will likely find that you will miss more material that you imagined. Also, don't be afraid to meet your professors. They actually like to get to know their students and it can come in handy later when you need a reference or letter of recommendation. Finally, get involved! You will have fun doing something you like while also meeting people. These people may become great friends later on or lead you to someone who can help you down the road in life., 147194=I can't think of a single student who found the academic rigor at the U of M to be lacking. Some courses will naturally be easier than others (especially 1000-level ones); however, those will be worth fewer credit hours in order to reflect that. Also worth iterating is the fact that the common misconception of science and math classes being more difficult is not necessarily true here; as a foreign language major, I can attest to the fact that As are not just handed out willy-nilly. All subject areas require work; there are no easy majors\u00e2??., 999561=The University of Minnesota is a very good school, it is ranked one of the top 10 research universities when I started attending in 2005. The classes are quite large and so you would need to develop a very healthy studying schedule to keep up with course work. That or you can visit the professors during office hours., 36546=The class content depends a bit on what the class is. Especially for first-year classes (1000 level), there are the joke classes that only require a bit of realizing what the professor wants. Good news (maybe...?), however, is that this changes a lot with higher level courses (starting even with the 2000 level ones). All of my professors so far do know their material; when signing up for classes during orientation, try to get into more advanced classes and to pick professors that have won the Morse Award or some other designation. All of that said, what someone learns depends mostly on that person's effort put into the class., 413694=On the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus we have the Weisman Art Museum. This building stands out from any other building on campus because of its postmodern architecture. It was just reopened in the fall of 2011 after it underwent a major expansion project. The museum now has many more works of art on display than it ever had before., 929488=I'd definitely give the University a 9.5 out of 10. I've actually been living here since the beginning of June and honestly I feel welcomed everyday I'm here. The University of Minnesota is full of fun, energetic, and friendly people that make up the rate 9.5, 347397=just a warning: the light rail won't be done until 2015 which blocks off all of washington ave., 770830=There's lots of cheap dates. There's a telescope on the physics building that is free to use after 8 o'clock and they show free movies in one of the buildings before the movies come out on video., 1062419=There are crime alerts that go on and it is very convenient that the university will text you on your phone and email you. Also you can call someone walk with you at night if you feel unsafe, you just call an escort. In addition there is the Gopher Chauffeur that takes calls till 2:00 AM., 929067=If you want to get into the University of Minnesota feel proud. The U of MN had 43,000 applicants for the incoming class of 2017, and only 5500 applicants were accepted. Definitely take your application seriously and meet every deadline.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here Right between St. Paul and Minneapolis, there is always stuff to do, people to meet, and you will always, always have something new to do every weekend. The sports scene is amazing if you love sports, and the night life is pretty epic, too! I can't tell you enough how much I love the cities, and how campus feels comfortable and safe, but has so many big-city things to see and do! Am learning a lot It is a huge change from high school, in my opinion, when it comes to how much you learn. College is more, you learn as much as you want, depending on how much time and effort you put into the class, but the professors all seem to want students to take the most out of your classes. In a huge school it is so easy to find a million opportunities, being able to take courses not offered at smaller schools, which gives you the best learning experience.
