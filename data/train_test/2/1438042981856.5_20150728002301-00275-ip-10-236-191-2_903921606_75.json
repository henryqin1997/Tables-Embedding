            "This is the one thing they have trouble keeping up with. Everywhere you go there are cops. Plain clothes, unmarked cars, marked cars, bicycles. Everything. However, at night time things can be dangerous if you don't know where your at. I personally had my bicycle stolen the first 24 hours I was here. This being said, that is all most of these crooks will do. They aren't smart enough to steal a car and they aren't dumb enough to hurt someone. They want to make a buck and your bicycle is top pick. I currently have 2 locks on my bicycle and keep it indoors at all times.",
            "The frat house across the street from me contain the nicest frat guys I have ever met in my life. I was walking down the street, they asked me if I had ever been to their house, and then they gave me a tour. The Greek life on campus is slim.. But a mile down the road in Greektown inside Downtown, doesn't get better than that.",
            "Clubs are few and far between. There is at least one club I know of that is safe to go to and is very student friendly. There are two clubs in downtown which you should not attend unless you are a frequent flyer there. Activities, however are plentiful. Many, many, club sports, co-op sports, late night study halls have activities, free yoga classes, free boot camp classes, and of course every Lions, Tigers, and Red Wings game is less than 2 miles away!",
            "This college is great for students who don;t mind living at home with their parents to save money on housing costs. Also, to me, it is great for the students who love to go out and explore the unknown. If you are from the metro-Detroit area, Detroit is your unknown. Now is the time to explore how cool this place really is.",
            "Since I have only been here about a month, I am not aware of any unusual locations on campus. But, Detroit has a whole host of unusual locations.",
            "This college is THE college to go to for bang for your buck. It gives very similar learning quality, smaller class sizes and less tuition costs than similar 4 year universities.",
            "Detroit is a great place to have a good time, especially if your claustrophobic. The bars here are often filled with young educated people. Midtown has several breweries and more bars than I can count. The best bars are always the hidden ones that no one knows about. Downtown Detroit has a few places to go, but don't judge a book by it's cover, there are a lot of good things happening there. The students of WSU are always active within the community and if you can't find something to do, it is simply because you didn't look hard enough.",
            "Wayne State University opened up a vegetarian on-campus diner. This goes to show they are keeping up with the times. They try to use local and/or organic food here as well. Many universities do not give these kind of options and even if they do, what is the chance you are going to go there and find someone you know? Here at WSU you are always finding your friends which makes every situation better.",
            "Wayne State University is mainly a commuter college. However, There are a few dorms on-campus and some student housing off-campus which I am currently living in. This is by far my most favorite part about this being mainly a commuter school, is you get to know everyone around you. At the end of the day, when everyone drove an hour in traffic back to the suburbs, you get to have the city to yourself. The nightlife around campus and in midtown is great.",
            "This is my first semester as an Undergraduate here at Wayne State so I could not tell you confidently how tough classes are.",
            "Prospective students need to jump through a lot less hoops than other similar 4-year Universities such as MSU or U of M. This doesn't mean its easy though, stay on top of your paper work and make sure you meet the deadlines. Come and take tours of Detroit and especially Midtown. Judging Detroit by 8 mile road is like judging a book by it's cover, it does no justice to the magnificence of the city.",
            "Wayne State University is a college for those who know they need a great education as well as realizing they have a budget to follow. This school is well known throughout Michigan and even throughout the country. If I had to choose one thing I like best about WSU so far, it would be the relatively small class sizes."

Overall I have been blessed to receive the OMLP Award for most of my time in the program. This is awarded by GM and gives you $500-$2000 toward tuition as long as your academic scores are maintained., 733193=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 174926=There are many organizations for students of all ethnic backgrounds. They have a day in September when all of the different clubs display and share their traditions and cultures., 140714=At Wayne State University, there are a few fun things that you can become accustomed to like the large rock in the center of campus where different groups spray paint their advertisement on them. Many of the groups that advertise their events are the sororities and fraternities, but some of the other events come from the groups of students from different majors of different interests. On campus, there are also a few hang-outs like on the second floor of the Undergraduate Library or the Student Center. Another thing that WSU is known for providing are the events where students can be shuttled on our own bus system to different cultural areas of Detroit where they can learn different types of dances, eat at a new restaurant, walk around the open fresh food market, attend a professional sports game, hear a Tchaikovsky concert from a full orchestra, or attend a concert from someone like Bruno Mars who performed on campus in 2011., 136272=One of the largest things that people look for in their campus and one of the largest things that would surprise people about Wayne State University are their Safety systems. Our WSU Police Department was formed in 1966 and each officer is fully licensed through the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards And they are seen all over campus and in the surrounding areas in patrol cars, on bikes, on foot and with K-9 units. Along with that, the students becoming Police Officers at Wayne State also patrol the entire campus and through every building in uniform providing an extra watch. Our parking structures especially, are fully protected by surveillance and guards. And access to almost every location requires a photo ID WSU card where each one has only a specific security level, with fewer being able to get into some buildings based on necessity like dorms, and fewer still for areas where valuables are stored like each dorm room or offices or music and art rooms. Beyond that, we employ a blue light system with individual telefone devices with a blue flashing light on top that turn on with the simple press of a button from anyone in trouble on campus. There are over 300 units and it is guaranteed that a WSU Police Officer can be at any location in under 90 seconds. Additionally, our WSU P.O. Headquarters can be contacted on or just off campus so that you can be escorted by an officer to where you are going, like a parking structure later at night., 59749=I lived on campus in DeRoy apartments in the Winter of 2011. I liked being able to go to class and have time to go back to my apartment in between classes. Most people commute to Wayne, but I personally like living there. The campus dorms require you to have a meal plan. If you live in the campus apartments, then meal plans are optional. I choose to make my own food, but having the option is nice.}",

If you enjoy the campus feel and a university setting this is a great school for you. Tips for prospective students While in high school prepare yourself by taking harder classes that will provide you with an advantage in college. Don't depend solely on your teacher's, take the initiative to find learning/studying methods that are influential to you. Bang for the buck Wayne",
