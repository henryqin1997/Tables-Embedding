    "textBeforeTable": "Discussion Schedule Given the level of enrollment, and the limited number of weeks for presentation, at least some students will have to present in pairs. Presentation partners should consist of graduate/undergraduate pairs; NO undergrad/undergrad or grad/grad pairs. Talk to Margaret if you would like to present with a partner and you aren't sure how to secure one. PRESENTATIONS: Every student will be expected to present an analysis of a news article to the rest of the group at least once. Students should pick an article, read it, then investigate the background of the story in the primary scientific literature. Read the technical paper that prompted the story, at least. Reconsider all issues listed above; your presentation should address how good a job the reporter did achieving accuracy, balance, and clarity. Your presentation should also address what the scientist did, or could have done, to increase the chances that the reporter would produce an accurate, clear, engaging story. Newsworthiness: why did the reporter decide to focus on this story? Why did the editor run it? How likely it that the information presented will change policy/technology/behavior/the world? Clarity: how hard is it to understand the article? Pretend to be your grandmother while thinking about this one! Balance: does the reporter consider alternative explanations? Are experts from all sides of an issue interviewed and quoted? Evidence: is there sufficient evidence presented for you to believe the conclusions drawn by the reporter?",

Students may consider leading a discussion on materials in the list below; if you wish to use one of these, get approval from Margaret first.
