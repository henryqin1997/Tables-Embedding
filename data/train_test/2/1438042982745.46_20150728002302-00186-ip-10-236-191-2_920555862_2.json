See http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/redmond/ for information about our destination. Participants will travel from Vancouver, BC, to Seattle, WA, on Saturday, August 16; departure is Saturday morning with return in the evening . All expenses will be covered as part of the workshop participation. Attendance will be optional, but non-U.S. citizens should be sure they have the proper visas for travel to and from the United States., 14053=References: 1. F. Bornemann, P. Deuflhard, A.
