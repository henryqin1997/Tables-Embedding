Many insiders, however, think Ferrari would be reluctant to pair him with clear number 1 Fernando Alonso next year. In fact, the Spaniard said 24 hours ago that he would prefer to keep Felipe Massa alongside him, as the Brazilian had beaten Raikkonen in 2008 and 2009. \u201cIt is his opinion,\u201d Raikkonen responded, \u201cand everyone has the freedom to say what they want.
