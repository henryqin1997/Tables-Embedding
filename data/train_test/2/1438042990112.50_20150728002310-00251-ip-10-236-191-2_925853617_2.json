Transmitter & Antenna location: On top of a hill, Sutro tower, or rall building? Benefit: Larger coverage area, more listeners. At Noisebridge facility: Benefit: Low cost. Disadvanages: Fewer listeners because smaller coverage are due to signal being blocked by local hills & buildings. Studio options: Turning the DJ booth into an actual real live DJ booth. Having the station out in the open to allow a for a more decentralized radio transmitter. Could cause problems if tampered with. It may be in our best interest to use the DJ booth.
