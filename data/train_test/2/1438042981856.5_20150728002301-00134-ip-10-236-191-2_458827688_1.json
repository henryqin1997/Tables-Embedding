    "textBeforeTable": "Below are our partitioning recommendations in table form. For GPT-based partitions, use the GPT Block Device and GPT Code columns with gdisk. For legacy MBR-based partitions, use the MBR Block Device and MBR code columns with fdisk: Partitioning Recommendations In all other respects, the partition table is similar to that which you might create for an MBR-based disk during a Gentoo Linux installation. We have a boot and a root partition with code 0700, and a Linux swap partition with code 8200. If you have installed Gentoo Linux before, the one thing that is likely new to you here is the GRUB boot loader partition, which is listed as \"BIOS boot partition\" within gdisk. This partition is required for GRUB 2 to boot GPT/GUID boot disks. What is it? In GRUB-speak, this partition is essentially the location of the meat of GRUB's boot loading code. If you've used GRUB Legacy in the past, this partition is where the new GRUB stores the equivalent of the stage1_5 and stage2 files in legacy GRUB. Since GPT-based partition tables have less dead space at the beginning of the disk than their MBR equivalents, an explicitly defined partition of code EF02 is required to hold the guts of the boot loader. For Previous fdisk users /dev/sda4, which will hold your root filesystem. /dev/sda3, which will be used for swap space, and /dev/sda2, which will be used directly by the new GRUB,",
    "textAfterTable": "Creating filesystems Before your newly-created partitions can be used, the block devices need to be initialized with filesystem metadata. This process is known as creating a filesystem on the block devices. After filesystems are created on the block devices, they can be mounted and used to store files. You will not create a filesystem on your swap partition, but will initialize it using the mkswap command so that it can be used as disk-based virtual memory. Then we'll run the swapon command to make your newly-initialized swap space active within the live CD environment, in case it is needed during the rest of the install process. Note that we will not create a filesystem on the GRUB boot loader partition, as GRUB writes binary data directly to that partition when the boot loader is installed, which we'll do later. You can see the commands you will need to type below. Like the rest of this document, it assumes that you are using a GPT partitioning scheme. If you are using MBR, your root filesystem will likely be created on /dev/sda3 instead and you will need to adjust the target block devices. If you are following our recommendations, then simply do this: We generally recommend XFS for root filesystems, although ext4 is also a good choice. This tutorial assumes the use of XFS. If you want to use ext4, then be sure that your /etc/fstab file reflects this.",
