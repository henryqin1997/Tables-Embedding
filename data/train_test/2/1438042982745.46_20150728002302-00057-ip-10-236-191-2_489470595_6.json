    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the invention has been described by reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it is not to be limited thereby and is to be limited only by the appended claims. The present invention is useful for tapping both single mode and multimode fiber, including both step index and graded index, and is usable with both glass-on-glass and plastic clad silica fiber. According to a presently preferred embodiment, the invention includes the use of glass-on-glass fiber including a polymeric coating (e.g. buffer), the coating preferably having an index of refraction higher than the cladding. Examples include an acrylate or silicone buffer, and/or any thin additional layers (e.g. jackets) surrounding the buffer layer Typical preferred glass-on-glass fibers include single mode fibers having a core diameter of about 10 microns, and a cladding diameter of about 125 microns, and a buffer diameter in a range between about 250-500 microns, with multimode glass-on-glass fiber including a core/cladding diameter of roughly 50/125 microns, 100/140 microns, and 85/125 microns, for example. Preferred fibers include those having cylindrical cores, cylindrical claddings and cylindrical coatings (e.g. buffers and/or jackets). Preferably, at least the buffer layer is maintained intact so as not to detrimentally degrade the strength of the fiber by exposing a glass surface thereof to moisture. According to the present invention, the light is withdrawn from the read optical fiber 91 in a serial manner by using a plurality of read taps disposed",
