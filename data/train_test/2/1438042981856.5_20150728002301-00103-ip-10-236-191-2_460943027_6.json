The formation of pseudoboehmite, a metastable aluminum hydroxyoxide, by the reaction of aluminum or aluminum oxide with liquid water in air is discussed by Vedder and Vermiyea, Trans. Faraday Soc. 65, 561-584 (1969) and Alwitt, J. Electrochemical Soc. 118 (11), 1730 (1971). The pseudoboehmite can be identified in the bonded coatings of the invention by electron microscopy which shows that the crystals which form the matrix around the deposited particulate material have the characteristic lamellar shape., 28232=The oxidizing environment to which the particulate material coated aluminum substrate is exposed to obtain the in situ formation of aluminum hydroxyoxide may be a water bath, although preferably it is an atmosphere obtained by admitting steam into an open vessel. Closed vessels containing steam and air at pressures ranging from atmospheric to pressures of 100 psi or more may also be used. By regulation of the quantity and pressure of steam introduced into the vessel, temperatures from about 50\ufffd to about 150\ufffd C. suitable for causing the formation of the bonding aluminum hydroxyoxide crystallites may be obtained. The ratio of steam to air is not critical, a suitable range being between about 1:20 to 20:1 parts of air per part of steam., 10174=This is a division of application Ser.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes Similar photocatalytic plates useful for the preparation of lithographic printing plates are obtained when the titanium dioxide is replaced by cerium oxide, zinc oxide, or bismuth titanate. The plate obtained is useful as a lithographic printing plate. When this treated surface is contacted with water and then with a lithographic ink, the ink adheres only to the copper areas and not to the hydrophilic background areas. The ink image can then be transferred to a receptor sheet such as paper. Particulate titanium dioxide was bonded to an aluminum sheet as described in Example 1. The surface of the bonded layer was swabbed with a 3% solution of palladium chloride in iso-propyl alcohol and dried. The dried sheet was then exposed through a photographic negative to ultraviolet radiation for about 45 seconds, washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and dipped into a commercial electroless copper plating bath. Copper deposited imagewise in the exposed areas, i.e., in those areas where the palladium chloride had been photocatalytically reduced under the influence of ultraviolet radiation by the titanium dioxide. This example illustrates the photocatalytic character of aluminum surfaces having certain particulate materials bonded thereto in accordance with the technique of the invention. EXAMPLE 91 Imagewise exposure of the coated aluminum plates through a litho negative, followed by development with a propanol-water solution gives blue oleophilic images on the hydrophilic surface of the plate. A press run shows this",
