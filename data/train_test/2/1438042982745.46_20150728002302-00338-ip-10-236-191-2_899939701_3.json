Food and Dining there is a student lounge. there is also vending machines, and a mobile lunch truck comes on campus as well. they also offer special meals once a month. Dorm Life no dorms Academic Rigor very broad academic rigor Tips for prospective students don't be afraid to ask questions. study up on financial aid you may need because richmond community does not offer student loans. i really wish they did. In three sentences teachers are amazing! i recommend this school for anyone seeking more involved teachers. the schedules are very flexible, with many class options.
