You can take as many credit hours as you desire, so you yourself can determine how much you pay. There is also great financial aid available that makes it even easier to go to school here. Am enjoying being here I love the friendly feel of Jefferson Community and Technical College campus in Shelbyville. Students come from all walks of life and are willing to talk to people whom they have never met. The professors want to help as much as possible and are willing to work with you inside and outside of class in order to do what it takes to get you through the class with growth and satisfaction. Because of the size of the campus, you see people you know every day, inside and outside of the classroom. Am learning a lot Jefferson Community and Technical College has specified programs between its many campuses, with differing classes at different campuses so that you can find classes that interest you and fit in with your major.
