A year later, and many international tests this is certain: with this 4-batten miracle, designer Kai Hopf achieved a touch down. No matter who got his hands on the HERO no one wanted to give it back. For 2013 it has now been refined again and progressed to become the irreplaceable favorite sail of super hero Victor Fernandez. He does not want to sail with any other sail anymore - it just fits perfectly to his sailing style and the new multi-fin wave boards!}",

Regardless of under- or properly powered up, too much pressure or too little, this sail always generates power without becoming unstable. Despite a further draft back position it doesn\u2019t become back handy, even when overpowered. This let\u2019s you imagine, how much the wind range has improved compared to previous 4 batten sails! The low weight makes for incredible handling. While rigging you can already imagine how light and soft the sail feels. The rotation is as smooth as silk, even with minimal outhaul tension.
