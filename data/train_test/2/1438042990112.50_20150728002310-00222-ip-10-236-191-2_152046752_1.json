We're just happy the bats got to us. We were a little nervous for a second.\" The selections snapped the Brewers' three-year streak of picking pitchers in the first round. They took Taylor Jungmann and Jed Bradley in 2011, Dylan Covey in '10 (he did not sign) and Eric Arnett in '09. \"This goes in cycles sometimes.
