Although the invention has been described as used in a specific printer, it will be understood that the invention may be practiced in other printers having either different stepper motor or print head characteristics. The stepper motor need not advance the record medium in minimum increments of R2 =1/150 inch nor does the print head have to print pixels with center-to-center spacings of R1 =1/300 inch. All that is required is that R1 and R2 be such that there are two integer k1 and k2 whereby k1 R1 +k2 R2 =PR1 where P is the number of active print elements during a line scan. The print head may have 1, 2 or more columns of print elements addressable in any sequence so long as they produce a uniform pixel spacing of R1. The print head must have at least P+X print elements where X is equal to or greater than k1. The print elements need not be ink jet nozzles but may comprise other types of elements for printing pixels. As stated above, fifty nozzles are active on any given line scan but all nozzles may not be used for printing. A different number of nozzles may be used for printing on different line scans. A useful sequence is to use 37 nozzles for printing on the first and alternate cycles",
