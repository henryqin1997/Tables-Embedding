            "Located close to the lower end of Manchester, but not in, the school is extremely safe. The security guards are friendly and funny, always willing to have a quick chat or walk you to your car at night. I have never had to worry about my safety at this school, which is nice after transferring from a Boston school.",
            "Even though the school is small and students come and go, there is always something going on to greet you, introduce you to another student or add to your day. Including lots of free food. What college student doesn't love that? Meanwhile, clubs are small and meaningful and focus on the local community or common/obscure interests.",
            "This school is for everybody, students are warmly received whether they are freshmen, transfer students, veterans or middle aged adults. There is opportunity to be found here.",
            "Expect to see some students and deaf teachers conversing in sign language in the hallways! The ASL program is great!",
            "You receive a university degree and education for half the price. Its not just the price, its also the quality of the professors and classes in a small personal setting.",
            "Elm Street is located 2 blocks away, full of shops, restaurants and bars to meet your interests. The Red Arrow, a 24 hour diner featured on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives, is 3 blocks away and absolutely amazing! Great for a quick lunch or dinner in-between classes, or a meet up spot with friends.",
            "A small sandwich shop is located on site providing cheap, delicious and quality food. But a short walk to Elm Street can fulfill whatever your heart desires.",
            "The Manchester campus is purely a commuter campus, however there are a few growing housing options with another nearby college, and lots of apartments to be found in Manchester.",
            "Professors are knowledgeable and passionate about their field, and they expect you to return the effort that they put into their classes. Classes are focused on furthering your success in your career and extremely relevant.",
            "The University of New Hampshire at Manchester is an exceptional institution dedicated on delivering the greatest education possible to its students through highly competent, motivated instructors, and a welcoming, kind student body. It provides a unique and enjoyable experience, while intellectually and personally expanding the minds of its students. It is without question, a highly commendable and recommended college."

    "textAfterTable": "Campus Safety There is Campus Security that will walk you to your car late at night if need be. They are very nice and very cooperative. Bang for the buck UNH Manchester is different than most schools simply because it is a commuter school. This means that such things as meal plans are not necessary, and make it more affordable to go to school here. What to do for fun Elm Street is very close to UNH Manchester, and has many shops and restaurants. Food and Dining There is a great little restaurant downstairs, and many local places downtown. Dorm Life There are no dorms at UNH Manchester. Academic Rigor UNH at Manchester is very good about getting you what you need for your major. The professors are also very good about answering any questions regarding classes if there are any issues or questions. Tips for prospective students Take advantage of the free tutoring!
