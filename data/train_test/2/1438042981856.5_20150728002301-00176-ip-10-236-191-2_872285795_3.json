The group says there's a Dutch fan who's been holding onto \"The High Numbers at the Railway Hotel\" since 1964. In other words, if it's in your closet, attic, basement or storage facility it's probably of interest to the band. Better yet, The Who says it will include the best and most interesting of all the items in its forthcoming anniversary releases, crediting the fans who offered the items and giving each fan two VIP tickets to a show on its upcoming tour., 5331=At a press conference back in June, The Who spoke of the upcoming tour as \"the beginning of the long goodbye,\" saying the band will stop touring before they stop playing as a band., 4208=Though these hard rockers originally started out with Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle and Keith Moon, it's been the former two that have kept the band going (after the passing of both Entwistle and Moon). Widespread recognition came with their third album, \"The Who Sell Out,\" in 1967. \"Happy Jack\" was released as a single; \"I Can See For Miles,\" came next, and their fame grew with performances at various music festivals, including Woodstock. Eventually, the 1969 release of \"Tommy\" was their first in a series of seven top ten albums in the US., 5851=How do you reach The Who? Fans with extraordinary items can email the group at thewho@umusic.com. The Who is scheduled to put out a greatest hits collection, \"The Who Hit's 50!\" on October 28, 2014, as well as prepping for a Who Hits 50! Tour that will send them through arenas in the U.K. this fall and in North America throughout 2015. The band will also mark its golden anniversary with releases and events designed to \"commemorate the group's cultural impact\" around the world., 2570=Update 6/19/15 To make up for the several May shows they were forced to reschedule, The Who has added an additional date to their 50th anniversary farewell tour. It will take place in Denver, CO, at the Pepsi Center on December 10. Tickets go on sale June 26 at 10am. Updated dates below. Update 6/5/15\u2026, 3587=Would you believe The Who is still one of the top acts in the music business? In February 2010 they performed the halftime show of Super Bowl XLIV. A month later came a stop at Royal Albert Hall, and by the fall they had announced the release of the Fortieth Anniversary Super-Deluxe Collectors' Edition of their \"Live at the Leeds\" album. Then came 2012, a 35-date tour and a chance to perform at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.}",
