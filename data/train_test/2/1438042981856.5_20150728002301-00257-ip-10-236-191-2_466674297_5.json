Those skilled in the art will further understand that the relative positioning of the stapling mechanisms and the position adjusting mechanisms to each other may be reversed, placing the stapling mechanisms in a distal-most position in relation to the position adjusting mechanism. The above described embodiments are for purposes of illustration only and the various modifications of these embodiments which will be apparent are considered to be within the scope of the teachings of this invention which is to be limited only by the claims appended hereto. The user could then look through the walls of the endoscope lumen 52 into the proximal housing 12 to, for example, observe whether each of the plurality of staple drivers 472 have been actuated. In addition, the user may also observe whether the wedge 402 shown in FIGS. 10a and 10b is locked into the blade portion 420 as described above. Alternatively, selected portions of the proximal housing 12 may be composed of the clear plastic-type material providing a \"window\" to view through the proximal housing 12.
