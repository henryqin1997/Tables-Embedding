The output of the optical encoder 31 serves as the reference frequency to which the cylindrical transparent body 6 is the \"slave\". Thus, low frequency torque disturbances on the drum 4 are tracked by the body 6, and high frequencies are damped by the inertia of the loop and motors. The system comprising the drum 4, the body 6, the motors 5 and 9, and the coupling circuit 10 is stiff enough so that torque disturbances of several ounces in the tape disturb the tape position by less than the image resolution. In the illustrative embodiment of the coupling circuit 10, the reference frequency signal fo is, for example, a 1000 Hz signal and the optical encoders 31 and 32 are 16-bit encoders generating 216 or 65,536 pulses/revolution. The phase detectors 33 and 34, the filters 35 and 36, the amplifiers 37 and 38, and the converters 39 and 40 may be selected from conventional and commercially available components., 24452=Up to a few years ago, wire-bonding was the most commonly used method for making connections from an integrated circuit (IC) chip to the outside world. An alternative to wire-bonding consists of using a tape carrier, similar to a movie film, having lead frames formed along its surface. In this film-carrier approach, usually a polyimide film carries a copper lead pattern that repeats itself along the length of the film. The finger-like leads of an individual site on the film are bonded simultaneously to the pads of an IC chip, as for example, described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,689,991 to A. D. Aird, issued Sept. 12, 1972, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,968,563 to A. H. Hamlin, issued July 13, 1976., 47435=A still further illustrative embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIG. 8 wherein the photosensitive tape 1 and the predetermined pattern 8 to be projected are driven by the same motor. This illustrative embodiment is useful when single or double sided exposure of the tape is needed. The photosensitive tape 1 and the predetermined pattern 8 are mounted on the same cylindrical transparent drum 81. The drum is rotated at a constant speed by means of a motor 82 having its shaft 83 coupled by means of two end plates 84 and 85 to the cylindrical drum 81. A source of light 12, similar to the one described in connection with the other embodiments, generates radiations that are directed inside the cylindrical drum 81 by means of lenses 86 and 87. A mirror 88 is positioned within the drum 81 for directing the radiations from lens 87 onto the pattern 8. In order to project an image of the pattern onto the photosensitive tape 1, an optical system comprising a plane mirror 89, a 1:1 lens 90 and a roof mirror 91 is optically coupled between the pattern 8 and the photosensitive tape 1. Since both tape 1 and pattern 8 are driven by the same motor 82, there is no need for phase-locked loops of the type described above. Furthermore, by using a cylindrical drum 81 having in its longitudinal direction a first cylindrical surface of diameter D1 and the second cylindrical surface of diameter D2 for respectively carrying the pattern 8 and the tape 1, magnifications given by: ##EQU2## are implemented. As described in connection with the other embodiments, the pattern 8 may be formed according to the above-described methods., 34126=Shown in FIG. 2 is an enlarged portion of the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 1, including the structural details of the optical system 11. By way of background, a known one-to-one imaging optical system is described in an article by J. Dyson entitled \"Unit Magnification Optical System without Seidel Aberrations,\" published in Journal of the Optical Society of America, Volume 49, No. 7, July 1959, pages 713-716. This known Dyson system consists of two components, namely, a concave spherical mirror of radius R, and a thick plano-convex lens of radius r, index n and thickness equal to r. The centers of curvature of both spherical surfaces are substantially coincident, and r is chosen so that parallel rays incident on the plano surface are focused on the mirror surface, i.e., ##EQU1## In this known system, object and image surfaces lie on or close to the plane face of the lens, and object and image are of opposite directions., 25161=These two known processes make use of a thin strip of a continuous electrically insulating tape having a plurality of prepunched apertures at regularly spaced intervals. A thin foil-like strip or layer of electrically conducting material is secured to the tape. By photolithographic masking and etching, portions of the layer are removed to form a plurality of sets of metallic finger-like leads. This subtractive technique, used to form the finger-like leads, is described in an article by S. E. Grossman entitled \"Film-carrier Technique Automates the Packaging of IC Chips\" in Electronics, May 16, 1974, pages 89-95. According to this article, the technique consists in first bonding a 1-ounce copper foil to a polyimide film by means of an adhesive. Photoresist techniques form the image of the desired lead frame in a step-and-repeat fashion along the film-mounted copper laminate. This step-and-repeat projection requires indexing, settling and alignment, all of which are time-consuming and expensive operations. Moreover, such a projection technique is difficult if long lengths of tapes are needed since accelerations associated with high speed indexing are damaging to the fragile tape. Furthermore, the high price-per-pound of the polyimide carrier increases the cost per site of such a tape especially when small quantities of custom tapes are needed.}",

Various modifications may be made thereto by persons skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In all of the above illustrative embodiments of the present invention, the photosensitive tape 1 may be a photoresist coated copper tape or a photoresist coated continuous metal-composite tape. Use of either negative photoresists or positive photoresists is within the spirit and scope of the invention. After patterning the photosensitive copper tape by using any of the above-described method and apparatus, the copper is etched where exposed (if positive resist is used) leaving a set of thin copper leads suitable for \"gang\" or simultaneous bonding to a chip.
