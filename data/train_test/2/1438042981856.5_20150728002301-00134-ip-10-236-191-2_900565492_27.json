            "Campus security is always walking around, and you are given their number to call at anytime at orientation, they are very nice and friendly",
            "WE HAVE NONE!",
            "Clubs and activities are improving throughout the year and more and more each year. Getting involved is what makes the campus improvements. Marbeck Center Board is best known for throwing on the best activites",
            "All types, Athletes, Mennonite, Catholics, gammers and or animate personnel.",
            "May Day is a big deal at Bluffton. It happens every graduation weekend with a musical special dance and festival.",
            "It is a very expensive school, however I have had many ways to get involved to advanced my career. The professors want your help. And most majors require internships that are awesome for resumes!",
            "We have two sand volleyball courts, tennis ball golf course, a Frisbee club, tennis courts, many intramural, and an awesome new fitness center.",
            "Food improves year from year, but salad and grilled chicken is always a safe bet. A must try is chicken tortilla soup. And we have a themed lunch or dinner every month that is truly exciting!",
            "Dorms are out dated, and some are not as opening to newbies as others. They are making an effort to update them and give us more different living opportunities. Dorm life is what your floor and you decide it will be for the year.",
            "I have loved almost all of my professors, they are truly genuinely nice people who want to help you not hurt you. They are much more understanding then most and I have less course work then in high school!",
            "Leave your door open and say hello to everyone, it is the easiest way to make friends. Bring board games and new ideas to every class and activity. Get involved, there are many kids trying to make the campus a better place but we cannot do it ourselves!",
            "Bluffton University has the nicest and most caring students and faculty. However it lacks excitement and enjoyment of on and off campus activities. It is a well rewarding school with amazing opportunities to forward ones own career."

There is something for every person here. Tips for prospective students When choosing your school make sure to visit your top choices. I recommend staying overnight to get a better feel for the campus and the people. Bang for the buck Bluffton does have a high sticker price but through scholarships and grants the price is not bad. Am enjoying being here",
