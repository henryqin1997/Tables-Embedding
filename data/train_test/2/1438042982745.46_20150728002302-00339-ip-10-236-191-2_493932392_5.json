Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and the scope of the invention; and, all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. As the fraction of water, \u03b1, decreases, the temperature increase becomes so small, for a fixed MWF power level, as to be unusable. However, if the power level is increased at lower fractional water content, then a usable temperature increase results. This teaches us that the power level of the MWF must be adjusted in accordance with the fraction of water content. The simplest approach is to have the power level determined by the temperature differential. A series of tests showed that, for a typical mixture of crude oil and brine, the temperature increased as a function of exposure time. For a fixed exposure time, but with varying percentages of water, a very usable temperature increase was obtained and the same is true for a flowing mixture. Then by combining equations (3), (4), and (5), an approximation of the functional relationship between the oil/water cut, ##EQU6## is found. Thus for a mixture such as oil and water, accurate temperature increases can be obtained. For mixtures with more than two components, accurate temperature increases",
