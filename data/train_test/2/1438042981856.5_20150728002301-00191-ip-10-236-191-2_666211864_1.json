I am an old soul now, but I was wild when I was young. However, my formative years at boarding school changed my perspective on life drastically. I played ice hockey, studied history and philosophy avidly and proceeded to major in both as well at Skidmore College. I really enjoy reading, my favorites are Murray Rothbard, Von Mieses, Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Shakespeare, Aristotle, Sartre, Kierkegaard and Kant to name a few. I became an actor because the progression of my life experiences aligned more with an adventure story than a quotidian or serene existence, but I have considered law school as a viable alternative. I am bad at talking about myself, but I am an existentialist so it is what it is. First Date",
