The apparatus is then heated at 150\ufffd C. (oil bath temp.) for 3 hours, while maintaining a positive chilled nitrogen flow through the manifold as set forth in Example 2. At the end of the reaction, the reaction tube array is drained and sparged as set forth in Example 1., 79968=The investigation of an array synthesis of benzodiazepines as potential targets was prompted by a brief communication by Camps, et al, Anales De Quimica 1974;70:848 who reported a one-step synthesis of several benzodiazepines starting with a resin-bound amino acid. A two-step route is outlined in Scheme 3. The first step in the sequence is the formation of an imine between a resin-bound amino acid and a 2-aminobenzophenone. Initially, a number of condensation methods were explored, but all proved unsatisfactory. Replacement of the imine condensation with a transimination reaction, as taught by O'Donnell and Polt, Journal Organic Chemistry 1982;47:2663, to form a mixture of E and Z imine isomers proved satisfactory The resin-bound amino acid imines are then converted to the corresponding benzodiazepines by heating in TFA., 90707=To facilitate urea formation, the appropriate reaction tubes were submerged in reaction wells containing 3 mL of a solution of 0.19 to 0.23M isocyanate (trimethylsilyl isocyanate, butyl isocyanate, allyl isocyanate, trifluoro-o-tolyl isocyanate, and 4-methoxyphenyl isocyanate) in DMF, containing an internal standard (e.g., anthracene at 1.89-2.00 mg/mL). The apparatus was sealed as set forth in Example 1 and agitated in a sonic bath for 6 hours, while maintaining a positive nitrogen flow through the manifold. The reaction progress was monitored by removing a sample of the filtrate (10-100 \u03bcl), derivatization with an appropriate amine or alcohol, and analysis by GC/ISTD calibration methods. At the end of the reaction, the reaction tube array was drained and sparged as set forth in Example 1., 95325=Five commercially available BOC amino acid Merrifield resins (alanine, glycine, 2-bromobenzyloxy carbonyl-tyrosine, tryptophan, and valine; 0.57-0.89 meq/g, 200-400 mesh) were deprotected in bulk (1-5 g) instead of within the apparatus, using TFA:CH2 Cl2 (1:1) at room temperature overnight. After washing with dioxane and CH2 Cl2, the resins were dried under vacuum and used directly., 105025=The reaction tubes are submerged in reaction wells containing 3 mL of 2N NaOH in 1:1 dioxane:water. The apparatus is assembled as set forth in Example 1, and allowed to stand at room temperature for 6 hours to affect ester hydrolysis. At the end of the reaction, the reaction tube array is drained and sparged as set forth in Example 1., 128151=The reaction tubes are submerged in reaction wells containing 3.0 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide in 1:1 dioxane:water and the apparatus is assembled as set forth in Example 1, and sonicated at room temperature for 6 hours as set forth in Example 5 to affect boron oxidation. At the end of the reaction, the reaction tube array is drained and Sparged as set forth in Example 1., 21918=This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/430,696 filed on Apr. 28, 1995, which is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/217,347, filed Mar. 24, 1994, now abandoned, which is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/012,557, filed Feb. 2, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,324,483, granted Jun. 28, 1994, which is a Continuation-In-Part application of U.S. Ser. No. 07/958,383, filed Oct. 8, 1992, now abandoned., 128657=The reaction tubes are submerged in reaction wells containing a solution of 0.1M HCl in 1:1 dioxane:water (3 mL). The apparatus is assembled as set forth in Example 1, and sonicated at room temperature for 6 hours as set forth in Example 5 to affect hydrolysis/ring closure. At the end of the reaction, the reaction tube array is drained and sparged as set forth in Example 1., 27667=Central to the demonstration of this concept is the need to devise a \"general\" method for multiple, simultaneous synthesis of organic compounds. The synthesis method developed must satisfy the following criteria. The compounds should be simultaneously synthesized in an array format, which is compatible with the standard techniques of organic synthesis. The final compounds should be produced individually (not as mixtures) in soluble form. The quantity generated should be greater than 1 mg and in sufficiently pure form to allow direct biological testing. Additionally, to the extent possible, sample handling should be carried out using automated systems for speed, accuracy, and precision. A final requirement is that the growing compounds must be readily separable from by-products and reagents. Solid phase synthesis techniques commonly used in peptide or oligonucleotide synthesis enable achievement of this criteria. Typical solid supports (resins) include cross-linked divinylbenzene-styrene (polystyrene), controlled pore glass (CPG), polyacrylamides, poly(ethylene glycol)monomethyl ether and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), silica gel, cellulose, acrylic acid grafted polypropylene, and the like. Additionally, the solid support contains a reactive moiety. Thus, a functionalized solid support is an insoluble material containing an accessible reactive moiety such as, for example, a carboxylic acid, alcohol, amine, halomethyl and the like which is used to covalently attach an incoming building block. A further objective of the present invention is to synthesize products with molecular weights of less than, but not limited to, 1500 g/mol., 110854=100 mg each of the commercially available FMOC-protected amino acids on WANG resins (FMOC-Alanine and FMOC-Phenylalanine, loading=0.37-0.60 meq/g, 200-400 mesh) are measured into two sets of four gas dispersion tubes (reaction tubes). The apparatus is assembled, swelled with 3 mL of DMF, and drained as set forth in Example 1., 76273=In the operation of the present invention, the synthesis of dipeptides is achieved using the apparatus and applying 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC) strategy, as taught in Meienhofer, et al, International Journal Peptide Protein Research 1979;13:35 and Atherton, et al, Bioorganic Chemistry, 1979;8:351 on a variety of commercially available polystyrene resins (see Table 1). For peptide acids the p-benzyloxy benzyl alcohol cross-linked divinylbenzene-styrene (WANG) resin, as taught in Wang, Journal American Chemistry Society 1973;95:1328, is utilized. Eight FMOC amino acid resins including phenylalanine, glycine, alanine, isoleucine, leucine, proline, valine, and tryptophan are deprotected, reacted with either FMOC alanine or FMOC isoleucine, deprotected again, then cleaved from the resin to generate 16 discrete dipeptides. A total of 3 to 20 mg (28-85%) of each crude dipeptide is isolated as the trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) salt and analyzed by HPLC, mass spectroscopy (MS), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H NMR) (see Table 1)., 45080=An initial element of the apparatus (10) as shown in FIGS. 1-6 is reaction vessels which can be any vessels capable of containing resin and organic reactants. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the reaction vessels are a combination of reaction tubes and reaction wells. The reaction tubes are most preferably gas dispersion tubes (11). The lower ends of the reaction tubes have filters (14) and one or more pressure equalization holes (40) pierced in the reaction tubes (11) above the filters (14). The total length of each reaction tube can be from 50 to 300 mm with a preferred length of 250 mm. The upper ends of the reaction tubes may have an outside diameter of from 5 to 25 mm, with a preferred outside diameter of 8 mm. The inside diameter of the upper ends of the reaction tubes can be from 1 to 24 mm, with a preferred inside diameter of 5 mm. To allow for the materials in the reaction tube to mix with reactants, a filter (14) should be located in the lower end of the reaction tube (11). The length of the filters (14) on the lower ends of the reaction tubes can be from 1 to 300 mm, with a preferred length of 25 mm. The filters (14) on the lower ends of the reaction tubes may have an outside diameter of from 5 to 30 mm, with a preferred outside diameter of 12 mm. The filters (14) on the lower ends of the reaction tubes may have an inside diameter of from 1 to 24 mm, with a preferred inside diameter of 5 mm. Preferably, in order to allow the maximum reaction between material placed in the reaction tube and surrounding reactant, this filter (14) is preferably constructed of fritted glass. The porosity of the frit may be modified or selected to accommodate various mesh sizes of solid supports and to affect more efficient reaction mixing. The pore diameter may be from 10 to 400 \u03bcm, with a preferred pore diameter of 145 to 175 \u03bcm for 200 to 400 mesh resin. The reaction tubes, including the filters, must be constructed of a material which will not be harmed by the presence of the volatile and/or corrosive reactants which are often necessary to carry out organic chemical reactions. Such materials include glass, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), stainless steel, ceramics, or alternate glasses, metals, or plastics, preferably glass. One or more (preferably one) pressure equalization holes (40) located on the reaction tube at a position above the filter and below the bottom face of the holder block provides a means to equilibrate any pressure differentials within the sealed apparatus. The position of the pressure equalization holes above the filter may be from 1 to 250 mm, with a preferred height of 20 mm above the top of the filter (14). The diameter of the pressure equalization holes must be small enough to prevent loss of resin through them or cause significant loss of air pressure during sparging. The pressure equalization holes may have a diameter from 100 to 2000 \u03bcm, with a preferred diameter of 1000 \u03bcm., 133061=In an example of a post-cleavage reaction, a modified Wolff-Kishner reduction is done on half of the amount of each of the isolated compounds. The compounds are placed in the appropriate reaction wells containing 3 mL of 0.09M potassium hydroxide, and 0.09M hydrazine hydrate in diethylene glycol. The reaction tubes are filled with 0.5 g sodium sulfate (to absorb water) and submerged in the reaction wells. The apparatus is sealed as set forth in Example 1, placed in an oil bath, and heated at 80\ufffd C. while maintaining a positive chilled nitrogen flow through the manifold as set forth in Example 2. After 12 hours, the reaction is stopped and the reaction tube array is drained and sparged as set forth in Example 1. Each product is isolated by adding 4 mL of a solution of 1:1 water:CH2 Cl2. Each organic layer is separated, dried, and concentrated as set forth in Example 8 to yield another 12 desired products., 83444=101 to 153 mg each of eight FMOC protected amino acids (phenylalanine, glycine, alanine, isoleucine, leucine, proline, valine, and tryptophan) on a commercially available WANG resin (loading=0.37-0.60 meq/g, 200-400 mesh) was measured into each of 16 gas dispersion tubes (reaction tubes). The reaction tubes were fitted into the holder block with two gaskets, one above and one below the holder block. The array of reaction tubes was fitted into a matching array of reaction wells in an appropriate reservoir block, in this case a test tube rack, and 3 mL of DMF was dispensed through the aperture at the top of the reaction tubes to wash any residual resin to the bottom of the glass frit. The manifold was fitted over the holder block and a nitrogen atmosphere was initiated through the ports on the manifold. The apparatus was then agitated in a sonic bath for 15 minutes to swell the resin support in preparation for the first reaction. Following swelling of the resin, the holder block and the manifold, in combination with the reaction tubes, were raised above the reservoir block and the reaction tubes were allowed to drain by gravity., 146087=The cyclic carbamate is formed according to the method of Gonzalez, et al, Tetrahedron Letters 1989;30:2145. The reaction tubes are submerged in reaction wells containing a solution of 0.2M diethyl carbonate and 0.4M NaOMe in MeOH. The apparatus is sealed as set forth in Example 1 and agitated in a sonic bath for 12 hours, while maintaining a positive nitrogen flow through the manifold. At the end of the reaction, the reaction tube array is drained and sparged as set forth in Example 1., 65374=A number of reaction tubes equal to the total number of compounds to be synthesized by the array method are loaded with 1 to 1000 mg, preferably 100 mg, of the appropriate functionalized solid support, preferably 1 to 3% cross-linked polystyrene. The individual reaction tubes are inserted into the holder block. The reaction tubes, in combination with the holder block and manifold, are inserted into the reservoir block so that each reaction tube is submerged in a volume, preferably 3 to 5 mL, of a solvent capable of swelling the polystyrene resin (such as, but not limited to, dichloromethane, chloroform, dimethylformamide (DMF), dioxane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethanol and the like). The polystyrene resin within the reaction tubes is preferably agitated for 15 to 30 minutes to affect swelling. Swelling times of 5 to 600 minutes, with or without agitation are also within the scope of the invention. The reaction tubes, in combination with the holder block and manifold, are removed from the reservoir block and the excess solvent within the reaction tubes is allowed to drain, preferably by gravity, although gas pressure applied to the manifold inlet (while closing the outlet) can be used to expel the solvent, if desired.}",
