            "Campus safety here is fairly good. They take concern about your safety and are always available to pick you up from the other campus at night if you need. Though, they also are not too aware, as I have gotten my bike stolen.",
            "There is no Greek life on campus. As sophomores you no longer live in dorms, you have apartments, so it's not like you have to live in dorms for four years. It just depends what your personality is and if you are okay with not having Greek life.",
            "There are several clubs and activities on campus here at APU. Only of my biggest problems coming into this year was that I signed up and devoted myself to way to any clubs and activities on camps that I had to dial it back down a little second semester. APU really does do a good job providing ways for people to find their click and get involved.",
            "APU is great for students that are okay with not having parties every day and okay with the strict rules of no alcohol. APU is a private Christian school so it is not as crazy and chaotic as some state or public schools. APU is not necessarily for the more mellow, just for those people that are okay on semi-strict rules, especially in college.",
            "Some exciting locations on campus are the brick wall where people can put their prayers or hardships into the cracks for others to read and pray for them. There is also places like sam's sub that have delicious sandwiches that everyone loves eating! There is also trinity tables which is a place where all the freshman students hang out and do their homework.",
            "APU is expensive, though they do provide a lot of options and resources for the students. The education here is very good and the professors are amazingly talented. APU is really a great school especially with all you receive.",
            "College is what you make of it. There are not a lot of places to go around in Azusa and hang out and it is not very safe but if you embrace college life and dorm life then it will be exciting as you will just be hanging out with friends, watching movies on week nights. Though there is not a lot of off campus activities there are football, basketball, and several other sporting events that APU has to entertain its students on the weekends.",
            "The food at APU gets boring, just like any other school. There are actually a lot of options for the students so the food and dining is really nothing to complain about, especially for college. The only complaint would be that APU closes their dinning venues very early on the weekends; so if you eat dinner after 7pm you then have to go off campus because everything is now closed.",
            "Dorm life is amazing! If anyone is thinking of living in the dorms I would say do it because this is the time in your life to live in the dorms and experience the crazy 2am fun that goes on in the halls. These girls in my dorm have become my family and I know the relationships I have built in the dorms are long lasting.",
            "Academic rigor is very weighted on your major. Nursing and science majors have a hard time. The teachers here are amazing, though they do expect a lot so be prepared to study a lot if you are those majors. Communication and psychology majors are not too rigorous, though it is college and it is harder than high school.",
            "If you are a prospective student my advice would be to first realize how expensive APU is and take that into great consideration. APU is an amazing school and you will fall in love with, as leaving will be one of the hardest things to do. Get involved at the school, APU does an amazing job to throw opportunities in freshman's faces; take advantage of them and get involved as much as you can, though remember school should always still come first.",
            "Azusa Pacific University is a college that is definitely unlike any other school, with its bible classes and God-first atmosphere. The professors connect with each student and though the school is quite large for a private school, the teacher student ratio is amazing. The only complaint while I rate APU would be for the administration to help out the students more, for several times I have had academic or financial aid questions and everyone just sends me to another department for help, not knowing themselves the answer."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{72652=The transition to college can be scary, but my biggest piece of advice is to stay positive through whatever life gives you! Be open to change and keep the future in mind! If you haven't visited yet, take a tour of the campus! Visit the department in which you are planning on majoring in. Make sure you are ready to be fully immersed in a Christian environment. Start looking out for sales on things you might need for college and start buying over summer so it's not stressful once you get to school! Read the ENTIRE code of conduct, housing rules, and just be prepared for what is expected of you once you get to APU. Make sure to register for classes as early as possible and ask your academic advisor as many questions as you need in order to be prepared for the year! Stay in contact with your admissions counselor often over the summer if you have questions. Also, get talking to future classmates on Facebook so you can make friends! The APU Class of 2015 page is where I made many friends before even getting to school, you can do the same! Have goals for the school year- not just long term goals, but lots of short term ones that you can achieve throughout the year. Have a mentor. Whether it is your alpha leader, RA, a professor you meet, ask an older person to be your mentor throughout college and guide you through life. Use ratemyprofessors.com to the fullest. You won't regret it. You will regret not using it! Compare book prices on amazon and the bookstore. Don't pay more than you need to., 7760=Honestly everyone could fit in at this school. We don't necessarily have a specific cookie cutter mold that you have to fit. There are many out of state students that attend here which adds to the diversity. The only requirement that I believe that would be necessary is that you have an open and receptive heart to the Christian lifestyle. There are many on-fire Christians at this school that might catch you off guard if you have never been exposed but they definitely should not intimidate you. You are not required to be a Christian but that doesn't mean that you can go about living any which way you please. The university wants to maintain its reputation of its motto to have God First. It goes all the way up to our president who constantly shows us a God driven heart to care for each and everyone person. If you can just buy into the mission you will enjoy your experience to the utmost. It says in the most cliche verse of the whole Bible, John 3:16, that ...God so loved the WORLD..., the entire world and that is what we are called to do as Christians as difficult and challenging as that may be but with the strength and love that God empowers us with each and every person will feel a sense of belonging. Some people who may not enjoy this experience are ones that dislike: Warm weather Suburban areas Required Chapel attendances (3 a week) Required Community service (120 credits by graduation) Required Bible Courses Having a good time! haha Like I said, this school only requires an open and willing heart ready to listen and act on the way God is pushing or pulling you. Sit back, relax and enjoy our Creators wild ride!!!, 740113=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 635243=Skip out on the caf (1899 dining hall) it ruins your stomach, but the west campus eating areas are way better. Their is two sandwich shops, a sushi place, pizza place, fast food type place, BBQ stand, Mexican restaurant, coffee shop, and west campus cafeteria on campus., 377852=Azusa Pacific University has a satellite school, which is conveniently located in my city of Victorville. The facility is beautiful and very functional. The instructors are all very knowledgeable. I am proud to become a graduate of APU in November of 2012!}",
