Sometimes, the size reductions are accomplished by reducing the number of objects for a particular features (like the number of possible swap areas, or the number of tty discipline structures). Sometimes, the size reductions are achieved by removing features or functions from the kernel. The CELF wiki page describing these patches is at: Linux Tiny The Linux-tiny patch set is a set of patches maintained by Matt Mackall developed with the intent to help a developer reduce the size of the Linux kernel. Linux-tiny patches The Linux kernel includes a number of options for to control the features and options it supports. The kernel, over time, has accumulated a large set of features and capabilities. But many features are not needed in Consumer Electronics products. By carefully tuning the kernel options, you can omit many parts of the kernel and save memory in your product.
