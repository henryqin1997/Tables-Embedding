Nearly everything closes at 3:00 on Fridays, so students better eat early or take lunch for themselves., 485284=UTEP is #1 in student affordability with an average semester cost of less than $2500. It is much more than worth the cost., 446017=Theres an engineering march that goes around but i honestly havent experienced anything unusual...yet., 563631=My tuition was about $2250, which is pretty decent considering I'm an engineering major., 451832=UTEP is known for its engineering program. There is a tradition for engineering students that is near St Patrick's day in which students learn about the history of the university and do chants and walk all over campus. At the end they paint the letter M on the mountains which is for college of mine. UTEP was originally a mining school back in 1914., 5642=UTEP isn't incredibly expensive. I haven't had a problem covering the expenses. I had a grant for 1000 and a loan, and I was covered. The Food Courts are expensive to me, though. I prefer eating out of campus. There's some cool restaurants around UTEP., 247895=The city of El Paso was rated the safest city in the United States in 2010, making this one of the safest Universities in the country.}",

There are many clubs and events to go to, so it's hard to be bored. Since the community of students isn't that huge, you will be able to meet and connect to many people. I'm a music major, and I've met sooo many students who are majoring in music. There's also a good range of ethnicity here, so you'll meet lots of different people. It's fun that way. Whatever your major is, you'll most likely meet many of those who have the same major as you, and those who don't. Even if El Paso is a small town, there's always something to do, even if it's hanging out at a cool coffee shop, checking out downtown, cheering for the Miners at the Sun Bowl, or going to a concert. :) Am learning a lot For the time that I've spent here (2 semesters), every professor that I've had has a different",
