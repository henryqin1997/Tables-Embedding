Kirianov, IVGG., 34131=Eruption that began in July 1975 is continuing, 37659=02/1999 (BGVN 24:02) Gas-and-steam explosion; minor seismicity, 14107=As of early February 2013, the eruption continued to produce very fluid lava flows, four growing cinder cones, gas-and-steam plumes with variable ash contents that often reached ~4 km a.s.l. and drifted in various directions, and daily thermal alerts above Tolbachinsky Dol. Two examples of eruptive products from the eruption are shown in figure 11., 35074=A volcanic cone 250 m high and 1,200 m in diameter has formed on the south slope of Plosky Tolbachik volcano. Violent activity was observed from 9 to 23 July, producing an ash column 8 km high and bomb outbursts up to 2,500 m. The ashfall area covers 200 km2, and the total of the ash and scoria amounts to 500 m3. On 30 July a lava outflow began issuing from a 1-km-long eruptive fissure on the southwest slope of the new volcanic cone. There is a danger of forest fires., 30006=The massive Tolbachik basaltic volcano is located at the southern end of the dominantly andesitic Kliuchevskaya volcano group. The Tolbachik massif is composed of two overlapping, but morphologically dissimilar volcanoes. The flat-topped Plosky Tolbachik shield volcano with its nested Holocene Hawaiian-type calderas up to 3 km in diameter is located east of the older and higher sharp-topped Ostry Tolbachik stratovolcano. Lengthy rift zones extending NE and SSW of the volcano have erupted voluminous basaltic lava flows during the Holocene, with activity during the past two thousand years being confined to the narrow axial zone of the rifts. The last eruptive activity, in 1975-76, vented from both the summit and SSW-flank fissures; it was the largest historical basaltic eruption in Kamchatka., 70774=KVERT reported that the S fissure along the W side of Tolbachinsky Dol, a lava plateau on the SW side of Tolbachik, continued to produce very fluid lava flows during 7-14 June that traveled to the W, S, and E sides of the plateau. Cinder cones continued to grow along the S fissure and weak gas-and-steam plumes were observed. A large thermal anomaly on the N part of Tolbachinsky Dol was visible daily in satellite imagery. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange., 51761=KVERT reported that the S fissure along the W side of Tolbachinsky Dol, a lava plateau on the SW side of Tolbachik, continued to produce very fluid lava flows during 25 January-1 February that traveled to the W and S sides of Tolbachinsky Dol. Four cinder cones continued to grow on the S fissure above Krasny cone. Gas-and-ash plumes rose to an altitude of 3.5 km (11,500 ft) a.s.l. and drifted in multiple directions. A very large thermal anomaly on the N part of Tolbachinsky Dol was visible daily in satellite imagery. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange., 30344=On 18 February, a gas-and-steam explosion generated a plume to 600 m above the volcano. Small (magnitudes near zero) shallow earthquakes were registered under the volcano and continued through the month, coincident with M 1.5 events at 15-30 km depth. No further unusual seismicity was reported as of mid-March., 71721=KVERT reported that the S fissure along the W side of Tolbachinsky Dol, a lava plateau on the SW side of Tolbachik, continued to produce very fluid lava flows during 14-21 June that traveled to the W, S, and E sides of the plateau. Cinder cones continued to grow along the S fissure and weak gas-and-steam plumes were observed. A large thermal anomaly on the N part of Tolbachinsky Dol was visible daily in satellite imagery. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange., 42389=KVERT reported that an eruption from Tolbachik that began on 27 November continued through 30 November. Lava effused from two fissures along the W side of Tolbachinsky Dol, a lava plateau on the SW side of the volcano, and ash plumes rose less than 500 m on 28 November.

The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange., 86900=\"Unlike the 1975 eruption, which was predicted 1 week in advance based on strong precursory seismicity at five seismic stations, the eruption that began in November 2012 was preceded by much weaker seismicity, so scientists were not able to predict this eruption. Earthquake hypocenters registered from more than 10 local seismometers were generally at depths of less than 10 kilometers and were mostly located below Plosky Tolbachik before earthquake activity migrated south to the eruption site . . .. Initial activity produced two primary fissures: a northern one, with four different active vents, and a southern fissure . . .. By the second day of the eruption, lava flows extended 9 kilometers from vent areas down into surrounding forests (Samoylenko et al., 2012). As of February 2013, weak explosive and effusive activity was ongoing at the main cone, and lava flows were active throughout the lava flow field from the southern fissure to Belaya Gorka, an older cinder cone 12 kilometers from the main vent (figure 12a).\", 32364=Seismic monitoring . . . by the KVERT began in late January 1994 when two stations were installed. Since then seismicity was considered to be at background levels. One earthquake was registered on 25 January. During the period from 28 January to 2 February, shallow volcanic earthquakes were registered at a rate of 5-13/day. The following week (3-8 February) there were 1-4 shallow earthquakes recorded each day., 23142=The first available photograph of the eruption showed that lava was issuing through two fissures (figure 2). Ashfall 4-cm-deep was reported in Krasny Yar (~60 km NNW) by midday on 28 November (figure 3). According to a KVERT information release, the Aviation Color Code was raised to Red for a brief period on 29 November, but this was not reflected in the daily reports; the Aviation Color Code remained Orange for the remainder of the reporting interval., 83466=The massive Tolbachik basaltic volcano is located at the southern end of the dominantly andesitic Kliuchevskaya volcano group. The Tolbachik massif is composed of two overlapping, but morphologically dissimilar, volcanoes. The flat-topped Plosky Tolbachik shield volcano, with its nested Holocene Hawaiian-type calderas up to 3 km in diameter, is located east of the older and higher sharp-topped Ostry Tolbachik stratovolcano. The summit caldera at Plosky Tolbachik was formed in association with major lava effusion about 6,500 years ago, while simultaneously the Ostry Tolbachik volcano underwent a major southward-directed sector collapse . Lengthy rift zones extending NE and SSW of the volcano erupted voluminous basaltic lava flows during the Holocene, but activity during the past two thousand years has been confined to the narrow axial zone of the rifts. The 1975-76 eruption originating from the SSW-flank fissure system and the summit was the largest historical basaltic eruption ever recorded in Kamchatka., 38824=07/1975 (CSLP 51-75) Explosions from four flank vents of Plosky Tolbachik, 79312=KVERT reported that the S fissure along the W side of Tolbachinsky Dol, a lava plateau on the SW side of Tolbachik, continued to produce very fluid lava flows during 9-17 August that traveled to the W, S, and E sides of the plateau. Cinder cones continued to grow along the S fissure and weak gas-and-steam plumes were observed. A thermal anomaly on the N part of Tolbachinsky Dol was visible daily in satellite imagery. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange., 62133=KVERT reported that the S fissure along the W side of Tolbachinsky Dol, a lava plateau on the SW side of Tolbachik, continued to produce very fluid lava flows during 5-12 April that traveled to the W, S, and E sides of the plateau. Cinder cones continued to grow along the S fissure. Gas-and-ash plumes rose to an altitude of 3.5 km (11,500 ft) a.s.l. and drifted in multiple directions. A very large thermal anomaly on the N part of Tolbachinsky Dol was visible daily in satellite imagery. A weak thermal anomaly was detected over the crater of the volcano on 6 and 9 April. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange., 73632=KVERT reported that the S fissure along the W side of Tolbachinsky Dol, a lava plateau on the SW side of Tolbachik, continued to produce very fluid lava flows during 28 June-5 July that traveled to the W, S, and E sides of the plateau. Cinder cones continued to grow along the S fissure and weak gas-and-steam plumes were observed. A large thermal anomaly on the N part of Tolbachinsky Dol was visible daily in satellite imagery. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange., 35879=The eruption of Plosky Tolbachik volcano commenced from the flank craters on 6 July 1975 at 0045 GMT. Four explosion vents located 18 km from the main crater are active. The place and time of eruption were predicted by Dr. Tokarev according to the character of the seismic activity., 50711=KVERT reported that the S fissure along the W side of Tolbachinsky Dol, a lava plateau on the SW side of Tolbachik, continued to produce very fluid lava flows during 18-25 January that traveled to the W and S sides of Tolbachinsky Dol. Four cinder cones continued to grow on the S fissure above Krasny cone. Gas-and-ash plumes rose to an altitude of 4 km (13,100 ft) a.s.l. and drifted in multiple directions. A very large thermal anomaly on the N part of Tolbachinsky Dol was visible daily in satellite imagery. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange., 38033=01/1994 (BGVN 19:01) Seismic monitoring stations installed; activity at background levels, 69829=KVERT reported that the S fissure along the W side of Tolbachinsky Dol, a lava plateau on the SW side of Tolbachik, continued to produce very fluid lava flows during 31 May-7 June that traveled to the W, S, and E sides of the plateau. Cinder cones continued to grow along the S fissure and weak gas-and-steam plumes were observed. A large thermal anomaly on the N part of Tolbachinsky Dol was visible daily in satellite imagery.

Local video images around that time lacked incandescence from the N part of Tolbachinsky Dol, although a thermal anomaly continued to be detected in satellite images. On 27 August the Aviation Color Code was lowered to Yellow., 40609=KVERT reported that episodes of volcanic tremor were detected in the area of Plosky Tolbachik during 7-10, 18, and 26 November. The number of shallow volcanic earthquakes increased to 250 on 26 November. A strong event occurred at 1652 on 27 November. The Aviation Color Code was raised to Yellow. That same day observers from Kozyrevsk (40 km NW) and Lazo (50 km SW) villages reported ash explosions and lava flows at Tolbachinsky Dol, in the same area as the 1975 eruption (northern vents). Ashfall, 4 cm thick, was reported in Krasny Yar (60 km NNW). The Aviation Color Code was raised to Orange. Based on information from the Kamchatka Branch of Geophysical Services (KGBS), the Tokyo VAAC reported that ash plumes possibly rose to altitudes of 6.1-10.1 km (20,000-33,000 ft) a.s.l. Ash plumes were not detected in satellite imagery. Plume altitudes were estimated based on seismic data.}",
