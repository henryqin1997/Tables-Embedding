Dunkin' Donuts will continue to be offered as an alternative at the Lake Worth and Palm Beach Gardens campuses., 619567=There are no dorms here. I would suggested living with parents or finding a room mate because rent over is pretty expensive. A decent 1 bedroom 1 bath can run you from $800-$1100., 18425=Community College is a great choice for students who don't have too much money to spend for college! For a full time student tuition is only $1000 per semester. On top of that if you have Bright Futures or other scholarship money you pay even less. I only paid around $600 for tuition this semester! You also save money on room and board which costs around $8000. There are no additional daily expenses for students living at home. You or your parents do not have to pay for an extra toothbrush, toothpaste, toilet paper, groceries etc.}",

Tips for prospective students This institute is a great opportunity You will learn so much.It is very easy but will take all of your dedication as well. Bang for the buck The cost for each class is very manageable. It is a major difference from a university. Apply for financial aid on a website called fasfa.gov.,by doing so you may not have to pay for anything. Am enjoying being here It is a lot of being at the institute.It offers so many activities. The campus is quiet and peaceful as well. The school brings a secure feeling",
