If this series ever becomes a TV show (please please please), she is the one person I can totally see pulling off the role of Stephanie. Anyway, the main character is a gun toting (minus the bullets) Jersey Girl who starts bounty hunting for her cousin Vinnie (I kid you not) when she loses her job. The stories takes place in the Trenton (Chambersburgh) area, and I do think this originally was a draw for me having lived in NJ for a number of years but I was sucked in by the easy writing style and utter insanity... There are more laugh out loud moments in this series than on most comedies I see on TV. The first case Stephanie has is to hunt down Joe Morelli, a Trenton cop who skipped bail. Now, Stephanie has some history with Morelli... like playing train in his father's garage as a grade schooler and having 4 minutes of bliss behind the counter at Tasty Pastry while in high school all before trying to run him down with her car - so this is going to be tricky. In a series on mis-steps and accidents, Stephanie finally gets her man. ...more",

Barnaby gets a bizarre call from her brother \"Wild Bill\" and picks up and goes to Miami to find his apartment ransacked and Bill missing apparantly along with Hooker's (NASCAR Guy) boat. Hooker sticks with her thinking that is the best chance at finding his boat and the two of them stumble into a mystery involving gold bars and bumbling bad guys. The play between Hooker and Barnaby is fun, but I could live another day without hearing Hooker refer to himself as \"NASCAR Guy.\" The sidekicks are not up to Lulu and Grandma Mazur level, but Judey did crack me up.

I really don't like (kind of despise) the whole NASCAR thing, so Miami and NASCAR weren't too much of a draw for me. Unfortunately, two things are probably skewing this rating: 1) I read this book before Metro Girl so I missed some of the set up and 2) I read it while in the middle of a Stephanie Plum marathon... That being said the book was OK. NASCAR, while relevant to the plot, didn't really bug me too much, but I just didn't find this book laugh out loud funny like the Plum novels. I chuckled in a few parts, but there was nothing that I highlighted for my mom. (We pass books back and forth so the first one to read highlights parts we thing are hysterical or noteworthy so we don't ruin it for the other person by telling them before they read.) The plot has Barnaby and Hooker stealing a competitors NASCAR rig with one of their friends and a dead guy on board. The whole plot comes down to a high tech way of cheating during a race. I like Barney, she's smart and sassy... Hooker is unremarkable in the fact that he is typical of JE's male counterparts for Plum... slightly dangerous and probably not good for you, but you have to love him anyway. The cast of sidekicks weren't as fun as Lulu and Grandma Mazur, and the ending quite frankly bugged me. I was disappointed that the cheating thing seemed to be OK. Anyway, if you run out of Plum books, this one is ok... but in a competition - Stephanie wins hands down! ...more",

However, at less than 200 pages these are hardly an appetizer for the Numbers books... I basically read it because it was there... Diesel is back from the other \"Between-the-Numbers\" books and he is looking for a leprechaun - Snuggy. These books usually have a supernatural twist and in this one, most of the regulars put in an appearance as well. So there goes my dream sequence idea for these books. Anyway, Grandma Mazur finds a bag of money and ends up in AC (Atlantic City for those not from Jersey) and the gang packs up and heads down there to rescue her (usually from herself). Somewhere along the line, Lulu gets a job modeling plus-sized underwear and Snuggy decides his leprechaun invisibility powers only work when he gets naked so there are plenty of things to laugh at/about.

As for the three things I pay attention to: characters, style and story, this one is This is actually the third Tess Gerritsen book that I have read. As for the three things I pay attention to: characters, style and story, this one is really good. Like her other books, it is easy to read and she brings back several characters you already know/love. Her Homicide Detective Jane Rizzoli has not been my favorite, but there are several scenes in this book that make me just love her. Imagine - a less than maternal pregnant woman, trapped in a hospital a week after she is due and being held hostage... If another author (Janet Evanovich for example) would have done this, I would have peed my pants laughing, but this is just another day in the life of Jane Rizzoli and she takes it in stride. In regards to the story, this is the best I have read so far from this author and one of the best thrillers I have read in a while. It was about a girl that came to America and got trapped in the world of human slavery/prostitution. By chance, her and a friend witness a horrible crime and in another stroke of luck escape and are forced to run. It totally sucked me in from the beginning and I HAD to finish the final 75 pages before I went to bed last night. A great mystery with an interesting story. ...more",

As always, easy to read, but her reoccurring main characters The second I have read by this author and overall, I wasn't really in love with the book. As always, easy to read, but her reoccurring main characters both kind of got on my nerves with the issues they were going through and their self deprecating attitudes were a bit much. (the one's ex husband returns and the will she/won't she fall for him again and the other's finding out she is pregnant by an FBI agent she worked a case with and hardly knows - REALLY? Come on...) The story was a little too conveinent and seems all to familiar. I could have read, seen a TV show or a Movie with this plot... nothing new was really added and the sub mystery seemed kind of just thrown in there and actually kind of wrapped up abrubtly. Overall, I am glad I read it for the character evolution, but if you aren't into reading the whole series by an author and need/want the story on the characters - you could really skip this one. ...more",
