Here's how its 14-day phase 1 study results compare to some other hepatitis C antiviral agents after their phase 1 14-day monotherapy studies in genotype 1 HCV-infected patients. ITMN-191 against the competition Thankfully InterMune released enough clinical trial data on Tuesday and Wednesday for us to be able to make initial comparisons of ITMN-191 against its brightest competition. Almost six years ago the FDA approved an important new compound to help treat HCV, which is very dangerous and can lead to liver cancer. Without a doubt there will be more in the coming years. With the success of other, similar antiviral compounds in clinical testing, many people have been eagerly awaiting ITMN-191's first study results. ITMN-191 is InterMune and partner Roche's antiviral protease inhibitor to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. It was discovered by Array BioPharma (Nasdaq: ARRY\u00a0\u00a0) and subsequently out-licensed to InterMune, which then out-licensed it again to Roche. The wait was a little longer than anticipated, but investors finally got a healthy first look at data from InterMune's (Nasdaq: ITMN\u00a0\u00a0) hepatitis C treatment, ITMN-191, on Tuesday. | More Articles April 3, 2008 | Comments",
    "textAfterTable": "*In previously untreated patients only. **Both previously untreated and treatment-experienced patients. ***In treatment-experienced patients only. ^Not necessarily at end of study. This is not a full list of top HCV drug treatments in development. Other compounds, such as\u00a0privately held ViroChem's polymerase inhibitor, have produced similarly strong study data. Another\u00a0important factor is that all these phase 1 studies used at least slightly different patient groups in various locations. Differences such as age, sex, or ethnicity affect how well a drug performs. All these drugs were tested in very few patients in these studies; some cohorts had fewer than 10 patients. It is still too early to guess which drug candidate looks most effective. Based on these results, all I'd be confident to say is that they all exhibit some activity in fighting hepatitis C. Even a 2.0 log reduction in a patient's HCV loads represents a 99% reduction in the amount of the virus in the bloodstream. The reason I compare ITMN-191 to the other leading anti-hepatitis C treatment candidates is to show that the drug's phase 1 results are at least comparable to other similar compounds that are much closer to approval. (If telaprevir doesn't get approved I will be beyond shocked.) InterMune has now officially validated ITMN-191 as a viable anti-hepatitis C drug candidate at this stage of the game. InterMune will start testing ITMN-191 in another phase 1b study this quarter, this time",
