For the $1000 price point, I would be thinking a hybrid or cabinet saw. I would find out the model #. If it is a contractor saw, like the 4512 (or one of its predecessors). My rule on HD, is if the machine was new within the last decade, I tend not to pay more than 50% of the original cost. Once the machine gets beyond that decade mark, that number tends to start going down. There are a few exceptions to that rule, including high-end tools that people tend to hold on to, like Festool and Lie-Nielsen., 8330=#3 posted 03-29-2013 04:05 PM, 27087=#14 posted 03-30-2013 01:01 AM, 10572=if the seller is firm $400, get a 4512, especially if you can find a HD that honors harbor freight's \"20 (now in some places 25)% off any single item\" coupon. the saw could be had for between $375 and $400. BTW, when i bought my 2412 HD, i got it for $265., 10098=1869 posts in 1594\u00a0days, 21815=#11 posted 03-29-2013 08:30 PM, 18524=#9 posted 03-29-2013 05:14 PM, 4283=#1 posted 03-29-2013 03:28 PM, 8652=It would have cost near a $1000 if he bought two of them. The Ridgid TS2412/TS2424/TS3612, and TS3650 never sold for more than $599 AKAIK, and many got them for less. If he bought some expensive blades, inserts, aftermarket miter gauge, dado set, etc., then the total after tax and deliver might have come close to a grand. Either way, the going rate for used Ridgid contractor saws is in the $200-$325 range depending on condition, model, and extras., 49183=\u00a92015 Verticalscope Inc.

If he added a high end fence to it, perhaps it can go to 400 or 500 but certainly not 1000. The 3650 comes with a good fence already anyhow., 10250=#4 posted 03-29-2013 04:29 PM, 12013=#5 posted 03-29-2013 04:39 PM, 16771=#8 posted 03-29-2013 05:03 PM, 25511=#13 posted 03-30-2013 12:54 AM, 23468=#12 posted 03-29-2013 08:40 PM, 17093=yrob, he is not wanting 1000 for it, he says that he bought it for $1,000. He didn\u2019t say it had a nice fence, etc. I find that someone who is going to go to the trouble and buy the extras for it is going to know the model number of the table saw off the top of his head.

Hmmmm. I bought a 3650 and paid $599.00 for it. Sold it for $250.00(on C/L). It was a great saw,I just wanted a cabinet type.Frankly the Ridgid worked just as good., 1991=03-29-2013 03:17 PM, 6427=#2 posted 03-29-2013 04:01 PM, 21663=2656 posts in 1889\u00a0days, 28696=#15 posted 03-30-2013 01:12 AM}",
