Since the sleeve is moved to its extended position by pushing it in a direction away from the point of the needle, there is no chance of the user being stuck by the needle while performing this operation. Once the sleeve is in its extended position it cannot accidentally be deflected to expose the needle. As a result the syringe and needle assembly no longer pose a threat and can be disposed of without the necessity of special handling. When the sleeve is in its retracted position the protrusions 38 engage the bottoms of the slots 46 or 48 and prevent the sleeve from moving to its extended position. However, after the syringe and needle assembly has been used, the sleeve can be moved to its extended position, where it encloses the needle and prevents accidental needle stick of a person who is handling the assembly, merely by pushing on the ledge 45. Pushing the sleeve causes the inner portions 36b of the fingers to be deflected so that",
