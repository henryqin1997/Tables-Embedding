The police close all the gates around 10:00 p.m. only allowing one or two entrances on campus. I see the police cars everywhere on campus either driving or walking and monitoring. There are also multiple emergency buttons around campus if you're in trouble and need immediate help., 399203=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 37629=the university of central arkansas is a community oriented school. this school has a 1:19 professor-student ratio, which allows for individual based learning in a higher education type learning environment. this school is great for those who like the pleasures of both a small town and a larger town., 355925=Food isn't awful on campus, but you will grow tired of it, especially in the cafeteria. The dorms all have kitchens so it wouldn't be too difficult to concoct a homemade meal occasionally.}",
