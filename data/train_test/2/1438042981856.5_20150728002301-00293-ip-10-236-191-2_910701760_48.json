            "Safety seems to be an issue. I receive probably at least one alert via email of an intruder, burglar, or harassment on campus weekly.",
            "This is poorest school of choice if you are looking for Greek life. No joke.",
            "This is quite obvious. I mean, it is Hawaii. But, as stated earlier, it's high in costs too.",
            "Anything you can think of outdoors, it is available. Transportation is easier with a vehicle, but the public transportation is exceptional. My first year I made good use to it.",
            "The cafeteria meal plans are mandatory if you are to dorm. If you aren't in a dorm, I honestly wouldn't advise buying a meal plan. besides, the cafeteria is somewhat out of the way of the main campus.",
            "Seriously, my first year was my best year. The dorms formed a sort of community within itself. Although I didn't spend the majority of my time with my dorm peers, there was a sense of family familiarity between all of us, and they are friendships that will last forever.",
            "Depending on your major, if you find the right professors, they are truly passionate about their specialization. Although many professors tend to be easy on their students, there still is quite a bit of quality information to learned. It all boils down to the students aptness and willingness to learn.",
            "Definitely be aware of the high costs of living. Whether you're being aided by your parents or by yourself, note that Honolulu has one of the highest costs of living in the US. Also, take note that the way of life here is quite different from the rest of the US. There are multinational groups and communities, and their cultural differences into one big salad bowl. Hence the state's nickname or reference.",
            "It is a beautiful school. Not exactly what I was expecting, but exceeded my hopes after a semester of adjusting."

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Be ready for a different demographic of students with many students of Asian and Pacific Islander decent. Some of the classes can be difficult and some of the professors can be hard to understand because of accents, but if you have tutors or form study groups with other students in the class, then you will be ok. Am enjoying being here The people in Hawaii are very friendly. Many of the professors are really helpful and want you to succeed in their classroom. Obviously, being in Hawaii year-round is going to a great place to spend your time and there is much to be explored here. Am learning a lot By being in a place that has such rich history and such a different culture than any other place elsewhere in the United States, you not only learn many new things just by being in college but also you learn about a whole culture. I have learned a lot about the Hawaiian culture and other Pacific Islander/Asian cultures. Login to rate or flag the reviews Brandon from Colorado Springs, CO 12/19/2009 Reviewer is",
