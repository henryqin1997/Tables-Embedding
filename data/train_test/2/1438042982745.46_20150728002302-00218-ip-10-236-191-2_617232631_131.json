The outcomes of his research have been documented in over 120 academic articles and published designs. He is an Assessor for the Australian Research Council (ARC). He is a reviewer/guest editor for various international journals (Design Studies, Automation in Construction; AIEDAM, ITCon), and reviewer/chair for various international conferences (CAAD Futures; DCC, CAADRIA; CONVR; ANZAScA; IASDR) in the field of architectural and design computing. He has been identified as an Emerging Research Leader during 2011-2012, and received the Pro Vice-Chancellor's Award for Research Excellence at the University of Newcastle in 2010. Ning\u2019s career highlight includes being a Chief Investigator of an ARC Discovery Project (2010-2013) to develop computational design analysis of 20th Century canonical buildings; and being the Research Leader of a Cooperative Research Centre for Construction Innovation (CRC-CI) project (2007-2008) to examine the use of BIM as collaboration platforms for the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. In the BIM project, he has collaborated closely with leading industry partners and government sectors such as Bovis Lend Lease, Woods Bagot, John Holland, Thiess, Leighton Contractors, the State of Queensland and Sydney Opera House. He has also led or participated in various research projects on design grammars, procedural content generation in game environments, collaborative design in 3D virtual environments as well as mobile computing in design, at the University of Newcastle and the University of Sydney. He was a visiting scholar at Columbia University in 2002 and at MIT in 2011.}",
