    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6086=5. Next, as illustrated in FIG. 10, the gold heater layer 30, 31 is deposited. Due to the fact that it is difficult to etch gold, the layer can be conformally deposited and subsequently portions removed utilizing chemical mechanical planarization so as to leave those portions associated with the heater element. The processing steps 4 and 5 basically comprise a dual damascene process. 6. Next, a top PTFE layer is deposited and masked and etched down to the sacrificial layer as illustrated in FIG. 11 so as to define the heater shape. Subsequently, the surface of the PTFE layer is plasma processed so as to make it hydrophilic. Suitable processing can exclude plasma damage in an ammonia atmosphere. Alternatively, the surface could be coated with a hydrophilic material. 7. A further sacrificial layer is then deposited and etched as illustrated in FIG. 12 so as to form the structure for the nozzle chamber. The sacrificial layer is then masked and etched in order to define a deposition area for the nozzle chamber walls. 8. As illustrated in FIG. 13, the nozzle chamber is formed by conformally depositing three microns of nitride and etching a mask nozzle rim to a depth of one micron for the nozzle rim (the etched depth not being overly time critical). Subsequently, a mask is utilized to etch the ink ejection port 35 in addition to the sacrificial layer etchant holes 36. 9. As illustrated in FIG. 14, the backside of the wafer is masked for the ink channels and plasma etched through the wafer. A suitable plasma etching process can include a deep anisotropic trench etching system such as that available from SDS Systems Limited (See) \u201cAdvanced Silicon Etching Using High Density Plasmas\u201d by J. K. Bhardwaj, H. Ashraf, page 224 of Volume 2639 of the SPIE Proceedings in Micro Machining and Micro Fabrication Process Technology). 10. As illustrated in FIG. 15, the sacrificial layers are etched away utilizing a sacrificial etchant such as hydrochloric acid. Subsequently, the portion underneath the actuator that is around the ink channel is plasma processed through the backside of the wafer to make the panel end hydrophilic.}",
