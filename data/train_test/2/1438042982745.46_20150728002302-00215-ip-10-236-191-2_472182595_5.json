In lieu of the proximity detector 14, an optical device may be employed if, for example, the velocity of a nonmetallic gear is to be measured. ______________________________________TEST GEAR TEETH TEETH PER SAMPLE______________________________________181-200 10161-180 9141-160 8121-140 7101-120 6 81-100 561-80 441-60 321-40 2 1-20 1______________________________________ The selection of N determines the number of gear teeth 12 which must traverse the proximity detector 14 for a sample period. The accuracy of the instrument depends upon the number of pulses counted per sample. The larger N, the more accurate the count received and stored by latch 52. Conversely, the resolution of the instrument depends upon the number of sample periods obtained by the instrument per revolution of gear 10. The smaller N, the shorter the sample period. More samples can be acquired per revolution of the gear 10 with higher resolution. Hence, by selecting the number of teeth per sample period, the operator is allowed to select the optimum sample period to maintain the desired accuracy of the instrument without sacrificing resolution. The chart below provides an example of the setting of the thumb wheel switch unit 18 for gears having the number of teeth shown. Referring to FIG. 2, multiplier 30 is shown. The input of the multiplier is a series of pulses at the frequency",
