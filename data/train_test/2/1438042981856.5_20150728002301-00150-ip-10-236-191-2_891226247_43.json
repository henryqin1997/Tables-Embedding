However, we're paying 1600 a semester for a meal plan and only get 450 max in mocs bucks which is a rip off., 284158=I visited this campus during the 2013 Fall Visit Day. The students and facility were warm and full of spirit, but the campus visit experience fell well short due to logistical issues. Visiting campus with several hundred other families, listening to speeches over a horrible public address system, being herded around the campus in large groups was not a positive experience., 359447=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 351207=I got accepted to UTC a few months ago and I cannot wait to attend! I will be a freshman in the Fall 2015 semester! Go Mocs!, 204406=Not very challenging compared to other schools. May be hard for students who had easy classes in high school., 2351=Chattanooga is a very beautiful place and the campus is small enough to pass at least someone you know everyday. Classes are medium in size and you can always get individual help from professors or tutors. The food is good ranging from Quiznos and Chik-fil-A to wraps, sushi and salads. The brand new gym is wonderful and the Aquatic center, once completed Fall 2010, will be decked out with a swimming pool, lazy river and water slide. There are plenty of clubs, intramurals, etc. to join and the musical performances are great. Plenty of things to do on and off campus with downtown within walking distance.}",

Taking challenging classes is great here, I can push myself to learn even more by doing this. There are plenty of opportunities to explore a wide variety of classes for those who are undecided through general education requirements.

The campus is just the right size and it is close to all the downtown Chattanooga attractions so if you want to go to the aquarium, you just walk down the hill. Tips for prospective students",
