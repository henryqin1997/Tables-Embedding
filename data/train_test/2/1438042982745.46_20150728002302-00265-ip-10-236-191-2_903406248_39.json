            "Our Lady of the Lake University has been voted the safest campus in San Antonio for 7 years straight. We have actual San Antonio Police Department officers on campus 24/7, 365 days a year. There is also a non-emergency number provided to the students for when they find themselves on campus late at night and feel like they need an escort to feel safer or when a student is having car trouble, the officers always try their best to help them out.",
            "There is also the Greek life offered: the campus has 2 fraternities and 3 sororities.",
            "The campus offers over 50 clubs and organizations to students varying from Bilingual club, to the Mizummi Anime club!",
            "The campus is also only 8 minutes away from downtown San Antonio and is near to the ViA bus, which is the public transportation offered here in San Antonio. The university is also at walking distance from various fast food restaurants. Throughout the year, the Resident Assistants in the dorm halls host a variety of free activities for the residents that include arts and crafts, socials, or food!",
            "The chefs try their best at accommodating to the students. There are different specials offered throughout the day, changing based on the day of the week. Our Lady of the Lake's Sister Annie B's cafeteria offers breakfast, lunch & dinner. The only downside is that the cafeteria tends to be closed when the university is closed, which is not a good thing for students living on campus throughout the holidays.",
            "The university encourages students to live on campus their first year, which is why a student deciding to live on campus obtains a scholarship that has a higher value. Having a roommate can definitely be a challenge, especially if you are an only child, but if you enter with an open mind, it can most definitely be an exciting experience!",
            "The various classes offered at Our Lady of the Lake University help develop a well-rounded student. There is a program here, for all freshmen, where they are required to take an APPS course where they teach you methods on how to become a successful college student. You gain skills in this course that will help you through out your years at the university such as: researching skills, organization skills, note-taking skills, etc.",
            "Study for your SAT's! The university gives you a scholarship at a higher monetary value when your scores are better. Take a friendly campus tour so that you may get the homey feel of the campus. Preferably during school hours so that you may see how lively and friendly it is here!",
            "Our Lady of the Lake University is an major community-based university. It is a university where a student can develop personal connections with professors and staff quite easily. The university strives to help students gain experiences that will help them make their way to graduate school."
