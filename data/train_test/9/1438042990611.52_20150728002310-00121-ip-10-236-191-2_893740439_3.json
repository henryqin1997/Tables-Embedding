            "GET INVOLVED!!! Keep in mind that you are going to college for academics, but if you sit in your room all day studying, you will be miserable at your college. Get to know people and make friends quickly. The more involved you are, the more people you will get to know. However, once again, academics come first, so make sure you don't over-commit yourself. Also, keep in mind that although the stereo-type of college is heavy drinking and partying, you can get through school without it. There are plenty of people who feel pressured to drink because everyone is doing it. There are plenty of people who don't drink in college. Just don't be pressured into it. If you do choose to drink, BE RESPONSIBLE. Don't drink as much as you can just to get drunk. You have too much to lose.",
            "No matter where you go, college will be expensive. Gannon is very good about giving as much financial aid as possible, but it's still a lot of money for school. Definitely worth the price though. Education is so important, you need to insure that you get a good one.",
            "The more you get involved, the more you get to know people. Everyone here is like a second family. The students are extremely friendly, and you'll know someone where ever you go. Also, being in the middle of downtown Erie, there's a lot of stuff to do, whether it's riding the Erie buses to the mall (free with your Gannon Id!), going to the sports games downtown, seeing a show at the Erie Playhouse, or just hanging out on campus.",
            "GU has some amazing teachers. I am going into my senior year, and I can honestly say that I have yet to have a teacher that I hate and would never take again. They are all very knowledgeable and provide new challenges for you every single day of class."

On campus the Activities Programming Board usually does different events every month and has something going on at least once a week if not more. Every month they show a movie that is popular and is just about to be released, so you get the pleasure of seeing it for free, before it's released on DVD. They bring in different comedians and celebrities to talk to you. We just had Matt Roloff from TLC's Little People Big World and that was a HUGE hit on campus. They also have craft nights and bingo nights, along with many other events. At the end of the year there is springtopia which is a week long of fun events scheduled all day each day to have last min fun before finals week starts. Every two years there is a big concert that is held featuring big name artists, such as Jason DeRulo, We The Kings, The Maine, Mayday Parade, The Fray, Andy Grammar, and Jacks Manequin. Off campus there is so much to do as well, there is events at the bayfront, 0.5 miles from campus in walking distance. There is Presque Isle State Park which is 5 miles from campus within running and biking distance. It has 11 beaches and fishing and plenty of other fun events. Downtown there are many bars and clubs to hit up if you are of age. There's also an ice skating rink as well as bowling alleys. Up the road a little ways is the Erie Zoo which is free on Sundays. And of course there is a large shopping mall, which is accessible by driving or taking the bus which is free with your student ID., 14031=Gannon at face value is relatively expensive. Financial aide is really good though, and once you get your award letter you can send a letter back with an argument to try and get more financial aide. I did this because I increase my SAT score the second time I took it and also increased my GPA my senior year. I ended up getting $1000 more per year!}",
