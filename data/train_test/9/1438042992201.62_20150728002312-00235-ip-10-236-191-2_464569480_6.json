No. 798,595, filed Nov. 15, 1985 and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention. In this system, when a system bus line is freed, any requestor wishing to use the bus asserts a request line. All requestors that have asserted their request line in the clock cycle in which the busy line was free will be provided with access to the bus in order of a predetermined priority ranking the requesting modules. When the last of these requestors has been granted the bus, the busy line is freed for a new set of requestors., 17335=This is a continuation of copending application Ser. No. 07/416,254 filed on Oct. 2,1989 now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Of course, it should be understood that various changes and modifications to the preferred embodiment described above will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, instead of decrementing a maximum packet count and comparing to zero, an equivalent system could increment a count value from zero and compare the value with a maximum packet count. These and other changes can be made without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention and without diminishing its attendant advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the following claims. Values received by the arbitration unit register are interpreted by the arbitration unit in accordance with the various formats illustrated in FIG. 8. When bits 0 and 1 are both zero, the arbitration unit register loads the packet count register file with a packet count maximum for one of the nodes. The next two values are used for loading a test value into the 16 bit counter 64. The value beginning with 100 is used in error detection for forcing and clearing errors. The value beginning 101 is used for writing the maximum system packet size into the maximum size select register 58. The final value provides for miscellaneous functions. For example, in the preferred embodiment, if bit 7 is asserted that means to disable the grant output buffers. Assertion of bit 8 in the final test and miscellaneous",
