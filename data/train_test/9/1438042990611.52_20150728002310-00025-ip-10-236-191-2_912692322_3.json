Along with academics there are plenty of clubs and sports teams you can join. It's just a great school in general. You'll love it here! Tips for prospective students Turn in you assignments on time. Get some sleep. Don't procrastinate. Don't be afraid to make some friends. Don't know how? Take your books or your laptop and study in the common area of your residence hall. Everyone studies out there. You're bound to make a friend or two. Bang for the buck This school is definitely worth it, but it's not exactly cheap. If I didn't love it, I wouldn't be here. Am",
