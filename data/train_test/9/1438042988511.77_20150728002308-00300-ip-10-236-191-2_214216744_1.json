Since hackathons are great ways to collect interesting ideas and people, I thought about whether I wanted to join and what I might do. It\u2019s easier to generate ideas when you have a particular focus, so I reflected some more on what I\u2019d started thinking about tech and the home., 57271=2015-04-20j Wearables, IoT, and the home \u2013 index card #tech-and-home, 4957=I started looking into alternatives. It seems wardrobe stylists work on commission, so you should plan to spend a good chunk of money \u2013 maybe $500 or $1000, which was more than I wanted to do at that moment. The custom dressmakers I asked quoted me rates around $250 for a single garment (although I didn\u2019t ask if they\u2019d reduce it for a super-simple pattern). Online tailors had very mixed reviews.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Where did the time come from? It\u2019s hard to say, since I was changing some of my other routines too. Anyway, I analyzed a weekly summary of my time records, correlating different categories with the time I tracked under sewing. Alternatively, you could use a higher rate \u2013 say, my consulting rate \u2013 since I could theoretically be working instead of sewing. But I don\u2019t particularly feel like working more. If I did, there would be other activities I would cut back on first, like playing video games, or reading fiction. You can analyze time trade-offs by assigning an arbitrary value to them. You might use minimum wage, or the replacement cost of hiring someone to take on some of your lower-value activities for you. For example, you might use $15/hour as a replacement cost, since that seems to be the going rate for a housekeeper in Toronto. If so, then my tops have cost an average of $110 or so. I expect future tops to use nicer fabric but require less time, so the estimated cost will likely be $75-100 per top. The bulk of the cost is really time.

There\u2019s this feeling of freedom that comes with knowing that I don\u2019t have to rely on manufacturers and retailers to make things I like. I might even be able to come up with things that I wouldn\u2019t be able to find in stores. If things wear out, I can repair or replace them. I have two more tops on the go, so that should bring me to a total of eleven cotton/polyester tops and seven 100% cotton ones. I think I\u2019ll hold off on sewing more tops after that. Maybe I\u2019ll sew containers and bags to use up my scraps, and then I\u2019ll think about sewing other things I wear. I\u2019m not interested in sewing things for anyone else (aside from family, maybe), so don\u2019t bother asking me. <laugh> Anyway, it was a pleasant surprise to find out that it was easy to reduce the high-stress, low-value activity of shopping with something I enjoy much more. =) Add",
