PCCP pay items option of Bidder A was awarded for this contract. INDOT compared the estimated cost with actual low bid costs of both pavement types. The following table shows the cost comparison with low bid of those pavement items that were relative to the mainline pavements and relative to this alternate bid for pavement type. All other items in the bids were common to both types of pavement. Shoulders and \"S\" Lines are to be HMA.
