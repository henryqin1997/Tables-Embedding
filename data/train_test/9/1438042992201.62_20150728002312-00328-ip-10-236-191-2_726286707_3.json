He coached the 1987-88 season at George Mason (20-10), the next six at Providence (108-76) and the following four at Clemson (74-48).

The senior forward was named Top of the World Classic and All-College Tournament MVP, and was also named to the Sooner Holiday Classic All-Tournament Team. Additionally, he earned Big 12 Player-of-the-Week acclaim Dec. 14. Najera, who shot .415 from the field and .642 from the free throw line last year, has posted .459 and .711 marks so far this season., 43006=Voted 1996 New England Player of the Year at Salisbury(Conn.)

He also contributed six rebounds and five assists in the 91-76 victory and went on to earn Top of the World Classic All-Tournament Team honors. Raymond's 29-point outburst is believed to be the second-highest scoring total by a Sooner in his collegiate debut.

But the Sooners pushed their advantage back to 12 less than two minutes later thanks to a Stone basket and a pair of Najera three-point plays. The win was OU's fourth straight in Lubbock.
