            "Kent is very good with campus safety. Kent State has campus police all over at all times. There is also campus phone stations set up all over campus if you ever need help.",
            "Kent is ALL about their Greek Life. I am a part of Kent's Greek life as a Chi Omega. Kent's Greek is strictly no hazing and it's an amazing life to get involved in. As a Greek community, we are extremely supportive of each other. Each organization is great at community service and giving back to the community through service and philanthropy. I definitely recommend becoming a part of Kent State Greek Life.",
            "Kent has over 250+ clubs and activities you can get involved in. If there's something you want to be a club, get together 4 people and go to an administrator to get the club officiated. You name it and it's probably a club here.",
            "Kent State is great for any type of student. There is something for every type of student at Kent. Kent is also known for the fashion program which is 3rd best in the country, so Kent is very good for a student who wants to go into fashion.",
            "Kent State University has something called black squirrels and the black squirrel festival. In February 1961, Lary Woodell brought a pair of 2 black squirrels to Kent from Canada. You won't find black squirrels anywhere else. The black squirrel is now known as the unofficial mascot of Kent State.",
            "Kent is awesome on financial aid and it's relatively affordable. Financial advisors are always willing to work with you on your situation.",
            "Join Kent State Greek Life and there's tons of things to do for fun with that. Also, Downtown Kent was just renovated and updated and there's a bunch of little shops and restaurants to go to as well. There's also a bunch of bars (if you're of age) you can go to.",
            "Lots of great food options, sometimes annoying to walk to, but that's just pure laziness. Love eating in the Hub which includes Subway, Archer Treachers, Nathan's Hot Dogs, Ambrosia, Einsteins, and Jump (asian food). Also, there's Prentice, and Eastway Cafe, and Tri Towers Market and Rosie's. Rosie's is open 24/7 and it's great for late night eats.",
            "Dorm life at Kent is a great experience. My first year I lived in Eastway which is the all freshmen building and I loved it. There is a market and cafe in the same building and it was a great way to meet people. For my second year, I live in Centennial E. Centennials are much more calm and laid back, but the atmosphere is great for studying and the dorms are very home like and they are the nicest dorms on campus.",
            "I am in the major of hospitality management and I LOVE it. Professors are always willing to help you succeed and improve. Never be afraid to contact your professors. Most of my professors have ben very willing to help me improve my grade and succeed in the class.",
            "1. Stay connected with your advisors, your advisors will help you with any questions you have about anything. 2. Get involved in a group on campus! There are over 250+ groups and organizations you can join 3. Stay focused and love the major you're in. If you're not enjoying it, then it's probably not the major for you.",
            "Kent State University is an amazing school that provides many organizations and resources to help you with your education. The faculty and staff are always around to help and answer questions. Kent State University provides skills and an education to further your life after graduation."

After May 4, safety is a top priority., 852539=Kent State University has something called black squirrels and the black squirrel festival. In February 1961, Lary Woodell brought a pair of 2 black squirrels to Kent from Canada. You won't find black squirrels anywhere else. The black squirrel is now known as the unofficial mascot of Kent State., 204422=Black squirrels basically run the campus, ever since a few were brought here in 1961 and heavily populated the area. The Black Squirrel is now our unofficial mascot., 790965=Be prepared for a hectic Halloween and a solemn May 4th., 860489=The May Fourth Memorial is great for a walk!, 583297=Every year in October there is the Black Squirrel Festival to celebrate Kent, Ohio's unique population of black squirrels. There is live music and many booths promoting different clubs and selling interesting items., 986622=If you are unaware, Kent state was the victim of a tragedy where the military opened fire on students protesting on May 4th, 1970, which some say ultimately led to the downfall of the Nixon administration and Watergate. There is a memorial and visitor center located at the scene of the incident on campus for anyone to visit, and each year on May 4th, they have a ceremony to honor those who died., 820637=There is a tradition of remembering the May 4th tragedy that happened on campus in 1970. There are also some beautiful landscapes through out campus. The sports teams also have a tradition with Akron University that is called the Wagon wheel Challenge. The two universities compete in all different sports with one another to get the most points and whoever wins gets the wagon wheel., 936529=The walls here at Kent State are way too thin and I can here every single thing my neighbors whisper. It tends to get very out of hand sometimes when I am trying to study, and the campus is too big to just get up and walking to the library at 10 o'clock at night., 299590=There is one location on campus that put Kent State on the map and a historical land mark. The May 4th memorial. In 1970, there was a protest at the now called May 4th park, where the U.S. shot at students. Four people ended up being killed. There are spots at the May 4th parking lot where they had died. Also every May 4th the parking lot is closed in remembrance of the tragedy., 930926=Black squirrels galore! Also in remembrance for those who lost their lives in the Kent State Shooting, we have a time of silence, no class on that day. It usually falls the week before or during finals (May 4th). There is a lot to learn about that day and it is nice to be able to learn about it., 903630=The campus is huge, bring good shoes. If you wait for the bus in December, you might get frostbite. The library has everything, I live here most of the time., 571210=The May 4th Memorial is a big deal on campus, it is a very respected piece of the campus. We cherish our history and hold it close to our hearts., 631574=There are a few traditions/events which happen in the month of May to reflect on the tragedy which happened with the National Guard shooting at Kent State on May 4th 1970., 880208=There is the black squirrel festival and there is a memorial for the four people that was shot and killed in 1970 by the Natitional guard, 333977=My favorite spot on campus is the May 4th memorial next to Taylor Hall, my friends and I spend a lot of time there at night sitting and talking., 515395=The May 4th memorial that commemorates the Kent State shooting, 892671=May 4th memorial activities to honor those lost during the tragic incident., 327394=Perhaps most infamously known for the May Fourth shootings, KSU holds a memorial service every year on that day to remember that catastrophic event, with guest speakers, a candlelit ceremony, and a day of remembrance to honor those who were lost., 994425=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 251742=In previous years Kent State University tried to sweep the events of May 4th 1970 under wraps. The Kent State Shootings are a grim legacy, though in the past ten years or so Kent has been properly respecting the lives lost on that day., 362177=There is college fest that we have and May 4 is a big day at Kent State as well., 287379=May 4th memorial, great trees., 3890=Tuition fees are reasonable. But room and board is EXPENSIVE, and fees are suppose to rise for Fall 2011 Semester. If you can, find an apartment or you could even rent out a room. But I do suggest that Freshman live in dorms, it gives you a chance to make friends and who knows they might even become your roommate.}",
