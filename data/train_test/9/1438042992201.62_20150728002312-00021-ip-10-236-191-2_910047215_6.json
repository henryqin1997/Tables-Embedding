            "Study for the SATs. It is a beatable test and with a good score you can get in many places. Also, challenge yourself and take some AP courses and see if you can get credit for any courses (you'll want to AP out of intro to bio if you can).",
            "Yes it can get a bit pricey but it's a school with a great reputation. If you're an engineer you are almost guaranteed a job after graduation. You learn a lot here, housing is nice, and food is okay, not great but better than high school cafeteria food.",
            "The people here are awesome. Everyone on my floor (Crockett 3!) are really nice. We all leave our doors open if we're home and just hang out with each other. I also am still very good friends with some of the people I meet at NRB (Navigating Rensselaer and Beyond) even though I don't live in the same building as them.",
            "I'm taking Intro to Comp Prog and I haven't ever done programming before so everything is new and exciting that class. Chem I and Calc II are review for me but I still am learning some things I didn't know before like vectors in Calc. In Minds and Machines (kinda philosophy class) I love learning all the different philosophical views on the nature of persons and consciousness."

Tips for prospective students It is not all-important to have a definitive major. Even if you do not come into Rensselaer with a clear idea of a major, there is a program for undeclared majors that allows exploration, and you can graduate on-time. Build a good work ethic now. Rensselaer's curriculum is rigorous, and it can be easy to fall behind. To prevent that from happening, develop good study habits that you can transfer to a college setting. Bang for the buck Rensselaer does come with a hefty price tag. However, Rensselaer is a well-recognized name in the business world. Many prestigious businesses attend the biannual career fairs with intentions of bringing in well-developed employees. The cost of Rensselaer",
