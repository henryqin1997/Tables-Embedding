    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While this invention has been described with respect to various specific examples and embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto and that it can be variously practiced within the scope of the following claims. As in the case of the first embodiment of FIGS. 1-5, the foregoing procedure may be repeated as many times as necessary to ensure that the desired number of tissue samples have been obtained, as indicated in the logic diagram of FIG. 8. Once the intact tissue specimen has been obtained, the cutting cannula 18 is returned proximally to its start position \"six\", which is the same as position \"one\", as illustrated in FIG. 6f, and the valves are maintained in the same state as in position \"five\". Thus, high vacuum pressure continues to be pulsed through the vacuum lumen 31 and to the region adjacent to the notch 24, 24b, such that medical waste continues to be drawn from the procedural site through the lumen 31 and distal port 26, 26b into an appropriate waste receptacle. While the constant low vacuum embodiment of FIGS. 1-5 is advantageous over the prior art for a number of reasons, the pulsing embodiment of FIGS. 13-15 may even be more advantageous for the purpose of effectively drawing blood and tissue waste away from the procedural site without interfering with tissue specimen recovery. For example, the embodiment shown in FIGS.",
