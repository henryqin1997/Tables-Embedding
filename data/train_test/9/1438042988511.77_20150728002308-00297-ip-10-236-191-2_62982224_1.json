It thrived with very little water, producing beautiful reddish-orange blooms with a purple cast to the sepals. It survived a -20 degree cold snap in December and so far this spring the crown has already tripled in size from last year. It seems to be doing fine with our extreme weather swings so typical of springtime in Denver (80 degrees one day followed by a hard freeze the next and repeated several times Feb - April).
