            "if you come to uci you must go to the annual dodge ball tournament!",
            "i would definatly say that i am getting what i pay for coming to uci. you can not put a price on the quality of the professors and ta's.",
            "at uci there are tons of things to do for fun. the beach is about 10 minutes away, there are plenty of shopping centers to go to and the movies is just a walk away.",
            "the dining hall food at uci is at best ok but that's part of the whole dorming experience! you definitely won't go hungry eating at the dining halls but you'll be glad to go home to your mom's cooking.",
            "the dorm life at uci is for everyone, not just students that are extroverted and enjoy parties. i am reserved by nature and was nervous about dorming but i found that it was not what i expected it to be. the students that i lived with were welcoming and respectful of my lifestyle and included me in all their activities and tried to get me involved.",
            "uci does not fall short on academic rigor. they recruit the best and expect you to be your best. the teachers do challenge you but they are also available to help you if you need it. the ta's are also very helpful with the rigorous curriculum.",
            "if you are planning to attend here and its possible you should dorm. it was one of the most amazing experiences that i've had. i am an introvert by nature and i was able to find a group of friends that i could spend time with and hang out with. there is a niche at uci for everyone.",
            "uc irvine is one of the most welcoming colleges that i have visited. the campus is beautiful and very clean. the professors are amazing and truly care about what they are teaching you."

Students usually know they can also shake the Mesa bridge by jumping on it in the middle and that there is a building that can project your own voice back to you if you stand in the right spot. Also, there is a taxidermized anteater (Peter!) in the study lounge., 728083=Keep your GPA up, get a good SAT/ACT score and write a good personal statement! UCI is upping its standards according to my incoming year (2012/2013 freshmen). Many people who seemed likely to get in did not, and UCI under accepted so they had to accept so many appeals., 698467=Dorm life is amazing! You meet different types of people who are easy to get along with and are fun to be around. I currently live in Crickhollow, which I must say is the best hall in UCI dorms of the 2012-2013 school year. Big thanks to our RA Colin for being so great in not only being a resident advisor but also being a mentor to us first years. There several activities at the dorms anywhere from movie and karaoke nights to hall mixer/party. To dorm in UCI is a great experience; Dorm life here makes the transition from high school to college easier and joyful., 222588=I spend a lot of my free time with my friends. I've made amazing friends at UCI and I have the most fun with them whether we're making a run to Cha at 12:50 am, shopping at the Irvine Spectrum, or at a fraternity event in AV., 462156=You can see the Disneyland fireworks at around 9:45 from the top of Engineering Hall., 93939=Well with the 32% increase it is getting a little expensive for a public University but it is a really good research University with enough mediums to help you learn what you are interested in and the quality is worth the money. Also they have a lot of Scholarships to apply for and not only GPA based so it can be a great relief for people who cannot afford College. I know people going to UCI that only pay $2000 all include per quarter. Although it is really expensive for out-of-state students and I would not recommend it for them., 309846=Research-oriented students. UC Irvine has one of the greatest research institutions and is renowned for its research achievements all over the world. If you're in social movements, UC Irvine specializes in social movements. Our Sociology Department has a great, prestigious set of professors who have both contributed to the realm of sociological research and social advocacy. May I recommend you get to know the following: Prof. Caesar Sereseres, Prof. Al Valdez, Prof. Charles O'Connel, Prof. Carter Butts... these are only but a few of the AMAZING faculty we have in the Sociology department. And THAT's just one department within the School of Social Sciences... GO SOCIAL SCIENCES!, 324026=If you are bored, even for one second at UC Irvine, you are doing it all wrong. UCI is a place for fun, learning, and involvement. http://www.uci.edu/features/2011/09/feature_bucketlist_110926.php This bucket list should be a requirement for graduation., 810798=Quarterly Undie run the weekend before finals. Shocktoberfest is a HUGE concert where we've had artists such as TYGA, Kendrick Llamar, etc.. Raggaefest is at the end of Spring Quarter where artist like The Expendables, Iration, Rebelution, and other top Reggae artists., 923332=The Academic rigor is slightly harsh. For English courses, you need to have good grammar in order to enroll to a low division writing class. Also, attendance is mandatory for many class such as Chemistry lab, writing, and discussions., 840202=eat around. and there's lots of beaches, huntington, newport, corona del mar, 22569=Study hard in high school and try to get at least a 3.7 GPA. Participate in as many extracurricular activities as you can. Try and score at least an 1850 in your SATs., 1141747=Brandywhine best place to eat lunch. Lot 5 is the temporary food for Mesa Court (Dorms) while they are building the new dorms and dinning hall (Complete in 2016 I think). Lot 5 has ok food, better than high school for sure. Pippins is in middle-earth(dorms) and has a larger variety, but might get extra protein from bugs in the food. They have panda, subway, wendys, a pub on campus and other dinning venues. Across the street is taco bell, chick-fila, chipotle, Cha, in-and-out, and other eateries. Overall the food on campus is ok, but across the street is best.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students This school is great for a student looking for a top-notch education. Yes, you can still have fun but it's also good to be studious. There are a lot of Bio Sci Majors at UCI and there are a lot of Engineering Majors, but that doesn't mean the English or Drama Major cannot get his/her moneys worth at this school. It is a very well-rounded school that not many people know about so take the time to research it. Our sports teams are excellent with some of the top in the nation, yet no one seems to know these things. Tips for prospective students My number one tip is to work hard in high school and to keep that up all the way through until high school is over. There is never a time for slacking off or letting yourself get behind. Working hard will prepare you for college. I had a difficult time with this for a while in my first year of college, but I had to remind myself to stay on task and really stay focused. In a college like UCI, there are so many students that it's a good idea to always try to be ahead because once you fall behind you stay behind. There are so many students working hard that you cannot let yourself down. I also suggest looking into colleges by doing",
