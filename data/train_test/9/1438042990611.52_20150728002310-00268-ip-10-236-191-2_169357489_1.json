Upton can trend anyway you want, the guy's on a playoff caliber club and he still does not seemingly really care much. He trots after balls, his work ethic has been called into question, Maddon has benched him more than once for disciplinary stuff, Longoria's fighting with him. The guy was much better on the road last year than at home, ok fine, but in 2010 he was better at home than on the road. What's the point there? Hey, maybe his due for a huge season, it would make sense as this one counts for him to get paid going forward, but history tells us that he might not be going all out to earn those big coins once he gets that fat contract in hand. I hope the Nats go in a different direction.dfh21, 19722=I am also ok with this at least for 2012. Werth is a very smart baseball player and I like the idea of him being the outfield captain between Morse and Harper, who are less experienced. If he plays there for one year and then we pick up someone else it won't totally kill his body for the rest of his contract. I would rather have the organization wait for the right player since contracts seem to be going for many years right now and trades can use up a lot of prospects. Spend the money and prospects wisely because you will be living with the player for a long time.So \u2013 I haven't heard many posters quaking in fear that the Marlins have picked up the big Z. Good thing TPlush is not still here or we would have lots of brawling opportunities per season., 50102=An O's blog perspective on 're-setting\" the Nats' MASN deal to help pay for Prince Fielder\u2026http://birdswatcher.com/2012/01/05/would-fielder-indirectly-be-on-the-orioles-payroll/They get a few of the basic details wrong (e.g., the MASN deal is forever, not just 30 years), but the thrust is that Angelos could end up both losing Prince (as if signing him were really an option) and essentially paying for him (out of what would otherwise be MASN 'profits')., 133418=\"some\". Plural. Let's see 2 links to any reasonably authoritative sources who explicitly compare this clown, favorably, to Kemp. As near as I can tell you are an army of one, in your disproportionate worship of Upton. Let's see the links\u2026and the voices in your head don't count\u2026,Old dude clown what voices do you hear in your head? Howdy Doody?): http://metsmerizedonline.com/2012/01/2012-baseball-predictions-fred-wilpon-is-next-frank-mccourt.htmlhttp://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/joe_sheehan/12/20/predictions.2012/index.htmlDude you don't know sh*t from shinola. Best you shut that yap you jerk., 116042=BJ Upton has been chasing his potential for a long time now and he's loafing after it. I am not sure why I remind you of so much of anyone, but call me crazy, have the Nats not had less than steallar success with high potential, questionable attitude guys in CF?He isn't Elijah Dukes, Justin Maxwell (who actually had a good attitude just a pretty weak bat thanks to JimBo promoting him from A to the majors), Nyjer Morgan, nor even Alfonson Soriano. He's not anemic bat Ankiel (he wants to start even when he sucks is that a good attitude?)Upton's OPS+ has gone up consistently the last 2 years. That's usually a good indicator that he is due for a break out season. If the Nats trade, and extend before the season they will get the break out season and pay a lot less than they would if he becomes free agent.Upton 2011 AWAY: 330 PA, .275/.360/.841 .370 wOBA .206 ISO., 37653=\"\u2026but he looked perfectly at ease when tracking down balls hit to any direction.\"My eyes and memory respectfully disagree. He always looked a little uncomfortable, or sometimes even surprised when he made a somewhat difficult catch. Also, like Dunn used to drive me crazy with, Werth never charges those one-hoppers that could be outs with a quicker guy. He's too cautious. Balls flying over his head and past his glove. I agree with the commenter who said he didn't always look like he was really paying attention.I'm excited about this team for 2012, but I foresee a lot of knots in my stomach anytime that ball is hit out of the infield., 123207=The guy was much better on the road last year than at home, ok fine, but in 2010 he was better at home than on the road. What's the point there? IN 2010 Upton improved dramatically over 2009:BUT it is interesting to note that he was far worse away than at home. Although he had more home runs aways. That's a dramatic sea changethat sends a message.As for you points. Again this is not Elijah Dukes. He and his brother Justin have been well respected in the baseball community since their youth like Zim. As far as \"discipline\"? Its not like Upton made a lot of money (he will this year through arbitration)? There was nothing stopping Maddon from benching him permanently \u2026 now was there dfh21? Why didn't he? That in itself makes every single one of your points almost null and void. That means the manager might actually see Upton's side of the story., 26836=Perhaps the Nats are looking to a future of 1) signing Prince Fielder for first base; 2) trading Michael Morse now at optimum value; 3) keeping left-field warm for a Bryce Harper June call-up; 4) keeping Rick Ankiel as the center-fielder against righties with Jayson Werth as the center-fielder against lefties; 5) starting Mark DeRosa as the right-fielder against lefties and Werth as the right-fielder against righties., 36718=Strongly disagree on Morse/Dunn evaluation of anon 8:59. Morse covered left well enough. He misread a few balls but overall he got to what he was supposed to. Dunn caught only what was hit to him. Morse runs like a giraffe but he he's better than Dunn, Willingham, Gomes, etc\u2026. By a lOng mile., 117547=Bowdenball said\u2026Keeping Harper in the minors for a few months might save the Lerners a few dollars after the 2014 season10MM is not a few dollars\u2026, 111855=John C and others:You said that if Harper started the year in the majors instead of being called up later in the season, he would hit free agency a year earlier. This is said frequently but I'm pretty sure it's wrong. It would allow him to gain another year of arbitration, but it eligibility for free agency is tied only to years of major league service (time on the 40 man roster). Keeping Harper in the minors for a few months might save the Lerners a few dollars after the 2014 season, but it won't allow the team to control his rights for an extra year. That clock begins ticking when he appears on the team's 40 man roster during the season.Once you understand this, you can begin to see why many people are projecting that he could make the club on opening day if the Nats fancy themselves contenders in 2012., 66965=Me, too, and I couldn't convince my husband to go again this year. Maybe AFL, though\u2026At least it wasn't 18 degrees when I got up this morning. :-)MicheleS said\u2026 NatsJack\u2026 REALLY JEALOUS! Not sure if I am going to get down there this year! January 6, 2012 11:29 AM, 11124=I think Brown is still in the picture, but probably not for 2012. He had a rough year last year, despite earning the September call-up.Brown hit just .235/.326/.402 last year at Syracuse. In 2010, split between AA and AAA for Oakland, he hit .283/.370/.466. If Brown can put up numbers like he did in 2010, he will jump back into the long-term CF picture., 70064=NatsNut @ 11:49 \u2013 it's not that Werth would play CF until Harper comes up, it's that he would shift to CF once Harper arrives. In the first X weeks of the season, Werth would be in RF and ((fill in the blank, likely a platoon)) would be in center. Werth would only move over to CF to give Harper a corner., 122393=Will said\u2026 Wow the Padres got hosed! Why weren't the Nats in for Rizzo, if all it would have taken was Henry Rodriguez and Jeff Kobernus?anuary 6, 2012 2:26 PMExactly what I was thinking, 26062=2010 Jayson Werth like performance at the plate erases any potential shortcomings in CF. Perhaps an oversimplification but sounds good to me., 162939=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 46216=Ouch, Soriano has $54M coming thru 2014. Wow.dfh21, 118342=@Bowdenball: Mark Z. says Harper becomes a free agent a year earlier if he's up at the start.Mark Zuckerman said\u2026Just to clear this up, here are the different scenarios for when Harper debuts and how that affects his arbitration/free agency status\u2026\u2013 If Harper is on the Opening Day 2012 roster (and if he stays in the majors for six years without any demotions), he would become a free agent after the 2017 season.\u2013 If Harper starts 2012 in the minors and is promoted before roughly mid-June, he wouldn't become a free agent until after the 2018 season but would qualify for Super-2 status in 2015. Though he's already scheduled to earn a $1 million salary that season, there's a provision in the contract that allows him to earn an arbitration-level salary if he qualifies. So this scenario could cost the Nats several million dollars.\u2013 If Harper starts 2012 in the minors and is promoted after roughly mid-June, he wouldn't become a free agent until after the 2018 season and wouldn't qualify for arbitration until after the 2015 season. This scenario both saves the Nats money because it eliminates the Super-2 possibility and ensures another season of team control before Harper can become a free agent.\u2013###\u2013, 130050=I'm only partially facetious about this: I say ask JW. He's for sure in the outfield every day. If he's okay with center, I'm okay with it. If he has any reservations at all, I say honor 'em.NB: I'm still in the 2011 was a fluke camp regarding Morse, but I hope I'm wrong. It seems like he lit up only when he got to first base every day. Back in the outfield and I've got to see it., 65137=Great reading as always gang.Couple of thoughts -1. I asked about our boy BH in centerfield and liked and agreed with what Sofa said. It reminded me of Mickey Mantle at 19 when he was just getting started and the Yankees had an aging Dimaggio in RF who could not cover any ground. Bottom line was a short pop fly to shallow right center that should have been an easy play for Joe resulted in Mantle injuring his knee and that injury haunted him the rest of his career.2. I had read somewhere that Ankiel not only wanted a starting job but also wanted a two year contract. I am guessing after Crisp got 13 million plus for two years he is still holding out for that but hopefully you guys are correct and we will look like a better option as ST gets near.3. Loved Soriano in 2006 but have there been worse contracts then what the Cubs gave him? I remember people screaming about how cheap the Lerners were in not signing him but that was pure folly. The fact that he is still owed 54 million for the next 3 years and his game has fallen off a cliff is just the reality of these long term contracts. Sort of makes you wonder about Prince for 8 years or longer doesn't it?Have to reinforce how great the, 127434=That clock begins ticking when he appears on the team's 40 man roster during the season.Once you understand this, you can begin to see why many people are projecting that he could make the club on opening day if the Nats fancy themselves contenders in 2012.YOU don't understand it. Harper is already on the 40 man roster and has been since the day he signed. That doesn't affect anything. He becomes a FA after he has 6.0 years of major league service time at the end of a season. If he's on the 25 man roster on Opening Day, he'll get credit for a whole year at the end of 2012. If he comes up after the season starts, he gets less than one year credit, which means it would be one year later that he'd have more than 6.0 years of service time at the end of a season. So missing part of a season on the front end gives him an extra season on the back end. That's the only reason they need not to bring him up in April, no matter how well he's playing in spring training., 62595=As enthusiastic as I am about the Nats, their OF scares the bejesus out of me. For fun I compared the offensive output of the Nats OF against the Marlins, Braves and Phillies in 2011. It's not as bad as I thought, but it's still pretty scary. Right now the OPS for the top 3 Nats OFs from 2011 stacks up as 910/718/664. Compare that to the Phillies 871/847/750, the Braves 734/708/687 and the Marlins 893/797/744 and only the Braves OF looks worse from an offensive point of view. I hope the Nats don't end up burning a year of Bryce Harper in his prime by starting the season with him before he's fully developed simply because they don't have any other viable option. They need a third ML starting OF, and right now, regardless of where Werth stands with his glove on his hip, they don't have one. It isn't DeRosa, Cameron or Bernadina and it seems unlikely that its Brown or Harper in 2012., 150546=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows.

But to do this the Nats must first sign Prince Fielder in order to have enough major league now-past-prospects to attract the Rays. Boras knows this. The Marlins know this. But they also know that BJ Upton is a free agent next year. Further, although it isn't as bad as Dunn, his hitting at home is pretty anemic for a future star in the making. So, clearly Upton is not happy playing in his own park in front of his own fans. If the Rays replace him with someone who is more than willing to hit at home and on the road? And the Nats do have a guy from Florida who might fit that model.But its likely a trade could not be executed without an extension in place for Upton. But if this could be achieved, with Rendon, Hood, Goodwin, Freitas, Hague, Kobernus, Martinson, Ramsay, Kelso and perhaps Skoles plus Keyes on their way? Plus another draft and a more aggressive approach internationally? The Nats could build a winner that would last 5 years out in 2012.Lots of work for Ted Lerner \u2026 not just Mike Rizzo and company., 72551=Whatever anyone's Mark I Eyeball test says (and clearly opinions vary), Werth has played 123 games in CF and hasn\u2019t disgraced himself there. As Mark notes, his UZR/150 is positive. Using other metrics he seems just about league average. Werth's range factor in CF is either slightly above (RF/9) or slightly below (RF/G) average. His CF fielding percentage is slightly below league average (.976 vs. .989), but his career total zone rating in CF is positive, although only just (+1). The Nationals auditioned him there in September in part to see if he could still play CF, and while he\u2019s no Austin Jackson or Brett Gardner he wasn\u2019t lost out there.And signing Fielder shouldn't really impact Morse. The Nationals are likely to open the season with Werth in RF, Morse in LF, and a platoon of Mike Cameron and Roger Bernadina in CF. Harper won\u2019t start the season in DC \u2013 that would enable Harper to hit free agency a year earlier, and why would the Nationals want to give up a year of Harper at 26 for an extra month of Harper at age 19? If/when Harper is ready to come up, he slides into RF (kid has a gun). If the Nationals have Fielder, or if LaRoche is healthy and playing well at 1b, Werth moves to CF and the OF is Morse/Werth/Harper. If Fielder goes elsewhere and LaRoche is not healthy or is struggling, that\u2019s when Morse moves to 1b to make room for Harper. Morse is under team control for 2012 and 2013, so the team has time to ultimately decide what to do to maximize the talent they can put on the field. But suffice it to say that signing or not signing Fielder will have very little effect on Morse\u2019s playing time if Morse continues to rake the way he has the past couple of years in DC. The team has options that it feels comfortable with.Oh, and Dunn was an epically bad OF. A serious contender for worst OF in the last 40 years bad. A Nationals OF of Morse/Werth/Harper would be below league average defensively. But probably not as bad defensively as the Cardinals OF last year of Holliday/Rasmus or Jay/Berkman. And the Cardinals did all right, IIRC., 69036=I don't see a place for Ankiel on the club. And he's looking for a shot to play a bigger role thatn he'd get in DC anyway. Not sure he's going to get it now that his supply of bogus prescription HGH seems to have dried up. It is just ODD how he had so much power for the short period of time before 2010 and now it is somehow magically gone. So instead we have another doper Cameron in tow. Great., 132068=NB: I'm still in the 2011 was a fluke camp regarding Morse, but I hope I'm wrong. It seems like he lit up only when he got to first base every day. Back in the outfield and I've got to see it.He consistently hit the same way from 2009 \u2013 2011 whether in AAA or the majors. Advances stats show a marked consistency and surprising improvement in 2011. In 2009 he demolished 2 separate AAA leagues with his bat before promotion after losing a year to injury in 2008. In 2011 he a lot more doubles than he had before and increased the number of extra base hits. He also decreased strike outs and increased walks.Morse really is that good and still has some ceiling as he is just entering his prime. He could get better.}",
