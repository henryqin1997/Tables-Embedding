    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{1750=The core - including Johan Franzen, Henrik Zetterberg, Pavel Datsyuk, and Niklas Kronwall - still leads the team in most scoring categories and simply seemed to take a little longer to get going without its familiar blue-line leader in the soon to be Hall of Famer Lidstrom. Because their backs were put to the wall weeks ago with respect to even qualifying for the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Red Wings have been in playoff do-or-die mode for longer than most teams and will post a significant challenge to their round one opponent, the Anaheim Ducks. Despite their midseason streak, the Ducks have been trailing behind the Chicago Blackhawks for the entire season but ahead of their division rival the Los Angeles Kings, so Anaheim hasn't had the same kind of daily intensity. Therefore, the Red Wings could be poised to do far more than just show up for the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs; they could make a significant run, starting with the disposal of the Ducks., 14878=1/28/15: Detroit went into the All Star break with a head of steam, having won five straight. That is tied with Anaheim and Winnipeg for the longest active winning streaks in the NHL. The strong push has put them into second place in the Atlantic Division with 63 points. They trail the Tampa Bay Lighting by one point (but have a game in hand) and Montreal by two points (who have two games in hand on Detroit). In other news, the NHL announced that the Red Wings would be in a Stadium Series outdoor game next season. They will visit the Colorado Avalanche at Coors Field on February 27, 2016., 335=The Red Wings went 2-1 versus the Anaheim Ducks in the 2013 NHL season and both wins came on the road. The Wings are hoping to get out to a hot start on the road and then improve their performance at home in the Joe Louis Arena., 10367=11/5/14: Putting the standings and on-ice play to the side for a few minutes to wish Mr. Hockey, Gordie Howe well. Howe, who played for Detroit from 1947-71, suffered a stroke last week and is recuperating. He was Wayne Gretzky before Wayne Gretzky, and, in fact, Gretzky's famous number 99 was a tribute to Howe who wore number 9. The Red Wings faithful gave him a warm ovation last week, which puts everything into perspective. Here is hoping that Mr. Hockey makes a full recovery and is back soon. The Red Wings have a couple great home games this week against the Devils (Friday) and the Lightning (Sunday), 7138=10/1/14: The Red Wings are getting prepared to start the regular season in search of some redemption. Detroit kept their long-standing streak of making the playoffs alive in the 2013-14 season, but it was a short trip to the postseason. This year should be different as the injuries have healed (though there may be some new ones). On top of that, the team broke ground on a new arena/entertainment district in downtown Detroit. The new digs are expected to open in for the 2017-18 season and will replace the antiquated Joe Louis Arena, which opened in 1979., 7796=10/8/14: There is no denying that the 2013-14 season was a down year for the Red Wings. They managed to make the playoffs, again, but simply did not have the firepower to do any real damage due to a lot of injuries. One player they need to get back, if they are going to improve this season, is forward Pavel Datsyuk. The good news is that Datsyuk is practicing with the team again. The bad news is that he is not ready to play a real game yet. He is recovering from a separated shoulder, and unlike the movies, is not fully repaired by popping back into place. Consider him doubtful to start the season, but he should be ready soon enough., 4703=6/20/13: The Red Wings announced that they are going to get a new arena. Their new home will take a couple years to build, and will be located near Ford Field and Comerica Park - home of the Detroit Lions and Detroit Tigers, respectively. It is expected to cost $650 million, and the hope is that a unified downtown sports area will continue to revived the area. The Red Wings have played in Joe Lewis Arena since 1979. It is the third oldest arena in the league, behind Madison Square Garden (major renovation) and Nassau Coliseum (which the Islanders are abandoning in 2015).}",
