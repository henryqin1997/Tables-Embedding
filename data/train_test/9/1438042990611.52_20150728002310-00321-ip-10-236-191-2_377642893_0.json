Furthermore, \"divorce\" in this context is the breaking of an engagement, and the voiding of an obligation to marry the girl.

They were learned men, which at that time included study of astrology and dream interpretation. The Greek manuscript literally calls them \"mages,\" but no evidence exists that any of them practiced sorcery, thaumaturgy, or any similar art. Their number is not given in any extant manuscript. They brought three categories of gifts (see below), but they were not three in number and probably were a much larger party.
