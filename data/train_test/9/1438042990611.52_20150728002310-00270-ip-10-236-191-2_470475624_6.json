The game parameters 228, such as how, when and where particular images will appear on the display screen 210, how the game works and how to operate the various elements operably coupled to the computer 204, are stored in the memory 208. The electronic game 200 may be housed in a game housing 202 such as, by example only, those shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,820,460 to Fulton (Oct. 13, 1998) and U.S. Pat. No. Des. 404,436 to McGahn et al. (Jan 19, 1999)., 44321=[0006]FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary electronic game 200 as found in the art. An electronic game 200 typically includes a microprocessor or other computer 204 having a central processing unit (\u201cCPU\u201d) 206 and memory 208. The computer may be coupled to a number of peripheral devices such as, by example only, a display screen 210 (e.g., a cathode ray tube (\u201cCRT\u201d), plasma display, liquid crystal display (\u201cLCD\u201d), and/or a display based on light emitting diodes (\u201cLED\u201d)), possibly having a touchscreen input 212 (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,397 to Dickinson (Sep. 14, 1999)), and/or buttons, keys or other user input devices 214. Preferably a coin, currency or card acceptor device 216 (to accept a credit card, gaming card, smart card and the like) permits a player to activate a game play or place wagers. The electronic game may also include a separate scoreboard display 218., 43722=[0005] Electronic games and their methods and apparatus for use are also well known in the art. Electronic games include games of chance, games of skill, and games involving both skill and chance. Examples of several patents describing games of chance include U.S. Pat. No. 5,833,536 to Davids et al. (Nov. 10, 1998), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, U.S. Pat. No. 5,769,716 to Saffari et al. (Jun. 23, 1998), U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,460 to Fulton (Oct. 13, 1998) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,947,820 to Morro et al. (Sep. 7, 1999)., 47042=[0009] Existing electronic game displays typically include multiple images representing various aspects of a game such as a game portion, a credit total portion and a wager amount portion. Other electronic game displays include an additional bonus award portion to indicate an amount of a bonus award which may be won, typically through multiple games. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,851,148 to Burne et al. (Dec. 22, 1998) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,911,418 to Adams (Jun. 15, 1999)., 46072=[0008] Initiating an electronic game can be done as simply as by inserting a coin or, more comprehensively, for example, by inserting an identification card, such as a \u201csmart card\u201d having a programmed microchip or a magnetic strip coded with a player's identification and credit totals. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,265,874 to Dickinson et al. (Nov. 30, 1993), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 5,806,045 to Biorge et al. (Sep. 8, 1998) uses a writeable identification card, such as a smart card to eliminate the need for a network or direct connection between remote systems and a common controller or point database. Promotional point and credit information may be retrieved, recorded and updated using the smart card. Alternatively, it is known to transfer money to a game through an electronic funds transfer as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,902,983 to Crevelt et al. (May 11, 1999)., 42104=[0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/675,829, filed on Sep. 29, 2000, entitled \u201cMethod And Apparatus For Gaming Machines With A Tournament Play Bonus Feature\u201d, and which is expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.}",

[0092] The present invention has been described primarily in terms of a game or games of chance, both as to primary game play as well as to tournament game play. However, it is contemplated that the invention may be implemented with a combination of a primary game of skill and a tournament game of chance, a primary game of chance and a tournament game of skill, or a primary game of skill and a tournament game of skill, of course, games of combined skill and chance may also be used as either or both of a primary game and a tournament game. [0091] Further, it is contemplated that tournament entries may be made from gaming machines exhibiting different primary games, or multiple primary games. Thus, game-specific entry point accumulation criteria associated with different types of games (for example, card games and reel-type games) may be mathematically adjusted so as to be substantially equivalent. In other words, the entry point accumulation criteria would be implemented for different games so",
