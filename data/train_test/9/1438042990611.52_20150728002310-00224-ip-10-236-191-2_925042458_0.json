In these kinds of nature-inflicted situations, we are reminded what a tiny universe it is and how we can be our brothers' keepers.\u00a0 Thanks to International DJ Paul Harding for the excellent preview of African Summer at the Cedar Cultural Center, as well as bringing in some fine new releases from the Rough Guide catalog and giving us the heads-up about The Cat Empire, fun music in the skakin' beat from Australi-ska.
