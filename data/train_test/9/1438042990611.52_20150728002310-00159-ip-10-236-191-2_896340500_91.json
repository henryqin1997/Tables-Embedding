            "So many things to do...skiing is only an hour away. Camping is about the same, and there's an immeasurable amount of hiking. If you like the outdoors, Boise is the perfect spot: urban sprawl and innovation surrounded by easily accessible and diverse landscapes. If you like being in town, there's plenty of things to do downtown and at different locations as you get to know more people (which is easy considering the small but not too small size of Boise).",
            "There's lots of good food in Boise. With Boise State being right next to downtown, there's a load of places to choose from. Not to mention the availability of food on campus. My favorite spot is Einstein Brothers Bagel company right in the middle of campus.",
            "Dorms seem fun, although I've never lived in one myself. I would say that on campus housing, such as the low priced houses in the surrounding areas, are a much more fun way to go. It's awesome to have roommates that share your course load and there's plenty of fun things to do and people to meet within walking distance.",
            "The classes at Boise State are what you make of them. Yes, they require studying and hard work. But in some it's easy to skate by in light of all the stress. At the same time, it's important to realize that you'll take from each course what you want to take from it; you learn what you want to learn and you keep the knowledge that you want to keep.",
            "I would tell prospective students to be as active as you can: get ahead in planning, join clubs and organizations that sound interesting to you, and do everything you can to move forward. There's no end to what you can do as long as you want to do it.",
            "Boise State University is the kind of place that makes you become what you want to be. It has taught me that my education will be exactly what I make it. There is every opportunity to make something of yourself as long as you're willing to go for it."

I know I will enjoy the boise campus because while being located in a large city (30 miles wide) it still holds the great characteristics of a small school. Everyone on the campus was friendly and helpful during my Orientation (June 9th and 10th 2011). It felt like a place I could grow and learn happily. Even my parents fears were resolved during orientation., 442883=I'm excited to get started in the fall. I attended the first summer orientation in June. I will be staying on campus., 82462=the tuition rise in 2010 caused me to stop attending.
