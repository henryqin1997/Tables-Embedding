    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34539=It has been found that bone remodelling is controlled by peak strain, and that just a few cycles per day of strain above a certain level, e.g., 1000 \u03bc\u03b5, is enough to maintain bone. Strains above 1000 \u03bc\u03b5 and up to 5 percent, or 50,000 \u03bc\u03b5, proportionally increase new bone formation. It would be advantageous to provide a fusion cage that allowed the graft material to be exposed to such strain levels, whereby the graft would be able to mineralize more quickly than prior art implants., 35706=Furthermore, a certain load threshold is required to reach the optimal strain level. Therefore, the strain applied to the graft may never be adequate for the promotion of bone formation. The known cages are stiff and the load required to produce a strain >1000 \u03bc\u03b5 can be high., 45460=Once this displacement has been reached, contact between the upper and lower portions of the cage is made and the cage becomes very stiff, permitting only very small amounts of additional strain for increased loads. This feature allows identical strains to be placed on the graft regardless of the applied load, e.g., 200 N or 1000 N., 29512=This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/EP98/06621, filed Oct. 20, 1998, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by express reference thereto.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations It is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the exact configuration as illustrated and described herein. For example, it should be apparent that a variety of materials would be suitable for use in the composition or method of making the fusion cage according to the Detailed Description of the Invention. Accordingly, all expedient modifications readily attainable by one of ordinary skill in the art from the disclosure set forth herein, or by routine experimentation therefrom, are deemed to be within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. FIG. 11 shows fusion cage 1 implanted in an intervertebral space 14 between two vertebral bodies 12 and 13. FIG. 10 shows the spring rate of fusion cage 1 wherein the fusion cage coaxially provides a spring rate c1 upon compression until slots 6 and 7 close at their minimal widths h1 and h2. Upon further compression, spring rate c2 is achieved, which in one embodiment is 1 to 5 times greater than c1, until slots 8 and 9 close at their minimal widths h3 and h4, thus causing a further increase of the fusion cage stiffness with an unknown gradient of the spring rate. In FIG. 9, the fusion cage 1 as shown in FIGS. 5, 6, 7, and 8 is loaded so that the cage 1 is compressed so that slots 6 and 7, lying",
