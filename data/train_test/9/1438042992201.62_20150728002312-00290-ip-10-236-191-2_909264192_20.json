If you ask the reason it's because most students taking that class could apply for medical school., 95188=parking is awful so people are forced to park down a ways in the park which is not safe at night. there is also a parking garage a ways off campus but buses running to there stop at only 6:00 at night! walking all the way over there is not safe either! the only redeeming quality is that the campus provides security if you contact them and they will escort you to your car. still, considering how many night classes the campus offers the safety is a big issue., 48395=UNO is equipped with 200 programs of study and is home to a diverse population. Student to Faculty ratio at the University is 19:1, meaning that the staff is here to help you. Be prepared to work hard in order to achieve your goals, but as long as you take advantage of the many opportunites of resources, you will be just fine., 364348=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 29256=UNO has a lot to do for fun, it only matters what you think is fun. At the new and stunning HYPR Building they have: an inside/upper-level track, a rock climbing area, a spa, an Olympic size pool, workout station, basket-ball courts, and other courts and areas for classes like, ballet, yoga, zumba, etc. They have a multicultural hour every week where people from all over the world come together to play a game, like baseball or soccer, or to have a conversation and culture themselves. UNO has many sororities, and fraternities, clubs like the equestrian club, tennis club, quittage club, larping club, equality club, Christian clubs, Muslim clubs, etc. There is also always something going on with the college, for example the other week they had a local theme park give free admissions to students with their I.D. card from 9:00 until 12:00 in the evening.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Jenae from Omaha, NE 12/21/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 6 out of 6 people found this review useful. 2 of 91 Categories Comments Great for these types of students UNO is great for students who want a closed campus feel while still being in the middle of a metropolitan city. As long as you are willing to take advantage of all that UNO offers, you will succeed and enjoy your college experience here. Tips for prospective students If you aren't from Omaha, schedule a campus visit! During required orientation you will get a tour of the campus and an overview of the school, but if you are debating between schools, take the time to visit. Also, keep in touch with older students so they can show you tips on simple things from buying cheap books, building a good schedule, and having an successful first semester. Most importantly, get involved!! Even if you don't live on campus, join an organization so you make the most of college. Bang for the buck Of course",
