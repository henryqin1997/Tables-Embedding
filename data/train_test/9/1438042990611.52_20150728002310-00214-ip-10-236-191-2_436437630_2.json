            "MOBILE VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY SYSTEM - A method and apparatus for messaging within a mobile virtual and augmented reality system is provided herein. During operation a user can create \u201cvirtual graffiti\u201d that will be left for a particular device to view as part of an augmented reality scene. The virtual graffiti will be assigned to a particular physical location. The virtual graffiti is then uploaded to a network server, along with the location and individuals who are able to view the graffiti as part of an augmented reality scene. When a device that is allowed to view the graffiti is near the location, the graffiti will be downloaded to the device and displayed as part of an augmented reality scene.",
            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANAGING INTERACTIONS - A method and apparatus for managing interactions between participants of a shared virtual environment is disclosed. The method comprises establishing a communication session by a first participant of the shared virtual environment with a second participant of the shared virtual environment. A data stream is received by the first participant located at a first location from the second participant located at a second location. Using the received data stream, a view of the shared virtual environment for the first participant is generated. An audio of the received data stream is controlled by the first participant. A text of the controlled audio is generated and the generated text is displayed in the view of the shared virtual environment of the first participant.",

            "Multiple Participant, Time-Shifted Dialogue Management - A virtual environment server. The server manages time-shifted presentation data between multiple participants in a shared virtual environment system. The server includes a routing module configurable for coupling to multiple participants, a real-time data management module coupled to the routing module, a time-shifted data management module coupled to the routing module, and a data store module coupled to the real-time data management module and to the time-shifted data management module. Participant output presentation data is received from the participants, stored as real-time presentation data, and transferred to appropriate participants. In response to requests from a requesting participant to obtain time-shifted presentation data from a time-shifted participant and any influence participants, time-shifted presentation data is retrieved from the data store module and transferred to the requesting participant. Influence participants are participants whose input presentation data are influenced by time-shifted participant and whose output presentation data influence presentation environment of requesting participant.",

            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CREATING VIRTUAL GRAFFITI IN A MOBILE VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY SYSTEM - A method and apparatus is provided for easily creating virtual graffiti that will be left for a particular device to view. During operation a device will be placed near a first point that is used to define a boundary for the virtual graffiti. The device will locate the first point, and use the point to define the boundary. The device will receive an image that is to be used as virtual graffiti, and will fit the image within the boundary of the virtual graffiti. For example, the device may be consecutively placed near four points that will define a polygon to be used as the boundary for the virtual graffiti. An image will then be received, and the image will be fit within the polygon.",

To further enhance the user experience, the virtual graffiti can be dynamic, changing based on a context. For example, a user may leave a virtual graffiti message that changes with, for example, outside temperature, location, weather conditions, or any other context.",
            "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT - A communication system for workforce management is formed of a system controller managing a plurality of badges associated with workplace devices and employees within the workplace. The controller receives event indicators from the badges. These event indicators are analyzed by the controller to determine whether a task should be created and performed by at least one of the workplace devices and/or at least one of the employees. Task lists and device assignments are dynamically updated in response to current workplace conditions.",

For example, the device may be consecutively placed near four points that will define a polygon to be used as the boundary for the virtual graffiti. An image will then be received, and the image will be fit within the polygon. Additionally, a device may create virtual graffiti from an image and a boundary."
