Subsistence uses as authorized by this paragraph (m)(16) are permitted in Denali National Preserve and lands added to Denali National Park on December 2, 1980., 244875=(D) Residents of Newhalen, Nondalton, Iliamna, Pedro Bay, and Port Alsworth may take up to a total of 10 bull moose in Unit 9B for ceremonial purposes, under the terms of a Federal registration permit from July 1-June 30. Permits will be issued to individuals only at the request of a local organization. This 10-moose limit is not cumulative with that permitted for potlatches by the State;, 27254=Based on the public comments received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, the Secretary of the Interior, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014Forest Service, implemented Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for subsistence management regulations for public lands in Alaska, subparts A, B, and C, implemented the Federal Subsistence Management Program and included a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The following Federal Register documents pertain to this rulemaking:, 404843=(A) You may not use aircraft in any manner either for hunting of ungulates, bear, wolves, or wolverine, or for transportation of hunters or harvested species in the Noatak Controlled Use Area for the period August 25-September 15. The Area consists of that portion of Unit 23 in a corridor extending five miles on either side of the Noatak River beginning at the mouth of the Noatak River, and extending upstream to the mouth of Sapun Creek. This closure does not apply to the transportation of hunters or parts of ungulates, bear, wolves, or wolverine by regularly scheduled flights to communities by carriers that normally provide scheduled air service., 184998=(n)Unit regulations. You may take for subsistence unclassified wildlife, all squirrel species, and marmots in all Units, without harvest limits, for the period of July 1-June 30. Unit-specific restrictions or allowances for subsistence taking of wildlife are identified at paragraphs (n)(1) through (26) of this section., 282540=(B) You may not use motorized vehicles or pack animals for hunting from Aug. 5-25 in the Delta Controlled Use Area, the boundary of which is defined as: A line beginning at the confluence of Miller Creek and the Delta River, then west to vertical angle benchmark Miller, then west to include all drainages of Augustana Creek and Black Rapids Glacier, then north and east to include all drainages of McGinnis Creek to its confluence with the Delta River, then east in a straight line across the Delta River to Mile 236.7 Richardson Highway, then north along the Richardson Highway to its junction with the Alaska Highway, then east along the Alaska Highway to the west bank of the Johnson River, then south along the west bank of the Johnson River and Johnson Glacier to the head of the Cantwell Glacier, then west along the north bank of the Cantwell Glacier and Miller Creek to the Delta River;, 435785=(A) You may use bait to hunt black bear between April 15 and June 30 and between August 1 and September 25; you may use bait to hunt wolves on FWS and BLM lands;, 3291=This final rule establishes regulations for seasons, harvest limits, methods, and means related to taking of wildlife for subsistence uses in Alaska during the 2007-08 regulatory year. The rulemaking is necessary because the regulations governing the subsistence harvest of wildlife in Alaska are subject to an annual public review cycle. This rulemaking replaces the wildlife regulations that expired on June 30, 2007. This rule also amends the regulations that establish which Alaska residents are eligible to take specific species for subsistence uses. In addition, this rule revises the regulations for fishing seasons, harvest limits, methods and means related to taking of fish on the Kenai Peninsula for subsistence uses during the 2007-08 regulatory year. This rule also amends the customary and traditional use determinations of the Federal Subsistence Board., 233178=(B) You may not hunt in the Portage Glacier Closed Area in Unit 7, which consists of Portage Creek drainages between the Anchorage-Seward Railroad and Placer Creek in Bear Valley, Portage Lake, the mouth of Byron Creek, Glacier Creek, and Byron Glacier; however, you may hunt grouse, ptarmigan, hares, and squirrels with shotguns after September 1., 478624=(1) In the Kenai River below Skilak Lake, fishing is allowed with up to 2 baited single or treble hooks from June 16-August 31., 465219=(A) Residents of Ninilchik may take sockeye, Chinook, coho, and pink salmon through a dip net and a rod and reel fishery on the upper mainstem of the Kasilof River from Federal regulatory markers on both sides of the river below the outlet of Tustumena Lake downstream to markers on both sides of the river at Silver Salmon Rapids. Residents using rod and reel gear may fish with up to 2 baited single or treble hooks. Other species incidentally caught during the dip net and rod and reel fishery may be retained for subsistence uses, including up to 200 rainbow/steelhead trout taken through August 15. After 200 rainbow/steelhead trout have been taken in this fishery or after August 15, all rainbow/steelhead trout must be released unless otherwise provided for in this section. Before leaving the fishing site, all retained fish must be recorded on the permit and marked by removing the dorsal fin. Harvests must be reported within 72 hours to the Federal fisheries manager upon leaving the fishing location., 336692=(A) You may not take wildlife for subsistence uses on lands within Mount McKinley National Park as it existed prior to December 2, 1980. Subsistence uses as authorized by this paragraph (m)(19) are permitted in Denali National Preserve and lands added to Denali National Park on December 2, 1980;, 197869=(A) You may use bait to hunt black bear between April 15 and June 15;, 267556=(C) One moose without calf may be taken from June 20-July 31 in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve in Unit 11 or 12 for the Batzulnetas Culture Camp. Two hunters from either Chistochina or Mentasta Village may be designated by the Mt. Sanford Tribal Consortium to receive the Federal subsistence harvest permit. The permit may be obtained from a Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve office., 285649=(C) Upon written request from the Ahtna Heritage Foundation to the Glennallen Field Office, either 1 bull moose or 2 caribou, sex to be determined by the Glennallen Field Office Manager of the Bureau of Land Management, may be taken from Aug 1-Sept. 20 for 1 moose or Aug. 10-Sept. 20 for 2 caribou by Federal registration permit for the Ahtna Heritage Foundation's culture camp. The permit will expire on September 20 or when the camp closes, whichever comes first. No combination of caribou and moose is allowed. The animals may be taken by any Federally qualified hunter designated by the Camp Director. The hunter must have in his/her possession the permit and a designated hunter permit during all periods that are being hunted., 388852=(D) The taking of one bull moose and one musk ox by the community of Wales is allowed for the celebration of the Kingikmiut Dance Festival under the terms of a Federal registration permit. Permits will be issued to individuals only at the request of the Native Village of Wales. The harvest may only occur between January 1 and March 15 in Unit 22E for a bull moose and in Unit 22E for a musk ox. The harvest will count against any established quota for the area;, 246413=(G) The communities of False Pass, King Cove, Cold Bay, Sand Point, and Nelson Lagoon annually may each take, from October 1-December 31 or May 10-25, one brown bear for ceremonial purposes, under the terms of a Federal registration permit. A permit will be issued to an individual only at the request of a local organization. The brown bear may be taken from either Unit 9D or Unit 10 (Unimak Island) only;, 351527=(B) You may not use motorized vehicles or pack animals for hunting from Aug. 5-25 in the Delta Controlled Use Area, the boundary of which is defined as: a line beginning at the confluence of Miller Creek and the Delta River, then west to vertical angle benchmark Miller, then west to include all drainages of Augustana Creek and Black Rapids Glacier, then north and east to include all drainages of McGinnis Creek to its confluence with the Delta River, then east in a straight line across the Delta River to Mile 236.7 of the Richardson Highway, then north along the Richardson Highway to its junction with the Alaska Highway, then east along the Alaska Highway to the west bank of the Johnson River, then south along the west bank of the Johnson River and Johnson Glacier to the head of the Canwell Glacier, then west along the north bank of the Canwell Glacier and Miller Creek to the Delta River;, 189159=(A) You may hunt black bear with bait in Units 1A, 1B, and 1D between April 15 and June 15;, 238329=(i) If you have a trapping license, you may take beaver with a firearm in Unit 8 from Nov. 10-Apr. 30., 375881=(A) You may use bait to hunt black bear between April 15 and June 30; and in the Koyukuk Controlled Use Area, you may also use bait to hunt black bear between September 1 and September 25;, 38630=The Service has determined and certifies pursuant to the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, 2 U.S.C. 1502 et seq., that this rulemaking will not impose a cost of $100 million or more in any given year on local or State governments or private entities. The implementation of this rule is by Federal agencies, and no cost is involved to any State or local entities or Tribal governments., 161695=(7) If you are a Federally qualified subsistence user, you may sell handicraft articles made from the skin, hide, pelt, or fur, including claws, of a brown bear taken from Units 1-5, 9A-C, 9E, 12, 17, 20, or 25., 39174=The Service has determined that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 on Civil Justice Reform., 483357=(v) You may only take smelt with dip nets in fresh water from April 1-June 15. There are no harvest or possession limits for smelt., 475774=(i) For sockeye salmon at all fishery sites: June 15-August 15;, 8175=The State implemented a program that the Department of the Interior previously found to be consistent with ANILCA. However, in December 1989, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in McDowell v. State of Alaska that the rural preference in the State subsistence statute violated the Alaska Constitution. The Court's ruling in McDowell required the State to delete the rural preference from its subsistence statute and, therefore, negated State compliance with ANILCA. The Court stayed the effect of the decision until July 1, 1990., 171613=(6) Taking or assisting in the taking of furbearers by firearm before 3:00 a.m. on the day following the day on which airborne travel occurred; however, this does not apply to a trapper using a firearm to dispatch furbearers caught in a trap or snare., 267244=(A) You may use bait to hunt black bear between April 15 and June 30; you may use bait to hunt wolves on FWS and BLM lands;, 475882=(ii) For late-run Chinook, pink, and coho salmon at both Kenai River fishery sites only: July 16-September 30; and, 303760=(ii) You may not take wildlife, except for grouse, ptarmigan, and hares that may be taken only from October 1\u2014March 1 by bow and arrow only, in the Skilak Loop Management Area, which consists of that portion of Unit 15A bounded by a line beginning at the easternmost junction of the Sterling Highway and the Skilak Loop (milepost 76.3), then due south to the south bank of the Kenai River, then southerly along the south bank of the Kenai River to its confluence with Skilak Lake, then westerly along the north shore of Skilak Lake to Lower Skilak Lake Campground, then northerly along the Lower Skilak Lake Campground Road and the Skilak Loop Road to its westernmost junction with the Sterling Highway, then easterly along the Sterling Highway to the point of beginning., 12508=Because the subpart D regulations, which establish seasons and harvest limits and methods and means, are subject to an annual cycle, they require development of an entire new rule each year. Customary and traditional use determinations (subpart C) are subject to an annual review process providing for modification each year. Section __.24 (i.e., customary and traditional usedeterminations) was originally published in the Federal Register on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22940). The regulations at 36 CFR 242.4 and 50 CFR 100.4 define \u201ccustomary and traditional use\u201d as \u201ca long-established, consistent pattern of use, incorporating beliefs and customs which have been transmitted from generation to generation* * *.\u201d Since that time, the Board has made a number of customary and traditional use determinations at the request of impacted subsistence users. Those modifications, along with some administrative corrections, were published in the Federal Register as follows:, 36075=The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601et seq.) requires preparation of regulatory flexibility analyses for rules that will have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include small businesses, organizations, or governmental jurisdictions. The Departments have determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act., 357571=(B) You may not use a steel trap, or a snare using cable smaller than 3/32 inch diameter to trap coyotes or wolves in Unit 20E during April and October;, 351212=(A) You may not take wildlife for subsistence uses on lands within Mount McKinley National Park as it existed prior to December 2, 1980. Subsistence uses as authorized by this paragraph (n)(20) are permitted in Denali National Preserve and lands added to Denali National Park on December 2, 1980;, 42525=16 U.S.C. 3, 472, 551, 668dd, 3101-3126; 18 U.S.C. 3551-3586; 43 U.S.C. 1733., 8796=As a result of the McDowell decision, on July 1, 1990, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (Departments) assumed responsibility for implementation of Title VIII of ANILCA on public lands and waters. In anticipation of carrying out this responsibility, the Departments published temporary subsistence management regulations for public lands in Alaska in the Federal Register on June 29, 1990 (55 FR 27114). Because the State was unable to create a program in compliance with Title VIII, the Departments published final regulations in the Federal Register in 1992 (57 FR 22940, May 29, 1992)., 144317=Regulatory year means July 1\u2014June 30, except for fish and shellfish, for which it means April 1\u2014March 31., 317402=(A) Except for aircraft and boats and in legal hunting camps, you may not use any motorized vehicle for hunting ungulates, bears, wolves, and wolverine, including transportation of hunters and parts of ungulates, bear, wolves, or wolverine in the Upper Mulchatna Controlled Use Area consisting of Unit 17B, from Aug. 1-Nov. 1., 176138=(h)Removing harvest from the field. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters and hind quarters of caribou and moose harvested in Units 9B, 17, 18, and 19B prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of moose harvested in Unit 21 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the field or process it for human consumption. You must leave all edible meat on the bones of the front quarters, hind quarters, and ribs of caribou and moose harvested in Unit 24 prior to October 1 until you remove the meat from the fieldor process it for human consumption. Meat of the front quarters, hind quarters, or ribs from a harvested moose or caribou may be processed for human consumption and consumed in the field; however, meat may not be removed from the bones for purposes of transport out of the field., 450407=(A) You may not use aircraft in any manner for moose hunting, including transportation of moose hunters or parts of moose during the periods July 1-Sept. 14 and Jan. 1-Mar. 31 in Unit 26A; however, this does not apply to transportation of moose hunters, their gear, or moose parts by aircraft between publicly owned airports;, 357436=(A) You may use bait to hunt black bear from April 15-June 30; you may use bait to hunt wolves on FWS and BLM lands;, 10397=Consistent with subparts A, B, and C of these regulations, as revised December 27, 2005 (70 FR 76400), the Departments established a Federal Subsistence Board to administer the Federal Subsistence Management Program. The Board's composition includes, 163582=(k) The regulations found in this part do not apply to the subsistence taking and use of fish, wildlife, or shellfish regulated pursuant to the Fur Seal Act of 1966 (80 Stat. 1091, 16 U.S.C. 1187); the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (87 Stat. 884, 16 U.S.C. 1531-1543); the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (86 Stat. 1027; 16 U.S.C. 1361-1407); and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703-711), or to any amendments to these Acts. The taking and use of fish, wildlife, or shellfish, covered by these Acts, will conform to the specific provisions contained in these Acts, as amended, and any implementing regulations., 282225=(A) You may not take wildlife for subsistence uses on lands within Mount McKinley National Park as it existed prior to December 2, 1980. Subsistence uses as authorized by this paragraph (m)(13) are permitted in Denali National Preserve and lands added to Denali National Park on December 2, 1980;, 261196=(ii) A joint permit may be issued to a pair of a minor and an elder to hunt sheep during the Sept. 21-Oct. 20 hunt. The following conditions apply:, 39750=In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994, \u201cGovernment-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments\u201d (59 FR 22951), 512 DM 2, and E.O. 13175, we have evaluated possible effects on Federally recognized Indian tribes and have determined that there are no significant direct effects.

The Tonsina Controlled Use Area consists of that portion of Unit 13D bounded on the west by the Richardson Highway from the Tiekel River to the Tonsina River at Tonsina, on the north along the south bank of the Tonsina River to where the Edgerton Highway crosses the Tonsina River, then along the Edgerton Highway to Chitina, on the east by the Copper River from Chitina to the Tiekel River, and on the south by the north bank of the Tiekel River., 233596=(A) You may use bait to hunt black bear between April 15 and June 15; except in the drainages of Resurrection Creek and its tributaries., 19166=The Departments published a proposed rule on August 14, 2006 (71 FR 46423), to amend subparts C and D of 36 CFR part 242 and 50 CFR part 100. The proposed rule opened a comment period, which closed on October 20, 2006. The Departments advertised the proposed rule by mail, radio, and newspaper. During that period, the Regional Councils met and, in addition to other Regional Council business, received suggestions for proposals from the public. The Board received a total of 64 proposals for changes to subparts C and D. After the proposal period closed, the Board prepared two booklets describing the proposals and distributed them to the public. One booklet was for wildlife proposals Statewide, and the other was for fish proposals for the Kenai Peninsula; both were also available online. The public then had an additional 30 days in which to comment on the proposals for changes to the regulations., 21496=All of the rejected proposals were recommended for rejection by at least one of the Regional Councils. Detailed information relating to justification for the action on each proposal may be found in the Board meeting transcripts, available for review at the Office of Subsistence Management, 3601 C Street, Suite 1030, Anchorage, Alaska 99503, or on the Office of Subsistence Management Web site (http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/home.html)., 40198=On May 18, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13211 on regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, or use. This Executive Order requires agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions. As this rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 13211, affecting energy supply, distribution, or use, no Statement of Energy Effects is required., 26459=A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for developing a Federal Subsistence Management Program was distributed for public comment on October 7, 1991. That document described the major issues associated with Federal subsistence management as identified through public meetings, written comments, and staff analyses and examined the environmental consequences of four alternatives. Proposed regulations (subparts A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence hunting and fishing regulations (subpart D). The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February 28, 1992., 20122=The 10 Regional Councils met again, received public comments, and formulated their recommendations to the Board on proposals for their respective regions. The Regional Councils had a substantial role in reviewing the proposed rule and making recommendations for the final rule. Moreover, a Council Chair, or a designated representative, presented each Council's recommendations at the Board meetings of April 30-May 2, 2007 and May 8-10, 2007. These final regulations reflect Board review and consideration of Regional Council recommendations and public comments. The public has had extensive opportunity to review and comment on all changes., 285062=(B) Upon written request by the Camp Director to the Glennallen Field Office, 2 caribou, sex to be determined by the Glennallen Field Office Manager of the BLM, may be taken from Aug. 10-Sept. 30 or Oct. 21-Mar. 31 by Federal registration permit for the Hudson Lake Residential Treatment Camp. Additionally, 1 bull moose may be taken Aug. 1-Sept. 20. The animals may be taken by any Federally qualified hunter designated by the Camp Director. The hunter must have in his/her possession the permit and a designated hunterpermit during all periods that are being hunted;, 376088=(B) If you have a trapping license, you may use a firearm to take beaver in Unit 21(E) from Nov. 1-June 10;, 33368=An environmental assessment was prepared in 1997 on the expansion of Federal jurisdiction over fisheries and is available from the office listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. The Secretary of the Interior with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture determined that the expansion of Federal jurisdiction did not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the human environment and, therefore, signed a Finding of No Significant Impact., 33979=The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to accord subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public lands a priority over the taking of fish and wildlife on such lands for other purposes, unless restriction is necessary to conserve healthy fish and wildlife populations. A Section 810 analysis was completed as part of the FEIS process. The final Section 810 analysis determination appeared in the April 6, 1992, ROD, which concluded that the Federal Subsistence Management Program may have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but the program is not likely to significantly restrict subsistence uses., 22434=All of the adopted proposals were recommended for adoption by at least one of the Regional Councils, although further modifications may have beenmade during Board deliberations, and were based on customary and traditional uses or harvest practices, or on protecting fish or wildlife populations. Detailed information relating to justification for the action on each proposal may be found in the Board meeting transcripts, available for review at the Office of Subsistence Management, 3601 C Street, Suite 1030, Anchorage, Alaska 99503, or on the Office of Subsistence Management Web site (http://alaska.fws.gov/asm/home.html). Additional minor modifications have been made by changing titles of officials delegated to open or close seasons or set harvest restrictions. This was necessary because of office reorganizations and internal agency changes in official geographic responsibilities., 472383=(vii) Failure to return the completed harvest permit by May 31 may result in issuance of a violation notice and/or denial of a future subsistence permit., 474771=(ii) At the Kenai River Mile 48 site, dip netting is allowed while either standing in the river or from a boat, from Federal regulatory markers on both banks of the Kenai River at about river mile 48 (approximately 2 miles below the outlet of Skilak Lake) downstream approximately 2.5 miles to markers on both banks of the Kenai River at about river mile 45.5. Residents using rod and reel gear at this fishery site may fish with up to 2 baited single or treble hooks from June 16-August 31., 34698=This rule does not contain any new information collection requirements that need Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). This rule applies to the use of public lands in Alaska. The information collection requirements described in this rule are already approved by OMB and have been assigned control number 1018-0075, which expires October 31, 2009. We may not conduct or sponsor and you are not required to respond to a collection of information request unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number., 338038=(A) You may use bait to hunt black bear between April 15 and June 30;, 243271=(B) You may not use motorized vehicles, except aircraft, boats, or snowmobiles used for hunting and transporting a hunter or harvested animal parts from Aug. 1-Nov. 30 in the Naknek Controlled Use Area, which includes all of Unit 9C within the Naknek River drainage upstream from and including the King Salmon Creek drainage; however, you may use a motorized vehicle on the Naknek-King Salmon, Lake Camp, and Rapids Camproads and on the King Salmon Creek trail, and on frozen surfaces of the Naknek River and Big Creek., 35528=Economic Effects\u2014This rule is not a significant rule subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866. This rulemaking will impose no significant costs on small entities; this rule does not restrict any existing sport, commercial fishery, hunting and trapping on the public lands, and subsistence fisheries will continue at essentially the same levels as they presently occur. The number of businesses and the amount of trade that will result from this Federal land-related activity is unknown but expected to be insignificant., 260763=(B) One moose without calf may be taken from June 20-July 31 in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve in Unit 11 or 12 for the Batzulnetas Culture Camp. Two hunters from either Chistochina or Mentasta Village may be designated by the Mt. Sanford Tribal Consortium to receive the Federal subsistence harvest permit. The permit may be obtained from a Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve office., 474297=(i) At the Kenai River Moose Meadows site, dip netting and rod and reel gear are allowed only from a boat from Federal regulatory markers on both banks of the Kenai River at about river mile 29 downstream approximately 2.5 miles to markers on both banks of the Kenai River at about river mile 26.5. Residents using rod and reel gear at this fishery site may fish with up to 2 baited single or treble hooks from June 16-August 31.}",

Supplementary information: \u2191 Background \u2191 In Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 U.S.C. 3111-3126), Congress found that \u201cthe situation in Alaska is unique in that, in most cases, no practical alternative means are available to replace the food supplies and other items gathered from fish and wildlife which supply rural residents dependent on subsistence uses * * *\u201d and that \u201ccontinuation of the opportunity for subsistence uses of resources on public and other lands in Alaska is threatened * * *\u201d. As a result, Title VIII requires, among other things, that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretaries) implement a joint program to grant a preference for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife resources on Federal public lands and waters in Alaska, unless the State of",
