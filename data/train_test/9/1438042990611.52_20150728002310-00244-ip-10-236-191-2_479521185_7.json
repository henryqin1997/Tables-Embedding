    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6687=FIG. 14A is a simplified, partially schematic illustration of portions of the mode control panel 130 and the flight plan list display 151, configured to display information during unlinked operation in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. In one aspect of this embodiment, both the mode control panel 130 and the flight plan list display 151 include displays of flight control information arranged in three columns: a first column corresponding to lateral motion, a second column corresponding to vertical motion, and a third column corresponding to the airspeed of the aircraft. The mode control panel 130 displays the current control indicators 833 (shown as current lateral control indicators 833 a, current vertical control indicators 833 b, and current airspeed control indicators 833 c), each of which includes a corresponding current target indicators 963 a, 1073 a, 1183 a, respectively. The mode control panel 130 also displays the next control indicators 834 (shown as next lateral control indicators 834 a, next vertical control indicators 834 b, and next airspeed control indicators 834 c), with no next targets shown because the operation is unlinked. Unlink indicators 977, 1077 a and 1177 also highlight the unlinked aspect of the operation.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{100635=At least some of the same information (e.g., the targets) displayed on the mode control panel 130 can be presented on the flight plan list display 151. In a particular aspect of this embodiment, the flight plan list display 151 can include the current control indicators 833 a, 833 b, 833 c even if these indicators correspond to instructions input at the mode control panel 130 for unlinked operation. In a particular aspect of this embodiment, information corresponding to linked operation can be visually separated from information corresponding to unlinked operation, e.g., by a marker 1455 or by use of different colors or fonts. The flight plan list display 151 also includes subsequent control indicators 1453 for flight plan legs to be executed subsequently to the current flight plan leg., 86294=In a particular aspect of this embodiment, the automatic control of the aircraft's airspeed is not characterized by modes, but rather by targets along with information indicating the basis for the targets. For example, the current airspeed control indicator 833 c can include a current target 1183 a and the next airspeed indicator 834 c can include a next target 1183 b. Each of the targets 1183 a, 1183 b can include a numerical value of the airspeed to which the aircraft is being controlled and a textual indicator of the basis for the airspeed. For example, \u201cRestr\u201d can indicate a flight plan speed restriction, \u201cEcon\u201d can indicate an economy airspeed setting, \u201cFlap Lim\u201d can indicate a limit speed corresponding to a currently extended flap position, and \u201cFlap Ref\u201d can indicate a maneuvering speed corresponding to a currently extended flap position., 106379=If the clearance limit value represents a level-off that occurs after the next level-off in the flight plan (during climb or descent), it is shown in the appropriate line of the flight plan list on the flight plan list display 151, and the remaining legs of the flight plan are indicated to be uncleared. As the operator then changes the clearance limit value at the limit altitude display 1075, the flight plan list display 151 is automatically updated to indicate new cleared legs (as appropriate) and the clearance value is inserted into the flight plan list display 151. If the aircraft operation is subsequently unlinked, the clearance limit is deleted and, in one embodiment, is not automatically reinstated if linked operation subsequently is reactivated. An advantage of the foregoing arrangement is that the operator can clearly see by reference to the flight plan list display 151 which legs are cleared and which are not. This arrangement can be particularly useful when a clearance limit results in multiple flight legs being cleared., 90849=In one aspect of the foregoing embodiments, some or all of the indicators can be textual indicators, graphical indicators or a combination of textual and graphical indicators. The links 1184 e, 1184 f can change color or another characteristic when it is possible for the operator to change which target 1184 c, 1184 d is coupled to the first and second indicators 1184 a, 1184 b. In other embodiments, other indicators can also be displayed in different manners depending on whether or not the corresponding control option is available to the operator. For example, in one further embodiment, modes and/or submodes can be displayed in one manner if they are consistent with the selected target, and in another manner if they are inconsistent with the selected target. In a further aspect of this embodiment, the modes and/or submodes that are inconsistent with the selected target may be unavailable for selection by the operator. For example, if the operator chooses a target located above the aircraft's current altitude, the \u201cDES\u201d mode will appear differently to the operator and/or will be unavailable for selection by the operator., 105638=If the clearance limit value represents the next level-off altitude in the flight plan (during climb or descent), it becomes the current vertical target. Accordingly, it is displayed at the current target indicator 1073 a on the mode control panel 130 and is also shown at the appropriate line of the flight plan list at the flight plan list display 151. In a particular aspect of this embodiment, the flight segments or legs subsequent to the clearance limit are highlighted to indicate that they are not yet cleared (e.g., by providing a visual separator between cleared and uncleared segments, and/or by providing cleared segments in a different color than uncleared segments).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Additional related embodiments are disclosed in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10/746,912, entitled \u201cApparatuses and Methods for Displaying and Receiving Tactical and Strategic Flight Guidance Information,\u201d filed concurrently herewith and incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

If the clearance limit value represents a level-off that occurs after the next level-off in the flight plan (during climb or descent), it is shown in the appropriate line of the flight plan list on the flight plan list display 151, and the remaining legs of the flight plan are indicated to be uncleared.
