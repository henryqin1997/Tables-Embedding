State spent the first month of the season adjusting the pressure that came with being the preseason Atlantic Coast Conference favorite. Now Mark Gottfried\u2019s team is ready for a long homestand that could help the No. 25 Wolfpack build momentum before starting league play. Richard Howell had 17 points and 10 rebounds to help State beat Cleveland State 80-63 on Saturday in the Wolfpack\u2019s annual return to its historic Reynolds Coliseum on-campus home. Since starting 3-0 with a No. 6 national ranking, N.C. State (6-2) absorbed a 20-point loss to Oklahoma State in the Puerto Rico Tipoff championship and lost at third-ranked Michigan in the ACC/Big Ten Challenge. There was also an 82-80 squeaker at home against UNC Asheville in which the Wolfpack didn\u2019t go ahead for good until the final 4 minutes. Those performances seemed to show N.C. State needed time to adjust as they blended in three McDonald\u2019s All-Americans with four returning starters. The Wolfpack beat Connecticut at Madison Square Garden in the Jimmy V Classic Tuesday, then shot 55 percent and led comfortably most of the afternoon to start a six-game homestand that will keep the team in Raleigh until 2013. \u201cWe have learned that we have to play hard every night, every possession, every practice,\u201d Gottfried said. \u201cSometimes guys have to learn that. ... We\u2019re also learning that for the most part when you do have some attention around your program, you better bring it every night because teams are going to play better against you. We haven\u2019t been in that role before so we\u2019re learning that. \u201cI hope for these guys they just keep understanding if we keep paying a price every day and really commit to it, we\u2019ve got a chance to be good. But we\u2019ve still got a long way to go in my opinion.\u201d The message seems to have sunk in for Howell, a 6-foot-8 senior who earned his third double-double in four games. He had 13 points and 10 rebounds in the win against UConn despite missing most of the first half with an injury. \u201cJust me being a senior, I thought I needed to step up and fulfill that (leadership) role with this being my last year,\u201d Howell said. \u201cI feel like we can go far but leadership is something we lacked.\u201d C.J. Leslie added a team-high 19 points for the Wolfpack, and freshman T.J. Warren, a Durham native who attended Riverside High School briefly before transferring to an out-of-state prep school, scored 16. The Wolfpack won 589 games at Reynolds from 1949-99 until moving off campus to the larger RBC Center \u2014 now PNC Arena \u2014 for the 1999-2000 season. But the school has typically played at least one game a year at Reynolds for the past decade as a nod to the program\u2019s tradition. N.C. State improved to 14-0 in the cozy building since its move, including a win against Marist in the 2007 NIT. \u201cI think it\u2019s special to play here,\u201d Gottfried said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for our fans, too. I think it brings them back in here and it means a lot to people. And it\u2019s fun, too, the crowd and how close they are to the floor. Our fans are loud and you could feel it in there today.\u201d N.C. State pushed ahead to a double-digit lead about 11 minutes in and took a 47-32 lead after the first half. Charlie Lee (15 points) brought the Vikings (6-3) as close as 57-47 on a 3-pointer with 13:55 left, but Lorenzo Brown answered with two straight driving scores. Lee finished with eight of Cleveland State\u2019s 18 turnovers, which led to 16 points for the Wolfpack. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t turned the ball over unnecessarily, we could have been right in this game,\u201d Vikings coach Gary Waters said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that I\u2019m trying to correct with these young kids. When you\u2019ve got nine freshmen and sophomores, it\u2019s become a teaching game instead of a coaching game. Eventually, if they don\u2019t stop turning the ball over, then I\u2019m not doing a very good job as a teacher.\u201d Cleveland State, a Horizon League program, played its third straight game without preseason all-conference pick Anton Grady. The 6-8 sophomore is expected to miss at least four weeks because of a knee injury sustained against Robert Morris on Nov. 20. No. 25 N.C.
