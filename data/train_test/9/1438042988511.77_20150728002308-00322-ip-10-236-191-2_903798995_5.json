Food and Dining subway is ok but other options should be offered. Dorm Life no dorms but it seems to be a charge for one. when i asked why i'm being charged 11,000 for housing they told me that, i wasn't supposed to see that and i'm not being charged. Tips for prospective students if someone asked me about the school i would inform them to make sure they check to see if the program that they're interested in is accredited, if not they would be waisting",
