    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{62535=In FIG. 7 (the control unit CU) centers around a computer comprising a processor CPU a timer-I/O unit TRU, a random access memory unit MEM1 and a read-only memory unit MEM2. The units are connected in a conventional manner to a bus system. The bus includes a control bus, an address bus and an address/data bus. The processor CPU can be of the type 8085 having a plurality of interrupt ports such as A and B, output control ports connected to the control bus, output address ports connected to the address bus and hybrid ports for either emitting addresses or data onto the address/data bus. Generally associated with the type 8085, processor is a type 8155 device. This device includes the timer for the system, a small amount of random access memory, and three bidirectional I/O facilities. Memory for the system is provided by a random access memory and a suitable one can be the type 2114. In addition, the programming for the system requires a read-only memory and a suitable type can be the 2716. The processor, the hybrid unit and both memories along with the bus system provide programmable control for the unit. Also associated with the unit is a receive interface RI which basically comprises two sets of gated amplifiers such that for one set of eight such amplifiers upon receipt of a signal on line RIR information can flow from the bus DOA-DOH to the bus APB and when a signal is received from line RIW the other set of amplifiers is activated so that data can flow from the bus MLB to the bus ADO-AD3. The control unit CU also includes a supervisory interface SI which connects the bus CRA-CRP to the bus APB. However it should be realized that first mentioned bus is a two-byte wide bus and the second mentioned bus is a single byte wide bus. Therefore the eight lower significant bits are transferable in response to a signal on the line SIL whereas the eight more significant bits transferable in response to a signal on the line SIH. There is also a control track with interface CTWI which essentially receives the E-code, the P-code and the H-code from the unit TRU in response to a signal on one of the lines from the interface controller IFC. Thereafter it will generate the signals for writing on the control track under the timing of signals received from the video tape recorder via the lines FP and HP. The signals written on the control track are again biphase coded-signals representing the H-code and the P-code. These signals are fed to the control track of the video tape recorder VTR via the line WTC. The control track read interface receives the E-code from the unit TRU in response to signals on lines WCTRH and WCTRL and thereafter during the playback when it receives the H-codes and the P-codes from the video tape recorder on the line RTC it generates the synchronizing signals on the like VTS for synchronizing the magnetic tape and the rotating magnetic head of the tape recorder., 29050=In FIG. 2 there is shown the waveforms of the television signals transmitted from the head end unit HEU to the remote subscriber terminals RST/1 to RST/N. In particular, waveform 2A shows the region around a conventional vertical blanking interval surrounded by the end of the video signal for one field and the start of the video signal for the next field. As also can be seen in waveform 2A, the synchronizing signals extend from the zero level to a level which is 25% of full amplitude, and the video signals extend from the 25% level upward to 100%. As is well known in the television transmission art, the synchronizing pulses are generally of four types: horizontal synchronizing pulses which establish each of the horizontal lines of the television raster; vertical synchronizing pulses which establish the fields of the television raster, equalizing pulses which are used to accomodate the fact that the two fields which constitute the complete TV frame are (in NTSC) 2621/2 lines each; and color burst signals which are used to establish synchronization of the color burst oscillator in a conventional receiver (the color burst signals are not shown in waveform 2A because they are not transmitted during Vsync and are too short to perceive on the scale shown). Waveform 2B actually shows the conventional synchronizing pulses used in television transmission. For instance, there is shown that last equalizing pulse EP6 before the start of the first vertical synchronizing pulse. Following in time the equalizing pulse EP6, is the start of the first vertical pulse VP whose leading edge is indicated as reference numeral SOV (compare with waveform 2A). The time span shown between equalizing pulse EP6 and vertical pulse VP is equal to one half of a horizontal line. The right hand portion of the waveform 2B shows a horizontal blanking interval which actually includes a front porch FP, the horizontal synchronizing pulse per se and the color burst CB.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While only one embodiment of the invention has been shown and described in detail, there will now be obvious to those skilled in the art many modifications and variations satisfying many or all of the objects of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof as defined in the appended claims. There will now be discussed another aspect of the invention which is concerned with the ability to be able to continuously display a single frame received from the head end unit HEU. Normally, this feature would be concerned with catalog shopping or the like. When a user decides that he would like to continuously view a single frame of information, he would signal the head end unit of this fact. The head end unit HEU in response thereto during the course of the transmission would transmit to all terminals the particular frame but with the frame there would be included the address of the terminal requesting the particular frame. For instance, in a Teletext system wherein users select their viewing material, the particular terminal would utilize this facility for selecting the frame. Since the signalling to select the frame and the actual selection of the frame by the head end unit do not constitute part of the present invention, this will not be further discussed. Therefore, it will be assumed that the head end unit HEU does transmit the desired frame and includes in",
