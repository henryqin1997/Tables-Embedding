    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{52639=Unfortunately, the AU Optronics B156HW01 display leaves a lot to be desired.\u00a0 Like many other notebooks, the X6811's screen suffers from poor black level of 1.3 cd/m\u00b2.\u00a0 This means that blacks don't appear jet black but rather grayish, which can particularly impact the appearance of films and games.\u00a0 The contrast ratio of 169:1 is also quite low and the glossy screen only partly makes up for this.\u00a0 On the positive side of things, the colors are vivid and the screen quite bright, an average brightness of 225.9 cd/m\u00b2 makes for a cheerful-looking picture., 57191=Medion has put in place a 15.6\" screen with the typical 16:9 aspect ratio.\u00a0 Rare for smaller\u00a0 15-inch screens, the full-HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 makes the screen look incredibly detailed.\u00a0 Moreover, working with many simultaneously open windows remains easy and can make your workflow more efficient (see screenshots)., 38811=We tested the CPU performance of the Erazer X6811 with the well established Cinebench R10 benchmark.\u00a0 In the Single-Core Rendering test (64bit) the Core i7-740QM doesn't stand a chance against dual-core processors from Intel.\u00a0 Thanks to the Core i7 640M's higher clock rate (mySN XMG P500 Pro), it beat our in-review CPU by 19% at 4606 to 3873 points. If all the cores are in use (Multi-Core Rendering 64bit), the tables turn and the Core i7 740QM outdoes the leading CPU by 10% (11022 to 10027 points)., 80536=The entry-level Erazer X6811-MD97623 goes for 1049 Euro.\u00a0 This model comes with a dual-core i5 460M processor, 4 GB of DDR3 RAM and a matte HD display with a resolution of 1366x768.\u00a0 The premium model adds a good deal to the price, coming to 1599 Euro.\u00a0 For this price, you get the Erazer X6811-MD97625 with a speedy quad-core i7 740QM CPU, a memory of 6G (DDR3) and a full-HD screen (1920 x 1080). Our in-review model (available starting January 2011), the Erazer X6811-MD97624, is virtually the same as the previously mentioned model but costs a whole 400 Euro less (1,199 Euro).\u00a0 In just about every area besides CPU, memory, and display, all three X6811 models are built the same.\u00a0 Medion has fitted each model with a 640 GB HDD and a classic DVD burner.\u00a0 And to top off the package, you get the speedy GeForce GTX 460M graphics card from Nvidia, which supports DirectX 11. Also available for purchase directly from the Medion homepage is the 17\" gaming notebook, Akoya X7811.\u00a0 However, after reviewing the Erazer X6811, we simply cannot recommend the Akoya.\u00a0 Compared to the Erazer, the Akoya has far to many weak points (keyboard, battery life, speaker volume, etc.)., 47925=One thing's for sure, you won't be buy this notebook for its range of viewing angles\u2014 which is rather small, by the way.\u00a0 Tilting the screen up and down just a bit can result a distorted picture.\u00a0 All in all, the picture quality of the Erazer X6811 is quite disappointing.\u00a0 Most notebooks are hardly better in this department, but at a price of over 1000 Euro, you'd expect a higher quality display.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{433024=An incredible level of performance for a price of 1200 Euro., 235921=The aging graphics engine of Modern Warfare 2 only makes the GeForce GTX 460M's job easier.\u00a0 At a resolution of 1920 x 1080, with very high detail settings and 4x AA, the first person shooter goes down nice and easy (46.0 fps).\u00a0 Nevertheless, Radeon HD 5870 comes out on top at 50.2 fps (+9%)., 275302=The gaming performance of the Erazer X6811 is top notch!\u00a0 With the exception of incredibly taxing games like Metro 2033 or Crysis, the GeForce GTX 460M is usually powerful enough to run current titles in high detail settings and high resolutions. Only with respect to resource-demanding antialiasing is there room for improvement. The GeForce GTX 460M is, therefore, the right choice for gamers, a good alternative for which will not be found in the 1200-Euro price range. The GeForce GTX 460M does not need to bow its head in shame compared to the competition from ATI because, after all, the Radeon HD 5870 manages to outdo the GeForce by a mere +4% on average., 137035=Thanks to the relatively undemanding hardware requirements, you can enjoy the new Fifa on the highest settings.\u00a0 With high details, 4x AA and a resolution of 1920 x 1090, the GeForce GTX 460M came out with an excellent 132.1 fps, 46% higher than the Radeon HD 5870 performed (90.3 fps)., 205984=As long as you don't go crazy with the graphics-enhancing settings, the popular multiplayer shooter, Bad Company 2, is easily playable on the Erazer X6811.\u00a0 High detail settings, 4x AA, 8x AF and a resolution of 1920 x 1080 result in a not-always-smooth refresh rate of 30.1 fps. At 32.2 fps, the Radeon HD 5870 surpasses the GeForce (+7%)., 340068=As previously mentioned, the high-end hardware uses up quite a bit of energy.\u00a0 Compared to the MSI GX660R with Radeon HD 5870, the Erazer X6811 consumes a similar amount of energy under heavy use (115.5-162.6 watts), but, substantially less than the MSI in idle mode (24.1-32.6 watts).\u00a0 It seems that the GeForce GTX 460M takes advantage of better energy-saving mechanisms in idle mode., 177311=Metro 2033, 12994=Complementing the processor, the high-end Nvidia GeForce GTX 460M (lithography = 40 nm) is the dedicated graphics card here with 192 unified shaders. The clock rates are quite standard: 675 MHz (core), 1250 MHz (memory) and 1350 MHz (shaders).\u00a0 The 1536 MB GDDR5 video memory is connected at 192 bits, which means no bottlenecking of data should occur., 97813=The highly detailed world of Mafia 2 doesn't give the GeForce GTX 460M any problems. With high detail settings on, 16x AF (anisotropic filtering) and a resolution of 1920 x 1080, we measured a smooth refresh rate of 34.4 fps. The AMD Radeon HD 5870 does even better with these settings, 41.1 fps make it 19% faster., 17645=The GeForce GTX 460M goes head-to-head its worst rival, the ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5870, in our synthetic benchmarks. Using 3DMark Vantage (DirectX 10) the GeForce GTX 460M pulls the short straw with 7616 to 6709 points, putting the Radeon HD 5870 (Medion Akoya X7811) 14% ahead. In the Unigine Heaven 2.1 benchmark (1280 x 1024, High, Tessellation normal) the GeForce GTX 460M turns the tables with its superior DirectX 11 performance, ranking in barely ahead of the Radeon HD 5870 (MSI GX660R) at 23.8 fps to 23.1., 177362=The exorbitant resource requirements of the first person shooter, Metro 2033, push the GeForce GTX 460M to the limit. With very high detail settings, in DirectX 11 mode, AAA (Analytical Antialiasing) and 4x AF, the game ran very choppy in full-HD resolution at a mere 9.5 fps. The Radeon HD 5870 does indeed perform 15% faster, but 10.9 fps is still nowhere near smooth.\u00a0 For a smooth-flowing picture, the graphics have to be lowered to moderate detail settings (DirectX 10).}",

    "textAfterTable": "Emissions System Noise The relatively high level of noise produced by the Erazer X6811 is one of its greatest weak points.\u00a0 The exhaust fan spins fairly quietly under light use (office, internet, etc.) and even while watching a film, only the quieter scenes are muffled by the fan noise.\u00a0 However, while using 3D applications or playing games, the fan becomes clearly audible.\u00a0 Our 100%-CPU-load stress test raises this noise level to a distractingly loud 50 dB(A) (heard from 15cm away).\u00a0 If that weren't enough, the Erazer X6811 also tended to make brief but irritating whistling noises\u2014a phenomenon we've begun to see in more and more laptops lately.
