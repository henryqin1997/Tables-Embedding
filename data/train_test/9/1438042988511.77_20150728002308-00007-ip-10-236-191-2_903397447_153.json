Read this guide before you buy textbooks: http://www.brainofjt.com/2014/01/textbook-trick-save-money.html It could save you thousands of dollars to use the method provided. 2. Many of the courses, especially in the business school, have exams with questions directly from the book rather than lecture. To succeed in those courses you'll need to 3. Get involved with people who actually care about your well-being. As a beginning college student, you'll run into a lot of college students who want you do talk and act like them. Usually that involves compromising your morals. Instead, places such as the BSU or Baptist Student Union will love to have you come in and be a part of everything that goes on there., 615686=Everyone in the dorms are nice and the dorm quality is outstanding. Also going to have lots of dorms remodeled coming 2013., 598196=Mizzou is great for every type of student, really. It is large enough to be able to sneak through in you are more introverted or leave school with 1000 friends (and not just 1000 added Facebook friends)., 632447=Especially if you're in-state, Mizzou is definitely well worth what you pay for your education. If you're out-of-state, Missouri is the easiest state to earn in-state status--just earn $2000 and have a residence in Missouri (e.g. your residence hall or apartment)., 210814=mu has many dinning halls for students. they offer many kinds of food. since 2011, mu open a new place, called student center dining. it offers many choices like pizza, burgers, drinks and sushi. it is so convenient and so nice. in addition, student can buy meal plan for the dining halls, so the average price of each meal is about 8 dollars., 881463=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 41613=Downtown Columbia has plenty of great restaurants, bars, etc. True/False Film Festival every year in late February / early March., 713718=I will be attending this school in August and I am very excited. I have done research and heard so much great things about this school. That has helped me make my choice to attend here, this school will help farther me education., 400948=There are a lot of traditions at Mizzou. In August before classes begin the freshman assemble for Tiger Walk where they walk through the Columns toward Jesse Hall. Tiger Walk is symbolic of a student's entrance into the University of Missouri. When students graduate they walk through the columns away from Jesse Hall. This is Tiger Prowl and is symbolic of students becoming Mizzou alumni. There are seven traditions all students are supposed to do before they graduate: climb the dome of Jesse Hall, explore the tunnels, kiss the 50-yard line on Faurot Field, streak across the Quad, ride the tiger in Tiger Plaza, swim in Brady Fountain, and yell I love Mizzou! in Speakers Circle. I forewarn anyone that wants to attempt these that some of them are illegal., 731801=Classes definitely get harder as you go up. Don't think everything will be like your 1000-level days.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Tips for prospective students Say hi to everyone on your floor, that will be your family and home away from home, at least until you start meeting people in your 500+ student lecture halls. Join clubs or do intramural sports, its a great way to relieve stress and to do something you enjoy while networking and meeting new people. Use your resources- YOU ARE PAYING FOR SCHOOL, and basically a lot of salaries around there so don't let anyone a professor, TA or tutor take advantage of that, get help when you realize you need it and before it becomes too late. Some classes you only get 3 grades and after a bad one it is hard to bring it up. Am learning a lot Mizzou so far has been a great experience for me. I am currently about to start my sophomore year and I feel with the help and opportunities I had freshman year that I am ready to face the challenges on taking classes more in-depth to my major.
