Clint Hill then turned the ball into his own net but Rangers pulled one back just before the break when Adel Taarabt fired home., 11885=Rangers pulled one back a minute before the break. A slip from Karagounis presented the ball to Taarabt. The former Tottenham Hotspur man, who scored twice against the Whites in Rangers\u2019 2-1 win at Loftus Road in December, still had a lot to do but ran at speed at Hangeland and saw his shot from the edge of the box fizz into the far corner via the fingertips of Schwarzer., 9099=Martin Jol named an unchanged starting XI for the fourth successive game as Bryan Ruiz passed a late fitness test on a slight hamstring strain suffered on international duty with Costa Rica. QPR made two changes from the side that lost 3-2 at Aston Villa, with Traore and Taarabt coming into their starting line-up. Former Whites striker Bobby Zamora made his first return to the Cottage since his switch to Loftus Road in January 2012., 9556=On a chilly April night in SW6, Rangers fashioned the opening shot of the match in the fifth minute but Stephane Mbia\u2019s speculative effort from 30 yards was easily held by Schwarzer., 14997=Date: Monday 1 April 2013 Kick-off: 8:00pm}",

QPR then made their final substitution of the game, with Jamie Mackie coming on for Traore, before Jenas curled a shot a few yards wide of Schwarzer\u2019s far post. Riether was booked on 89 minutes for taking too long to take a throw-in and Senderos was also cautioned for time-wasting as the match entered added time. A crazy game took",
