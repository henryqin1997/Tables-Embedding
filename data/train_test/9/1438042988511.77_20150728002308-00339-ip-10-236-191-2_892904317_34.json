            "There are always campus police patrolling and keeping an eye on things. There are also emergency stands all around campus and in all of the parking lots to provide a way for anyone being threatened to call for help and police. The parking lots are well-lit and I feel comfortable attending late night study at the library.",
            "I am not personally part of Greek Life, but many of my friends and peers love it and say it is a great experience.",
            "There are always activites going out. From outdoor hiking clubs, to group snowboarding trips, to fashion shows and bake sales, there is something available to join, and be a part of.",
            "Students interested in getting a good education, with many opportunities, but like the smaller classroom settings and southern hospitality.",
            "There is a nature/ hiking trail on campus. Not to mention, the entire city is surrounded by beautiful mountains. The newest edition to ETSU campus is the disk golf course they added this past 2011-2012 school year.",
            "I think ETSU is a great size campus, with awesome resources.",
            "There are always intramural sports and event, and sororities and fraternities as well. ETSU always provides interesting guest speakers too. We always have a Fall semester concert, that the students get to vote on, so that's a big hit. If you like to work out, there is a great facility on campus that provides swimming, rock climbing, basketball, volleyball, racket ball, ping pong, and much much more. There are also weekly work out classes like Butts Gutts and Thighs and Girls Night Out that really make exercising fun. If you want to learn salsa dancing, or thai kwon do, those classes are available too!",
            "I think the campus offers good food choices. There is an einstein bagel shop in the library, and at the snack bar. There is also chick-fil-a and other places to eat. In the dorms, there is a convenient store as well.",
            "I have never lived in a dorm at ETSU, but have had many friends who have. No one has ever really said bad things, especially about the newer dorms. The old ones, I've heard, can be a little scary though- especially in the shared bathrooms. BUT hey- it's college!",
            "I feel that professors are always willing to help students reach their full potentials. I also think that the students at ETSU are, for the most part, enthusiastic and thirsty for knowledge.",
            "Find your classrooms BEFORE the first day, and always stay on top of financial aid and student requirements for new terms, they'll sneak up on you! Also, make sure you always have a parking permit sticker for wherever you are parking, because you WILL get a ticket, even if you're only parked there for 20 minutes.",
            "ETSU is overall a great school. The atmosphere is nice and classy and classroom size is manageable. There are many smiling faces and professors are almost always more than willing to help students not only learn, but understand."

Greek Life Frats hold plays, parties, and parking lot amusement. Always something going on with the Greeks. Clubs and Activities Every club you can think of. My roommate leads the quidditch club. Great for these types of students If you want a little space. There is lots of room around campus and classes are flexible and varied. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus Everyone studies. Weird. Bang for the buck Living in Tennessee it was really affordable for me. In a great location mid-town with lots",
