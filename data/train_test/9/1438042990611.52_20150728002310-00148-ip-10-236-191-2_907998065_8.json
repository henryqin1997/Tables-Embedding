            "Hardin-Simmons is great for students who are passionate about God. The university has an amazing Christian atmosphere. It is also great for students who do not want to go to a huge public university. The small student population is great for students who want to get plugged into social clubs and campus organizations. I believe that anyone who applies here can find a place to fit in.",
            "In general, don't be afraid to apply to college. For prospective students thinking about applying to Hardin-Simmons, don't get turned off by the school because of it's small size. The small student population allows incoming students to feel at home here. I have found a family here at Hardin-Simmons among my close friends. I highly encourage students to apply to the Honors Program at Hardin-Simmons. If you get into the Honors Program, you get another scholarship added to the university scholarship you will probably receive when you apply to the university. Hardin-Simmons is a great place to be. The Christian atmosphere is very inviting, and you feel like you are home here.",
            "Tuition may be a bit high, but the education you receive is totally worth the money you pay. The university offers many scholarships, so paying for college is not so difficult to do. I have a university scholarship which covers almost all of my tuition and other costs such as my meal plan and my housing costs.",
            "Being a small school, Hardin-Simmons makes everyone feel like one big family. The university encourages students to get plugged into campus organizations and social groups on campus. I enjoy being a part of something big, and I do not feel like a number here. Making friends is so easy here, and mostly everyone you meet will have a smile on their face and is ready to strike up a conversation with you.",
            "The learning environment is excellent here. The student to professor ratio is considerably lower than that of other colleges and universities, so students can actually have access to the professor and build genuine relationships with them. I feel that students can learn whole lot better with a smaller class because being in a class of 500 people is so much more intimidating than being in a class of 15 to 20 people. Most of the classes I am taking are intellectually engaging. I highly recommend high school students applying here to also apply for the Honors Program. Being a part of the Honors Program has developed my cognitive skills and has taught me how to think differently about important issues in our society."
