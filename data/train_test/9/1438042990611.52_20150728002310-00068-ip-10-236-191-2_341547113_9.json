And, to quote Lefty Kreh in the introduction to this book, \"Tom is a marvelous storyteller\". Flies, Ties & Lies is a book like no other. It is a practical handbook on one hand, biographical on the other and a guidebook on the third (?!!) hand. Each practical teaching chapter is followed up with a biographical story. For instance, Chapter One \"Fly Casting\" is followed up by \"God Bless You, Uncle Gino\", a thank you to the man who started Tom on fishing. Perhaps the most instructional section is Chapter Two - Reading The Water. This is an awesome study of water movement and trout vision. I realize now, after reading this chapter, how naive and careless I have been my whole fishing career. How many fish must I have spooked off over the years? The stream and its immediate surrounding are carefully disected, horizontally and vertically. The author studies and relates how the fish interact with each portion of the stream, both in the water and out. Flies, Ties and Lies",
