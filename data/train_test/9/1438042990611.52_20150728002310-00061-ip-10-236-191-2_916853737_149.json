            "Campus safety is important. The university police is located on campus. There are also many Emergency button locations in case a person needs help.",
            "IUP has over 100 clubs there is pretty much a club for every interest. Theres also many activities held throughout the day everyday! On friday nights for example, there's bingo night. Sometimes halls will have movie nights. The Hub has fashion show events as well.",
            "Iup offers a variety of options when it comes to food. Theres Fosters which is known as the cafeteria. Fosters by itself has a variety of food from grilled food, to home style food, to vegan food. Then theres Folgers and the Hub which also offer foods such as salads, wraps, pizza, bagels, and much more! If you're in a rush and need to get something quick for lunch the pod offers bagged lunches which are quick and easy to get.",
            "Dorm life is splendid! The rooms are spacious and you have many options as whether to share a room or not. I believe most include a fridge and a sink as a little kitchen area. Usually the people on the same floor are extremely nice and you get the chance to meet them whenever theres a floor meeting. Washers and dryers are made on every floor making it easy for students to wash clothes.",
            "Such as any other college there is much work and studying to do. Skipping classes can instantly affect how well a person does on the next exam. So every class is important. Classes can range from one hour to three depending on the day and class. Usually all classes are a lecture class so its essential to take notes while the professor is speaking. I suggest reviewing the notes taken everyday because it will help you learn.",
            "If criminology is an interest for students I suggest they come and visit Indiana University. It is known for its great criminology department. Make sure to manage your time well there could be many consequences if you don't such as never going to class due to not getting enough sleep. My last tip would be not to stress! Its not the end of the world if you fail a test just study harder for the next one!",
            "Indiana University of Pennsylvania was my first choice since the first time i visited. Its a great school with many opportunities, activities, and a great criminology department. The professors here are all extremely well educated and know what they teach and how to keep you interested."

That said, you may have to take out loans if you do not get sufficient financial aid (this happens especially if you live in on-campus housing). My loans have averaged $1000 per semester. Also, the quality of education will depend on the department/major you are in. The Education department and Nursing programs have notable and excellent programs, while some others are very lacking in terms of instructor quality and rigor., 700862=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 10966=Expect cold weather in October, but mostly expect amazing unity. The IUP campus is big and holds 14,000 students, but you feel so involved when you are here. Whether you join the paper or just play frisbee with friends in the Oak Grove, you will see how unified the students are.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Comments Campus Safety IUP is a very safe and secure campus. The dorm building lock after 8pm every day. Each wing of the dorm building is always locked. Your dorm room door locks and so does your bedroom door. Your bedroom windows lock and will not open more than 6 inches as a safety precaution. The police are always around and there are emergency buttons located around campus. If you press that button the police will be there within 2 minutes. It's very safe. Greek Life There are tons of opportunities to go Greek at IUP. There are honor, religious, themed, and just fun fraternities and sororities to join. Don't miss out! Clubs and Activities There are infinite clubs and activites you could join. There are all kinds of religious groups, anime club, sports teams, residence hall association, everything! There's even video games club. Great for these types of students Great for all types of students, especially education majors! Bang for the buck It's cheap compared to other schools in Pennsylvania. What to do for fun You could go hang out at Indiana",
