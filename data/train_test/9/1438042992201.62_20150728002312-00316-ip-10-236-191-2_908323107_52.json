            "The campus has plenty of resources, including the security and call buttons all around campus.",
            "Winona is definitely not known for its sororities.",
            "They offer inter medial sports teams that you can sign up for with friends. You pick your teams.",

            "There's always people hanging around outside Prentiss-Lucas. It tends to be the meeting place for partiers/drunk people. So, be aware that it gets loud.",
            "Honestly, walking around campus you can tell why Winona is so much less expensive than other universities. It doesn't have as much to offer.",
            "Winona has a lot of scenic things to do, like hike the bluffs or kayak on the lake.",
            "The caf had pretty good food, but weekend food was always pretty bad.",
            "Do your research and check layouts. Main campus dorms are much smaller than west campus dorms.",
            "It really depends on the course and professor for difficulty. As long as you're not afraid to ask questions, you should be okay.",
            "Do your research on your intended major/minor. Make sure you look at classes as well to see what they offer.",
            "WSU is a good school specifically for nursing and education majors. The town of Winona is pretty quaint. The school in general doesn't have a whole lot to offer compared to other larger universities in Minnesota."

The Smaug on the other hand has, what I believe to be, great food. You do have to use dining dollars, purple pass, cash, or credit/debit cards for that though., 172627=The caf gets repetitive and bland after a while, but the school has a lot of options on campus, in an area we call the Smaug. Plenty of fast food and local restaurants will keep anybody happy., 235394=There are TONS of options provided in the cafeteria. Personally I prefer to eat in the smaug because I am obsessed with mondo's sub's., 200990=There is plenty of options on campus. I particularly enjoy the dining in the Smaug., 122101=The campus is beautiful and pristine; it is also super well kept which is nice. The dorms are also well kept, and seem to be newly furnished but are super hot in the late month of August. I have not had one professor that I have not liked; they are all really fair, but still hard enough to make you work for a good grade.}",
