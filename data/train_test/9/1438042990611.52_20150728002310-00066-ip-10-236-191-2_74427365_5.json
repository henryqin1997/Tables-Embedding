Instead of percentages, you specify numbers corresponding to the ratio of CPU that you want to give to each consumer group. To use the RATIO method, you set the MGMT_MTH argument for the CREATE_PLAN procedure to 'RATIO'. See \"Creating Resource Plan Directives\" for an example of a plan that uses this method. See Also: \"Updating a Plan\" \"Deleting a Plan\" Creating Resource Plan Directives You use the CREATE_PLAN_DIRECTIVE procedure to create resource plan directives. Each directive belongs to a plan or subplan and allocates resources to either a consumer group or subplan. Note: The set of directives for a resource plan and its subplans can name a particular subplan only once. You can specify directives for a particular consumer group in a top plan and its subplans.
