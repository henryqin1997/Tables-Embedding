Terri said Thongsy purchased her food, new clothes and then brought her to the Thongsy family home in Sacramento, where she stayed for several days. Terri was soon joined by a runaway friend, Angelica, at which point Thongsy began buying both teens food and renting them a room to stay in at the Motel 6 on Stockton Boulevard in Sacramento., 32701=According to Terri\u2019s testimony, at some point she and Angelica were taken to Putnam\u2019s posh, two-story home on Wood Leaf Circle in Roseville, a location where police had previously arrested Putnam and adult women for prostitution activities back in 2008. Terri denied she had been engaged in prostitution at Putnam\u2019s residence. She also told Macumber rather bluntly that a number of statements she made in 2010 to Roseville police detectives and investigators from the Placer County District Attorney\u2019s Office were \u201clies.\u201d}",
