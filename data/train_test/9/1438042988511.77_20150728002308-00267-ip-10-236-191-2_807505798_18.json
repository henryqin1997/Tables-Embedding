The Department of Microbiology now offers combined degrees with Biochemistry, Botany, Chemistry and Zoology in the School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences. The Department of Microbiology has 2 Undergraduate teaching labs for second and third year practical training sessions. The Department also has 6 well equipped and very active research laboratories to train post graduate students from Honours to post doctoral level. The Microbiology Department strives to ensure the impact of knowledge onto students and community members with regards to the impact that microorganisms have on their environment and general well being. The Department of Microbiology also strives to provide opportunities for students to obtain the highest qualification offered. The Department provides excellent teaching, research and community interactions. Emphasis is placed on the following aspects:}",
