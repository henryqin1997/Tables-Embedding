Hampshire County Council School Places Plan Linked schools The Westgate School The term 'linked' is used to indicate schools with a close association to each other. Linked schools are not 'feeder' schools and attendance at a linked school does not guarantee a place. However, for admission to community secondary schools, out-of-catchment applicants attending a linked primary or junior school have priority, after those with siblings, over other out-of-catchment applicants.
