It was noted that aluminum vapor-coated samples which had previously been specially prepared with thicker space coat layers provided extremely high retroreflectivity while the retroreflectivity of the samples having diffuse reflective pigments remained relatively constant as shown in the table above. Repetition of the process upon 3M Brand GLOGUIDE\u2122 Retroreflective Elements with varying amounts of space coat exhibited significantly less variation in retroreflective efficiency when another diffuse reflective pigment, latex paint with titanium dioxide, was applied over the space coat. Prototype retroreflective assemblies of the present invention were initially prepared from 3M Brand GLOGUIDE\u2122 Retroreflective Elements which had been vapor-coated with aluminum to provide a metal reflective layer. After noting the retroreflective efficiency, the aluminum vapor coat was removed by etching with a 5 weight percent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. After the aluminum was removed, LIQUID PAPER Brand opaquing fluid was brushed on over the space coat. The resultant array of the invention had noticeably more efficient retroreflectivity than did the original aluminum vapor-coated array. The relative space coat measurement was obtained by measuring the amount of space coat material sprayed onto a glass plate under similar production conditions to that being employed on a web of retroreflective assemblies. The retroreflective assemblies of the invention provided substantially uniform retroreflective performance",
