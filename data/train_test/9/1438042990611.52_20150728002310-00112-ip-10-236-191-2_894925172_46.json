            "This is a wonderful institution for students who want a great education, and a great social experience. Also, any student who has strong self-motivation. Because this is a large school, a student has to be independent and in control of his or her education. Students from the Midwest will be happy to know that this campus is no exception when it comes to warm personalities, even if the weather gets a little frigid.",
            "I would recommend taking a trip to campus for a tour and information. Be sure to take an extra hour or two to walk around campus and the downtown area, talk to some of the students passing by and take in the sights for a true feel of the school. If you are able, try to attend a football, basketball, or hockey game to capture the Badger spirit.",
            "For me, attending the UW is very affordable. I am a Wisconsin resident, and I pay in-state tuition. However, for students from out of state, this could be pricey. The out of state tuition is still cheaper than many private institutions, and many scholarships are available for people from other areas. Truthfully, there are many scholarships available for any student as long as he or she is willing to search and apply.",
            "When I graduated high school, I really wanted to go far away for college. Because I grew up in Madison, I wanted to venture out to other places. After spending the semester on the east coast, I realized that the people in the Midwest tend to be more welcoming and friendly than people from other regions. When I returned, I noticed that there are many more things to do on campus since it is in the heart of Madison, not on the outskirts of the city. No matter where you stay on campus, you can walk to main shopping areas, restaurants and bars, movies, museums, and events on the square. I would highly recommend attending some of the sporting events; all of the athletic teams are very successful. The fans and student section give the team great support and provide an exciting atmosphere.",
            "I originally went to Boston College, hoping that a private school would help me achieve a great education, but I was unimpressed. I found myself bored and resorted to daydreaming through all of my classes. I transferred to UW Madison since I was unhappy with my experience out east. So far, all of my classes at the UW have been intruiging and challenging, including the subjects I did not particularly enjoy during high school. The professors are fantastic, and the TAs that run discussions and other sections that supplement the lectures are more helpful than I could have imagined. This is a great school if you want to get well educated. Also, there are a countless amount of resources to enhance your learning."

While not everyone can score tickets (which go on sale every June and sell out within an hour), everywhere you go, you will pass by viewing parties. Other traditions focus on Bascom Hill, the stretch of land that was the original campus. From the 'Battle for Bascom' snowball fights (between Southeast and Lakeshore campus'), Tray sledding, studying under the shade of a tree on the first warm day, or rubbing Abe's foot for good luck, it's the place of tradition., 225606=Madison's cost are reasonable, although I heard that they will be raising tuition by $2000 every year. I didn't really get any financial aid except for an actuarial science scholarship, so I wish I could have gotten a little more help. But through internships and jobs I think the cost is manageable., 1037239=Apply during the first application window! I applied before in September, before the first deadline in October, and knew by early November that I had been accepted. Also, apply for the scholarships through your college in early February., 316538=I can not talk on dorm life as a personal experience, what I can say is my fellow classmates who live in dorms really do not complain much and the new state of the dorm building should be done for fall2012. It will be awesome. Plus plenty of opportunity to live off campus also., 973368=Lots of student orgs to join, may have to look around on the WIN website to find what you are interested in as there are so much and it is hard to find out about them all. May not be as close with the people in your org as you will other friends but that isn't true for all orgs on campus, 1101166=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 94332=Madison has a world-class faculty full of brilliant and interesting (my chemistry professor was in the 1992 Olympics) instructors. Also my first semester instructors were very open about providing help and keeping their office hours to explain any questions. Because it is a very intelligent and motivated student body, students push each other to learn.}",

I would not recommend this school for people who can get distracted easily. Tips for prospective students Apply early, I really believe this will increase your chances of getting accepted and will get you a response a lot faster so you can make your decision. Really work to get a high ACT score and writing a good admissions essay. Bang for the buck Although this school is rather pricey for a public school I feel that it is definitely worth it. People are always impressed when they hear that I go to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, so I know that a degree",
