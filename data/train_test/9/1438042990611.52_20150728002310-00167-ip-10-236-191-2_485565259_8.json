Thus, processor type and memory configuration in the computer system C is determined through the use of one 8 bit data port and no addressing capability to the respective processor or memory boards is necessary for this purpose. Instead, shift registers located on each processor and memory board are used to transfer the data in a serial fashion to the 8 bit MEMID data port. The serial configuration of the shift registers and the use of tristate buffers allows this configuration to recognize and account for expansion slots where no processor or memory board has been asserted. Referring now to FIG. 4, a timing diagram for the MEMID data port is shown. When the MEMID data port is read, signified by the CMD* signal being asserted low, the DATABSY signal is negated low, which in turn forces the EXRDY signal to be negated low. This activates the MIDCLK signal, and the data signals from the system board shift register 100 are subsequently shifted into the MEMID port through the DATAIN input on each rising edge of the MIDCLK signal.
