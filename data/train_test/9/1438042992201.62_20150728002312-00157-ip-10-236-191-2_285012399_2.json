In addition to the Scholar-Athlete program, an All-Academic team comprised of student-athletes that excel both academically and athletically is chosen in each of the conference's 18 sports by a committee consisting of faculty athletic representatives, academic advisors and sports information directors. Additionally, the conference recognizes all student-athletes who achieve at least a 3.0 GPA on its Academic Honor Roll, with those achieving a 3.5 average or better receiving Commissioner's Honor Roll status. Finally, the Academic Cup is awarded to the school with the highest cumulative GPA among its student-athletes for that academic year. The America East provides member schools and their athletic programs a platform upon which student-athletes can achieve both collegiate and life success through the promotion and nurturing of athletic excellence, academic achievement and leadership, on and off the field. .box {font-family:verdana; background-color:#1c1d4d; color:#ffffff; margin-right: 20px; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom:30px; padding:20px;} a.special:hover {color:#00b2e2;text-decoration:underline;} a.special:link {text-decoration:none; color:#00b2e2;} .additional {padding-left:10px;} td {font-size: 12px; padding-left:15px; padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:10px;} .tbl-hdr {background-color:#1c1d4d; font-size:12px; color:#fff; font-weight:600; text-decoration:bold; font-family:verdana; padding-bottom:5px; padding-top:5px; padding-left:15px; } p {line-height: 125%; font-size:12px;}",
