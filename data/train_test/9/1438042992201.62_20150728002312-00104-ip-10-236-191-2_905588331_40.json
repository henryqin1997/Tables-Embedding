My mind changed at summer orientation when I saw all of the clubs and opportunities Chico actually gave you. -If you have a meal plan try and organize how many meals a week you should be having. Because both semesters I had so many meals left over and the last week I tried to eat around 5 times a day! -Be prepared for both extreme heat from August to early October, and extreme cold in the winter. And when I say extreme I mean extreme for someone from the Bay Area. (100degrees and 30degrees), 217698=Okay, I'm going to divide the food and dining into two categories-the dining hall on campus and dining out in town. The Sutter Dining Hall was only recently opened in 2011, so it's extremely new and modern. However, the food options aren't necessarily the greatest. But I guarantee if you ask anyone at any school, they'll all tell you that they're dining hall stinks. Now as for downtown dining, it's awesome. There's a great pizza place called Celestino's (it's been a huge staple while I've lived in Chico), and also a burger/bar joint called The Bear (you have to try the jiffy burger...yes, it's a burger with peanut butter on it!), 584889=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
