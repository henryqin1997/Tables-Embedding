In 2014, the top tax credit bumps up to 50%. The credit is available for a maximum of six years: 2010 through 2013 and for any two years after that., 41803=Big Air has nine employees, six full-timers and the rest working part time. Several employees get insurance through their spouse's plan and others have military veteran benefits, but Big Air paid for insurance for two employees in 2009 and will cover three in 2010, plus Jennifer, her husband and their two kids. The company kicks in $100 each month toward employees' premiums or 50% of the cost -- whichever is less. Mostly that's the $100 option., 34304=Millions of business owners will get postcards from the Internal Revenue Service in the coming weeks suggesting they check and see if they are eligible for the 2010 tax credit. Notifications are also going out to tens of thousands of tax professionals., 39064=An auto repair shop with 10 employees that has a total payroll of $250,000 -- meaning each worker averages $25,000 -- and spends $70,000 annually on health insurance premiums would max out the benefit, collecting a credit of $24,500 on its 2010 taxes., 101777=Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
