His programs went into exhaustive detail on individual artists, labels and musical disciplines. He also spearheaded many important events on the air, such as the 2001 and 2008 Dada and Surrealism festivals that dominated the airwaves for days on end and involved many in the local avant garde community as well as many KBOO programmers. Richard passed away in 2009 but it's our hope to carry on with his mission of introducing listeners to unheard new music as a collective of his collaborators and listeners.
