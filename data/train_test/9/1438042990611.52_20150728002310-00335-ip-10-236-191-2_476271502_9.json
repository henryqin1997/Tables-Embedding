    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6334=In an exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 2, retailer terminal 108 comprises a retailer POS terminal 1112, such as a cash register for example. When a consumer ID is used at the time an item is purchased, purchase data, including a SKU number, is input, sensed, or otherwise recognized by terminal 108, and then the purchase data is processed and stored by retailer processor 110. Retailer processor 110 comprises or is in communication with a suitable database 111 or other storage device for maintaining and storing purchase data and any other suitable retailer information. Database 111 may be any type of database, such as any of the database products described above for example. Database 111 may be organized in any suitable manner, including as data tables or lookup tables. Purchase data that is stored in database 111 is available to the retailer's local back office system (not shown) for inventory, accounting, tax, data analysis, and other purposes. The captured purchase data may include the item purchased, the item's unit price, the number of items purchased, the date, the store location, an employee ID, and any other information related to the purchase. In an exemplary embodiment, retailer processor 110 may also receive, process, and store manufacturer data, such as information regarding products and/or services and UPC data, from manufacturers 106 who have enrolled in the system 100. The manufacturer data may be stored in any suitable form, including data tables or lookup tables.}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{93941=In an exemplary embodiment, rewards terminal 116 operates in real-time. In this context, \u201creal-time\u201d means that reward points are immediately, or nearly immediately, updated at the time purchases are made and are therefore immediately redeemable by the consumer at the a point of sale. Thus, for example, a consumer may be informed by rewards terminal 1116 at the point of sale that the item being purchased by the consumer may be purchased using the consumer's accumulated reward points, including points accumulated on a network level. Points accumulated on a network level enable consumers to accumulate points more rapidly than would be possible if only a single retailer or group of retailers were issuing the points. In one embodiment, rewards terminal 116 may update a consumer's rewards points in real-time and, in response to the consumer's particular points total, issue a coupon, a gift certificate, and/or additional bonus points to the consumer., 135169=According to another embodiment, a CMPS Optional Programs database 1045 may reside as a subset of CMPS database 1065 to facilitate storage of optional features applied to card accounts such as, for example, frequent flyer points. CMPS Optional Programs database 1045 may be configured with the SE number captured in ADAS 1030., 133518=When the card application leaves LNA (step 1020), it is received by a capture agency (step 1025), which processes the card application through an Account Decisioning and Approval System (ADAS) 1030. Business rules within the ADAS 1030 ensure that a SE number has been properly captured prior to issuing an approval of the card application. In other words, if the SE number is not present on the card application, it is routed to a work list in ADAS 1030, wherein the application is held until the correct SE number is identified and assigned. In accordance with one embodiment, ADAS 1030 is not linked with either of MAPS 1010 or SE database 1015. Because the correct SE number may not yet be present on MAPS 1010, ADAS 1030 may be unable to determine whether the SE number on the card application is valid. For example, a SE number may be pre-allocated to the card sponsor for assignment to a SE, yet not be fully established in MAPS 1010., 132945=Meanwhile, the SE account application is processed (step 1005) using the card sponsor's merchant capture system, and a SE account is established in MAPS 1010 with the SE number assigned and activated (step 1010). Information regarding the SE, including the SE number, is stored in the SE database 1015. Because properties regarding hierarchy, structure, and submission options may be determined at this stage by the card sponsor, the SE number originally listed on the card application may no longer be accurate., 134568=When the card application is approved by ADAS 1030, a new card account data file 1035 is produced containing the information necessary to establish the account within CMPS database 1065 and any other downstream system requiring information concerning new card accounts. The SE number from the new card account data file 1035 is stored within CMPS database 1065. If it is determined that the SE number is not valid, a CMPS screen 1070 may be accessed by a card services representative to facilitate correction of the SE number., 36800=This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 09/836,213 filed Apr. 17, 2001 and entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Networked Loyalty Program\u201d, which itself claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/279,817, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Networked Incentive Awards Program\u201d and filed Mar. 29, 2001, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety., 131750=When a SE has neither an established MP card account nor a SE account, the establishment of each occurs in parallel, in that each account may be processed independently from the other. The initial application data is captured at an issuer, issuing bank or other issuing entity (step 1000). This initial data capture includes collecting the SE number field on the card application form if it is known at the time of application. The completed form is transmitted from the issuer bank to the card sponsor for processing by a Local New Accounts (LNA) department and/or system (step 1020). The LNA enters the SE number on the card application form by searching for the SE within a SE database 1015. If the SE does not yet exist within SE database 1015, then the LNA (step 1020) will leave the SE number field blank for the time being. When the card account and RPA applications leave the issuer (step 1000), in one embodiment, there is no systematic connection between the two applications, or subsequently between a Merchant Accounts Payable System (MAPS) 1010 and a Card Member Properties System 1045 (CMPS)., 135556=In an exemplary embodiment, a batch process may notify a Rewards Management System (RMS) of new SE accounts to be enrolled in RPA, via a batch interface 1050. As new SE accounts are saved within CMPS database 1065, new enrolment records are created that include the card account number and the linked SE number. SE numbers are maintained using batch interface 1050, which is configured to detect changes within CMPS database 1065 and/or CMPS Optional Programs database 1045. When batch interface 1050 detects changes such as, for example, modify and delete type transactions; the changes are transmitted to RMS (step 1055) via a change file 1055. This ensures linkage consistency between RMS 1060 and CMPS database 1065 and/or CMPS Optional Programs database 1045., 39526=These and other similar incentive award programs are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,774,870 and 6,009,412, issued to Thomas W. Storey and assigned to Netcentives, Inc., both of which are hereby incorporated by reference to the extent that they describe an automated rewards system.
