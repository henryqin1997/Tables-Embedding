You will learn how your faith in God plays out in every aspect of your life--including academics. Malone is a small school with an extremely powerful community. You will find your place among other followers of Christ at this school! Tips for prospective students Malone has rules! For example, students are not allowed in the dorms of the opposite gender on Tuesdays and Thursdays or during certain hours on other days. We also have chapel on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings, and you are required to go to 20 per semester. The University has rules such as this for very good reasons, and takes them quite seriously. So please read and consider them! Bang for the buck",
