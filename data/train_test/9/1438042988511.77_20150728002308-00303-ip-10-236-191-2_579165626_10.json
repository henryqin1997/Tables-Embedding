            "Hello everyone! My name is chiyako92 (you can call me \"chiya\") and I joined Baka-updates Manga a long time ago, but it's the first time I write in its forum. Up to now, I have only updated some series. Well, what I could say about me? I'm 19, I'm Italian and I graduated this July, so now I'm doing nothing -- but studying to get my driving license. I love reading novels and, obviously manga, as well as watching anime. My fav is Detective Conan, but I also like the Pretty Cure saga. I'm really nice to meet you! ________________ MANGALAND - Il mondo dei manga (MU profile)",
