    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot The classes are really small for the most part. I am a Pre-vet student, it's a popular major here so the classes get filled up quickly and are really full. They almost always open up another class to choose. The professors care about the students and usually have one-on-one sessions to help the students out to make sure they're getting the most out of their classes. The professors are passionate about their subjects and really know what they are talking about.
