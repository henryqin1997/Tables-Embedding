I think the drive will be as much fun as the rest of the trip :-) Chickenfoot Chickenfoot - The Winery Dogs (to show them what's going on in the scene right now, plus it's awesome) Zebra Zebra - Pyromania Def Lep - Clockwork Angels Rush - Holy Diver Last in Line and Dio - a homemade cd with most of Lost In The Translation, Humanimal, etc. JSS - I made a mix cd with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Songs off of Queensryche - greatest hits The Battle Allen/Lande - Mood Swings Harem Scarem - Strength in Numbers Tyketto - In no particular order I'll bring: We have a lot of driving to do (it'll be a minimum of 10 hours each way) so I decided to take music from different decades and also different sub genres. Funny you should mention this. I have a long road trip coming up and a friend said \"bring along your kind of music\"",
