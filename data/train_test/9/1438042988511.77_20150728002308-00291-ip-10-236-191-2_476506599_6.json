The handling can relate to other items than keys, e.g., tools, documents, medical drugs, etc. The characterizing features of the various embodiments or parts thereof can of course be mutually exchanged. The identification and control devices can of course be sealed or be protected in other ways against trespassing. The keys, i.e., the key rings and the like, can also be included in such a protection. In very special cases the pins can be designed as a part of a key. The apparatus according to the invention suitably is provided with a special computer program, which also comprises the possibility of successively adding one or more additional strips or the like to a suitable number of insertion positions. The apparatus, the method and also said computer program allow a mounting of devices 3 in \u201cstationary\u201d or changeable positions. In the latter case, device 3 can be inserted into an arbitrary hole 23. Thanks to printed circuit card 42 of device 3 and chip 43, it is easy for control center 4 to recognize each device 3 as a unique part and to indicate its possibly changed position.",
