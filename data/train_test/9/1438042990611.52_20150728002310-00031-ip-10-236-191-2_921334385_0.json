If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service Designer While on a year-long globetrotting adventure, designer Samantha August noticed a strong respect of the ocean in the people she met. When she returned to NYC, she focused on how to make the ocean a part of her life. The result is Basta Surf swimwear, a chic line inspired by her love of surfing and travel. And Samantha's designs are beautiful in more ways than one: a portion of all sales will be given to Global Water, a charity committed to creating safe water supplies in developing countries.
