    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Also, by providing the memory unit between the image signal encoding unit and the code transforming unit, the partial code transformation of an image as well as the code transformation after the editing processing are possible, which saves a processing on the unnecessary image data. Due to the above-mentioned effects, by combining the present invention with the proposed encoding method which aims at reducing a page memory, an efficient image data encoding method is realized. (7) For example, when image information is to be transmitted in the JPEG international standard system from a device which is provided at a transmitting side and has a compression function, it is possible to reduce image deterioration due to the second encoding in a frequency space of a device at the international standard system side which does not have a mode discrimination function. Also, as the receiving device, any device can be used, provided that it is in conformity with the JPEG international standard system. (6) Since the second encoded results do not contain the mode discrimination information, a special receiving device is not required. (5) Due to the fact that the first encoding is executed by mode discrimination in the pixel space and the second encoding is executed by making use of the mode discrimination results for processing coefficients in a processing space, it is possible to transform the second encoding in the frequency space with accuracy in a",
