No. 4,290,151, issued to Massana on Sep. 22, 1981, and are discussed In the articles of Carlos D. Duran and Jose Luis M. Ubago, \"Clinical and Hemodymanic Performance of a Totally Flexible Prosthetic Ring for Atrioventricular Valve Reconstruction\", 5 Annals of Thoracic Surgery, (No. 5), 458-463, (Nov. 1976) and M. Puig Massana et al, \"Conservative Surgery of the Mitral Valve Annuloplasty on a New Adjustable Ring\", Cardiovascular Surgery 1980, 30-37, (1981)., 29526=Other examples of adjustable ring prostheses are taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,602,911, issued to Ahmadi et al and 4,042,979, issued to Angell on Aug. 23, 1977, provide for mechanism of adjusting the ring circumference. In Ahmadi et al the ring prosthesis frame is a coiled spring ribbon which is adjusted by a mechanical screw assembly. In Angell, a drawstring is used to adjust the circumference of a rigid frame member. Again, these ring prostheses suffer from the disadvantages of the rigid ring prosthesis discussed above. The Angell prosthesis could also possess a substantially flexible portion after suturing which could include multiple plications for the reasons discussed above for the completely flexible prosthesis., 25732=Examples of rigid annuloplasty ring prostheses are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,656,185, issued to Carpentier on Apr. 18, 1972; and 4,164,046, issued to Cooley on Aug. 14, 1979. Certain artificial heart valves have also been developed with rigid frame members similar to the rigidity of the described valve prosthesis. Examples of this type of heart valve are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,204,283, issued to Bellhouse et al on May 27, 1980; and 4,306,319, issued to Kaster on Dec. 22, 1981., 30271=U.S. Pat. No. 4,055,861, issued to Carpentier on Nov. 1, 1977 teaches an annuloplasty ring prosthesis which has a flexibility between the completely flexible rings discussed above and rigid ring. The ring of Carpentier is deformable to an equal degree and simultaneously in all directions. The preferred support is described as having the elasticity of an annular bundle of 2 to 8 turns of a cylindrical bristle of poly(ethylene terephthalate)., 29004=An example of a self adjusting ring prosthesis is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,446, issued to Reed on Dec. 25, 1984. This annuloplasty ring prosthesis provides for self adjustment of the prosthesis annulus by two reciprocating pieces which form the prosthesis frame. The basic disadvantage of this ring prosthesis is that the individual frame members are formed from a rigid material, with the resulting prosthesis suffering the same disadvantages discussed above for rigid ring prosthesis in general., 21127=This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/833,600 filed on Feb. 10, 1992, now abandoned which is a continuation of application Ser. No. 07/387,909 filed on Jul. 31, 1989, now abandoned.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets While the preferred embodiments have been described, various modifications and substitutions may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is to be understood that the invention has been described by way of illustration and not limitation. The above described ring mount assembly 18 includes a ring support 20 formed by a C-shaped and straight side as best seen in FIG. 5. A second embodiment is seen in FIG. 6. This ring mount assembly 80 includes a ring support 82 which is formed with only an open C-shaped side 84. Except for the stated difference in shape of the ring support 82, this ring mount assembly 80 includes similar elements as those described for ring support 20, which are indicated by the prime of the previously provided element number, and will not be described in any more detail herein. This embodiment of ring mount assembly 80 provides an open area across which a suture is positioned after being tied off at the respective hole 66. In accordance with another embodiment, the first end 71 is tied off at hole 66, with the second end 73 passed first through one end of the ring prosthesis 10, and then brought back across and passed through the other prosthesis 10 end. This suture end 73 is again tied off at hole 66. Removal of suture 70 is accomplished by sniping the suture between",
