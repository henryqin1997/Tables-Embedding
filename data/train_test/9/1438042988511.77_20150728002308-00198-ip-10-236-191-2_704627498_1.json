The Saints are coming off of three consecutive emotional, primetime games and now have to adjust to playing in the daytime hours. This contest against the Rams is also sandwiched by two key games against the Panthers. By winning the first, last week, New Orleans has given itself a semi-comfortable margin for the NFC's No. 2 seed, but it's still fair to wonder how much the Saints are focused on the Rams on a short week with another game against Carolina ahead. Meanwhile, the Rams have two players who stylistically give the Saints problems in Zac Stacy and Robert Quinn, and it helps tremendously, obviously, that this game is in St. Louis.

Earlier in the season, I had a rule: \"Always take the points whenever anyone plays the Jaguars.\" But, as is proven over and over again, the NFL season is a long one that evolves considerably from Week 1 to Week 17. Once 0-8, the the Jags are riding a three-game win streak, the second-longest in the league right now behind only Philadelphia's. That has masked the fact that there are still significant flaws in Jacksonville, but the team is playing hard for Gus Bradley and having fun, and that goes a long way when playing a team with a similar talent level, as the Jags are this NFL Week 15 Betting Odds",
