            "Denton is a quiet college town, and I've never felt anything less than safe whilst walking long distances to enjoy its thriving night-life.",
            "UNT has a healthy Greek life, with a full fraternity row and sorority row, the members of which can often be seen on campus tabling for new recruits and raising funds.",
            "The Denton chapter of the International Socialist Organization (ISO), the Feminist Majority Leadership Alliance (FMLA), the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of Denton (GLAD), Young Americans for Liberty (YAL), as well as many other organizations, provide a variety of opportunities for many different kinds of students to feel included and get involved.",
            "Those students who appreciate a population of diverse political views, nationalities, races, religions, sexual orientations, as well as those students who appreciate a strong art community would do well at UNT.",
            "The annual UNT production of the Vagina Monologues and the associated V-Day fundraising effort for local and international women's organizations is particularly popular, well renowned, and effective at raising money and awareness.",
            "UNT has a large working-class student population and for good reason. It actually faces a budget deficit because the quality of services offered is so high compared to the relatively low prices of housing and tuition.",
            "UNT puts on a number of excellent musical performances, features many special guest lecturers, produces some notable plays, and screens several fine films a year, and many residential events (pajama parties, a haunted house in October) provide an array of fun times. It also has a brand new football stadium which is very admirable.",
            "UNT is generous enough to provide five cafeterias, one of which is 100% vegan, one of which specializes in fried comfort foods, and others which, together, represent almost every palate.",
            "There is a great deal of diversity amongst the dorms in terms of style and level of involvement. There's something for those who are quietly studious, those who are full of school spirit, those who love social interaction, and more.",
            "The difficulty curve is great for the average student. I have found that hard work earns an A, and that only a complete lack of effort or really unfortunate circumstances could earn a failing grade. The average student putting in average effort would probably earn a B.",
            "If prospective students were to take a tour of our quaint campus, they would get a good idea of what UNT has to offer for their unique interests and talents. That's all that it takes!",
            "UNT makes the college experience very easy. The teaching staff, in general, is very accommodating of diverse needs and talents, and the other services (dining, housing, transportation, and extracurricular events like plays and musical performances) are all affordable and accessible. It all comes at a relatively low price, as well."

They offer many different styles of cafeterias such as, an all vegan hall, a Cajun hall, a general foods hall, and many others. We have many places to eat on campus and some high dollar places like Starbucks., 58465=As I am in pursuit of my B.A.A.S. degree, UNT has excellent programs that accept my credits earned at a Technical College. I am looking forward to attending in the Fall of 2009. Everyone I have met at the campus is friendly and very helpful., 867393=February is a spring month, why is there snow? My class wasn't uphill when I was on time last Monday... HOW IS IT FINALS ALREADY????, 380469=I have attended UNT since Spring 2012 including Summer after having transferred from a junior college. I attend evening classes and had been working fulltime until now. As a result I am not very involved with lot's of campus activities, my review may be limited in some aspects., 383158=There are so many things on campus to do for fun, but the Union at the 1 o'clock lounge is the place to be on campus., 755652=A variety to choose from. There is cajun cafeterias, vegan cafeterias, as well as the standard ones., 214768=unt might not have the same prestige as smu, but it is still very nice, and certainly much cheaper. expect to pay about $1300 per 4 hour class (including fees, texts, etc.). financial aid seems kind of lacking, but the fa office claims it is temporarily short on funding., 408856=UNT is the best decision I have every made! I will be graduating this December with a Bachelors in Psychology and Minor in Spanish. Its diverse, comfortable, and its a awesome school!, 449420=I do not know yet. I will start in August., 51814=well lit, unt shuttle buses run all over campus and town until like 10:30, and emergency stations are numerous., 873635=Every April there is a 12 hour concert in one of the dorms (Bruce Hall) called Bruce Jam. This concert is open to everyone and features student bands. Bruce Hall also host a haunted house every October/, 938232=If you look around, there is usually something to do every day. I'm more of a hermit and keep to my room, but I hear about a lot of different things. Andy Grammar even did a concert here the other week! Most things are free too!, 1149997=UNT is great on traditions like the Mean Green Victory march after winning football games., our Alma Mater chant at Football games. Fraternity Bid Day marches around campus in the Fall and Spring. The campus bell that rings a nice little tune every hour on the hour. And certainly the unforgettable Eagle CAWH that anyone can throw up at a given time to show school spirit., 22038=Make sure you like where you will be living first and if you need a job apply in June or July. If you don't like noise don't stay in a dorm. Best freshmen halls for walking to class are Kerr and Maple as they have food for first thing in the morning and bus stops right in front of them. Also DON'T DO MORNING CLASSES!!! It's not like high school 8am because at least there you can go to bed before oh say... midnight?}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am enjoying being here The location of this campus, Denton, can be extremely dull at times, but the overall atmosphere of the school is gorgeous. On top of that, there is such a variety of students, you will never have trouble looking for the right crowd to fit in with. Am learning a lot Overall, the University of North Texas is a very accredited institution. However, every now and then you will find a blow off class or professor that might be alot easier/harder than others at the same level.
