Fourteen countries reported no consumption of opioid pain medicines between 2006 and 2008, meaning that there are no medicines to treat moderate to severe pain available through legitimate medical channels in those countries. In a further eight countries that do not report their consumption of opioids, the situation is likely similar, as governments participating in the international drug control regime will not export opioids to those that do not. Thirteen other countries do not consume enough opioids to treat even one percent of their terminal cancer and HIV/AIDS patients.

The working group decided to conduct a rapid situation analysis to assess the availability of and the need for palliative care in Vietnam.[119] Based on the rapid situation analysis\u2019s findings, the working group recommended that national palliative care guidelines and a balanced national opioid control policy be developed, training for healthcare workers be expanded, and that availability and quality of palliative care services be improved at all levels. In September 2006, the Ministry of Health issued detailed Guidelines on Palliative Care for Cancer and AIDS Patients, which provided guidance to practitioners on palliative care and pain management, and in February 2008, it issued new guidelines on opioid prescription, which eased regulatory barriers as described above., 221034=[88] Palliative Care Association of Uganda (PCAU), \u201cAudit Report of Palliative Care Services in Uganda,\u201d April 2009, http://www.theworkcontinues.com/document.asp?id=1386&pageno= (accessed March 27, 2010), pp. 7 and 12., 234024=[123]The Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health, Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, E/C.12/2000/4.

Concerted efforts by Uganda\u2019s government and civil society to improve access to palliative care have resulted in the removal of many of the barriers discussed in this survey. During 2006 to 2008 Uganda could already treat a significantly higher portion of its terminal HIV/AIDS and cancer patients than neighboring Kenya (Uganda: 7.4 percent; Kenya: 4.6 percent), even though Kenya\u2019s GDP is significantly higher than Uganda\u2019s. The ongoing process of improving access to palliative care in Uganda, discussed below, means that Uganda\u2019s consumption of opioids has likely increased subsequent to 2008, so that more patients care receive treatment., 236190=[128] The Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health, Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, E/C.12/2000/4.

It also instructed states to make adequate provision to ensure their availability. Yet, today these essential pain relieving drugs continue to be so poorly available in most of the world that WHO estimates that each year tens of millions of people suffer untreated moderate to severe pain, including 5.5 million terminal cancer patients and 1 million patients in the last phases of HIV/AIDS.[2], 117506=A handful of Eastern European and Central Asian countries\u2014Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan\u2014consume only enough opioids to treat less than 30 percent of their terminal cancer and HIV/AIDS patients.

Since then, the government has worked to improve the availability of narcotic medications. It added liquid morphine to its essential drug list and adopted a new set of Guidelines for Handling of Class A Drugs for health care practitioners, also a first in Africa. The Ministry of Health also started importing oral morphine powder and providing oral morphine solution to public health facilities at no cost.

Following an initial assessment and action plan for improving palliative care in Romania, Romania was selected as a pilot country by OSI and the Pain and Policy Studies Group (PPSG). In 2002, the Romanian Ministry of Health appointed a commission of specialists to provide reform recommendations.

In the last five years, the government has undertaken significant regulatory reforms to remove unnecessary barriers to accessing pain treatment and improve access to opioid medicines. In 2006 the government increased the maximum number of days allowed for the prescription of opioids from 10 to 30 days,[93] easing access for patients who need opioid therapy for extended periods of time. Revised regulation for regional drug procurement has also been put in place with the aim of improving opioid availability. The new regulation mandates all 32 Colombian states to have at least one place where opioids are guaranteed to be in stock at all times.[94] Morphine consumption has increased following these efforts to improve availability. Between 2006 and 2009, the government reported a 42 percent increase in units of morphine sold.[95], 206256=[58]Human Rights Watch interview with Don Schumacher, February 8, 2010; Human Rights Watch interview with Dr. Bill Noble, Macmillan Senior Lecturer in Palliative Medicine, Sheffield University, United Kingdom, December 14, 2009; Human Rights Watch interview with Dr Liz Gwyther, CEO, Hospice Palliative Care Association of South Africa, South Africa, October 6, 2010; Human Rights Watch interview with Dr Henry Ddungu, advocacy manager, African Palliative Care Association, Uganda, August 10, 2009., 95062=In Central America and the Caribbean, about half of the countries consume so few opioid medications that even if all were used exclusively to treat patients with terminal cancer and HIV for pain, less than a third of them could receive adequate treatment (Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and Haiti).

The new laws and regulations establish that it is the sole responsibility of the doctor to determine the appropriate opioid dose and allow doctors to prescribe opioids to patients in severe pain regardless of the underlying disease. Prior to the reforms, doctors could only prescribe opioids to patients suffering from a limited class of diseases, such as cancer in its advanced stages.

In our survey, we sought to establish how widely available morphine is in different types of healthcare facilities in countries as a way of measuring the effectiveness of the supply and distribution systems governments have put in place. In particular, we asked about the availability of injectable morphine in hospitals and oral morphine in tertiary hospitals, other hospitals, pharmacies, health centers, hospices, and AIDS clinics. We also asked whether, in the experience of the key informants, morphine was harder to access outside major cities and whether health care providers were involved in developing their government\u2019s estimates of its need for opioid medications. As the import, production, and distribution of controlled medicines are",
    "textAfterTable": "The table demonstrates that oral morphine is generally most widely available in tertiary hospitals and hospices; somewhat less available in pharmacies and smaller hospitals; and least likely to be available in health centers or AIDS clinics. In other words, patients with pain often need to be referred to larger health facilities, making pain treatment less accessible and more costly for them. Poor availability of oral morphine in smaller healthcare facilities also compounds access problems for people who live far from major cities, where larger health facilities are likely to be located. In many developing countries, distance and the cost of travel make it very difficult for people living in rural areas to reach any health facility, but their closest facility is likely to be a small clinic or health centre or perhaps a pharmacy or small hospital. As oral morphine and other opioids are less likely to be available in these settings than in larger hospitals, rural patients\u2019 barriers to accessing pain treatments are compounded.[44] A key component of a functioning supply and distribution system is a robust process to estimate the need for opioid medications. WHO has recommended that the government involve healthcare workers in developing such estimates.[45] In 23 of the countries surveyed, healthcare workers, who were mostly leading palliative care or pain management specialists, were not aware of any such consultations.[46] In several other countries, survey respondents reported occasional consultations that were thought",
