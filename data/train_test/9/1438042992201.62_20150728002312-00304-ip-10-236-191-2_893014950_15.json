            "I personally enjoy Greek Life at Southwestern. We have four sororities, which all have great girls. There is no rivalry between the sororities, and I have some friends in the ones outside of my own. However, there are no sorority houses. The men in the fraternities are genuine guys for the most part, and throw fun parties for the students on campus. They are usually very open about who attends their parties.",

            "The food is fairly good for a college campus and the dining hall staff is very friendly. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served on weekdays. Brunch is served on Saturday and Sunday, which is a very popular meal for students.",
            "The freshman dorms are very friendly. There are two coed dorms, which are both Living-Learning Communities, as well as a dorm exclusively for women, and one for men. There are also coed dorms for sophomores, which are also popular of students. Juniors and Seniors have the option of living off campus or in any of the apartments on campus.",
            "Southwestern has a challenging and rigorous academic environment. Many students spend a lot of their time studying, but the effort is worth it. Students learn a great deal in each of their courses."

    "textAfterTable": "Comments Great for these types of students Anyone can find a place at Southwestern. We have brilliant theater and art students, all of whom are dedicated and fun to be around. For the more athletic students, we have excellent sports teams. I am a member of the inaugural softball team and we won our side of the conference and made it to the conference tournament. The volleyball team made it to regionals as well as the men's basketball team. The baseball team played well in our conference as well as our men's and women's soccer team and women's basketball team. Tennis plays hard and we are lucky enough to have the opportunity to add on a men's lacrosse program and hopefully women's lacrosse will soon follow. A lot of the athletes major in kinesiology or some sort of science. Our science program is very academically challenging. I am positive that any student who attends this school will find their place here. Tips for prospective students If you plan on attending Southwestern, I would suggest you have an idea of what you want to accomplish. You don't have to pick your major until your junior year, but it's ideal to have a general direction on which you would like to travel. Join academic clubs, play sports, and participate in intramurals, for these things can help you decide where you want to go in your",
