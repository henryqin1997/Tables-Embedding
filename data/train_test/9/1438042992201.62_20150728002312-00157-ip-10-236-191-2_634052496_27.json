Honeybee Chronic Toxicity Note: Population-level effects on honeybees may occur even if a pesticide has low acute toxicity. For example, certain pesticides interfere with honeybee reproduction, ability to navigate, or temperature regulation, any of which can have an effect on long-term survival of honeybee colonies. The neonicotinoids, pyrethroids and keto-enol pesticides are some types of pesticides causing one or more of these effects. Sorry, no honeybee acute toxicity data available for this chemical.

Any underlined term with a book icon has additional information. * Data marked with an asterisk indicates that this chemical is not explicitly listed on the corresponding list. Instead, it belongs to a group of chemicals that IS designated on the list. For example, if an agency assigns a classification of reproductive toxicant to \"mercury compounds\", that classification is applied to all mercury compounds in the PAN Pesticide database, which are then marked with an asterisk.
