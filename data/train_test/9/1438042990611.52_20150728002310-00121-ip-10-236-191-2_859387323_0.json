    "textBeforeTable": "About Color and Availability - pictured above are some available Star/GStar colors. This model may not be available in all of these colors. Likewise, each weight range may not be available in all colors. Therefore we ask you to list and prioritize your color preferences and to give us guidance if the color or weight range you want happens to not be available. Feel free to contact us if you need more specific info. About GStar plastic in general - it has more flexibility and more grip than regular Star. It's more flexible in cold weather yet not floppy in hot weather. It retains flight characteristics longer than DX or Pro Plastic. It's just as durable as Star and maybe slightly more since added flexibility prevents damage during hard hits. All said and done, it offers high performance, longevity, superior grip, flexibility and an amazing pearlescent sheen. Speed 2, Glide 1, Turn 0, Fade 3 It is great for putting, short to medium drives, accurate approaches, and beginners. The Rhyno\u2019s Thumtrac gives it a sure grip and reliable performance in any situation. The Innova GStar Rhyno is an overstable putt and approach golf disc that can handle headwinds. Great for players with lots of throwing power as the Rhyno stops on a dime and stays close to the basket. It is a must have disc for short to medium up shots and putting into the wind. The Pro-line model is also called a \u201cSoft\u201d Rhyno and is made to",
    "textAfterTable": "\"Thank you Innova for the Rhyno! I have about 10 Rhynos that I cycle in and out of my bag all the time. This isn't just for putting; I throw most of my short mid-range shots with this disc. It is an awesome sidearm approach disc too.\" - Matt Dollar \"The Rhyno has so little glide and that's what I like about it. It is especially reliable in windy conditions and also has the best brakes in the business. Throw it in there on long approaches on uneven terrain and the Rhyno won't dance, hardly skip, it's lazy, it won't give you anymore than you gave it. The R-Pro Rhyno is as tough as they get. Take it out in the woods and if you hit a tree it will die and avoid the 60 foot deflections into deep trouble. Throw it again...it'll still be stable.\" - Simon Lizotte If you want a golf disc with more Fade, try the Viper more Turn, try the XD more Glide, try the Classic Aviar Other Speed 2 discs include the Aviar, Aviar Driver, Classic Aviar, JK Aviar, KC Aviar, Nova. and Yeti Pro Aviar.
