My older iMac (2007 \u2013 OSX Tiger and still goin I bought the LaCie 1TB P9223 as backup for my new iMac 21.5 (OSX Yosemite 10.10.4). My older iMac (2007 \u2013 OSX Tiger and still going strong) has been retired to the bedroom. I have a LaCie backup drive also for the older iMac and it has worked perfectly for nearly eight years. It was used to transfer all my files to the new iMac, as the Migration Assistant is not compatible with OSX 10.4. The LaCie P9223 arrived the next day after ordering from the Apple Store and was easy to install, but I could not register it as requested by the LaCie Setup Assistant and was informed of a \u2018server error \u2013 please try again later\u2019. I then registered it separately online with the LaCie website. It is externally robust in its aluminium casing and sits well above the Apple SuperDrive on the foot of the iMac. When requested by the LaCie Setup Assistant, I opted for 100% partitioning for Mac. This is simply achieved by dragging the slider displayed in the Setup Assistant all the way to the left to illuminate the default partition and clicking OK. When the prompt to choose the Apple Time Machine for backup was displayed I selected OK and Time Machine started the first backup. I took 35 minutes for around 90 GB. Thereafter, Time Machine has been backing up so far without a problem. I have not impaled myself on the \u2018sharp corners\u2019 of the casing as mentioned by some reviewers, but as I don\u2019t need mobility \u2013 using it exclusively for the iMac \u2013this is not a problem, although I see what they mean. I have no horror stories to relate, and if the reliability of my previous LaCie drive is equaled by the P9223 I will have none. \u2026 More (Read full review)}",
