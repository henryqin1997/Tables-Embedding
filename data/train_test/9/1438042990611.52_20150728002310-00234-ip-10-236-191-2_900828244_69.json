            "There is always campus security around to make students feel safe. They do their job and are there if you need them.",
            "CNM is very affordable even for a full time student.",
            "CNM is again a community college. There is not much of a campus life style. Student's go to class and go home.",
            "I cannot honestly rate food and dining for CNM. I know they have snack bars on campus but I have never felt the desire to go there.",
            "There is no dorm life. Simple. If you are a student looking for dorm life you'd be better at UNM. CNM is mainly for people who are older and going back to school or students who can't afford schools like UNM.",
            "The professors push you to succeed. They give enough work that you will learn something as well as not falling behind. They are also lenient on attendance if there is a logical reason.",
            "I discovered this year that taking morning and night classes at CNM main campus in Albuquerque when I live in Rio Rancho is not very smart. If you are a CNM student and live more than 20 minute from main campus do not take classes first thing in the morning or after 4:30. The traffic is horrendous this time of day. Also finding parking at main campus is very tricky. Around 8 am the parking lots tend to fill up and don't start emptying until around 6-7 pm.",
            "Central New Mexico Community College is a great place to start before moving on to a larger university to get your bachelor degree. The professors are very knowledgable and helpful. They will work with you to make sure you don't fail. For those who don't like large classes, CNM is great. The class sizes are large enough where it doesn't feel like one-on-one learning but small enough to where you don't feel lost in the crowd. CNM also offers a large array of classes to suit anyones needs."
