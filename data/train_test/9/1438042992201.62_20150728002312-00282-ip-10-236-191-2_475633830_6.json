Rather, the scope of the invention is to be interpreted only in conjunction with the appended claims. One such material for producing the authentication signature 80 is derived from a solution of potassium ferrocyanide. After drying, the authenticating signature 80 executed in the non-visible material 81, may be easily rendered visible by a solution of ferris sulphate. This could be achieved by wiping over the authenticating signature with a marker pen 100 filled with the indicator. Preferably an area 60 on the face 15 of the check 10 just above the signature line 75 would be identified by delineation such that the receiver of the check would know where to resolve the invisible authenticating signature 80. Preferably the delineation would include a U-shaped box outline 70. An additional means for assuring the authenticity of the bearer of a check 10 is an authenticating signature 80, deposited by writing or other means, on the face 15 of the check 10 in a normally non-visible material 81, but which is capable of later being easily rendered visible, such that after the execution of the check, the authenticating signature 80 may be rendered visible for comparison with the already executed signature 82 by the bearer.
