            "College students who haven't quite settled on what degree they want yet; Don't waste your money at a big university - figure it out here where you can literally try out anything you want and find your niche.",
            "As with all the maricopa colleges, MCC has their own press so they help the student wallet a TON when it comes to books. You're getting the same, if not more one-on-one education time as you would with a big university, but paying WAY less! I love it here!",
            "There are so many events going on all the time, it's easy to find something to do. From plays that go on all year long to clubs and athletic/charity/everything events, MCC always has plenty going on!",
            "Newly renovated Lounge area has coffee, cafe, and lunch type foods. Great for a quick bite or a meal between classes. Price is a little high, so there's also restaurants walking distance across the street from campus if you want more bang for you buck (and to walk off those calories).",
            "Academics are excellent with professors who know how to challenge their students to ensure they're getting the most out of their education.",
            "Talk with your professors before they become your professors. They'll know better than even the academic advisement what path you should be taking based on what your goals are.",
            "Mesa Community College puts you in charge of your education; you want it, you go for it. You definitely get out what you put it here; If you put in the effort, your professors will bend over backwards to help you, but vice versa if you aren't willing to put in the effort, your instructors will have little to work with and can't help you. Mesa CC is also incredibly diverse in the degrees they offer with literally something for everyone and ways of discovering what degree really is the best one for you."

Back in 2011, the lunch room was very modest, and pretty dull to be honest. The new updated 2012 room is more of a lounge or really large cafe. The food selection has grown, there are many tables, couches and chairs to lounge around on, plenty of vending machines, and an overall more relaxed environment, though it may become a bit loud a times. The food pricing is typical for any college; overpriced. In the end, I must applaud MCC for stepping their game up on this aspect., 409901=This is the place to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life. Take all the basic courses and figure out what subjects you enjoy the most. If you end up changing you're career then you only have to pay $1200 more instead of $12000 at most universities.}",
