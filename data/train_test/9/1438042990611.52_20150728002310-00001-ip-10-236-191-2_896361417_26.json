            "The campus is very safe. As for Campus Safety (our version of campus police) they are there when you need them. Also, with Medical Amnesty they really are there to help.",
            "There is something for everyone. Campus Activities Board, Crossroads Program, I AM WE ARE, Queers & Allies, Christian Athletes, Gustie Dems, Gustavus Atheist and Agnostic, and many more.",
            "Midnight express: the teachers serve you dinner the night before finals week begins. There are many, many more.",
            "Yes, the sticker price is a little overwhelming. However, Gustavus is great when it comes to scholarships and financial aid. For me it was less expensive to attend Gustavus than a State School.",
            "St. Peter is a quiet college town. However, there are always things to do on campus. If you want a change of scenery there is Patricks Pub, a Movie Theatre, and the Co-op. Also, the cities and Mankato are just a short drive away!",
            "6th in the nation is what we are... or 8th. Anyway, the food is fantastic.",
            "Freshmen housing is ok. However, once you start moving into the upperclassmen housing, it is great.",
            "Like any institution there are classes that will be less than challenging. However, the majority of the courses that you will take will challenge you to think and to push your comfort zone. Almost all instructors are willing to go above and beyond to help you achieve your potential as a human being.",
            "Make sure you check out arboretum while on campus, it is a great place to take a walk and visit with friends. Also, be sure to try something new in the caf.",
            "Gustavus is a place where a beautiful sense of community is fostered, while students are encouraged to be themselves and explore their passions and ideas. Gustavus is the right fit for you if you want to be involved and gain life long friends while you learn."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Gustavus is expensive. That's a fact. However, as a student where financial aid was a large factor in my choice, Gustavus really came through. After speaking with my admissions counselor and financial aid, I was able to work out something that could work for me. Never let price get in the way of the college you want to go to, including Gustavus. It is possible, and 100% worth it. Am enjoying being here Gusties are kind, considerate, and friendly people. Even with the wind (it is extremely windy) people still have smiles on their faces. The cafeteria is outstanding (Top Ten Best Campus Food in the Country. Literally.). The buildings are nice to look at, and there is plenty of things to do during the week or on the weekends. Activities are constantly going on, including concerts in the Cafe, improv comedies, guest speakers, game nights, and dances. There is never a lack of things to do in between studying! The town of Saint Peter is very small, and the movie theater isn't the greatest. Luckily, Mankato is about 15 minutes away, and you can get anything you need from there. It makes life more enjoyable when you can get to Target! Am learning a lot If",
