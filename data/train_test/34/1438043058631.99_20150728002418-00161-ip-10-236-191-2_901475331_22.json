            "Campus security is very present and makes sure all of our students feel safe at all times. They are very approachable if you notice suspicious activity, and will take care of it immediately. I have never felt truly unsafe walking alone, even at night.",
            "Since we're already like a giant sorority, we don't have any official sororities on campus. The closest would be ADA, but they aren't so much Greek as a secret society that raises awareness and excitement for events coming up on the horizon. Instead of togas, they wear purple.",
            "Because we're a small liberal arts school, we don't have a whole lot of sports, but we do have soccer, lacrosse, swimming, and volleyball, and a few other non-varsity sports. As for clubs, there are too many to list here, but there is at least one club for everyone. One such example, a club I participate actively in, is WA2, or Women Who Appreciate Anime. We meet every Friday and watch 2 hours of Japanese animation, bring different Japanese culture traditions to campus (kakurenbo, or hide in the seek in the dark; Maid Cafe, a maid-themed Japanese cafe; and others), and together with the specialty house Otaku Hall, put on a convention every January.",
            "If you are quirky and creative, feminist and with a rebellious streak, you will fit in here perfectly. Don't be scared off if you're more conservative, though -- our campus is diverse in lots of ways. Just keep in mind that if you're against LGBTQ rights, you may want to keep quiet about your opinions, as we have an unusually high percentage of queer students here.",
            "Every year on a surprise date is Tinker Day, when all classes are cancelled and we dress up in crazy outfits and hike up Tinker Mountain to partake of fried chicken and Tinker cake, and then watch a number of skits from the different classes.",
            "Though high, tuition is very transparent as to what it's used for, and every time there's a tuition hike they let us know exactly what it's going toward. This year, tuition was slightly higher in order to include laundry, so we no longer had to mess with quarters in the washing machines.",
            "Every weekend there are shuttles into downtown Roanoke, where there are a lot of cute local shops that are fun to explore. There's also occasionally a farmer's market and bazaar, with stands from many local businesses. Other things include the mall, movie theater, mini golf, Mill Mountain and its zoo, and a host of restaurant choices.",
            "Moody Dining Hall is average at best, but unfortunately has its sub-par days as well. If you are paying very close attention to what you're eating, you can eat healthily. Because we're in the South, some of the food is a little more fatty than necessary. There's also a sad lack of vegetarian variety, though if you're happy with beans, tofu, and salad, you can continue a veggie diet.",
            "The freshman dorm is somewhat small, but has air conditioning, something the other dormitories on campus don't have. The buildings are all fairly old, and have a cozy feel to them. Walls can be pretty thin, though, so make sure you have a respectful rapport with your neighbors, in case you -- or them -- are being too loud, so you can resolve the problem easily and not have to involve an RA.",
            "The classes are challenging and fast-paced, and active participation is encouraged and sometimes required. As long as you perfect your time management, schedules should not become overwhelming. Any time there is confusion, professors are willing to answer questions.",
            "Branch out and try classes you might not ordinarily take! If something sounds interesting and isn't in your field of study, go right ahead and take it -- we have class perspectives for a reason. Even classes that seem completely random will probably count toward your graduation requirements.",
            "Hollins has top-notch class schedules, professors, and students. The professors really care about their students' education and will often check in if you are struggling in some way. The community is very tight-knit and accepting of new people."

All day classes are cancelled. Then, this is totally optional, you climb up Tinker Mountain, which is a HIKE, in crazy costumes. Then at the top, you sing songs, put on skits, and eat fried chicken and picnic fare. This is just one really nice tradition. There are several more!, 122606=Tinker Day!

While the staff where great and friendly, the food choices were usually lacking. However, they are moving to a new group for the 2014/15 school year., 146734=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 80180=Hollins University is home to a plethora of unusual traditions, one of the most well known being Tinker Day. Tinker Day usually happens in the middle of the week. The church bells are rung around 5:30 am and all the students join in the cafeteria for donuts. Classes are then cancelled for the rest of the day as everyone dresses in incredibly ridiculous outfits and then hikes Tinker mountain, which is literally a mountain.}",
