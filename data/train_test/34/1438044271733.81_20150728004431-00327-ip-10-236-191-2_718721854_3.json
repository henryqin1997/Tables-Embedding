    "textBeforeTable": "Table 1 Example Uranus Exposure Time Calculations We used the JWST exposure time calculator (ETC) to estimate exposure times of Uranus and Neptune in each observing mode based on flux values derived from existing IR spectra of both planets. We compared the exposure time estimates for wide and narrow-band imaging with the planetary rotation rates (17.24 hours for Uranus and 16.11 hours for Neptune) to determine the number of imaging filters and spectral resolution elements that may be sampled before significant planetary rotation occurs. Tables 1 and 2 provide a list of proposed exposure times with corresponding SNRs for Uranus and Neptune, respectively. Based on the observing plans provided in Tabke s 1 and 2, Uranus will rotate by 18.4\u00b0 and Neptune will rotate by 6.4\u00b0 if all observations are made in succession, assuming no overheads. Overhead estimates are not currently available, but if we assume ~50% efficiency for Uranus and ~10% efficiency for Neptune. Filters were selected for exposure time calculations based on filter bandwidth and spectral feature overlap. General Description of Exposure Time Calculations All observations are taken 4 times to sample the latitudinal variations on the planet. OBSERVATION DETAILS: NIRCam Imaging MIRI Imaging NIRSpec IFU OBSERVING TEMPLATE: MIRI MRS-IFU Neptune TARGET(S): Uranus NOMINAL ALLOCATION (hours): 168 NIRCam imaging, NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy, and MIRI IFU spectroscopy imaging will be obtained for both planets. Neptune is too bright for MIRI Imaging. These observations will be obtained with a cadence that",
