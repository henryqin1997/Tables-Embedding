This rating is represented as either a percentage or a decimal, with 1 (or 100%) being perfect absorption and 0 (or 0%) being perfect reflection. In other words, the higher the decimal or percent, the more sound the tile will absorb.

    "textAfterTable": "Sound Transmission Class (STC) Sound Transmission Class (STC) is used to rate several different types of building materials for their ability to block sound and prevent it from passing through them. Putting appropriate material between you and a sound source can reduce the apparent loudness of the sound. Adding material with an STC of 5 is clearly noticeable and an STC of 10 or more cuts the apparent loudness by 50%. As the STC goes up, the loudness continues to go down.
