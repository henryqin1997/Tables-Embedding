If you are very interested in attending school at UAA, the professors are very helpful on homework, the stuggle a student have, and they also take time for you to improve and acomplish it until you understand it.

And as stated the cost of tuition fees would be lowered being a resident. Also being a student at UAA you would be able to use the gym, swimming pool, shutter, and other great places around the campus for free, well not for free because all of the equipments and activities are already included in the tuition fees. And making a wolf card is free with a 10 dollar already included in the wolf card for printing. Am enjoying being here I as a current enroll student, really love it here at UAA. I meet many new people, meet many new challenges, and being a resident in Alaska lowers the tuition fees. Am learning a lot",
