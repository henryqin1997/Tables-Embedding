    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the invention has been described in detail herein in accordance with certain preferred embodiments thereof, many modifications and changes therein may be effected by those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will note from the above discussion that provided herein is an enhanced heat exchanger for use in cooling electronic components, or other type components. The heat exchanger may include thermoelectric structures to further enhance the ability to cool the electronic components by improving heat removal capability for a given heat exchanger volume and volumetric air flow. A thermoelectric-enhanced heat exchanger in accordance with the present invention can be readily designed for use with a specific heat generating component, e.g., an electronic module housing one or more integrated circuit chips, to ensure optimal temperature distribution on the component while minimizing cooling costs. In addition, by integrating thermoelectric structures and fins between adjacent pairs of passages carrying cooling fluid, space is conserved. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 3, operationally as the heat generating component(s) generates heat, heat is transferred therefrom into the coolant fluid passing through heat transfer devices 140 (e.g. cold plates). Pump 150 pumps the heated coolant to an input port or entrance of the passages of the heat exchanger via circulation conduit 130. With",
