    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{4809=In January of this year the hard working Bobby Robinson passed away and pay a sort of mini tribute to him, playing several records he produced and issued. He was the owner of Harlem's most successful record store, Bobby's Happy House of Hits, he worked as an amateur talent scout and, as well as advising major blues record companies, he ran his own now legendary labels Red Robin, Whirlin' Disc, Fire and Fury. n 1951, he launched Robin Records (which later became Red Robin Records), and began recording doo wop. He claimed that being stuck in traffic at the New Jersey turnpike cost him the chance to sign Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. In 1956, he formed Whirlin' Disc Records, but after falling out with his business partner formed Fury Records in 1957.Passing blues musicians would often offer to record for Robinson. The most spectacular result in his career was when he gave Harrison studio time in 1959. The resulting single, \"Kansas City\", went on to sell more than 3m copies, topping both the R&B and pop charts. Other blues artists he recorded included Bobby Marchan, Lee Dorsey, Lightnin' Hopkins, Elmore James, Arthur Crudup, Champion Jack Dupree, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee among numerous others., 6872=The Griffin Brothers, one of Dot Records' most popular touring R&B acts, hired Noble Watts right after he finished college, and he toured with them for a time. In 1952, he joined famed baritone saxophonist Paul \"Hucklebuck\" Williams as a member of the house band for the groundbreaking TV show \u201cShowtime At The Apollo.\u201d Later on, he had a stint playing with Lionel Hampton's big band. He also played on late '50s tour packages behind the likes of Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers. Watts first recording came in 1954 on DeLuxe Records. A 1956 single for VeeJay Records preceded his two-year association with New York's Baton label. The song \u201cHard Times (The Slop)\u201d brought Watts to the pop charts in 1957. Countless tours and performances \u2013 as well as a string of singles for various labels \u2013 kept Watts busy through the 1960s and into the 1970s. We hear Watts today on the fine instrumental \"Jookin.\", 45219=Sun 9 Dec 2012, 33966=Inspired by the successful model of the guitarist Les Paul and the singer Mary Ford, he formed a duo with the singer Sylvia Vanderpool (later Sylvia Robinson). Mickey & Sylvia's recording of \u201cLove Is Strange\u201d, a million-selling hit in 1956-57. In the wake of \"Love Is Strange\", he and Vanderpool opened a nightclub, started a publishing company and generally tried to take more charge of their performing lives than was usually possible for black artists. But their personal relationship was stormy and Baker was tired of playing forgettable music for teenagers. Early in the 60s, he moved to France., 27825=Teddy McRae, also known as Mr. Bear, cut a few isolated titles as a leader, including two songs for King in 1945, six for Groove in 1955 and two numbers for Moonshine in 1958, and recorded with Champion Jack Dupree from 1955-56. Prior to this he was an important an arranger and tenor-saxophonist for several bands including Cab Calloway, Jimmie Lunceford, Lionel Hampton and Chick Webb's., 30842=During the period covered in this show, Baker recorded only a handful of sides under his own names, fifteen sides between 1952 and 1956. In addition to the above mentioned Big Red McHouston sides, the rest of the sides\u00a0 are instrumentals and today we spin several of those including \"Shake Walkin'\", \"Bandstand Stomp\" and \"Rock With A Sock.\" In addition he cut his only full-length album from this period, 1959's The Wildest Guitar and all instrumental\u00a0outing issued on Atlantic., 17029=We've done a couple of shows on the New York blues scene including last year's show on ace session man Larry Dale and more recently a show devoted to recordings revolving around Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry's New York recording activities. New York City has never had a big reputation as a blues town, compared to Chicago and L.A. It did however have a very lively postwar R&B scene. The R&B scene had its peak between 1945 and 1960 and has always been closely associated with the local jazz scene. There were nationally important clubs like the Apollo and Savoy and numerous other spots for live entertainment. The recording scene was dominated by a group of small but enterprising independent companies like Apollo, DeLuxe, Fire/Fury, Herald, Baton, Joe Davis, Old Town and in particular, Atlantic and Savoy. There was also out of town companies that recorded local talent like Federal and RCA\u2019s Groove and Vik subsidiaries. Literally hundreds and hundreds of R&B recordings were made, aimed at the black market with occasional cross over success. Today's show spans the early 50's through the early 60's spotlighting a slew of great lesser known blues artists as well as bigger names like Big Maybelle, Paul Williams and Champion Jack Dupree. We also spotlight the contributions of trio of sizzling session guitarists: Larry Dale, Mickey Baker and Jimmy Spruill., 30215=Among the earliest sides I heard Baker on those backing Big Maybelle, Nappy Brown and Champion Jack Dupree. Baker appears on several Big Maybelle sessions in 1954, 1955 and 1956 and backs Nappy Brown's on his 1952 debut plus sessions in 1955 and 1960. Baker backs Jack Dupree on sessions in 1953 and 1955 and the two reunited for a session in London in 1967 for the Decca label., 28714=A couple of lesser known New York artists worth mentioning are Eddie Mack and Mr. Bear. Mack was part of the Brooklyn blues scene in the late 40's and early 50's but his subsequent career is a mystery. He fronted various groups by Cootie Williams & His Orchestra (he replaced Eddie Vinson), Lucky Millinder & His Orchestra and others. He cut some two-dozen sides between 1947-1952. Mickey Baker appears on Mack's final four sides for the Savoy label which are among his best., 7365=Buster Brown played harmonica at local clubs and made a few recordings, including \u2018I\u2019m Gonna Make You Happy\u2019 in 1943. Brown moved to New York in 1956 where he was discovered by Fire Records owner Bobby Robinson while working in a chicken and barbecue joint. In 1959, he recorded the \"Fannie Mae\", whose tough harmonica riffs took it into the US Top 40. In later years he recorded for Checker Records and for numerous small labels including Serock, Gwenn and Astroscope., 5487=As Tarheel Slim, Allen Bunn,\u00a0 encored on Bobby Robinson's Red Robin logo in 1953. He also sang with\u00a0 R&B vocal groups, the Wheels and the Lovers. As Tarheel Slim he made his debut in 1958 with his wife, Little Ann, in a duet format for Robinson's Fire imprint. He cut a pair of rockabilly raveups of his own, \"Wilcat Tamer\" and \"No. 9 Train\" (both featuring Jimmy Spruill). After a few years off the scene, Tarheel Slim made a bit of a comeback during the early 1970's, with an album for Trix, his last recording. He died in 1977., 11788=In the early and mid-'50s, Mickey Baker did countless sessions for Atlantic, King, RCA, Decca, and OKeh, playing on such classics as the Drifters' \"Money Honey\" and \"Such a Night,\" Joe Turner's \"Shake Rattle & Roll,\" Ruth Brown's \"Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean,\" and Big Maybelle's \"Whole Lot of Shakin' Going On.\" He also released a few singles under his own name. Baker was also recorded as half of the duo Mickey & Sylvia. We hear Baker on several numbers today, including those already mentioned backing Larry Dale, such as Champion Jack Dupree's \"Stumbling Block Blues\", Big Maybelle's \"I'm Getting 'Long Alright\" and a pair of sides by blues shouter Eddie Mack. Mack was part of the Brooklyn blues scene in the late 40's and early 50's but his subsequent career is a mystery. He fronted various groups by Cootie Williams & His Orchestra (he replaced Eddie Vinson), Lucky Millinder & His Orchestra and others. He cut some two-dozen sides between 1947-1952. Baker also\u00a0 appeared on a series of instrumental sides by piano pounder Sam Price cut for the Savoy label in the late 50's such as \"Bar-B-Q Sauce\", \"Chicken Out\" and our selection, \"Rib Joint.\" All these sessions were collected on the now out-of-print 2-LP set Rib Joint. He also cut several instrumentals under his own name during this period., 9972=Jimmy Spruill landed in new York in 1955 where he worked steadily as a session sideman, appearing on records by King Curtis, Little Anthony and the Imperials, the Shirelles, Tarheel Slim and Elmore James, in addition to putting out singles under his own name. He most frequently worked for the record producers Danny and Bobby Robinson, who ran record labels called Fire, Fury, Everlast, Enjoy and VIM out of Bobby's Happy House of Hits record store in Harlem. In May 1959, \"The Happy Organ\" by Dave \"Baby\" Cortez reached #1 on the Billboard chart, before giving way only one week later to Wilbert Harrison's \"Kansas City\", both of which featured guitar solos by Spruill. He almost duplicated this feat in 1961 when Bobby Lewis's \"Tossin' and Turnin'\", featuring Spruill's guitar solo, hit #1 was followed up the charts by the Shirelles' \"Dedicated To The One I Love\", which peaked at #3. Another well-known recording on which Spruill plays is \"Fannie Mae\" by Buster Brown. His rhythm work in the background of some of Elmore James' last records is also notable. In 1957 Bobby Robisnon began issuing\u00a0 Jimmy Spruill's solo 45's, on Fire and its subsidiary labels Enjoy, Vest, and VIM where cut tough instrumentals like \"Hard Grind\", \"Scratchin'\", \"Slow Draggin'\", \"Scratch 'n Twist\" and \"Cut and Dried.\"\u00a0 Those tracks and more are available on the Night Train CD Wild Jimmy Spruill: Scratch & Twist (Released and\u00a0 Unreleased Recordings 1956-1962). We hear Sprull today ripping it up on a couple of his own killer instrumentals, \"Hard Grind\" and \"Kansas City March\", as well as backing Bob Gaddy, Buster Brown, Noble \"Thin Man\" Watts' and Hal Paige., 905=Sun 13 Dec 2009, 29823=Baker backed a number of veteran artists who were trying to update their sound for the new rock and roll craze including Amos Milburn, Wynonie Harris, Big Joe Turner and Louis Jordan. Turner sailed into the rock and roll era rather seamlessly, scoring\u00a0a big hit with \u201cShake, Rattle and Roll\u201d with Baker on guitar. Although not commercially successful, Baker and Louis Jordan cut some rocking records during this period. In 1956, Mercury Records signed Jordan, releasing two LP's and a handful of singles. Jordan's first LP with Mercury, Somebody Up There Digs Me, showcased updated rock n' roll versions of previous hits such as \"Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens\",\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\", \"Salt Pork, West Virginia\", \"Beware!\" and a scorching \"Caldonia\" which we feature today; its follow-up, Man, We're Wailin' (1957), featured a more laid back \"late night\" sound. Although Mercury intended for this to be a comeback for Jordan, the comeback did not turn out to be a success, and the label let Jordan go in 1958., 8048=A few other artists worth mentioning are Buddy & Ella Johnson, Buster Brown, Noble \"Thin Man\" Watts and Tarheel Slim. In 1939, Buddy Johnson waxed his first 78 for Decca and shortly thereafter, Ella joined her older brother. Buddy had assembled a nine-piece orchestra by 1941 and visited the R&B charts often for Decca during the mid-40's. The Johnson band barnstormed the country to sellout crowds throughout the '40s. Buddy moved over to Mercury Records in 1953 and scored several R&B hits. Buddy kept recording for Mercury through 1958, switched to Roulette the next year, and bowed out with a last session for Hy Weiss' Old Town label in 1964., 31363=Another favorite record of mine is the now out-of-print 2-LP set Rib Joint. Baker backed piano pounder Sam Price on a series of instrumental sides for the Savoy label in 1956 and 1959. The sides feature great session players including King Curtis, Leonard Gaskin, Panama Francis Al Casey and Kenny Burrell among others. We spin several selections from these sessions including \"Rib Joint\", \"Kansas City Boogie Woogie Stomp\", \"Bar-B-Q Sauce\" and \"Juke Joint.\", 14927=We first hear Dale in the company of Paul Williams on three sides from 1953 and 1954. Williams moved with his family from the south to Detroit where he began playing sax professionally after high school. His song \"The Hucklebuck\" stayed on the charts for 32 weeks in 1949. Nothing else matched this success the fame form that hit kept Williams busy recording and performing live for years. He led the house band at Harlem's Apollo Theater\u00a0 in the mid-50's and later directed the bands of Lloyd Price and James Brown. He retired from music in 1964. Our selections find Williams laying down some tough R&B with New york Larry Dale taking the vocals and playing guitar on the blistering 'Shame Shame Shame\" and \"The Woman I Love Is Dying\" and playing guitar on the jumping \"Women Are The Root Of All Evil\" featuring Jimmy Brown on vocals., 15636=Born in Texas, Larry Dale had moved to New York City in 1949 and quickly fell into the local blues scene. Dale made his start with Paul \"Hucklebuck\" Williams\u2019 band in the early 50\u2019s. Dale was much in-demand on the New York blues scene during this period working with Bob Gaddy, Mickey Baker (as a vocalist), Champion Jack Dupree, Cootie Williams and others. He also cut scattered sides under his own name for several New York labels., 13941=We also hear Dales' playing behind Champion Jack Dupree, Mr. Bear, Cousin Leroy, Bob Gaddy, Mickey Baker as well as sides cut under his own name.\u00a0 Dale played on all four of Dupree's 1956-58 sessions for RCA's Groove and Vik subsidiaries, and on the best known Dupree LP, 1958's Blues from the Gutter, for Atlantic. Today we hear Dale backing Dupree on the rocking\u00a0 \"Shake Baby Shake\" from 1952 and 1956's \"The Story of my Life.\" Teddy McRae also known as Mr. Bear cut a few isolated titles as a leader, including two songs for King in 1945, six for Groove in 1955 and two numbers for Moonshine in 1958, and recorded with Champion Jack Dupree from 1955-56. Prior to this he was an important an arranger and tenor-saxophonist for several bands including Cab Calloway, Jimmie Lunceford, Lionel Hampton and Chick Webb's. In 1955 and 1957, Cousin Leroy recorded eight tough tracks that had a little something extra that drove blues fans crazy when they came out on unauthorized records in the 60s. Nothing is known about his background. Both as a session man and featured recording artist, pianist Bob Gaddy made his presence known on the New York blues scene during the 1950's. He arrived in New York in 1946. Gaddy gigged with Brownie McGhee and guitarist Larry Dale around town, McGhee often playing on Gaddy's waxings for Jackson, Jax, Dot, Harlem, and from 1955 on, Hy Weiss' Old Town label. There Gaddy stayed the longest into 1960. Both Gaddy and Dale remained active on the New York scene for decades after. Larry Dale is featured on guitar. We hear Dale backed by Mickey Baker on \"Stranger Blues\" and the menacing \"You Better Heed My Warning.\" In 1960, Dale did another vocal session, for the Old Town subsidiary Glover in New York City, resulting in two fine singles, \"Big Muddy\" and the song that gives today's show its title, the scorching party number \"Let the Door Bell Ring\" which hit the R&B charts., 25116=Tue 22 Nov 2011}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{23732=Blues vocalist, stand-up pianist and occasionally organist, Betty Hall Jones worked with Bus Moten's band and Addie Williams in Kansas City. Returning to California, she performed as a single artist before joining drummer/vocalist Roy Milton's band in L.A. in 1937. She almost certainly recorded on piano behind Alton Redd for the Black & White label in 1945, and accompanied Luke Jones on the Atlas recording sessions, and possibly with Red Mack for the same label in 1946 and 1947. In the same year she recorded with King Porter for Imperial label (the tremendous \"That Early Morning Boogie\" that we just heard) and under her own name for Atomic, Capitol and under Luke Jones' name for Modern. She recalled cutting unissued titles behind Ray Charles for Capitol. In the 1950's she recorded for Dootone and Combo., 6877=Today\u2019s spotlight is on the Blue Moon label, a Spanish label that for the last five years or so has been reissuing some amazing recordings of jump blues and R&B from the mid-40\u2019s to the mid-50\u2019s. Blue Moon can been seen as a sort sister label to Document records; where Document issues the complete recorded work in chronological order of every blues artist from the pre-war era, Blue Moon has been reissuing the chronological recordings of some great jump blues pioneers from the immediate post-war era. Much of this music has been unavailable on CD and spotlights a fascinating era when jump blues was merging into R&B and eventually morphing into rock and roll. The\u00a0 label has done an invaluable service by issuing the chronological recordings of neglected pioneers like Sonny Thompson, Cecil Gant, Tiny Grimes, Goree Carter, Paul Williams, Jack McVea and many others. The music on today\u2019s program is a mix of jump blues and R&B. Jump Blues refers to an uptempo, jazz-tinged style of blues that first came to prominence in the mid- to late '40s. Usually featuring a vocalist in front of a large, horn-driven orchestra or medium sized combo with multiple horns, the style usually features a driving rhythm, shouted vocals, and honking tenor saxophone solos. Billboard magazine first used the term \"Rhythm and Blues\" as the title for its black music charts in 1949, replacing \"race music.\" R&B evolved out of jump blues in the late '40s, laying the groundwork for rock & roll. R&B kept the tempo and the drive of jump blues, but its instrumentation was sparer and the emphasis was on the song, not improvisation. It was blues chord changes played with an insistent backbeat., 22750=The Arkansas-born, Chicago-based singer-guitarist Arbee Stidham hit the top of Billboard's \"race\" chart in 1948 with his recording of \"My Heart Belongs to You\" and recorded prolifically over the next two decades for a variety of labels. He retired from music in 1974., 18892=Blue Moon has issued all of Jack McVea\u2019s recordings between 19944-1952 over four CD\u2019s. McVea played baritone saxophone in the Lionel Hampton Orchestra in 1942. He led one of the West Coast's earliest R&B combos and backed up important artists such as T-Bone Walker and Wynonie Harris. McVea's own \"Open The Door, Richard!\" created one of the biggest crazes ever to come out of black music in the pre-Rock'n'Roll era. He blew tenor sax alongside Illinois Jacquet at the first 'Jazz At The Philharmonic' in 1944, and he jammed and recorded with Slim Gaillard and Charlie Parker., 17093=Bandleader and pianist Sonny Thompson was among the most prolific R&B instrumentalists of the late '40s and early '50s. Thompson began recording for Sultan in 1946, then did several sessions for Miracle, King, Federal, and Deluxe, while also backing vocalist Lula Reed from 1951 to 1961. Thompson scored two number one R&B hits for Miracle in 1948: \"Long Gone,\" Pts. 1 & 2, and \"Late Freight.\" He landed another Top Ten and two more Top 20 singles for Miracle in 1949, and then had three Top Ten hits for King in 1952. The biggest was \"I'll Drown In My Tears,\" sung by his wife Lula Reed, which reached number five. My Tears,\" which reached number five. Reed was a fine singer who passed away last summer with barley a mention in the media. In the 1960\u2019s Thompson arranged and played on the classic Freddie King sides for King. Thompson\u2019s recordings have been collected across five CD\u2019s spanning from 1946-1955., 15984=Cecil Gant, who went by the moniker the G.I. Sing-Sation, was an army private who allegedly got his first break while performing for a war bond rally in 1944. He scored a massive hit the same year with \u201cI Wonder\u201d the first release on the new Gilt-Edge label. The record\u2019s huge success prompted others to form record companies devoted to black music. Gant was a first rate ballad singer in the vein of Nat King Cole and Charles Brown but he was also a superb bluesman who could lay down some storming boogie-woogie. Gant recorded prolifically for the L.A. labels Gilt-Edge and 4 Star and in Nashville, which was probably his hometown, for Bullet, Dot and Decca, meanwhile playing in nightclubs throughout the country. Between 1944 and 1951 he waxed over 150 sides before his untimely death in 1951 at the age of 38. The Blue Moon label has provided an invaluable service by issuing all of Gant\u2019s recordings across seven CD\u2019s., 9960=While the big bands declined nationally, a number of small groups thrived in Kansas City. Myra Taylor, Walter Page and other musicians cast off from the decline of the big bands returned to Kansas City. Taylor's early recording can be found on Blue Moon's Kansas City Jumps Vol. 3. Julia Lee, the Jimmy Keith band, the Four Tons of Rhythm, the Jesse Price band, Dwight \u201cGatemouth\u201d Moore, Geechie Smith, Tommy Douglas\u2019s band, Oliver Todd\u2019s Hottentots and a number of other small ensembles found steady work in the clubs at 18th and Vine, downtown and those \u201cout in the county\u201d that thrived in the post-war period. Geeshie Smith is featured on the CD Swingin' Small Combos Kansas City Style Vol.2. Vernon \"Geechie\" Smith was a trumpeter/vocalist from the Tulsa, Oklahoma. He played early on with Ernie Fields Orchestra. He was a KC stalwart, spent many years in Kansas City and played in countless KC styled bands. He moved to L.A. where he joined Joe Lutcher's band. After recording under his own name for the Bihari Brother' Modern subsidiary Colonial in 1950 and for the obscure Kicks label in 1954, he drifted into obscurity. An influential drummer who was best known for supporting major performers, Jesse Price appeared in many settings through the years. His recordings are featured on the CD\u00a0 Swingin' Small Combos Kansas City Style \u2013 Vol.1:\u00a0 The Complete Jesse Price 1946-1957. After moving to Kansas City in 1934, Price became an important fixture, playing with George E. Lee, Thamon Hayes, Count Basie's orchestra (1936) prior to Jo Jones, touring with Ida Cox and later working with Harlan Leonard (1939-41). Price moved to Los Angeles in 1941, playing with Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong (1943), Stan Kenton (1944), Basie (1944), Benny Carter, Slim Gaillard (1949) and (in Kansas City) Jay McShann, among many others. He was less active in the 1960s and '70s but led a band at the Monterey Jazz Festival as late as 1971. Price recorded 23 selections as a leader from 1946-48 (mostly for Capitol). During the 1950's Jay McShann, Ben Webster, Jimmy Witherspoon, Lucky Enois and other nationally established musicians returned to Kansas City and revitalized the local scene., 13236=Los Angeles, in the 1940's, became a huge center for rhythm and blues recording. T-Bone Walker had settled in Los Angeles. On any given night in the late 1940's you could drive south on Los Angeles' Central Avenue and hear the music of such jazz and jump titans as Buddy Collette, Charles Mingus, Wynonie Harris, Big Jay McNeely, Joe Liggins and Johnny Otis. These sounds would waft from such venues as the Lincoln Theater, the Club Alabam, the Down Beat, and Jack's Basket Room (which featured fried chicken and biscuits by the basket). When you got all the way out to Watts, you could check out Little Harlem and The Barrelhouse. The first breakout rhythm and blues single, \"I Wonder,\" was recorded by Private Cecil Gant in a simple basement studio and released in 1944 on Gilt Edge Records, a short-lived L.A. indie. When \"I Wonder\" went to the top of Billboard's race charts, a number of labels sprang up to capitalize on the smooth, cool, Leroy Carr-derived L.A. blues style Gant had popularized. As Mike Rowe wrote: \u201cUnlike New York and Chicago there had been no blues or any kind of recording industry pre-war \u2026The music as well as the industry was starting from scratch. \u2026It was very often of Do-It yourself triumphing over the most adverse conditions.\u201d The Black population swelled in the 1940\u2019s, due to large manpower needs to work in the U.S. defense industry during World War II. These new arrivals needed entertainment, of course, and the local jazz and blues club scene heated up quickly. There was a host of labels recording blues and R&B in Los Angeles in the 1940s including Specialty, Imperial, Aladdin, and the umbrella of labels run by the Bihari brothers RPM/Modern/Kent/Flair/Crown were the most notable. Bob Geddins was a key player who operated numerous small labels like Down Town, Big Town, Irma, and others. May of these sides were leased to larger outfits like Chess, Specialty, Modern and others., 21865=Blue Moon has issued all of Cousin Joe\u2019s recordings on three CD\u2019s spanning 1945-55. Joe was 12 when his family moved New Orleans. Joe took up guitar and ukulele, and made a living playing on the Riverboats in the 30's. By 1941, he'd moved to St. Louis to play in Sidney Bechet's band, before heading to New York three years later. This was Joe's most fruitful recording period cutting sides for a myriad of labels including King, Gotham, Philo, Savoy and Decca., 21281=Today's program also spotlights several fine blues vocalists including Sonny Parker, Cousin Joe, Eddie Mack, Arbee Stidham, Crown Prince Waterford and Betty Hall Jones.\u00a0 Sonny Parker began singing and dancing as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Butterbeans and Susie. He joined Lionel Hampton\u2019s band in 1949 and was touring France in 1955 when he suffered an onstage stroke. He never recovered and passed in 1957 at the age of 32. Between 1948 and 1954 he cut some three dozen sides., 19586=Another important series is Blue Moon's reissue of\u00a0 all of Tiny Grimes recordings between 1944-1954 on five CD\u2019s. Tiny Grimes was one of the earliest jazz electric guitarists to be influenced by Charlie Christian, and he developed his own swinging style. In 1938, he started playing electric guitar, and two years later he was playing in the Cats and the Fiddle. During 1943-1944, Grimes was part of a classic Art Tatum Trio, which also included Slam Stewart. In September 1944, he led his first record date, using Charlie Parker. He also recorded for Blue Note in 1946, and then put together an R&B-oriented group, \"the Rockin' Highlanders,\" that featured the tenor of Red Prysock during 1948-1952. Although maintaining a fairly low profile, Tiny Grimes was active up until his death in 1989., 23051=Charles \"Crown Prince\" Waterford was from Jonesboro, Arkansas. He sang with Leslie Sheffield's Rhythmaires and Andy Kirk's Twelve Clouds of Joy before beginning his career as \"The Crown Prince of the Blues\" in Chicago in the 1940s. Waterford shouted the blues in the then very popular manner and continued his recording career for labels like Hy-Tone, Aladdin and Capitol. In 1949, he joined the King stable. In the 1950's he recorded for small companies and later dedicated his life to the Church and became known as Reverend Charles Waterford., 22340=Eddie Mack was part of the Brooklyn blues scene in the late 40's and early 50's but his subsequent career is a mystery. He fronted various groups by Cootie Williams & His Orchestra (he replaced Eddie Vinson), Lucky Millinder & His Orchestra and others. He cut some two-dozen sides between 1947-1952.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Show Notes: Today\u2019s spotlight is on the Blue Moon label, a Spanish label that for the last five years or so has been reissuing some amazing recordings of jump blues and R&B from the mid-40\u2019s to the mid-50\u2019s. Blue Moon can been seen as a sort sister label to Document records; where Document issues the complete recorded work in chronological order of every blues artist from the pre-war era, Blue Moon has been reissuing the chronological recordings of some great jump blues pioneers from the immediate post-war era. Much of this music has been unavailable on CD and spotlights a fascinating era when jump blues was merging into R&B and eventually morphing into rock and roll. The\u00a0 label has done an invaluable service by issuing the chronological recordings of neglected pioneers like Sonny Thompson, Cecil Gant, Tiny Grimes, Goree Carter, Paul Williams, Jack McVea and many others. The music on today\u2019s program is a mix of jump blues and R&B. Jump Blues refers to an uptempo, jazz-tinged style of blues that first came to prominence in the mid- to late '40s. Usually featuring a vocalist in front of a large, horn-driven orchestra or medium sized combo with multiple horns, the style usually features a driving rhythm, shouted vocals, and honking tenor saxophone solos. Billboard magazine first used the term \"Rhythm and Blues\" as the title for its black music charts in 1949, replacing \"race music.\" R&B evolved out of jump blues in",
