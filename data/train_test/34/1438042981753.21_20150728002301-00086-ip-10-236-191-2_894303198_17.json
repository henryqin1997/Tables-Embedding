            "We have campus police here every day. Nothing bad ever happens. This is my second semester so far, and there hasn't been one fight, which is a breath of fresh air.",
            "The two that I've heard of so far is Psi Theta Kappa and Psi Beta (Psychology honor society club), which I'm involved in. I'm hoping to join Psi Theta Kappa next semester.",
            "There are numerous clubs and activities that students can join. Some clubs even give out scholarships!",
            "North Lake College provides us with materials that saves me money. Books can be rented, which meant I didn't have to spend more. We even have a store that sells clothes, shoes, etc, and the only money they accpet are blazer bucks, which are easy to earn. Students can get blazer bucks by participating in workshops. Blazer bucks can also be purchased in the payment area, and it's not even expensive.",
            "This is my second semester here at North Lake. From the looks of it, people just like to chill in the Student life center, which has flat screens to watch movies, and it's also a great place to just hang with friends. Students also enjoy socializing in the cafeteria. I see people who bring games and play that with their friends. Students also have fun in the various amount of clubs provided here at North Lake. North Lake also has a huge lake located near the caferia. The part of the cafeteria that oversees the lake has clear glass walls, so students can gaze over the lake, while enjoying their meals. There are also chairs outside the cafeteria (near the lake), where students can eat their meal, while also enjoying nature, and socializing with friends. North Lake also has a dance team/drama class that perform in our stage area on some occasions, and students are welcome to go. There is much to do here at North Lake.",
            "The only restaurant we have here at Northlake is Subway. I wish we had more to choose from. Subway is not what I want to eat every day because I'm not even a huge subway fan. I wish there were more varieties to choose from.",
            "none",
            "Northlake has great teachers, who know what they're talking about. These teachers trained and passionate about what they teach; at least the ones that I've met have been that way. The teachers here will help with with whatever you need, and all you have to do is set up an appointment to meet them at their offices. It's that easy; just ask for help, and they will gladly do so.",
            "Just because North Lake is a community college, does not mean incoming students can just blow it off. North Lake offers various degree programs, and even courses to transfer to a four year college. Incoming students should engage in class discussions and stay focus, whether it's for an associate degree or a transfer plan. Blowing off the courses provided would be a waste of time and money. Students should also get involved in extracurricular activities, clubs, etc. They should join in on the fun, but at the same time be focused on their school work. There are some students here who take this for granite. Every time I'm going to class (on the first floor), I see the same people sitting there in the lounge area. After class, they're still there. It's like they don't even move; they just go to school to sit and chat. But it will come to bite them back in the future. So I'm warning incoming students to stay focus, don't procrastinate!",
            "North Lake College of Irving is the best route for saving money for college courses. The teachers and staff are incredible, and tends to students questions/concerns, tutoring, etc. There are numerous places in which students can socialize, and have a great time."

Am enjoying being here I really like North Lake, because there are many clubs and activities you can join. The campus is pretty large and not just one building like NCTC. The campus is clean and is nice for a older campus. Am learning a lot I am learning a lot at North Lake. The professors are all pretty nice and seem to really want to help you succeed.
