Plus, there's some \u201cpost-rock\u201d from the likes of Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Bell Orchestre (featuring members of Arcade Fire), where the shoegaze approach to classical is mixed with the wall-of-sound achievements of say - Glenn Branca\u2019s Guitar Army, as \"rock\" instruments play well together with \u201cclassical\u201d strings, reeds, and percussion. Hear new music from Montreal on this edition of New Sounds, featuring works by Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Bell Orchestre, and Mains de Givre, among others.\u00a0 https://media2.wnyc.org/i/0/45/l/99/1/wnyc-logo.png 3x\" height=\"15\" /> Jun 4, 2010 Email a Friend",
