This small district was known in those years for being a real testing laboratory where skilled craftsmen made custom hiking boots for people throughout the region. Diadora has come a long way since then, but its ethos of being distinguished through high quality, attention to detail, and the use of innovative materials hasn't wavered, remaining the same today as it was when it started out more than 60 years ago. Today, in addition to specializing in the production of footwear for tennis and soccer players, Diadora devotes itself to crafting some of the most technically advanced cycling shoes in the world. Just take a look at images of 2011 Tour winner, Cadel Evans, and you'll see that he was, and still is, relying on his Diadoras to propel him to victory.}",
