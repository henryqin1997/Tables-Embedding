Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), including ERK (Extracellular Signal-Related Kinase) 1/2, p38 and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase), play a fundamental role in governing the key negative regulator of autophagy mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin), a conserved Ser/Thr kinase [29,30]. DAPK (Death-Associated Protein Kinase), PI3K/AKT (Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B) and p53/AMPK (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase) signaling pathway also mediate the induction of autophagy through the modulation of mTOR [9,10,25,29,31,32]., 17564=Cells 2012, 1(3), 520-534; doi:10.3390/cells1030520, 143945=\u00a9 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

During tumor development, cancer cells can acquire many features such as sustained proliferative signaling (active oncogenes), evasion of growth suppressor functions, invasion of healthy tissues due to metastatic potential, replicative immortality, angiogenesis stimulation and resistance to cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents [2,3]. For decades, the scientific community has been working to understand not only the molecular mechanisms at the basis of the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells, but also how these cells become insensitive to internal/external stimuli promoting cell death. Drug resistance of cancer cells is often correlated to an impaired activation of Programmed Cell Death (PCD), mainly occurring through the apoptotic pathway(s); accordingly, it has been assumed for a long time that the re-activation of apoptosis could be sufficient to promote the eradication of cancer cells [4,5]. Classical apoptosis implies the activation of caspases, which are in charge for extensive protein degradation [6]; this event could be also triggered by the release of proteolytic enzymes from lysosomes (lysosomal-mediated cell death) [7]. Moreover, necroptosis, \u201can ordered cellular explosion\u201d, represents a cell death mechanism with morphological features resembling necrosis [8]. The scenario is even more complicated, given that a housekeeping process, i.e., autophagy, which regulates physiological functions, could also promote cancer cell survival, as illustrated below [9,10,11].}",

Click here to display table A multitude of internal and external stimuli can persuade a healthy cell to become malignant. Once this process is activated, a series of biochemical events drive an uncontrolled proliferation status. The new progeny of transformed cells first has to evade cell death in order to sustain chronic proliferation and consolidate the tumor microenvironment. Autophagy deregulation is prevalent in many cancers and involves several autophagic genes or proteins (reviewed in [36,37]). For instance, in 40%\u201375% of human breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers the Beclin-1 gene is monoallelically deleted [38]. In gastric and colorectal cancers, UVRAG and others ATG genes, showed frameshift mutations [39,40,41]. Conversely, the autophagic marker LC3 is highly expressed in more than 50% of human gastric cancers [42]. Table 1 reports representative examples of the altered status of autophagic factors. 4. The Paradoxical Role of Autophagy in Cancer Under stress conditions, mTOR is inactivated, thus allowing autophagy to start through the formation of the ULK complex (Figure 2), composed of FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) -family Interacting Protein of 200 kDa (FIP200), Unc-51-Like Kinase (ULK) and ATG13 [33]. In the",
    "textAfterTable": "Even in cancer cells, as it occurs during normal homeostasis control, autophagy senses stress signals and promotes the lysosomal degradation of organelles and proteins. The impact of autophagy in the yet complex network governing cancer progression could occur at different levels: (i) counteracting genome instability, thus impairing malignant transformation; (ii) protecting cancer cells from unfavorable conditions, thus promoting tumorigenesis [9,10]. (i) Autophagy can act as a tumor suppressor by removing damaged organelles and growth factors, and by facing chromosomal instability. In this respect, the autophagy factors Beclin-1 and Atg5 are considered as \u2018guardians\u2019 of the cellular genome. Mathew et al. [46] demonstrated that immortalized epithelial cells with loss of Beclin-1 or Atg5 have increased DNA damage, gene amplification and aneuploidy, in parallel with enhanced tumorigenicity. In addition, they found that defective autophagy (Beclin-1+/\u2212 and Atg5\u2212/\u2212) in immortalized Baby Mouse Kidney (iBMK) cells caused the accumulation of p62 protein aggregates, damaged mitochondria and misfolded proteins, driving the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) [47]. The active role of UVRAG in maintaining genomic stability has been demonstrated in UVRAG depleted cells, which were affected in centrosome stability, chromosome segregation and spindle formation [48]. This body of evidence suggests that appropriate protein quality control by autophagy contributes to contrast tumorigenesis. (ii) Paradoxically, the cytoprotective role generally played by autophagy can be harmful in cancer cells, as it can help them resist anticancer therapy [49,",
