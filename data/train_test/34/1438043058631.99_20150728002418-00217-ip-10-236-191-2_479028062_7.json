For example, intermediate mask layer 240 may be formed from an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane. Such materials are manufactured by W. L. Gore & Associates. A more complete description of the construction and operation of such materials can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,953,566 entitled Process for Producing Porous Products, issued on Apr. 27, 1976 to Robert W. Gore, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,390 entitled Porous Products for Process Therefor, issued on Feb. 5, 1980 to Richard W. Gore., 80691=Intermediate layer 240 preferably comprises a barrier material that is capable of differentiating between gases and liquids and may be, for example, Visqueen Film Products' low density polyethylene, Vispore X-6212. Non-wetting materials, such as used to form barrier material 240, have small apertures which prevent liquids with a relatively high surface tension from passing therethrough yet will allow gases with a low surface tension to pass therethrough. It is preferable to have the apertures as large as possible to allow easy breathing, and yet small enough to retard or prevent the flow of liquids. Intermediate layer 240 is designed to freely pass gases in either direction, while restricting the passage of liquids in at least on direction. Filter body 228 is constructed with barrier material 240 positioned to restrict liquid passage from the exterior of mask 210. Further description of the construction and operation of such barrier material may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,135 issued Dec. 230, 1975, to Thompson, assigned to Proctor and Gamble Co., and is incorporated by reference for all purposes., 66240=A more complete description of the construction and operation of such material can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,135 entitled Absorptive Structure Having Tapered Capillaries, issued on Dec. 30, 1975 to Hugh A. Thompson. Such materials are often constructed from a low density polyethylene and include small apertures which prevent liquids from passing therethrough due to the liquid's relatively high surface tension. U.S. Pat. Nos. '960; '533 and 5,150,703 entitled Liquid Shield Visor for a Surgical Mask with a Bottom Notch to Reduce Glare, issued on Sep. 29, 1992 to Hubbard, et al provide additional information on materials which may be used for layers 30, 32, 34 and 44 and face masks constructed with such materials. These patents are incorporated by reference for all purposes within this application. Other types of microporous film may be satisfactorily used with the present invention., 39823=One type of mask is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 2,012,505 entitled Mask, issued on Aug. 27, 1935 to S. J. Goldsmith. Another type of disposable face mask is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,319,567 entitled Disposable Face Mask, issued on Mar. 16, 1982 to M. Magidson. This mask is molded and has been especially configured in an effort to avoid leakage of fluid flow past the edges of the mask. Obviously, leakage cannot be tolerated when attempting to control liquids and/or aerosols. U.S. Pat. No. 4,606,341 entitled Noncollapsible Surgical Face Mask, issued Aug. 19, 1986 to Vance M. Hubbard and Welton K. Brunson shows a conventional rectangular face mask having a trapezoidal pleat. For some operating conditions, rectangularly shaped masks, including the mask shown in Patent '341, may have less than an optimal fit to prevent the passage of liquids and aerosols between the periphery of the masks and a wearer's face., 40767=Recent developments in surgical face mask have resulted in resistance to liquid penetration from the exterior of such masks. U.S. Pat. No. 4,920,960 entitled Body Fluids Barrier Mask, issued on May 1, 1990 to Hubbard, et al., is exemplary of improvements in such masks. U.S. Pat. No. 5,020,533 entitled Face Mask with Liquid and Glare Resistant Visor, issued on Jun. 4, 1991 to Hubbard, et al., is an example of incorporating a visor to protect the face of a wearer from liquids during medical procedures., 36598=\"This application is a Continuation-in-Part application of pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/168,090 filed Dec. 15, 1993, entitled Disposable Face Mask with Face Shield, of same assignee, now abandoned in favor of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/491,137 filed Jul. 17, 1995, and of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/278,930 filed Jul. 20, 1994, entitled Face Mask with Enhanced Seal and Method, of same assignee, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,553,608. This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/991,154 filed Dec. 16, 1992, entitled Disposable Face Mask, of same assignee, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,061.\", 68188=For one embodiment of the present invention intermediate mask layer 134 was formed from an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane. Such materials are manufactured by W. L. Gore & Associates. A more complete description of the construction and operation of such materials can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,953,566 entitled Process for Producing Porous Products, issued on Apr. 27, 1976 to Robert W. Gore, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,390 entitled Porous Products and Process Therefor, issued on Feb. 5, 1980 to Robert W. Gore. These patents are incorporated by reference for all purposes within this application. For some applications and operating environments the use of filter media 134 substantially enhances the performance of the resulting disposable face mask 10.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the present invention has been described in detail with respect to alternative embodiments, various changes and modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art, and it should be understood that various changes, substitutions, and alterations can be made hereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. In addition to the previously discussed materials, face masks 10, 110, 210 and 310 may be manufactured using a wide variety of non-woven materials and/or microporous films. The teachings of the present invention allow incorporating new, state of the art materials into face masks 10, 110, 210 and 310. Examples of hydrogel type materials and compounds satisfactory for use with the present invention are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,504 entitled Skin Adhesive Hydrogel, Its Preparation and Uses; U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,338 entitled External Application Base or Auxiliary Agent and External Application Composition for Human Being or Animal Containing the Same; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,664 entitled Thin Film at EC Dressings, Preparation and Use. These three patents are representative of only a few of the many types of hydrogel materials and compounds which may be satisfactorily used with the present invention. For some applications it may be desirable to apply suitable hydrogel-type materials and/or other biocompatible adhesive compounds to strips 50 and 52 for mask 10, strips 150 and 152 for mask 110 strips 270 and 272",
