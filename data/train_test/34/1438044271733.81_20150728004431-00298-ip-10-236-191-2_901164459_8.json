            "rmu is a private university that helps each student fulfill their full potential. the classes are small, making it easy to get to know your professors. the campus is not too big as well, making it easy to get to any class in a matter of five minutes."

    "textAfterTable": "Academic Rigor My experience may be slightly swayed because I'm a media arts student and my first semester included a communication skills course, a math course, intro to psychology, and an art and a video course. So, the communication skills class was the only traditionally rigorous course (assignments and papers), while the art courses were a drawing per week or the production elements of a project. But, from my experience in my first week of my second semester, I'm seeing that this will be a more rigorous set or courses for me. So, it varies but overall the work can be a challenge, but I don't believe it could ever bury you. And in any such case, we offer free tutoring services. Tips for prospective students Really get involved if you come to RMU - we have a lot of opportunity to be involved in the theatre, tv station, and radio, as well as the newspaper and literary journal. Also, there's a club or organization to suit virtually everyone. In three sentences The courses are not too easy or too strenuous, and the teachers I have had are helpful but do not baby their students by any stretch. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate, and the residence halls and campus facilities are great. Overall, I love RMU.",
