The same thing at Test Track is also possible. 2. No one has recorded Glass video of \"Listen to the Land\" or the \"Universe of Energy\" yet. 3. Sit in a circle and each take a photo of their perspective. We can then stitch them together later. 4. We can all play and record the \"Agent P\" game (formally Kim Possible). 5. We can take over the English Pub or have margaritas in Mexico. Make sure your Glass is charged up :-)\ufeff",

Considering the importance of gay rights in our country, confirmed by our own Supreme Court, and the scale of IT Indian outsourcing and the concerns of replacing employees with it, why is this never discussed? - http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/11/world/asia/india-same-sex-relationship/ India and its largest religion have some of the strictest positions against homosexuality in the world, but companies (even in California, including #Disney \u00a0) don't seem concerned about the support or message they send by spending millions on them. HCL for example, Disney's IT partner in Florida, has no formal policy statement I can find in their \"about us\" or careers section of their site on being an equal opportunity employer or not discriminating based on sex or age or religion or sexual orientation. There's none on Cognizant Technology Solutions site, Disney's IT partner in California, that I can find either and if you click the \"Our Views\" link in their \"Our Company\" section ( http://www.cognizant.com/careers/our-company ) you get a 404 error.\u00a0 Shouldn't we require all corporate partnerships and companies conducting business here have such policies in place with public disclosure? Even if a company has good policies, what about the country itself we're supporting? And not just India; as a nation we've been pretty vocal about China's labor practices and Russia's gay discrimination, so we should not have different standards.\u00a0 A company is responsible for its entire supply chain, so why is there no outrage, protest or even discussion about a possible conflict of interest?\u00a0 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_India NOTICE.

Why not Plex AND Kodi? Plex is a fork from the Open Source XBMC software project (which was recently renamed Kodi). Both are front-end interfaces for controlling all your TV and media viewing. Choosing between them sometimes resembled \"PC versus Mac\" discussions, but there are specific advantages to each. Before I detail how I got to where I am and why, I'll describe my current setup. I run a Plex server on a Mac Mini with a connected box of disk drives. This allows our tablets and phones (plus anything having a webkit based web browser) to view content through apps or browser. I've converted most of my discs and old VHS into video files, plus have a large collection of recorded OTA (over-the-air) shows all on disk. This Mac Mini also controls one TV, while another Mac Mini controls a different TV. On the Mac Minis I'm converting them to Kodi as the interface instead of Plex Home Theater (PHT). Kodi operates independently from Plex, maintaining its own database of content, but all my media drives are NFS/AFP shared so Kodi is using the same source material to build its database as Plex is for its database. I add content to the drives externally to both systems, and cron jobs trigger scheduled database updates for both. The only handicap in this arrangement is that one system doesn't know to flag a show as \"watched\" if it was viewed in another system, however there are solutions for this I haven't implemented. Kodi is fully Open Source, whereas Plex is increasingly walking a line of trying to be a commercial product built from Open Source, without providing that source, by forcing you into a cloud service even if you don't need it. I've been switching to Kodi as my TV interface instead of PHT for several reasons: 1. Kodi being fully Open Source has leapfrogged Plex in functionality and media compatibility. The Kodi themes look better on large 1080p or larger displays, plays video files that Plex struggles with, handles digital audio better, and their plugins are kept more current. Plex themes, remote control XML, and plugins are no longer compatible with Kodi. 2. Hulu, Netflix and other content services removed the ability for (even paying) viewers to access show episodes directly via static URL or RSS. Hulu also kept changing their API to break 3rd party clients and force you into buying Hulu+ (I was a contributor in the Plex forums keeping the Netflix plugin alive). These destroyed a Plex advantage for me of intermixing content from local and Internet sources without needing to know where that content was hosted. Now if I want to watch a Hulu show on Plex I have to go to the Hulu plugin first and browse to it; same as if I was using Kodi. Or Roku. I no longer have a reason to prefer Plex for this. 3. Kodi handles subtitles better. 25% of my library now consists of foreign language material, so this has become a problem area, even when my media is properly flagged. 4. While Kodi is a stand-alone setup per computer, it seems to take less resources in that arrangement than \"Plex Media Server\" + \"Plex Home Theater\" running on the same machine. It even seems to take less running \"Plex Media Server\" + Kodi, which is good because Kodi offers no web service other than configuration and remote control; and \"client\" apps are just players that stream locally and need NFS/Samba/uPNP access to your media. My phone gets quite warm using the Kodi Android player. Having one Plex Media Server in the house gives me a more options, including a Roku client. 5.Plex use to have a policy that using it only on your home network is free and unencumbered, You didn't need to log into their service or pay for a \"Plex Pass\" (a service providing a social component to your experience and allowing you to view your content on the Internet) if you limited yourself to your home subnet. They just charged you for buying their mobile client apps. I have no use for a \"social component\" to my media viewing, no desire to pay a service to watch my own content, or to tell an outside service what I'm watching or own (unless they pay ME for that data) so I don't use the Plex cloud service and even have all their IP addresses blocked. However they have been increasingly forcing you to log into their service in the client and server code, even for installing apps I've previously purchased, so I've been reducing my Plex clients to webkit browsers and Roku. Cutting The Cord Plex began as Mac OSX-only and became more visually polished than XBMC (which started on the XBOX) once the popular Aeon theme was created. I \"cut the cord\" (commercial cable/satellite TV cord that is) back in 2008, when I recognized Plex+Aeon could integrate all my over-the-air (OTA) , Hulu, Netflix and personal media viewing, and present it blended regardless of its source material. I was not a fan of having to know where content is hosted (is it on Hulu? My video collection? Netflix?) in order to play it. Plex had modules for viewing Hulu, Netflix, TWiT, Youtube, Joost, JustinTV, uStream, NASA, Crackle, and Comedy Central, but if you were a clever programmer you could hide them by using direct URLs. I now had 300+ TV shows to choose from, but only about 40 shows were my own videos (this was before I started saving all PVR recordings and collecting anime). You just picked the show and episode using an IR remote and it played, you didn't need to know anything else. My wife found the setup very easy to use. Almost overnight my two TVs were being run by used Mac Minis running Plex, plus my own code to keep everything automatically updating itself. However less than 2 years later Hulu and other providers broke the ability of reaching content via direct RSS or URL, destroying some of the hidden integration we enjoyed. Plex changed to a client server model, creating the ability to view content and manage the system using web browsers. This forced us to set up a centralized server and change the Mac Minis into clients, but it also allowed us to view content on any device including iPads and smartphones. My wife does most of her viewing on an iPad. Since Plex can re-stream content, we can even watch free Hulu on these devices. Plex added releases for Windows and Linux, although the Linux product was handicapped because there was no Silverlight for Linux (required for Netflix), however it also became incompatible with XBMC. Plugins, themes and features were now platform specific. Then Plex made a major change; they created a cloud service. Like Hulu, it's suppose to let you socialize with friends, get their recommendations, and view your content on the Internet. And just like those features on Hulu and other services, no one uses them. They add no real value to watching your content; only the feature letting you want our content outside your home had value, and I didn't need it (I just create a VPN). As Plex expanded this service, it got more in the way of local media viewing. Kodi implemented several of of the better features in Plex and passed Plex in terms of Plugins. It was time to re-evaluate my situation.\ufeff___, 100561=2015-07-01 23:30:49 (3 comments, 3 reshares, 23 +1s)Open\u00a0, 119762=2015-06-23 15:58:57 (1 comments, 2 reshares, 34 +1s)Open\u00a0, 94376=2015-07-02 16:06:30 (1 comments, 2 reshares, 3 +1s)Open\u00a0, 67380=2015-07-13 20:13:49 (5 comments, 2 reshares, 24 +1s)Open\u00a0, 82652=2015-07-08 04:32:13 (0 comments, 3 reshares, 51 +1s)Open\u00a0, 109342=Should Foreign Outsourcing Be Held To Anti-Discrimination Policies?
