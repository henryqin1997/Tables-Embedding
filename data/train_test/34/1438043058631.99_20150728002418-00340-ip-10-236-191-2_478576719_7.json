Since it is usually impractical to provide, on the same circuit chip as the array, such a large decoder as required to handle the number of steering gates of a large array, they are preferably connected together in a manner schematically illustrated in FIG. 16 for a few memory cells of one row. Such a connection is further described with respect to FIG. 6 of afore-referenced U.S. patent application, Ser. No. 09/871,333, filed May 31, 2001. Every fourth steering gate along the row is connected to a common steering gate line, in this example, which allows the simultaneous programming and reading of one charge storage region of every other cell along the row. A steering gate line 411 is connected to steering gate 191 and others, line 412 to gate 192 and others, line 413 to gates 189, 193 and others, and line 414 to steering gates 190, 194 and others. The word line 198 is connected with the select gate of each of the cells in the row, including select gates 198\u2032 and 198\u2033. Other rows in the array similarly have distinct word lines., 66014=[0014] Another approach to storing two bits in each cell has been described by Eitan et al., \u201cNROM: A Novel Localized Trapping, 2-Bit Nonvolatile Memory Cell,\u201d IEEE Electron Device Letters, vol. 21, no. 11, November 2000, pp. 543-545. An ONO dielectric layer extends across the channel between source and drain diffusions. The charge for one data bit is localized in the dielectric layer adjacent to the drain, and the charge for the other data bit localized in the dielectric layer adjacent to the source. Multi-state data storage is obtained by separately reading binary states of the spatially separated charge storage regions within the dielectric., 57811=[0006] There are various programming techniques for injecting electrons from the substrate onto the floating gate through the gate dielectric. The most common programming mechanisms are described in a book edited by Brown and Brewer, \u201cNonvolatile Semiconductor Memory Technology,\u201d IEEE Press, section 1.2, pages 9-25 (1998), which section is incorporated herein by this reference. One technique, termed \u201cFowler-Nordheim tunneling\u201d (section 1.2.1), causes electrons to tunnel through the floating gate dielectric under the influence of a high field that is established thereacross by a voltage difference between the control gate and the substrate channel. Another technique, channel hot electron injection in the drain region, commonly referred to as \u201chot-electron injection\u201d (section 1.2.3), injects electrons from the cell's channel into a region of the floating gate adjacent the cell's drain. Yet another technique, termed \u201csource side injection\u201d (section 1.2.4), controls the substrate surface electrical potential along the length of the memory cell channel in a manner to create conditions for electron injection in a region of the channel away from the drain. Source side injection is also described in an article by Kamiya et al., \u201cEPROM Cell with High Gate Injection Efficiency,\u201d IEDM Technical Digest, 1982, pages 741-744, and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,622,656 and 5,313,421, which article and patents are incorporated herein by this reference. In a further programming technique, termed \u201cballistic injection\u201d, high fields are generated within a short channel to accelerate electrons directly onto the charge storage element, as described by Ogura et al., \u201cLow Voltage, Low Current, High Speed Program Step Split Gate Cell with Ballistic Direct Injection for EEPROM/Flash\u201d, EEDM 1998, pages 987-990,\u201d which article is incorporated herein by this reference., 141743=[0125] A large number of individually addressable memory cells 11 are arranged in a regular array of rows and columns, although other physical arrangements of cells are certainly possible. Bit lines, designated herein to extend along columns of the array 11 of cells, are electrically connected with a bit line decoder and driver circuit 13 through lines 15. Word lines, which are designated in this description to extend along rows of the array 11 of cells, are electrically connected through lines 17 to a word line decoder and driver circuit 19. Steering gates, which extend along columns of memory cells in the array 11, are electrically connected to a steering gate decoder and driver circuit 21 through lines 23. The steering gates and/or bit lines may be connected to their respective decoders by techniques described in a co-pending patent application by Harari et al. entitled \u201cSteering Gate and Bit Line Segmentation in Non-Volatile Memories,\u201d Ser. No. 09/871,333, filed May 31, 2001, which application is incorporated herein by this reference. Each of the decoders 13, 19 and 21 receives memory cell addresses over a bus 25 from a memory controller 27. The decoder and driving circuits are also connected to the controller 27 over respective control and status signal lines 29, 31 and 33. Voltages applied to the steering gates and bit lines are coordinated through a bus 22 that interconnects the steering gates and bit line decoder and driver circuits 13 and 21., 147159=[0129] Operation of a memory system such as illustrated in FIG. 21 is described in patents and pending applications identified above, and in other patents and pending applications assigned to SanDisk Corporation, assignee of the present application. Those of the cited references that describe the structure, processing or operation of a memory system using floating gates as the storage elements will be recognized as being relevant to implementing the systems using dielectric storage elements in place of the floating gates.

No. 09/793,370, filed Feb. 26, 2001, describes a data programming method applied to either floating gate or dielectric storage element systems, which application is incorporated herein by this reference., 145825=[0128] The memory cell array of the system of FIG. 21 is desirably divided into segments. As will be noted from the second and third examples described above, the sources, drains and steering gates can extend without limit across the entire array in the y-direction unless segmented. These dielectric arrays may be divided into segments that each extends only a portion of the distance across the full array in the y-direction. The sources and drains at an end of a segment are connected through switching transistors to global bit lines, normally made of metal. The steering gates may be similarly connected through switching transistors to global steering lines. Alternatively, the steering gates may be connected to steering gate line bussing associated with the segment, in the manner previously described with respect to FIG. 16. During programming, reading or erasing operations, one selected segment is usually connected to a set of global bit lines at a time, as well as to either a set of global steering lines or to associated steering gate line bussing, depending upon the segmentation embodiment being used. Such segmentation is described with respect to FIG. 10C of aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,180, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/871,333, filed May 31, 2001., 72477=[0020] In another specific example, a NAND array has its memory cell floating gates replaced by storage element regions of a dielectric layer. This dielectric is sandwiched between word lines and the substrate surface. Otherwise, the array is operated as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/893,277, filed Jun. 27, 2001, which application is incorporated herein by this reference. Each storage element region may be operated to store more than two charge levels, thus storing more than one bit of data in each such region., 90854=[0065] The second structure, shown in FIG. 6B, uses a tailored layer 141 of silicon rich silicon dioxide to trap and store electrons. Such material is described in the following two articles, which articles are incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference: DiMaria et al., \u201cElectrically-alterable read-only-memory using Si-rich SI02 injectors and a floating polycrystalline silicon storage layer,\u201d J. Appl. Phys. 52(7), July 1981, pp. 4825-4842; Hori et al., \u201cA MOSFET with Si-implanted Gate-Si02 Insulator for Nonvolatile Memory Applications,\u201d IEDM 92, April 1992, pp. 469-472. As an example, the thickness of the layer 141 can be about 500 Angstroms., 53496=[0001] This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 10/161,235, filed May 31, 2002, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 10/002,696, filed Oct. 31, 2001, which applications are incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference., 69426=[0018] In a particular example, the Dual Storage Element Cell described above in the Background has charge-storing dielectric substituted for each of the two floating gates of the memory cells. This dielectric is sandwiched between conductive steering gates and the substrate to form two functionally separate charge storage elements over channels of the memory cells between their sources and drains. One region of charge is preferably stored in each of these two storage elements, which lie along the length of the cell channels on opposite sides of the select transistors, although two such regions may alternatively be used to obtain a further increase in charge storage density. The level of charge in a region affects the threshold level of the portion of the length of the cell channel beneath that region. Two or more such charge levels, and thus two or more different threshold levels, are defined for programming into each of the two charge storage regions of each memory cell. Programming and reading of a selected one of the two charge storage regions of an addressed cell is accomplished in the same manner as in the dual floating gate systems, by turning on the select transistor and driving the other channel portion strongly conductive. This renders the selected charge storage region of the addressed cell responsive to voltages placed on its source, drain and gates. Specific examples of Dual Storage Element Cell arrays in which the charge storage dielectric may be substituted for floating gates are given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,091,633, 6,103,573 and 6,151,248, and in pending applications Ser. No. 09/667,344, filed Sep. 22, 2000, by Yuan et al., entitled \u201cNon-volatile Memory Cell Array having Discontinuous Source and Drain Diffusions Contacted by Continuous Bit Line Conductors and Methods of Forming,\u201d Ser. No. 09/925,134, filed Aug. 8, 2001, by Harari et al., entitled \u201cNon-Volatile Memory Cells Utilizing Substrate Trenches,\u201d and Ser. No. 09/925,102, filed Aug. 8, 2001, by Yuan et al., entitled \u201cScalable Self-Aligned Dual Floating Gate Memory Cell Array and Methods of Forming the Array,\u201d which patents and patent applications are incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference., 63814=[0012] Another type of memory cell useful in flash EEPROM systems utilizes a non-conductive dielectric material in place of a conductive floating gate to store charge in a non-volatile manner. Such a cell is described in an article by Chan et al., \u201cA True Single-Transistor Oxide-Nitride-Oxide EEPROM Device,\u201d IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol. EDL-8, No. 3, March 1987, pp. 93-95. A triple layer dielectric formed of silicon oxide, silicon nitride and silicon oxide (\u201cONO\u201d) is sandwiched between a conductive control gate and a surface of a semi-conductive substrate above the memory cell channel. The cell is programmed by injecting electrons from the cell channel into the nitride, where they are trapped and stored in a limited region. This stored charge then changes the threshold voltage of a portion of the channel of the cell in a manner that is detectable. The cell is erased by injecting hot holes into the nitride. See also Nozaki et al., \u201cA 1-Mb EEPROM with MONOS Memory Cell for Semiconductor Disk Application,\u201d IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 26, No. 4, April 1991, pp. 497-501, which describes a similar cell in a split-gate configuration where a doped polysilicon gate extends over a portion of the memory cell channel to form a separate select transistor. The foregoing two articles are incorporated herein by this reference. The programming techniques mentioned above, by reference to section 1.2 of the book edited by Brown and Brewer, are also described in that section to be applicable to dielectric charge-trapping devices.}",

[0164] Conclusion [0163] Other configurations of memory cell arrays that use conductive floating gates may similarly be modified to replace the floating gates with charge trapping dielectric material, and then to operate each charge storage region of the array either in binary (two states) or multi-states (more than two states). For example, certain configurations described in patents and patent applications referenced above position either of the storage elements or source/drain diffusions in trenches, the trenches either being rectangular in cross-section or V-shaped. In these embodiments, the conductive storage elements can also be replaced with charge trapping dielectric material. [0162] Other Memory Cell Configurations [0161] Either of the memory systems of FIG. 21 or FIG. 31 may be embedded as part of the host system, or may be included in a memory card that is removably insertible into a mating socket of a host system. Such a card may include the entire memory system. Alternatively, the controller and memory array (with associated peripheral circuits) may be provided in separate cards. Several card implementations are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,887,145, which patent is",
