    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While several presently preferred embodiments of the novel inductively coupled RF invasive devices have been described in detail herein, many modifications and variations will now become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and variations as fall within the true spirit of the invention. It may be advantageous to have multiple coil pairs 200, 250 within invasive device 120 to provide additional information to the tracking system. These multiple coils can be either frequency-multiplexed or time-multiplexed by the tracking system. It may also be advantageous to add additional inductors and capacitors to the coils to match and tune the invasive device to selected frequencies. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, inductive coil 260 transmits radiofrequency energy which is received by communicating coil 250, passes along leads 210 to tracked coil 200 which radiates the energy. However, reciprocity between transmitters and the receivers exists such that tracked coil 200 may receive energy within the subject 112 of FIG. 1 from coils 160, pass the energy via leads 210 to communicating coil 250 that will transmit RF energy to inductive coil 260, through leads 290 and 291 to tracking/display unit 108. FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of invasive device 120 inserted through incision 310 of subject 112. A center portion 320 of invasive device 120 is free to accept other",
