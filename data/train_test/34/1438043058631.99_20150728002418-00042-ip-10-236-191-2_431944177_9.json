Already he had played more Shield matches than he had in either of the previous two seasons with New South Wales. The Blues had a long list of talented batsmen to squeeze into their line-up and Forrest decided his best chance of consistent game time was to switch states. A right-hand middle-order batsman, he had done enough during his time with the Blues to be picked for Australia A to play Sri Lanka A in 2010, which came on the back of a Shield tally of 452 runs at 64.57 in 2009-10. Forrest made an impressive start to his state career but his form tailed off in 2008-09 after the sudden death of his father Ian. He carries a tattoo on his right arm bearing the name of his mother, Vanda, who died of cancer when Forrest was 18. Brydon Coverdale, 39892=Nov 1, 2013, 11079=Kemar Roach, 13205=Born November 15, 1985, Windsor, New South Wales, 33736=Peter Forrest's decision to head north to Queensland in 2011 paid off with a call-up to Australia's ODI squad in his first summer with the Bulls, and he justified that faith in him by scoring 66 on his international debut, and notching up his maiden ODI century in only his fourth innings. In fact, he'd scored more runs than any other Australian batsman after four ODIs, and the first to make three 50-plus scores in his first four innings., 38250=Oct 14, 2014}",
