            "Dedicated, honest, hard working, and self sacrificing for their craft. Ready to spend long hours in labs and in studio. Ready to give up the usual social life.",
            "Go out, hang out in the studios, make art.",
            "The food is expensive but the quality is much better then when i started.",
            "There is no dorm life, there is no on campus or off campus student housing.",
            "Professors expect technical ability as wel as intellectual ability to be up to par with people that are well out of high school. Often times returning to finish another BFA or BA.",
            "Wait until a year or two after high school. The rigor of this school is not like the one of high school, you are responsible to yourself and there are not set classes where you will have someone looking over your shoulder and holding parent teacher conferences if you are not keeping up with the work. If you wait to come and attend for the last couple of years and finish a BA after junior college there is a better chance you will graduate with better grades and not be overwhelmed and drowning.",
            "Art Center is an amazing education opportunity, the curriculum is rigorous. Professors expect only the best and at times it seems difficult to keep up with standards expected of you from your teachers, classmates, and even yourself. But, in the end you wil emerge a polished and well versed artist, ready to take on the job market and establish a practice."

    "textAfterTable": "Clubs and Activities The Student Government at Art Center is awesome, 'nuff said. There are a multitude of activities and events held year-long, every term. You won't find a hoard of clubs like you would at a larger college but Art Center holds its own, offering plenty of clubs for everyone. Great for these types of students Students who love what they do, enjoy working hard and want to be the best. Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus The campus is absolutely gorgeous. Hidden and secluded on top of a beautiful hill, the school overlooks all of Los Angeles. It's funny that even local residents are unfamiliar with where the school is and what it is. Deer and other wildlife wandering about are the usual. Art Center is also renowned for bringing in the best guest speakers consisting of well-known and distinguished people in the industry. Bang for the buck Art Center was recently named the most expensive art school in the U.S. It is pricey, no joke. It's easy to say it's not worth it, but when looking at how successful students are upon graduating, it kind of is worth the price. Artists here become the best of the best.
