(Think $4,000 compared to $10,000.) Tuition varies on which and how many classes you take, but the classes are set up to help you do your best and to teach you accurate information in whichever field its in. As an update, I'd like to share that this past Spring I was able to enroll in a study abroad class in Japan over spring break! The cost was only about $2700 or so, and we were able to make scheduled payments instead of paying all at one time. We went around the cultural capital, Kyoto, learning about the history and culture of the country while being guided by a professor who grew up there. It was fascinating! For the price paid, we visited many important cultural places in Japan and had a very unique and amazing experience!, 153790=I have enjoyed going to College of Dupage so far. I am looking forward to returning to College of Dupage on August 20th. I am very lucky to have the opportunity to attend this school., 110359=If students don't like to smoke then they should be happy about the no smoking on campus ban which goes into affect August 2012. There are a range of sports activities such as football and basketball for students to be apart of as well., 129050=There are tons of clubs to join that a lot of people miss out on in a community college but you should take advantage of them, especially your first year. There is also a Leadership retreat to Lake Geneva every August, it's a lot of fun., 50921=The food at the school has really improved drastically. When i first attended it in 2008 it was alright but every since they have renovated the quality has risen drastically., 294704=As I am writing this, the cost is $136 per credit hour. Along with some fees for classes, that sums up to ~$1500 for a 12 credit hour student. Pretty cheap. However, this might not guarantee quality professors., 424177=College of DuPage have a variate of food choices. In the Fall semester of 2014 they recently added a Chik-fa-la in the cafeteria., 436969=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Great for these types of students Motivated people wishing to save money, confused people trying to figure out what to study, students who perhaps don't have a high school diploma who have their GED and want to get a college education, non-traditional students, adult students looking to go back to school...just about anyone looking for an education for a good price! Tips for prospective students Don't slack off. It's very easy to get caught up in not caring about education if it's not that expensive, but the costs will eventually add up. Don't expect a nice and friendly student body, because there are too many people to form a copious amount of friendships. Also, don't be afraid to try something new, as this would be the place to discover some things about what you enjoy in your education than in an expensive four-year school. Bang for the buck This is where COD really shines. Even with modest tuition hikes, the school is still affordable. I have gotten through the first two years of my BA with virtually no debt. This is one of the top accredited community colleges in the country, and the price makes it a great choice to figure out what you want to study and what you enjoy. Am enjoying being here",
