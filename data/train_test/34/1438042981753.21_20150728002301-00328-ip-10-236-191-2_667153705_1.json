More encouraging than the raw numbers, however, is how he improved from his 2012 season. Lindsey raised his walk rate and improved his isolated power in his 2013 campaign. While there are no immediate plans for him to see time at the big league level in 2014, he could begin to move through the ranks quickly if he continues to deliver a similar combination of plate discipline and pop as he advances in the upper levels of the minors., 14107=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25bc Advanced Stats, 35962=5/5/2014, 38631=8/22/2012, 34076=7/18/2014, 36870=7/20/2013, 32149=8/8/2014, 33066=7/23/2014, 41959=2012, 41262=2013, 40407=2015, 40580=2014, 42011=A big 2011 season helped Lindsey become one of the Angels\ufffd top prospects. The 2010 supplemental first rounder had a big season with Orem in the Pioneer League, riding 43 extra-base hits to an impressive .987 OPS. Lindsey is just 20 and needs to improve his on-base skills, but as a shortstop with power potential, he\ufffdll be a guy to keep an eye on in keeper leagues., 20444=Age is determined on July 1st of each season. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jump To:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Basic Stats \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u25b2 Split Stats, 41314=Lindsey, a supplemental pick in the first round of the 2010 draft, slashed .289/.328/.408 in 589 plate appearances for High-A Inland Empire last season while playing second base. While those numbers don't compare favorably to what he did in rookie ball during the 2011 campaign, you really couldn't ask for much more from a 20-year-old middle infielder who completely skipped Low-A. Plate discipline is a bit of an issue for Lindsey, but that should improve as he continues to develop power, and he figures to start the 2013 season either back with High-A Inland Empire or with Double-A Arkansas., 31246=11/21/2014, 40459=Subscribe now to see our 2015 outlook.}",
