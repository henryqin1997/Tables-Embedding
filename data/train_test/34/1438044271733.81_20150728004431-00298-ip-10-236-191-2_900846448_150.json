            "Campus Security of DePaul is amazing, they have escort services for late nights at the gym or library or for those extreme weather days. You call and they take you anywhere around campus. They are a very easy service to contact and act fast, which is always something you like to hear.",
            "Is not that big of a deal at DePaul. Yes, there is Greek Life, but its not a big percentage of the population.",
            "DePaul is full of clubs, finding them is the hard part. DePaul uses Orgsync for communication throughout all clubs. It's a very confusing website to figure out, so Facebook always comes in handy with finding them as well. The activity fair is also something to hit up the first weeks of school, it collects all clubs in the quad allowing you to sign up for emails and finding the many many many clubs DePaul has to offer.",
            "For students who are outgoing and wanting the city life, not for students who have always looked forward to college being like the movies. This isn't anything you'll find in animal house...",
            "Pasta Palazzo. You'll thank me later.",
            "GO DOWNTOWN! Explore Chicago and what it has to offer. Keep your eyes and ears open for flyers hanging around, the city has so many festivals and concerts. You should never go bored, now broke on the other hand might be a problem. So also look out for free things going on within the city and the campus. DePaul puts on many activities for students to attend, like theatre shows and all sporting events are free! The dorms also put things together for those that live within them to attend shows and movies. There is always something to do or find.",
            "DePaul doesn't have many options when it comes to avoiding the freshman 15, there is a salad bar, and sandwiches and thats about it when it comes to trying to eat healthy. If you're not into that then you are in luck, each section serves different forms of food. You have the fast food, pizza, pasta, mexican, and the corner that always changes each quarter. Student Center food isn't the best, but Brownstones will be your savor when it comes to breakfast and when the dinning hall decides to close at 6 pm and Brownstones is still open, their bagels and coffee are the way to go! For those that seem to find this all to be something they don't want, do not fear! ETC. is a tiny grocery store that has an okay choice considering its basically free with your meal plan. It offers the necessities to feed yourself when the dining hall isn't cutting it.",
            "Living with someone else isn't the high point at DePaul, but the dorms prove to be social and some are the total opposite. It's really what you make of it. Seton and Corcoran were the most social dorms by far. The people there were so friendly and welcoming. Other dorms tended to be very clique and were harder to accommodate to. But non the less dorm life offers a lot at DePaul, the RAs lead many fun activities that occur throughout the city, you meet some of your best friends within the dorms and the ability to do so right across the hall is the best part of it. It may not seem like the best thing, but in the end, some of your best memories occur in those tiny jam packed rooms.",
            "Within the 10 week periods you do have per class you are still required to work as hard as a semester. It feels like everything is due at once and you have midterms along with finals, but the professors do as much as they can to allow enough time for everyone to insure good grades for themselves. It is tough, but in the end, what you get out of each class is something that last with you much longer.",
            "DePaul isn't your normal school, it is one however that you must be open to. The quarter system is something you will learn to love and hate, but it helps when it comes down to the amazing breaks you receive. The teachers do have little time with only 10 weeks to teach but they are some of the best teachers I have ever had the opportunity to learn from, and in those 10 weeks you will either want the class to be done already or never want to leave. DePaul is a college, a college of diverse students all with different backgrounds to share and learn from within the student community, it is welcoming and fun. The adventure doesn't just start and stop within the school, the availability of Chicago as your backyard is the key point DePaul has to offer and that is something you will always use.",
            "DePaul is the most unique college experience one can ask for. The diverse amount of people you encounter within the city is incredible and such a life lesson in itself. DePaul offers you more then just any other college experience, it offers you knowledge inside and out of the class room."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{19386=Many people in the other reviews have mentioned this, so I will keep it short. It is a private institution, it is expensive. Furthermore, if you are an international student, have luck in trying to find some sort of scholarship because financial aid is not available to international students. If you are in the music school, however, you are almost guaranteed that you will have some sort of scholarship \u2013 I believe 100% of all the freshman of the class 2013 got scholarships ranging from $3,000 to $15,000. Financial aid is big for Americans, but international students is very very competitive and hard., 767101=While I do not live in a DePaul dorm, I do live in a DePaul-affiliated apartment building called 1237 West. The facilities are nice and residents receive a lot of discounts at local stores, but it is very antisocial. There is a lot of drinking and drugs on the freshman floor and the RA's and RD do not enforce their no-tolerance policy., 127175=Right now, I am a college sophomore - a double major in Biology (Pre-med concentration) and Political Science. I originally transferred to DePaul from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign after one semester, primarily because the atmosphere at UIUC did not appeal to me. DePaul much better served my needs - smaller classes, better access to professors, better advisors, etc. To compare, at UIUC, my chemistry class had about 350 people. My chemistry class at DePaul had 30 one quarter, 70 another quarter. In addition, DePaul University has a core curriculum. In short, this means they focus on a well-rounded education, requiring students to take classes from the core titles: Self, Society, and the Modern World, Philosophical Inquiry, Scientific Inquiry, Religious Dimension, and a few others. This allows a student to expand beyond his or her horizons, and truly integrate his or herself within the community. For instance, I took a core class titled Critical Thinking. This class taught me about communitarian philosophy, as well as mindsets shared by others. This obviously helps me with my political science, while also providing a new insight when addressing bioethical concerns. The best part about these classes is the central focus on discussion. Because of the small size, there are no lectures or TA's (a nice bonus). DePaul is also on the quarter system. We start school in September and get out the week of Thanksgiving. We return the first week of January for 11 weeks. Then we have spring break, and return for 11 more weeks. We end in June. The quarter system is faster than semesters, as the quarters are 10 weeks long, and then 1 week of finals. One normally takes 3-4 classes each quarter. This totals in 9-12 courses throughout the year, meaning one can learn a bunch in this time. Finally, almost all of the professors have doctorates, or are getting doctorates, in their field. They are very knowledgable, and for the most part, friendly., 766231=There is only one place on campus to eat, which is the Student Center. When all of the stations are open, there is a decent selection of food, and the quality is okay. However, unless you eat at peak hours (12:30 and 6), the only stations likely to be open are the pizza station and burger station. Rarely do I ever have a choice of healthy food. The dining plans do not work in the traditional all you can eat style -- you pay for each item individually, and the cost of a meal is around $10, or more if you eat a lot. Most of the time I cook my own meals or visit local restaurants., 276481=the dorm life is okay, make sure you are comfortable with it before you committ to it because depaul will not let you switch dorms, roommates without paying a $1000 deposit. dorm life makes you feel like you are in high school again because of the mandatory meetings, rules and regulations. i would suggest living in the apartment style dorms to have more freedom., 811616=There is a great amount of options for on-campus and off-campus housing. At the Lincoln-Park campus you can choose from the traditional-style residence halls: Belden-Racine Hall(5-story), Clifton-Fullerton Hall (6-story), Corcoran Hall (4-story), Munroe Hall (6-story), Seton Hall (4-story), University Hall (4-story); or the apartment-style residence halls: Centennial Hall (4 story), McCabe Hall (7 story), Sanctuary Hall & Town homes, Sheffield Square Apartments, Vincent & Louise House, and 1237 West. The Loop Campus offers housing at the University Center (UC) which is shared by the DePaul students, Roosevelt University, Robert Morris University, and Columbia College. There are a ton of options for you to live comfortably for your college journey., 74891=Apply early! DePaul has an Early Action program with a deadline in mid-November and they will notify you by mid-December. This way you get top consideration for scholarships and financial aid. After the Early Action deadline, they look at applications as they come in (rolling) until February. The biggest mistake that I made when applying to DePaul was sending my application in the last day possible. It's more important that they get your application than all your transcripts and test scores., 860587=I cannot really judge here, as I don't attend the school, but I don't think it is very good. The 2014 Secondary Education grads upon their first year of teaching earned a median income of 29,500 a year. This is far lower than the median for the whole state of Illinois, which is 35,000 a year. It makes me wonder if DePaul does not adequately prepare students school districts know this so they offer a lower starting salary., 864665=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 844002=DePaul has many great opportunities compared to other colleges. Being in the city and having many of the alumni work in the city gives the school and its current students many connections. DePaul also has a great calendar system where the students get a full month's break from Thanksgiving until January, yet the courses still cover all the information needed., 6832=I have just recently transferred to DePaul University in June of this year. I have taken 3 summer classes and found I am able to graduate almost 6 months early due to the University's flexible and accomodating class requirements. In three months I have been able to get a jump start on my education. Despite the larger classes, the professors provide ample time to get in touch. I feel like they are just as dedicated to my success as I am., 785360=Know there are two campuses one downtown and the Lincoln Park area. For example business, majors typically have classes downtown so it's a lot of more commuting downtown and being in-between the big buildings. Science students typically have class in Lincoln park where the quad and the newly remodeled library is. The school is also on a quarter system so you do 30 weeks in a year taking typically 4 classes a quarter. The classes go fast so make sure to be on top of your game. We usually start around the second week in September have break from thanksgiving until the beginning of January, then a spring break at the end of march and start summer break in June.}",
