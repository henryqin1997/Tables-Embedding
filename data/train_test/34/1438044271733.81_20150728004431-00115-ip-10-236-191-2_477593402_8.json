It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications may be made in the embodiments chosen for illustration without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the description has been focused on generating transformations of the enrollment voice model; however, it is equally possible to generate transformations of the incoming voice signal and compare these transformations with the enrollment voice model. A voice comparison module 209 is coupled to the voice modulating unit 208 and the buffer 210. As the enrollment voice model is retrieved from the memory 206, the voice comparison module 209 compares the transformation generated by the voice modulating unit 208 with the incoming voice sample stored in the buffer 210. A voice modulating unit 208 is also coupled to the common memory 206. The voice modulating unit 208 is designed to retrieve the appropriate enrollment voice model from the memory 206 when a current user calls into the system. The voice modulating unit 208 generates a transformation for the enrollment",
