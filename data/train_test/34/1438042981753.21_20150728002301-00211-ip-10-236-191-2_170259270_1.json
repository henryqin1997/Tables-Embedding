Is it dedication to the team, to the sport, or watching a winner? I read Chipper Jones comments about how this year was a pleasant change from when Braves fans are outnumbered in their own stadium (link below), and it got me thinking\u2026 No one doubts that DC fans will show up when the team is winning, so the team takes the approach to suffer through the lean times and work to build a future winner, as opposed to a more painstaking effort to build a more loyal, less fairweather fan base. This is an approach with Stan K's fingerprints all over it in both cities. Stan's Atlanta teams were famous for not selling out Turner Field even for the playoffs.Honestly, would DC support a non-winning team if it sensed the Ownership cared and was working hard to do everything they could to win now AND win later AND uphold the \"public trust\" by honoring their fanbase? DC and Atlanta have similar fairweather/transient reputations that don't necessarily support that. Just curious for people's thoughts as we wait for first pitch. (And Go Nats!)http://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-braves-blog/2010/04/05/chipper-wants-electricity-from-opening-day-crowd-to-continue/, 42157=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2010/04/01/DI2010040102101.htmlGood Stuff like\u2026.\"he Nats handled Monday very badly. Kasten's only experience is of sports in Atlanta where he started working for Ted Turner when he was in his early-to-mid-20's. He still has a surprisingly poor feeling for the Washington area and seems tone deaf on some issues. When something blows up in your face as dramatically as the Opening Day fiasco, it should be a hint that you should try to get a better feel for your community before you invite thousands of Phillie fans, in buses, to your \"home.\"\"Sorry, JayB. That's not Boswell saying the group sales were all Kasten and that Kasten pushed it hard. Learn to read. Then learn to write., 40806=@NatinBeantownI think DC can clearly support a baseball team better than Atlanta if it is even reasonably competitive. Just look at 2005 when they had 2.5 million fans. It is tough to be patient, and this team just had to build from square one as far as a farm system because of the way MLB ran (them into the ground) them before the Lerners. Have the Lerners and Kasten done a great job, probably not. There is a lot of room for improvment there as well. But I am pretty sure if the nats fielded an 80-85 win team that was in the hunt into August every year, they would post that 2.5m in attendance every year as well. This town even puts in pretty good attendence numbers for the Wiz, and they are a god awful embarrassment., 82665=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC.

And throw 38-plus year old incendiaries to pitch against potent lineups like the Phillies. I guess I'm confused? Do the Nats want to develop younger, read \"cheaper\" players? Or do they just want to cobble together a major league lineup from the scrap pile of other teams in order to put a product on the field to keep the turnstiles going? Hopefully, in July it will be looking more like the first choice. Then at least something will be accomplished this year?, 39945=Nice article about Strasburg, Heyward and \u2026 Zuckerman. Nice going, Mark.http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/04/12/100412fa_fact_mcgrath, 1179=OK, so if that's the best thing they've got going for them, you know it's been a rough start to the season. But at least the weather's been great and those cherry blossom trees behind the left-field fence turned pink right on schedule for the first time since Nationals Park opened in 2008., 33606=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/The-Phillies-fan-invasion-was-orchestrated-by-th?urn=mlb,232653andhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2010/04/01/DI2010040102101.htmlGood Stuff like\u2026.\"he Nats handled Monday very badly.
