The younger Bochy recovered to post a 1.38 ERA in 35 relief appearances last year at low-Class A Augusta and is currently thriving at Richmond. It's believed that if the Giants summon Hembree to the Majors, Bochy will replace him at Fresno.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "giants' bonus pool First-round buzz As Barr indicated, it's anybody's guess. Various mock drafts have linked the Giants to Piscotty, right-hander Nick Travieso of Archbishop McCarthy High School in Pembroke Pines, Fla., right-hander Lance McCullers of Jesuit High School in Tampa, Fla., infielder Richie Shaffer of Clemson and left-hander Andrew Heaney of Oklahoma State University. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty about who's going to be taken ahead of us,\" he said. \"Not a lot of people separate themselves. That's why I'm not sure who's going to get to us.\" Beyond the obvious top prospects, Barr sees little differentiation. \"We're looking at both,\" Barr said, referring to the pools of prep and college players. \"Realistically, there's a pretty even number of who we're considering.\" The scoop Having struck gold with collegians (Lincecum, Posey) and high school seniors (Cain, Bumgarner) alike, the Giants are weighing all options. The Draft has taken on added importance for the Giants. Having committed tens of millions of dollars in multiyear contracts to the likes of Cain, Bumgarner and Sandoval, San Francisco must develop a fresh wave of affordable homegrown talent, since chasing big-time, high-salaried free agents might not be economically possible",

The more picks a team has, and the earlier it picks, the larger the pool. The signing bonuses for a team's selections in the first 10 rounds, plus any bonus greater than $100,000 for a player taken after the 10th round, will apply toward the bonus-pool total. Any team going up to five percent over its allotted pool will be taxed at a 75-percent rate on the overage. A team that overspends by 5-10 percent gets a 75-percent tax plus the loss of a first-round pick. A team that goes 10-15 percent over its pool amount will be hit with a 100-percent penalty on the overage and the loss of a first- and second-round pick. Any overage of 15 percent or more gets a 100-percent tax plus the loss of first-round picks in the next two Drafts. Shopping list Having traded promising right-hander Zack Wheeler to the Mets for outfielder Carlos Beltran last year, the Giants will be looking for some quality arms",
