Then Bob did a backflip over the gap to a 720. It was insane!\" Schaar beat out Elliot Sloan, who landed a 720 tail grab over the gap and a 540 tail grab on the quarter-pipe, and big air pioneer Bob Burnquist, who hucked a backflip over the gap and a 720 on the quarter-pipe. The new Mini MegaRamps are designed to allow safer progression in Big Air skateboarding, and training facilities at the Camp Woodward action sports complexes have given rise to a younger generation of Big Air competitors. \"I think it is a little bit easier to throw [1080s] on Mega 2.0 because it is easier to grab your board,\" Schaar said after the competition, which took place late in the evening after rain delays that canceled the Skate Bowl super finals earlier in the day. Skate Mega Big Air Twelve-year-old skateboarder Tom Schaar launched a lien 180 over the gap and spun a 1080 on his way to winning",
