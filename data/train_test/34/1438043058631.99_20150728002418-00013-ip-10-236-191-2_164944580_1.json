    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{34310=First of all I thought Hairston and Cora did well in replacing Zim in the field. They did the job defensively, and none of us thought they could do it offensively, but they held the defense together along with the other infielders.As for options for Bixler. I thought I read from mark earlier in the month he was out of options (though I am known to misremember things at times).We have two series left in AL parks. personally I would use Marquis before I would use Stairs.Give Stairs his due he hit a line to center that the field was positioning against the Stairs of 2001 not 2011. I liked Stairs over the years, but at 43 he is not the player we need. As for Harper is he moving up after the SALLY league all star game? I sure hope so, he can learn the defensive position at a higher level as well as he can there., 25122=Adam LaRoche 2011 to 2012 will be the same as Jason Marquis 2010 to 2011. Don't count out LaRoche yet., 95115=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC. Images provided by Getty Images. Powered by WordPress.com VIP., 24396=Stairs is here till June 29 which is our last interleague game in LA against the Angels. After that, all bets are off., 54466=\"Wouldn't the Nats be a franchise to consider moving to the AL given DC's historic alignment with the AL?\"No. Washington is physically located too close to Baltimore \u2013 only 30 miles or so. They would never have two teams in the same league so close together. It's a different era now than it was back when Washington and Baltimore were both AL cities (and BTW that era only lasted 17 years, from 1954 when the St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore to 1971 when the Senators left DC) and during that era there was never a year when both teams drew well. Washington to the AL is not gonna happen., 61508=Carl in 309,Given that our first three picks are all represented by Scott Boras I would look for the signings to run something like this on deadline day: Goodwin at 11:35 PM, Meyer at 11:46 PM and Rendon at 11:59 PM.Anything earlier would be a pleasent surprise., 37009=I hope no one is expecting too much out of Ryan Zimmerman's return. Obviously, it's a big plus for the team, but he has been injured and out of real competitive play for 6 weeks. The guy is going to be covered in rust. His 2011 batting average is more likely to drop at first than to go up. Only as the days and weeks go by are we likely to see him make a huge contribution. When that happens, the calendar is likely to read \"July.\", 1005=Mike Rizzo stood in the home dugout at Nationals Park on the morning of April 30, having just announced Ryan Zimmerman would be having surgery to repair a torn abdominal muscle, trying to maintain a positive outlook despite the challenge that was now facing his club., 58316=Thanks Wally, I appreciate that.And on another note, I'm with Feel Wood as the Nats are in the National League right where they originated as the original Nationals (changing to the Senators around 1897 or so) before entering the American League in 1901.And if they decide to keep divisions (3 five team divisions in each league)Houston makes the most sense by adding the 5th team to the AL West and establishing a true rivalry with the Teaxa Rangers., 47445=SteveM, I knew you would have some ballsy ideas for improvement. Chris Marrero is ready in the short-term and maybe longer term. I still support Detwiler to the bullpen for 2011., 28432=#4 said\u2026 Adam LaRoche 2011 to 2012 will be the same as Jason Marquis 2010 to 2011. Don't count out LaRoche yet. June 13, 2011 11:23 AM Good point and agreed. Obviously LaRoche was playing with one arm and it was ashame to see him suffer as long as he did but as people paying to watch the games, we suffered through it too as it was hard to watch., 43527=Interesting post, although wouldn't the comparable stats be for June 6 last year (31-35, which represents the same number of games played as their 30-36 record does now)?DCJohn said\u2026 At this point a year ago, the Nats were 31-33. Then went 3-12 for the rest of the month Got swept by the Tigers, White Sox, and Orioles. Lost two of three to the Indians. The next fifteen games is the season. Taking three out of four from San Diego was so important. They were a last place team. It what you are suppose to do. I am sure that San Diego looked at the Nats, thinking that this where they rescue their season. You can bet the Cardinals, Orioles, Mariner, White Sox, and Angels are all thinking the same thing. For us the fans who are tired of being the doormat of the National League, the next two weeks will tell the tale. Being close to or over .500 at this point in the season is a realistic goal., 25850=Mark'd, I don't see any trades until July 31 and none of those probably will help this 2011 team so still hope Marquis is retained and gets a contract extension so Rizzo can concentrate in the off-season on other needs like a protypical leadoff guy.To improve today, I bring up Chris Marrero to play 1st base against lefties so Michael Morse can play LF. To watch Ankiel and Nix in games vs. lefty pitchers as the best option is not good. Marrero is on fire right now in Syracuse and also could pinch-hit, and I would bring Marrero and Zimmerman up together and DFA Stairs and send Bixler back. I also bring in Detwiler and send back Stammen or Mattheus or DL Burnett to get him right. Riggleman needs a viable lefty option and my hope is Detwiler can ramp up his fastball and become even more dominant than what we have seen of him as a starter in AAA.Zim will be a major addition and the other changes would plug some holes for Riggleman and rid this team of Matt Stairs., 82593=As ESPN-980 AM's Nats Insider, Mark makes daily appearances on the station's various shows. Here's the 2015 schedule (subject to change)... MON: 12:45 p.m. TUE: 2:30 p.m. WED: 4:30 p.m. THU: 2:30 p.m. FRI: 5:30 p.m. SAT: 10:30 a.m. *All times Eastern.

Click here for past audio clips., 64171=Lots of good stuff today so here goes my two cents.I have wanted Detwiller in the bullpen for quite some time so I like that move. I really like the idea of bringing Marrero up and then having Morse play LF vs lefties. I have to hope/believe that LannEn is for real after these last 3 starts and if that is the case, I don't want to see Rizzo move him or Marquis for that matter. If Marquis continues to pitch like he has and is our #3 next year with LannEn our #4/5 we really do have a shot. I also like keeping Pudge and have mentioned that previously as well. I am in no rush to trade anyone as we near the deadline and like the way this team has developed. I think Cora/Hairston will only get better as they return to their roles. I don't understand Stairs value although I supported him in the beginning of the year. I don't think we have anyone in the minors that can replace Ankiel (has Brown done anything?) so I am guessing Rizzo will not be a big seller in July.Go Nats!!, 41220=Knoxville Nat said\u2026 Steve M said:\"When the Nats had 2 or 3 ugly losses and that 5 game dive started in Baltimore during the 58 games Zim was gone, it looked like a free fall was in the offing but somehow this team put together some amazing games.\" I think this calls for some recognition as to how well Jim Riggleman and the coaching staff have kept this team from falling apart and focused on winning ballgames. For all the naysayers out there Riggs has done a fine job with this team and the veteran role players such as Cora, Hairston, Ankiel etc (okay maybe not Stairs) have all contributed in an admirable fashion. June 13, 2011 12:00 PM I think Manager's go with the record and the team the expectations. In Riggleman's case, he is playing right to my expectations but almost seems like he is being setup to fail by some of the players he has been stuck with. At times, his lineups have been AAA and he won those games.Rizzo delivered on athleticism and improved defense but has failed to make improvement on the 'fly' like good GMs do.When a team that is 6 games below .500 has only made 1 DFA, I have to question if that is the only issue at hand so I give a B+ to Riggleman and a C- to Rizzo at this point in time. Neither can be blamed for the injuries but sitting on your hands when you have options to improve this team and consistently do nothing is not acceptable.Slaten was HORRIBLE and it took him almost 60 games to make that move. Stairs is a joke and still nothing has been done. The team now only has 1 legit right handed OF in Werth and no moves have been made. Burnett has been bad and still remains in the bullpen. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE., 39191=Anon 11:38, I would love to see Nationals play in American League, just because of their history. but I don't see that happening. MLB is also going to look at Central and Western divisions. If I am not mistaken, they might just move Astros and get it over with. As far as Marquis is concerned, we need to sell high on him. If we can get Gardner from Yankees, that would be great. Maybe he can be our leadoff hitter. We should look for either that or lefty relievers. Yankees supposed to have one of the best organizational depth of all sort. Let us rip them off. We should have done the same last season with Dunn when it became apparent that Dunn is not going to sign with us. The one veteran I want to hold onto is Pudge. There are many reasons not to keep him. Ramos seems to have developed enough, Pudge is not doing much offensively, he needs enough playing time to reach 3000 hits. But I really like the character and wish we could keep him. Most likely he will be gone to many of the contending teams, struggling with injured catchers or allowing too many stolen bases.Our bullpen needs the most tweaks right now because Burnett and others are struggling. Riggleman can only use Tyler, Todd, and Drew in close games. Willing to give HRod some more time to sort his control issues. Maybe we can change either Detwiler or Gorzo in relief roles. Our fifth starter will remain a question mark though., 63247=Before anyone gets to excited about JZimm and Strusburg future, read this article \u2013>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/tom_verducci/06/10/yankees.pitchers/index.html}",
