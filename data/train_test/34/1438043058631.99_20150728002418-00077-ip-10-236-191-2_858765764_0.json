            "- added serializer docs to plugins.txt - CHANGES formatting",
            "- Fixed bug preventing declarative-bound \"column\" objects from being used in column_mapped_collection(). [ticket:1174]",
            "formatting",
            "- zoomark adjustments - changelog has separate category for 'features'",
            "avoid some often unnecessary method calls. i think we might have squeezed all we're going to squeeze out of compiler at this point.",
            "the @memoized_property fairy pays a visit",
            "- Repaired the table.tometadata() method so that a passed-in schema argument is propigated to ForeignKey constructs.",
            "- Fixed bug in Query involving order_by() in conjunction with multiple aliases of the same class (will add tests in [ticket:1218]) - Added a new extension sqlalchemy.ext.serializer. Provides Serializer/Deserializer \"classes\" which mirror Pickle/Unpickle, as well as dumps() and loads(). This serializer implements an \"external object\" pickler which keeps key context-sensitive objects, including engines, sessions, metadata, Tables/Columns, and mappers, outsid\u2026",
            "add two new hooks for bulk operations to SessionExtension: * after_bulk_delete * after_bulk_update",
            "- Fixed bug in composite types which prevented a primary-key composite type from being mutated [ticket:1213].",
            "- Dialects can now generate label names of adjustable length. Pass in the argument \"label_length=\" to create_engine() to adjust how many characters max will be present in dynamically generated column labels, i.e. \"somecolumn AS somelabel\". Any value less than 6 will result in a label of minimal size, consiting of an underscore and a numeric counter. The compiler uses the value of dialect.max_identifier_length as a default. [ticket:1211] - removed ANO\u2026",
            "Tiny fix to test setup logic.",
            "- Simplified the check for ResultProxy \"autoclose without results\" to be based solely on presence of cursor.description. All the regexp-based guessing about statements returning rows has been removed [ticket:1212].",
            "- added 'EXPLAIN' to the list of 'returns rows', but this issue will be addressed more fully by [ticket:1212].",
            "Added a label for pg.",
            "- Fixed bug when using multiple query.join() with an aliased-bound descriptor which would lose the left alias.",
            "- Improved the behavior of aliased() objects such that they more accurately adapt the expressions generated, which helps particularly with self-referential comparisons. [ticket:1171] - Fixed bug involving primaryjoin/secondaryjoin conditions constructed from class-bound attributes (as often occurs when using declarative), which later would be inappropriately aliased by Query, particularly with the various EXISTS based comparators.",
            "update call count",
            "Added tests for Query.scalar(), .value() [ticket:1163]",
            "Fixed assoc proxy examples [ticket:1191]",
            "revert r5220 inadvertently committed to trunk",
            "progress so far",
            "Corrected some ordering issues with tests.",
            "- mapper naming/organization cleanup - gave into peer pressure and removed all __names - inlined polymorphic_iterator() - moved methods into categories based on configuration, inspection, persistence, row processing. a more extreme change would be to make separate mixin classes for these or similar.",
            "pep8 stuff",
            "- util.flatten_iterator() func doesn't interpret strings with __iter__() methods as iterators, such as in pypy [ticket:1077].",
            "the recent change to garbage collection of InstanceState meant that the deferred lambda: created by lazy_clause would get a state with no dict. creates strong reference to the object now.",
            "Added documentation for the MetaData.sorted_tables() method.",
            "Corrected method documentation for MetaData.drop_all().",
            "allow repr to leave stuff as unicode. I can't think of any reason for the old behavior except that I didn't understand unicode when I wrote it. Not that I claim to fully understand it now. fixes #1136"
