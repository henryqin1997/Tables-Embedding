    "textBeforeTable": "The faculty represent diverse specializations in the disciplines of animal science and teacher training. With doctoral degrees from many of the nation's most prestigious agricultural universities, the faculty have combined philosophies of undergraduate education, research, curriculum development, industry relations, and career placement into a unique program. Their experience allows for the combination of the practical and theoretical aspects of the animal sciences to provide an education second to none. Students select an adviser who assists in both academic and career planning on an individual basis. The faculty place a high priority on strong teacher-student relationships. Faculty Back to Top Agricultural communications students must pass the Department Qualification Examination (DQE). The DQE is a screening examination administered by the Mass Communication and Journalism Department. It must be passed before permission is given for enrollment in MCJ 10 and other writing and editing courses. Contact the Mass Communications and Journalism Department for DQE information, requirements, and testing dates. Candidates for the Agriculture Specialist Credential must possess 3,000 hours or two years of occupational experience in agriculture. (For details, consult the agricultural education credentialing coordinator.) Agriculture courses titled Tours or Lectures may be used to satisfy upper-division unit requirements but may not be counted to satisfy agricultural education core or specialized field requirements in the major. Contact the Kremen School of Education and Human Development for admission and program requirements for the Single Subject Credential.",
    "textAfterTable": "Careers The Department of Animal Sciences and Agricultural Education offers options in agricultural communications, teacher preparation, basic animal science, pre-veterinary medicine, livestock business management, dairy science, equine science and meat technology. Courses integrate animal evaluation, behavior, disease, environmental management, genetics, health, marketing, muscle biology, nutrition, physiology, production, and reproduction. Instruction in the animal science disciplines is enhanced through practical application at the various farm laboratory units. The Beef, Dairy, Horse, Meats, Sheep, and Swine units are maintained to support this educational purpose. In addition, veterinary and physiology laboratories are utilized to complement on-campus education. A 4,300-acre livestock and range management facility and another 800 acres of rangeland in the Sierra foothills are available. The department is extremely proud of its outstanding faculty and the level and quality of student activities in which they participate.
