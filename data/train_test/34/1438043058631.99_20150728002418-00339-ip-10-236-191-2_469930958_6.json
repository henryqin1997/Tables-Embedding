This film resistor would lie between strip contacts 32 and 33 in the same way that film resistor 16 lies between strip contacts 37 and 38 so that the first heating resistor 15 is still connected in parallel with the bimetallic switching device 14. It should also be mentioned that the resistance value of the heating resistor 16 must be set so that the ohmic heat generated by the rated operating current which flows through the heating resistor is sufficient to heat the bimetallic snap switch 26 to above its release temperature. It can be seen that the second heating resistor 16 is not a complete annular layer but is formed by an annular segment, whereby a section 41 has been left out. The heating resistor 16 can be seen as a parallel circuit of a number of smaller elementary resistances between the ring-shaped strip conductors 37 and 38 so that if the section 41 is enlarged or reduced the resistance value of the heating resistor 16 is enlarged or reduced. This means that the resistance value of the heating resistor 16 can thus be altered very easily at later dates. Since the heating",
