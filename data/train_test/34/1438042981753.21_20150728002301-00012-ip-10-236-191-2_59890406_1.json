            "On Aug 21, 2014, Chillybean from Near Central, IA (Zone 5a) wrote: Our plants grew from a tallgrass prairie seed mix for clay subsoil. We tried keeping the area mowed per the suggestions given with the seed, but a few of these escaped the mowing. Beyond our wannabe prairie patch grew a lot of curled dock, thistle, pig weed, but along the edge was found some of the Partridge Pea. When the seed heads dry, I will place some elsewhere around the property. This is a food source for quail, partridge and pheasants and we would enjoy seeing these birds find food at our place. We have seen this along roads in wooded areas. This is an annual and if allowed to self-sow, it can be enthusiastic. I dislike \"invasive\" for native plants. From Wikipedia: \"It is considered an excellent choice for planting in dis... read moreturbed areas, as it will quickly cover an area, preventing erosion, while still allowing other plants to become established.\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamaecrista_fasciculata",

It attracts hordes of native wasps and bees along with sulfur butterflies. Although it tends to increase its coverage each year, it is easily controlled by pulling. This is NOT fish bean, which is Tephrosia vogellii and which does not have yellow flowers.",
            "On Oct 23, 2011, Erutuon from Minneapolis, MN wrote: I planted this last year as a seedling from the Friends School Plant Sale. It produced pods that year, but the seeds in them looked like duds, so I didn't expect it to come back. But this year there were hundreds of seedlings all over the bed, so I guess the seeds must've been good. The seedlings have two seed leaves that are short and semi-circular with tiny compound leaves sprouting from the middle. This year there were tons of beautiful yellow flowers that the bees were all over, which gives the plants their positive rating. When the pods are forming, though, the plants are more ugly.",

The partridge pea in mid summer has emerged (in a crowded field) as one of the strong growing and truely beautiful plants in the mix. Being new to Dave's Garden, I'm pleased to find so much information from various growers. Thanks to you folks.",

Someone else said that theirs died once transplanted and mine almost did also. I potted it and it completely flopped over and started to wilt. My pot is one of those that has a retainer for water at the base and I misted the plant with water a few times in the day. It came back up the next day and kept on growing. It did lose some \"branches\", but, you can't tell. It wasn't until it flowered that I knew that it wasn't an Acacia-type tree because of the pea-like yellow flowers. I was concerned that maybe I was fostering a weed, but, I'm glad that I have found that this is not the case.",

Flowers have 5 petals which are bright yellow. The lower petal is larger, as is typical with other blooms in the pea family. Found along roadsides and in open wooded areas in the Eastern U.S. from Massachusetts to Florida, west to New Mexico and north to South Dakota.",

This plant grows wild, sporadically, and uncontrollably around my house, and seems to thrive in sunny and partly shady locations with poor soil... like around the house's concrete foundation or near the driveway base, or where even the weeds and stickers don't grow in my woodsy frontyard. Crazy plant! It would seem hardy.... however any time I try to transplant it, the thing dies within a day (no matter how much of the sandy surrounding soil I keep intact around the root). Now that I see how easy it may be to collect the seeds, I will try to grow them from seeds in the areas I think they will look best. Wish me luck!",

The foliage is compound and very fine resembling a Mimosa. It folds up in the evening and also when touched. The seeds must be collected when the pods are brown but before they burst open. Many birds enjoy the seeds in the garden and in the wild."
