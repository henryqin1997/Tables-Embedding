            "UB has their own police department on campus. They are not just campus security, they are legitimate police officers. They are constantly patrolling both campuses to ensure the safety of the students. The blue light system is also in place on campus, so students can always feel safe.",
            "I personally did not join Greek Life, but there are so many sororities and fraternities on campus, even academic ones. I always see them selling baked good in the Student Union to fund raise.",
            "There is a club for anything you can imagine at UB and if you can think of one that does not exist, you have to power to create your own. All of these clubs have their own events and the Student Association also holds many events as well.",
            "UB is held to higher academic standard and has a very extensive science program. Students that plan to work hard should come to UB because it will pay off in the end.",
            "There are a few unusual traditions on campus, like Oozefest. These are things you will learn about on a tour of the campus or during orientation. Experiencing these things make you really feel like you are a part of UB.",
            "You definitely get what you pay for at UB. The food, services and activities are of a higher standard and in state prices are very reasonable. UB also offers scholarships and loans that help out a lot.",
            "There is plenty to do on campus. The Student Association holds events during the day and on Friday and Saturday nights, so that you never have to even leave campus. If you do decide to leave campus, there is a subway station on South that takes you right into the city.",
            "The food is one of the better college foods I've had. There are so many options to choose from. Besides having a dining hall, there is a food court right in the dorming complex which is open really late. The meal plan is also a great thing, allowing us to eat as late as 2 am.",
            "The dorms are cleaned and maintained on a regular basis. The rooms are also larger than most other schools I've visited. I was in a triple and my roommates and I all had our own space. We were never on top of each other.",
            "I started out as a Pharmacy Major, and no one lied to me when they said it would be hard. It is really important to keep up with all your work and studying, college is not as easy as some people make it seem. You do have to study on weekends and even weeks before tests.",
            "Take a tour of UB. There is no other way to get a feel for the school. On the tour make sure you talk to your guide and ask any questions you have.",
            "This University has profound professors that are willing to help you succeed in your academic career. Not only are the professors great, but the campuses themselves are held to a high standard and met. I really enjoyed my freshman year there and can not wait to return for my sophomore year."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{86900=pretty average grades area accepted. around 1200-1700 is the medium i think., 567639=The campuses have emergency telephones dispersed throughout both North and South Campuses, University Police numbers are well known in the event of an emergency and most buildings require swipe access so that only faculty and students can enter. My only critique is that University Police expend too much energy in unjust ticket issuing instead of protecting the well-being of students. This leads to avoidable rape situations as I have witnesses in the Fall of 2013., 586897=Every April, Oozefest is held where players play a game of volleyball except not just any normal game. This game is played in mud and at the end of the game, players are filled form head to toe with mud., 225566=out of 10 stars i give UB 8. Campus is great and so is the diversity, However the university treats its students as if they are just their 8-digit person number. They are making adjustments but it is clear that UB2020 is the major goal of this institution. There is support available, and doing research is always encouraged and recommended. I would consider returning for another undergraduate degree., 267540=Every Parents weekend, which is in the middle of October, UB puts on a carnival with real rides followed by a bonfire and fireworks. It was a lot of fun to hang out with my family and a much needed break from classes. Every year, UB brings well known people to speak in a tradition known as the Distinguished Speaker's Series. Past speakers have included Lance Armstrong, and Bill Nye the Science Guy. Also, Every spring, the entire campus and alumni get fired up for a volleyball tournament known as Ooze Fest. It is basically playing volleyball in a giant mud pit. This will be my first year participating and I am super excited. There are also a lot of concerts and shows which are all free for students., 649245=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 172940=Hm. This is a toughy. One of my favorite things about UB is that there are two big concerts every single year, one each semester. In the fall semester there is FallFest, and in the spring semester SpringFest. The venues are different each semester- one is dedicated to alternative/rock/pop music, while the other is geared toward rap/hip-hop/R&B. And these aren't your everyday bands and artists just getting on the map trying to make it big- most are already established. IE- 2 AM club and the white panda came for fallfest 2011 (check them out, pretty good stuff), and rick ross, tyga, and fabolous came for springfest 2012. Not to mention-free for all UB students and open to the public. No unusual locations I can think of. There are seats and chairs everywhere though- can you sit and enjoy the atmosphere, do some work, or even sleep wherever u want on campus (most of the time). There r fun events in the Student Union most times, so u can just walk in and join in on the fun before or after a class, and Seniors graduating do get to sign a giant metal bull as a class gift before they leave the school., 16683=If you got above a 1450 on the SAT, be sure to apply for the Presidential Scholarship. Otherwise, it doesn't matter because UB will inform you upon acceptance whether or not you qualify for their scholarships.}",

Tips for prospective students Professors are your friends so talk to them, get to know them, and most importantly get them to like you. This also goes for TA's who end up grading your assignments (when the class) has TA's. Don't just study, prepare. Professors don't write syllabi for fun (I mean seriously writing those things can't be fun) so read them use them to see",
