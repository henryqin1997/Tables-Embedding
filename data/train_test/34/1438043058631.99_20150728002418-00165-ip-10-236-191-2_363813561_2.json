Regulation Return to Top Access information about the Peace River Watershed View a map of Peace River Watershed Miriam, Lake is located within the Peace River Watershed. Watersheds are areas of land with waterways that flow to a common destination. The boundaries between watersheds are elevated areas called divides. In this Atlas, the watersheds are composed of groups of creeks that flow to a single bay or group of bays. Drainage basins are subunits of watersheds and are defined by the main creek that flows through them. Charlotte Harbor NEP has five watersheds, named after the bays or river, and 19 drainage basins, named after the creeks. Stormwater improvements to reduce flooding and improve water quality are based on the drainage basin unit. Learn more about watersheds \u00bb Watersheds and Drainage Basins \u00a0 Return to Top",
