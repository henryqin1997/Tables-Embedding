You should strive to achieve as a minimum, the maximumSale Price for all the stores in your village, as this will increase revenue into your town to allow you to better equip your residents. The building menus are split into general buildings and food buildings. Buildings become gradually available as you increase the rank of your village and convince residents to settle in your village. Each building has an inherent bonus that will be given to all buildings within its effective radius. The effective radius of this bonus extends 1 square from the location of the building, so only adjacent buildings will receive bonuses. Buildings are not only your primary source of income, but also a way for residents to increase their stats, as some buildings offer stat bonuses to residents that use them.
