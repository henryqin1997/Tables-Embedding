    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow. It is noted that the order of the steps of method 300 is merely illustrative and may be rearranged in other embodiments. In particular, the steps of designating a default search frame and rendering a page are interchangeable. In addition, the automatic designation of a frame may be used to advantage in manners other than for content searching purposes. For example, the designated frame may be a default printable frame. Returning to step 320, if the user action is not to perform a search, the method 300 proceeds to step 334 to query whether the user action is a request to find the next match (for a search string) in a frame. If so, processing proceeds with step 324, which has been described above. Otherwise, the method 300 proceeds to step 336 where all other user actions are handled according to the rules of the data processing system 100. If, however, step 318 is entered negatively, the method 300 proceeds to step 320 and queries whether the user action is a request to perform a search of content in a frame. If so, the search string is retrieved at step 322. At step",
