Food options aren't all that great, but food from the dining halls are relatively cheap and taste good. The most expensive options are in the MU (Togo's, Carl's Jr., Panda Express), but you can also find Bueno's Burritos which gives you a massive burrito for really cheap, plus there's hardly ever a long line, even at 12:30 PM on a weekday., 671018=Its winner of the prestigious 2009 Ivy Award.

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students The amount you learn in a class depends on many different factors. In the first year you really have to learn how to juggle a whole new array of things that can become quite overwhelming. OSU offers some helpful classes on time juggling, study sessions, and other recourses which should be taken advantage of.

Check out www.ratemyprofessors.com for some reviews by people who have already taken the class so you know what to expect. Bang for the buck I have only been at OSU for a year but so far its been a lot of money for simple classes. At OSU you have the option of dual enrolling in Linn Benton. I would definitely suggest looking into this, especially in your first year. There is a Beaver Bus that will take you directly to Linn Benton which I believe runs every 30 minutes so transportation is not a major issue. Classes are very expensive and you can get the basics out of the way for a lot cheaper.
