Carley Younger led the Warriors with five points. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0ERA coach Bob Younger said he saw some good things despite the lopsided score., 31972=\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe girls are working hard underneath. They were boxing out early,\u201d he said. \u201cLate in the second quarter, we got away from it. We got in foul trouble late in the first half, but we cleaned it up in the second half until they got tired. Some of the looks ended up being thrown away. That\u2019s something we wanted to taper down. The fans are seeing turnovers. I\u2019m seeing where they are looking to throw the ball and not just getting it there.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Another issue was the speed with which Niwot played the game. It didn\u2019t surprise the coach. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe run hard at practice,\u201d Younger said. \u201cBut when we sat down last night (Dec. 4), I told the girls as hard as we think we are running in practice, the game is going to be another notch faster. If you look at some of the things where we made mistakes, it\u2019s that notch faster.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Younger had to call up three junior-varsity players to expand the number of available players. One Warriors\u2019 starter was out because of an injury. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOur bench came in and tried. Everybody tried. No one quit, and that\u2019s something I\u2019m always proud of,\u201d Younger said. \u201cThey were hustling to the end. But because of the minutes they were playing, they ran out of hustle. I saw a lot of good things for the first game of the year, going against a 4A squad that\u2019s going to press a lot harder than teams in our league.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Rocky Mountain Lutheran handed Eagle Ridge a 57-33 loss in the Warriors\u2019 home opener Friday. Flossie Richmond scored 20 points, and Carley Younger added a half-dozen. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re going to do some little tweaks,\u201d Bob Younger said. \u201cThe boxing out? I can\u2019t complain a lot. From where I was sitting, it didn\u2019t look bad. The biggest thing is find that next notch so we can eliminate a lot of our turnovers. We were seeing the offense, seeing the holes. It was just so fast, they didn\u2019t read the defense.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Warriors host Shining Mountain at 6:30 p.m. Dec. 18., 41520=Copyright \u00a9 2015}",
