For simplified embodiments, it may also be provided that one or the other query is not performed. The temperature differences between the temperature sensors to be monitored and the intake air temperature, and the difference between the temperature signals to be individually monitored, constitute the above-referenced prerequisites. In the embodiment illustrated, the temperature sensors upstream from the catalyst and upstream from the filter are monitored. If the absolute values of the differences are greater than a limiting value, an error is detected. An error-free state is determined when all temperature sensors indicate the value of a reference sensor. Instead of the intake air temperature, the ambient air temperature may be used as the reference sensor. [0033] At this point the measured temperatures have been changed only insignificantly, which is attributed to sensor lag, among other factors. If the start-up takes too long, it is no longer possible to make this assurance. Therefore, a check is made in query 240 as to whether the starting cutout speed has been reached within a predeterminable maximum time. [0032] In addition, a check is made as to whether cooling water temperature TW and/or intake air temperature T1 and/or their difference is below a limit value SW. In addition, plausibility checking is not performed until starting cutout speed",
