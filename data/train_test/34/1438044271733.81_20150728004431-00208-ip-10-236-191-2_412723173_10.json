And this 5DIII offered at 750 UKP on Gumtree is equivalent to just 8,128 SK (at the x-rates web site). It's a con! Why? Because the price is far below what the seller would get from open bidding on eBay. 5DIII bodies at 760 UKP and 5DIII+24-105 at 750 UKP are just not possible. foto43 wrote: I misinterpreted the site apparently,",
