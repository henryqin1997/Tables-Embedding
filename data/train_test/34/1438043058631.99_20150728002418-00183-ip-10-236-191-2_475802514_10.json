Wicker, Error Control Systems for Digital Communication and Storage, Prentice-Hall 1995, the contents of which a herein incorporated by cross-reference)., 109594=When the stylus nib 121 or ink cartridge nib 119 of the pen 101 is in contact with a surface, the pen 101 determines its position and orientation relative to the surface at 100 Hz to allow accurate handwriting recognition (see the article by Tappert, C, C Y Suen and T Wakahara, \u201cThe State of the Art in On-Line Hand Writing Recognition\u201d IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol 12, number 8, August 1990, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). The force sensor photodiode 144 is utilized to indicate relative threshold whether the pen is \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d. The force may also be captured as a continuous value, as discussed above, to allow the full dynamics of a signature to be verified., 78697=One embodiment of the physical representation of the tag, shown in FIG. 4a and described in our earlier application U.S. Ser. No. 09/575,129, includes fixed target structures 15, 16, 17 and variable data areas 18. The fixed target structures allow a sensing device such as the netpage pen to detect the tag and infer its three-dimensional orientation relative to the sensor. The data areas contain representations of the individual bits of the encoded tag data. To maximise its size, each data bit is represented by a radial wedge in the form of an area bounded by two radial lines and two concentric circular arcs. Each wedge has a minimum dimension of 8 dots at 1600 dpi and is designed so that its base (its inner arc), is at least equal to this minimum dimension. The height of the wedge in the radial direction is always equal to the minimum dimension. Each 4-bit data symbol is represented by an array of 2\ufffd2 wedges. The fifteen 4-bit data symbols of each of the six codewords are allocated to the four concentric symbol rings 18 a to 18 d in interleaved fashion. Symbols are allocated alternately in circular progression around the tag. The interleaving is designed to maximise the average spatial distance between any two symbols of the same codeword., 82822=The four perspective target structures 17 are the last to be located (at 30). Good estimates of their positions are computed based on their known spatial relationships to the ring and axis targets, the aspect and rotation of the ring, and the rotation of the axis. Matching proceeds by applying the ring's normalizations to each shape's moments. Once their second-order moments are normalized the circular perspective targets are easy to recognize, and the target closest to each estimated position is taken as a match. The original centroids of the four perspective targets are then taken to be the perspective-distorted corners 31 of a square of known size in tag space, and an eight-degree-of-freedom perspective transform 33 is inferred (at 32) based on solving the well-understood equations relating the four tag-space and image-space point pairs (see Heckbert, P., Fundamentals of Texture Mapping and Image Warping, Masters Thesis, Dept. of EECS, U. of California at Berkeley, Technical Report No. UCB/CSD 89/516, June 1989, the contents of which are herein incorporated by cross-reference)., 121519=Each raw stroke is encrypted using the Triple-DES algorithm (see Schneier, B, Applied Cryptography, Second Edition, Wiley 1996, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) before being transmitted to the computing system. The pen and computing system exchange session keys for this purpose on a regular basis. Based on a conservative estimate of 50 cycles per encrypted bit, the encryption of a one-second 5500 bit stroke consumes 0.7% of the processor's 45 time., 105758=The image sensor is CCD with an approximate resolution of 215\ufffd215 pixels (such a sensor is produced by Matsushita Electronic Corporation, and is described in a paper by Itakura, K T Nobusada, N Okusenya, R Nagayoshi, and M Ozaki, \u201cA 1 mm 50 k-Pixel IT CCD Image Sensor for Miniature Camera System\u201d, IEEE Transactions on Electronic Devices, Volt 47, number 1, January 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference) with an IR filter., 76380=Each tag contains typically contains 16 bits of tag ID, at least 90 bits of region ID, and a number of flag bits. Assuming a maximum tag density of 64 per square inch, a 16-bit tag ID supports a region size of up to 1024 square inches. Larger regions can be mapped continuously without increasing the tag ID precision simply by using abutting regions and maps. The distinction between a region ID and a tag ID is mostly one of convenience. For most purposes the concatenation of the two can be considered as a globally unique tag ID. Conversely, it may also be convenient to introduce structure into the tag ID, for example to define the x and y coordinates of the tag. A 90-bit region ID allows 290 (\u02dc1027 or a thousand trillion trillion) different regions to be uniquely identified. Tags may also contain type information, and a region may be tagged with a mixture of tag types. For example, a region may be tagged with one set of tags encoding x coordinates and another set, interleaved with the first, encoding y coordinates., 88938=It is possible to dispense with perspective targets altogether and instead rely on the data representation being self-registering. In this case each bit value (or multi-bit value) is typically represented by an explicit glyph, i.e. no bit value is represented by the absence of a glyph. This ensures that the data grid is well-populated, and thus allows the grid to be reliably identified and its perspective distortion detected and subsequently corrected during data sampling. To allow tag boundaries to be detected, each tag data must contain a marker pattern, and these must be redundantly encoded to allow reliable detection. The overhead of such marker patterns is similar to the overhead of explicit perspective targets. One such scheme uses dots positioned a various points relative to grid vertices to represent different glyphs and hence different multi-bit values (see Anoto Technology Description, Anoto April 2000).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The present invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment and number of specific alternative embodiments. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant fields that a number of other embodiments, differing from those specifically described, will also fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it will be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments described in the present specification, including documents incorporated by cross-reference as appropriate. The scope of the invention is only limited by the attached claims. Instead of providing accelerometers to sense motion relative to the surface, alternative motion sensing means may be provided. Such means include motion sensing means which includes an optical sensor which cooperates with the surface to generate signals indicative of movement of the optical sensor relative to the surface, motion sensing means which includes at least two contacts arranged to contact the surface and sense movement in two orthogonal directions, or any other suitable motion sensing means for sensing movement relative to a surface. Since the starting position of the stroke is not known, only relative positions within a stroke are calculated. Although position integration accumulates errors in the sensed acceleration, accelerometers typically have high resolution, and the time duration of a stroke, over which errors accumulate is short. The acceleration measured by the accelerometers in each of the X and",
