    "textBeforeTable": "So what? While what's happening with Motors Liquidation is an extreme example, the market is often driven to wild swings and emotional excesses, on both the upside and the downside. Just take a gander at the moves among these fairly large and well-known (and followed) stocks over the past 52 weeks: But hey, what's $200 million between friends? Rounding error, right? What efficient market? If nothing else, what's happening with Motors Liquidation should drive a stake through the heart of whatever's left of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. There is absolutely no way that the company's fair value is anywhere near where it's trading in the market. Yet if the market were efficient, the market price would have to be linked with the company's intrinsic value. There's only one conclusion that you can rationally draw from what's happening with Motors Liquidation's stock: The market is nuts. Yet it's there. And with millions of shares trading in any given day, that irrational pricing persists, despite volumes heavy enough that the shares clearly aren't suffering from a lack of liquidity. It doesn't get any more obvious than that Both the company and the government acknowledge that the stock is worthless. In spite of that, the recent price of $0.40 apiece for its shares",
    "textAfterTable": "Source: Yahoo! Finance. Every last one of them has either doubled off its low or been cut in half from its high, in the space of a year. If the stock market were truly an efficient arbiter of companies' fair values, such swings would be rare enough to be virtually nonexistent. The table above indicates that each of these companies has -- at some point -- been very inefficiently priced over the past year. Yet whether it's in the form of a $175 million market cap on a worthless liquidation company, or the whiplash-inducing swings on other highly followed stocks, the market regularly gets it wrong, time and time again. Luckily for you, this means you don't have to be perfect to beat the market. You just have to recognize when the market is completely off its rocker, and invest accordingly. What you can do about it Whatever the market may think of its stock at any given time, a company's intrinsic value tends to adjust slowly as the business evolves over time. If you focus your effort on determining that intrinsic value, you can begin to identify those times when the market gets it clearly wrong. When the market prices a stock well below its intrinsic value, it's time to buy. When it prices the stock well above its intrinsic value, it's time to sell. You don't need to be perfect in your analysis, or have access to lightning-fast trade executions, to beat the market. Quite often,",
