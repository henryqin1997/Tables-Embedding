    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{330680=[0156] The MIU CLK circuit 1231 provides a timing signal to the MIU controller 1230, and also provides a timing signal to the CDMA modems. The MIU CLK circuit 1231 receives and is synchronized to the system clock signal wo(t). The controller clock signal generator 1213 also receives and synchronizes to the spreading code clock signal pn(t) which is distributed to the CDMA modems 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215 from the MUX., 328551=[0154] The exemplary RCS contains at least one MIU 931, which is shown in FIG. 10. The MIU of the exemplary embodiment includes six CDMA modems, but the invention is not limited to this number of modems. The MIU includes: a System PCM Highway 1201 connected to each of the CDMA Modems 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215 through a PCM Interface 1220; a Control Channel Bus 1221 connected to MIU controller 1230 and each of the CDMA Modems 1210, 1211, 1212, 1213; an MIU clock signal generator (CLK) 1231; and a modem output combiner 1232. The MIU provides the RCS with the following functions: the MIU controller receives CDMA Channel Assignment Instructions from the WAC and assigns a first modem to a user information signal which is applied to the line interface of the MUX and a second modem to receive the CDMA channel from the SU; the MIU also combines the CDMA Transmit Modem Data for each of the MIU CDMA modems; multiplexes I and Q transmit message data from the CDMA modems for transmission to the VDC; receives Analog I and Q receive message data from the VDC; distributes the I and Q data to the CDMA modems; transmits and receives digital AGC Data; distributes the AGC data to the CDMA modems; and sends MIU Board Status and Maintenance Information to the WAC 920., 378890=[0198] If loss of lock (LOL) is detected, the modem receiver terminates the Track algorithm and automatically enters the reacquisition algorithm. In the SU, a LOL causes the transmitter to be shut down. In the RCS, LOL causes forward power control to disabled with the transmit power held constant at the level immediately prior to loss of lock. It also causes the return power control information being transmitted to assume a 010101 . . . pattern, causing the SU to hold its transmit power constant. This can be performed using the signal lock check function which generates the reset signal to the acquisition and tracking circuit 1701., 370540=[0186] The Auxiliary AVC 1712 also receives the I and Q digital receive message signal data and, in the described embodiment, includes four separate despreaders 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 as shown in FIG. 18. Each despreader receives and correlates the I and Q digital receive message data with delayed versions of the same despreading-code sequence PARI and PARQ which are provided by code generator 1304 input to and contained in shift register 2020. The output signals of the despreaders 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 are combined in combiner 2030 which provides noise correlation signal ARDSPRDAT. The auxiliary AVC despreading code sequence does not correspond to any transmit spreading-code sequence of the system. Signals OE1, OE2, . . . OE4 are used by the modem control 1303 to enable the despreading operation. The Auxiliary AVC 1712 provides a noise correlation signal ARDSPRDAT from which quantile estimates are calculated by the Quantile estimator 1733, and provides a noise level measurement to the ACQ & Track logic 1701 (shown in FIG. 15) and modem controller 1303 (shown in FIG. 11)., 334737=[0160] The PCM Highway Interface 1220 connects the System PCM Highway 911 to each CDMA Modem 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215. The WAC controller transmits Modem Control information, including traffic message control signals for each respective user information signal, to the MIU controller 1230 through the HSB 970. Each CDMA Modem 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215 receives a traffic message control signal, which includes signaling information, from the MIU. Traffic message control signals also include call control (CC) information and spreading code and despreading code sequence information., 349375=[0172] Two output symbol streams FECTR0DI and FECTR0DQ are generated. The FECTR0DI symbol stream is generated by EXCLUSIVE OR Logic 1602 of shift register outputs corresponding to bits 6, 5, 4.3, and 0, (Octal 171) and is designed as In phase component \u201cI\u201d of the transmit message channel data. The symbol stream FECTR0DQ is likewise generated by EXCLUSIVE-OR logic 1603 of shift register outputs from bits 6, 4, 3, 1 and 0, (Octal 133) and is designated as Quadrature component \u201cQ\u201d of the transmit message channel data. Two symbols are transmitted to represent a single encoded bit creating the redundancy necessary to enable error correction to take place on the receiving end., 345717=[0168]FIG. 13 illustrates the block diagram of the MISR 1410. For the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a counter is set by the 8 KHz frame synchronization signal MPCMSYNC and is incremented by 2.048 MHz MPCMCLK from the timing circuit 1401. The counter output is compared by comparator 1502 against TRCFG values corresponding to slot time location for TR0, TR1, TR2, TR3 message channel data; and the TRCFG values are received from the MIU Controller 1230 in MCTRL. The comparator sends a count signal to the registers 1505, 1506, 1507, 1508 which clocks message channel data into buffers 1510, 1511, 1512, 1513 using the TXPCNCLK timing signal derived from the system clock. The message data is provided from the signal MSGDAT from the PCM highway signal MESSAGE when enable signal TR0EN, RT1EN, TR2EN and TR3EN from Timing Control Logic 1401 are active. In further embodiments, MESSAGE may also include signals that enable registers depending upon an encryption rate or data rate. If the counter output is equal to one of the channel location addresses, the specified transmit message data in registers 1510, 1511, 1512, 1513 are input to the convolutional encoders 1411, 1412, 1413, 1414 shown in FIG. 12., 344332=[0167] Referring to FIG. 12, the code generator means 1304 includes Transmit Timing Control Logic 1401 and spreading-code PN-Generator 1402, and the Transmit Section 1301 includes MODEM Input Signal Receiver (MISR) 1410, convolution Encoders 1411, 1412, 1413, 1414, Spreaders 1420, 1421, 1422, 1423, 1424, and Combiner 1430. The Transmit Section 1301 receives the message data channels MESSAGE, convolutionally encodes each message data channel in the respective convolutional encoder 1411, 1412, 1413, 1414, modulates the data with random spreading-code sequence in the respective spreader 1420, 1421, 1422, 1423, 1424, and combines modulated data from all channels, including the pilot code received in the described embodiment from the code generator, in the combiner 1430 to generate I and Q components for RF transmission. The Transmitter Section 1301 of the present embodiment supports four (TR0, TR1, TR2, TR3) 64, 32, 16, 8 Kbps programmable channels. The message channel data is a time multiplexed signal received from the PCM highway 1201 through PCM interface 1220 and input to the MISR 1410., 457322=[0234] The Code lock check algorithm, shown in FIG. 15) is implemented by the modem controller 1303 performing SPRT operations on the output signal of the scalar correlator array. The SPRT technique is the same as that for the acquisition algorithms, except that the constants are changed to increase the probability of detection of lock., 348664=[0171]FIG. 14 shows the block diagram of K=7, R=\ufffd convolution encoder suitable for use as the encoder 1411 shown in FIG. 12. This circuit encodes the TR0 Channel as used in one embodiment of the present invention. Seven-bit Register 1601 with stages Q1 through Q7 uses the signal TXPNCLK to clock in TR0 data when the TR0EN signal is asserted. The output value of stages Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q6, and Q7 are each combined using EXCLUSIVE-OR Logic 1602, 1603 to produce respective I and Q channel FEC data for the TR0 channel FECTR0DI and FECTR0DQ., 365343=[0180] In FIG. 11, the modem controller 1303 implements the Phase Lock Loop (PLL) as a software algorithm in SW PLL logic 1724 of FIG. 15 that calculates the phase and frequency shift in the received signal relative to the transmitted signal. The calculated phase shifts are used to derotate the phase shifts in rotate and combine blocks 1718, 1719, 1720, 1721 of the multipath data signal for combining to produce output signals corresponding to receive channels TR0\u2032, TR1\u2032, TR2\u2032, TR3\u2032. The data is then Viterbi decoded in Viterbi Decoders 1713, 1714, 1715, 1716 to remove the convolutional encoding in each of the received message channels., 372576=[0188] The CDMA modem receiver section 1302 implements several different algorithms during different phases of the acquisition, tracking and despreading of the receive CDMA message signal., 456778=[0233] The AMF Tap-Weight Update Algorithm of the AMF Weight Gen 1722 (shown in FIG. 15) occurs periodically to de-rotate and scale the phase each finger value of the Pilot Rake 1711 by performing a complex multiplication of the Pilot AVC finger value with the complex conjugate of the current output value of the carrier tracking loop and applying the product to a low pass filter to produce AMF tap-weight values, which are periodically written into the AMF filters of the CDMA modem., 379580=[0199] Two sets of quantile statistics are maintained, one by Quantile estimator 1723B and the other by the scalar Quantile Estimator 1723A. Both are used by the modem controller 1303. The first set is the \u201cvector\u201d quantile information, so named because it is calculated from the vector of four complex values generated by the AUX AVC receiver 1712. The second set is the scalar quantile information, which is calculated from the signal complex value AUX signal that is output from the AUX Despreader 1707. The two sets of information represent different sets of noise statistics used to maintain a pre-determined Probability of False Alarm (Pfa). The vector quantile data is used by the acquisition and reacquisition algorithms implemented by the modem controller 1303 to determine the presence of a received signal in noise, and the scalar quantile information is used by the code lock check algorithm., 364395=[0179] Time synchronization of the receiver to the received signal is separated into two phases; there is an initial acquisition phase and then a tracking phase after the signal timing has been acquired. The initial acquisition is done by sliding the locally generated pilot code sequence relative to the received signal and comparing the output signal of the pilot despreader to a threshold. The method used is called sequential search. Two thresholds (match and dismiss) are calculated from the auxiliary despreader. Once the signal is acquired, the search process is stopped and tracking begins. The tracking maintains the code generator 1304 (shown in FIGS. 11 and 15) used by the receiver in synchronization with the incoming signal. The tracking loop used in the Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) and is implemented in the acquisition & track 1701 and the IPM 1702 blocks of FIG. 15., 335443=[0161] The MIU also includes the Transmit Data Combiner 1232 which adds weighted CDMA modem transmit data including In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) modem transmit data from the CDMA modems 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215 on the MIU. The I modem transmit data is added separately from the Q modem transmit data. The combined I and Q modem transmit data output signal of the Transmit Data Combiner 1232 is applied to the I and Q multiplexer 1233 that creates a single CDMA transmit message channel composed of the I and Q modem transmit data multiplexed into a digital data stream., 369521=[0185] The Pilot AVC 1711 shown in FIG. 17 receives the I and Q Pilot Spreading-code sequence values PCI and PCQ into shift register 1920 responsive to the timing signal RXPNCLK, and includes 11 individual despreaders 1901 through 1911 each correlating the I and Q digital receive message signal data with a one chip delayed versions of the same pilot code sequence. Signals OE1, OE2, . . . OE11 are used by the modem control 1303 to enable the despreading operation. The output signals of the despreaders are combined in combiner 1920 forming correlation signal DSPRDAT of the Pilot AVC 1711, which is received by the ACQ & Track logic 1701 (shown in FIG. 15), and ultimately by modem controller 1303 (shown in FIG. 11). The ACQ & Track logic 1701 uses the correlation signal value to determine if the local receiver is synchronized with its remote transmitter., 351575=[0175] The combiner 1430 receives the I and Q spread transmit data channels and combines the channels into an I modem transmit data (TXIDAT) and Q modem transmit data (TXQDAT) signals. The I-spread transmit data and the Q spread transmit data are added separately., 371817=[0187] Each despread channel output signal corresponding to the received message channels TR0\u2032, TR1\u2032, TR2\u2032, and TR3\u2032 is input to a corresponding Viterbi decoder 1713, 1714, 1715, 1716 shown in FIG. 15 which performs forward error correction on convolutionally encoded data. The Viterbi decoders of the exemplary embodiment have a constraint length of K=7 and a rate of R=\ufffd. The decoded despread message channel signals are transferred from the CDMA modem to the PCM Highway 1201 through the MOI 1717. The operation of the MOI is very similar to the operation of the MISR of the transmit section 1301 (shown in FIG. 11), except in reverse., 451715=[0229] Code tracking is implemented via a loop phase detector that is implemented as follows. The vector y is defined as a column vector which represents the 11 complex output level values of the Pilot AVC 1711, and B denotes an 11\ufffd11 metric real valued coefficient matrix with pre-determined values to optimize formance with the non-coherent Pilot AVC output values y. As described above, the se detector output is given by equation (39);, 350884=[0174] The output signal of each spreader 1420, 1421, 1422, 1423, 1424 is a spread transmit data channel. The operation of the spreader is as follows: the spreading of channel output (I+jQ) multiplied by a random sequence (PNI+jPNQ) yields the In-phase component I of the result being composed of (I xor PNI) and (\u2212Q xor PNQ). Quadrature component Q of the result is (Q xor PNI) and (I xor PNQ). Since there is no channel data input to the pilot channel logic (I=1, Q values are prohibited), the spread output signal for pilot channels yields the respective sequences PNI for I component and PNQ for Q component., 331198=[0157] The RCS of the present embodiment includes a System Modem 1210 contained on one MIU. The System Modem 1210 includes a Broadcast spreader (not shown) and a Pilot Generator (not shown). The Broadcast Modem provides the broadcast information used by the exemplary system, and the broadcast message data is transferred from the MIU controller 1230 to the System Modem 1210. The System Modem also includes four additional modems (not shown) which are used to transmit the signals CT1 through CT4 and AX1 through AX4. The System Modem 1210 provides unweighted I and Q Broadcast message data signals which are applied to the VDC. The VDC adds the Broadcast message data signal to the MIU CDMA Modem Transmit Data of all CDMA modems 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215, and the Global Pilot signal., 367547=[0183] The Adaptive Matched Filter (AMF) 1710 resolves multipath interference introduced by the air channel. The exemplary AMF 1717 uses an stage complex FIR filter as shown in FIG. 16. The received I and Q digital message signals are received at the register 1820 from the A/D converter 1730 of FIG. 15 and are multiplied in multipliers 1801, 1802, 1803, 1810, 1811 by I and Q channel weights W1 to W11 received from AMF weight generator 1722 of FIG. 15. In the exemplary embodiment, the A/D converter 1730 provides the I and Q digital receive message signal data as 2's complement 6 bits I and 6 bits Q which are clocked through an 11 stage shift register 1820 responsive to the receive spreading-code clock signal RXPNCLK. The signal RXPNCLK is generated by the timing section 1401 of code generation logic 1304. Each stage of the shift register is tapped and complex multiplied in the multipliers 1801, 1802, 1803, 1810, 1811 by individual (6-bit I and 6-bit Q) weights to provide 11 tap-weighted products which are added in adder 1830, and limited to 7-bit I and 7-bit Q values., 49669=[0001] This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/840,769, filed Apr. 24,2001, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/444,079, filed Nov. 22, 1999, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/024,473, filed Feb. 17, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,332, which is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/669,769, filed Jun. 27, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No.5,796,776, which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/000,775 filed Jun. 30, 1995., 342755=[0165] Each CDMA modem 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215 of FIG. 10, and as shown in FIG. 11, is composed of a transmit section 1301 and a receive section 1302. Also included in the CDMA modem is a control center 1303 which receives control messages CNTRL from the external system. These messages are used, for example, to assign particular spreading codes, to activate the spreading or despreading, or to assign transmission rates. In addition, the CDMA modem has a code generator means 1304 used to generate the various spreading and despreading codes used by the CDMA modem. The transmit section 1301 transmits the input information and control signals mi (t), i=1, 2, . . . I as spread-spectrum processed user information signals scj (t), j=1, 2, . . . J. The transmit section 1301 receives the global pilot code from the code generator 1304 which is controlled by the control means 1303. The spread spectrum processed user information signals are ultimately added with other similarly processed signals and transmitted as CDMA channels over the CDMA RF forward message link, for example to the SUs. The receive section 1302 receives CDMA channels as r(t) and despreads and recovers the user information and control signal rck (t), k=1, 2, . . . K transmitted over the CDMA RF reverse message link, for example to the RCS from the SUs., 373676=[0191] The acquisition and tracking algorithms are used by the receiver to determine the approximate code phase of a received signal, synchronize the local modem receiver despreaders to the incoming pilot signal, and track the phase of the locally generated pilot code sequence with the received pilot code sequence. Referring to FIGS. 11 and 15, the algorithms are performed by the Modem controller 1303, which provides clock adjust signals to code generator 1304. These adjust signals cause the code generator for the despreaders to adjust locally generated code sequences in response to measured output values of the Pilot Rake 1711 and Quantile values from quantile estimators 1723B. Quantile values are noise statistics measured from the In-phase and Quadrature channels from the output values of the AUX Vector Correlator 1712 (shown in FIG. 15). Synchronization of the receiver to the received signal is separated into two phases; an initial acquisition phase and a tracking phase. The initial acquisition phase is accomplished by clocking the locally generated pilot spreading-code sequence at a higher or lower rate than the received signal's spreading code rate, sliding the locally generated pilot spreading code sequence and performing sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) on the output of the Pilot Vector correlator 1711. The tracking phase maintains the locally generated spreading-code pilot sequence in synchronization with the incoming pilot signal., 367162=[0182] In another embodiment of the invention, the CDMA modem receiver may also include a Bit error Integrator to measure the BER of the channel and idle code insertion logic between the Viterbi decoders 1713, 1714, 1715, 1716 and the MOI 1717 to insert idle codes in the event of loss of the message data., 350224=[0173] Referring to FIG. 14, the shift enable clock signal for the transmit message channel data is generated by the Control Timing Logic 1401. The convolutionally encoded transmit message channel output data for each channel is applied to the respective spreader 1420, 1421, 1422, 1423, 1424 which multiplies the transmit message channel data by its preassigned spreading-code sequence from code generator 1402. This spreading-code sequence is generated by control 1303 as previously described, and is called a random pseudonoise signature sequence (PN-code)., 363392=[0178] Referring to FIGS. 9 and 10, the RF receiver 950 of the present embodiment accepts analog input I and Q CDMA channels, which are transmitted to the CDMA modems 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215 through the MIUs 931, 932, 933 from the VDC 940. These I and Q CMDA channel signals are sampled by the CDMA modem receive section 1302 (shown in FIG. 11) and converted to I and Q digital receive message signal using an Analog to Digital (A/D) converter 1730 of FIG. 15. The sampling rate of the A/D converter of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is equivalent to the despreading code rate. The I and Q digital receive message signals are then despread with correlators using six different complex despreading code sequences corresponding to the spreading code sequences of the four channels (TR0, TR1, TR2, TR3), APC information and the pilot code., 336106=[0162] The Receiver Data Input Circuit (RDI) 1234 receives the Analog Differential I and Q Data from the Video Distribution Circuit (VDC) 940 shown in FIG. 9 and distributes Analog Differential I and Q Data to each of the CDMA Modems 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215 of the MIU. The Automatic Gain Control Distribution Circuit (AGC) 1235 receives the AGC Data signal from the VDC and distributes the AGC Data to each of the CDMA Modems of the MIU. The TRL circuit 1233 receives the Traffic lights information and similarly distributes the Traffic light data to each of the Modems 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215., 372815=[0189] When the received signal is momentarily lost (or severely degraded) the idle code insertion algorithm inserts idle codes in place of the lost or degraded receive message data to prevent the user from hearing loud noise bursts on a voice call. The idle codes are sent to the MOI 1717 (shown in FIG. 15) in place of the decoded message channel output signal from the Viterbi decoders 1713, 1714, 1715, 1716. The idle code used for each traffic channel is programmed by the Modem Controller 1303 by writing the appropriate pattern IDLE to the MOI, which in the present embodiment is a 8 bit word for a 64 kbps stream, 4 bit word for a 32 kbps stream., 332117=[0158] The Pilot Generator (PG) 1250 provides the Global Pilot signal which is used by the present invention, and the Global Pilot signal is provided to the CDMA modems 1210, 1211, 1212, 1215 by the MIU controller 1230. Other embodiments of the present invention, however, do not require the MIU controller to generate the Global Pilot signal, but include a Global Pilot signal generated by any form of CDMA Code Sequence generator. In the described embodiment of the invention, the unweighted I and Q Global Pilot signal is also sent to the VDC where it is assigned a weight, and added to the MIU CDMA Modem transmit data and Broadcast message data signal., 329971=[0155] The MIU controller 1230 of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention contains one communication microprocessor 1240, such as the MC68360 \u201cQUICC\u201d Processor, and includes a memory 1242 having a Flash Prom memory 1243 and a SRAM memory 1244. Flash Prom 1243 is provided to contain the program code for the Microprocessors 1240, and the memory 1243 is downloadable and reprogrammable to support new program versions. SRAM 1244 is provided to contain the temporary data space needed by the MC68360 Microprocessor 1240 when the MIU controller 1230 reads or writes data to memory., 377408=[0196] The Pre-Track algorithm immediately follows the acquisition or re-acquisition algorithms and immediately precedes the tracking algorithm. Pre-track is a fixed duration period during which the receive data provided by the modem is not considered valid. The Pre-Track period allows other modem algorithms, such as those used by the ISW PLL 1724, ACQ & Tracking, AMF Weight GEN 1722, to prepare and adapt to the current channel. The Pre-track algorithm is two parts. The first part is the delay while the code tracking loop pulls in. The second part is the delay while the AMF tap weight calculations are performed by the AMF Weight Gen 1722 to produce settled weighting coefficients. Also in the second part of the Pre-Track period, the carrier tracking loop is allowed to pull in by the SE PLL 1724, and the scalar quantile estimates are performed in the Quantile estimator 1723A., 393367=[0206] For the present algorithm, the control voltage is formed as \u03b5=yTBY, where y is a vector formed from the complex valued output values of the Pilot Vector correlator 1711, and B is a matrix consisting of the constant values pre-determined to maximize the operating characteristics while minimizing the noise as described above with reference to the Quadratic Detector., 368814=[0184] The CDMA modem receive section 1302 (shown in FIG. 11) provides independent channel despreaders 1703, 1704, 1705, 1706, 1707, 1708, 1709 (shown in FIG. 15) for despreading the message channels. The described embodiment despreads 7 message channels, each despreader accepting a 1-bit I b 1-bit Q spreading-code signal to perform a complex correlation of this code against a 8-bit I by 8-bit Q data input. The 7 despreaders correspond to the 7 channels; Traffic Channel 0 (TR0\u2032), TR1\u2032, TR2\u2032, TR3\u2032, AUX (a spare channel), Automatic Power Control (APC) and pilot (PLT)., 366127=[0181]FIG. 15 indicates that the Code Generator 1304 provides the code sequences Pni (t), I=1, 2, . . . I used by the receive channel despreaders 1703, 1704, 1705, 1706, 1707, 1708, 1709. The code sequences generated are timed in response to the SYNK signal of the system clock signal and are determined by the CCNTRL signal from the modem controller 1303 shown in FIG. 11. Referring to FIG. 15, the CDMA modem receiver section 1302 includes Adaptive Matched Filter (AMF) 1710, Channel despreaders 1703, 1704, 1705, 1706, 1707, 1708, 1709, Pilot AVC 1711, Auxiliary AVC 1712, Viterbi decoders 1713, 1714, 1715, 1716, Modem output interface (MOI) 1717, Rotate and Combine logic 1718, 1719, 1720, 1721, AMF Weight Generator 1722, and Quantile Estimation logic 1723.}",
