Although this is supposed to be a \"relaxed pant\", I did find the pants to be a bit tight in the hip and seat area. Fortunately, it comes with a skirt as well, which has a very flexible and comfortable elastic waistband. No fit problems with the skirt. Overall, happy with the purchase. Reviewed by M. R. (Eden Prairie, MN), 6 months pregnant The suit runs smalls so I ordered up a size. The pants are cut too slim and the skirt is an odd shape. However, if I pull the skirt up higher on my abdomen it works ok. The jacket fits perfect and is very flattering because of the sash.",
