Cisco MCS 7845-H2/I2-RC1 and MCS 7835-H2/I2-RC1 servers are supported for upgrades only. However, they are not recommended for use with Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Release 7.1 due to their smaller hard drives. Cisco MCS 7845-H2/I2-RC2 and MCS 7835-H2/I2-RC2 servers are supported for upgrades only. If you are using the DL380-G6 Server from HP, the Application Server software must be at MP_DVD_308-7_0_2_14.iso or higher from manufacturing. IMPORTANT!!! When installing Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Release 7.1 Application Servers, make sure to connect the monitor directly to the server. Using a KVM of any kind (for example, a SIP Based KVM with SMART CABLE) might result in the installation UI not being displayed on the monitor, and thus prevent you from continuing with the installation.

For additional information about supported third-party servers, go to: http://www.cisco.com/go/swonly.
