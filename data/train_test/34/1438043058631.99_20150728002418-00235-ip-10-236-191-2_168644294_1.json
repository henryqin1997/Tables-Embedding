What better image than hardworking and intensely dedicated to his craft? Wagner's piece in the post is great too. A homebody with his family during the off season, starts a 2 hour workout at 5:30 am four days a week, eats a PBJ sandwich before every game. And according to his brother, \u201cHe told me last year in the middle August, he was going to make a push and get that Rookie of The Year Award, and look what he did in September. I truly believe he can do anything he wants to do in his career .\u2009.\u2009. Anything he puts his mind to he can achieve. If he wants to win the MVP, he will.\u201dAnd we get to watch this kid for the next five years? Pinch me., 29904=Interesting Kilgore post on Span. One question that isn't addressed is whether he intentionally made a change after his good 2009 season, and if so, who made the suggestion? Or did he just drift away from what he was doing then and not notice what he was doing until Eck reviewed the video from the last 3 years?Don't the Twins have a hitting coach?, 39465=http://dcbaseballhistory.com/2013/02/masn-makes-first-error-of-the-spring/I sure hope the Florida faithful video tape the entire 1st and 2nd innings for us.Any of you know how to do it and post up on YouTube or VIMEO?, 40443=Call in now to 1-712-432-1980 to listen to Mike Rizzo!, 22869=MicheleS said\u2026 Ghost.. Love how Eck drove over to see Span just after the trade. February 20, 2013 11:05 AM Exactly! Glad you astutely said that. No matter what you think about Eckstein, I will say it again, \"The hardest working coach in the MLB\"., 81153=Copyright \u00a9 2012-2015 Comcast SportsNet Washington DC.

I don't think he really wants to play. And riding those buses is the wrong spot to be if you don't want to play.
