Yates completing 98.2 percent of his passes, Robert Quinn pounding 24 reps at 225 pounds and running a 4.59 sprint to boot, Greg Little leaping upward 38 inches and outward 10 feet, 10 inches., 44188=She now has 17 homers in two seasons, which puts McCurry well over halfway to the state record (27)\u00a0shared between Rams senior Jordan Critcher and 2007 Graham graduate Nikki Welborn., 172822=The most UNC players selected in one draft was seven back in 1998. UNC had three first-round picks that year, in defensive end Greg Ellis (Dallas), defensive tackle Vonnie Holliday (Green Bay) and linebacker Brian Simmons (Cincinnati)., 33785=Cannon said he did not make his final decision until about 2:30 p.m. today, just a half-hour before he announced it., 165843=Simmons, a 6-foot-8 forward and the Citizen-Times All-WNC Player of the Year,\u00a0had initially accepted a preferred walk-on position with North Carolina in August., 187776=The Roberson girls will also race in the 400-meter relay (11:10 a.m.) and 1,600-meter relay (3:45 p.m.) today., 69492=Rachel Reese was 5-5 with three doubles and four RBIs.

Unfortunately, Carolina\u2019s on-field results in 2010 didn\u2019t match those of 1996-97; the Heels were 8-5 with a win over Tennessee in the Franklin American Music City Bowl but were handcuffed throughout the season by a myriad of personnel issues wrought by NCAA and institutional investigations., 166681=Simmons called to notify his high school coach (Jimmy Cleaveland) of the Tar Heels\u2019 scholarship on Wednesday at about 10:30 p.m. \u00a0, 31162=Shot put: Hailey Cook (Hen) 39-5; Discus: Hailey Cook (Hen) 113-8.5; Long jump: Leah Weyandt (Hen) 14-1; Triple jump: Brittany Poeng (KM) 29-0; High jump:\u00a0Megan Garren (Hen) 5-0; Pole vault: Elizabeth\u00a0Foster (Hen) 7-6; 3,200-meter relay: Hendersonville 10:37.18; 100-meter hurdles: Toccara Jefferies (Sh) 18.14; 100-meter dash: Cierra Jeffries (Sh) 13.56; 200-meter dash: Tuscola 1:50.38; 800-meter relay: Shelby 1:55.62; 1,600-meter run: Kristen Stout (Hen) 5:43.00; 400-meter relay: Tuscola 52.76; 400-meter dash: Stephanie Burris (T) 1:00.52; 300-meter hurdles: Marilee Walker (Hen) 50.29; 800-meter run: Becca Elliott (PC) 2:27.28; 200-meter dash: Stephanie Burris (T) 26.90; 3,200-meter run: Elizabeth Lackey (Hen) 12:41.28; 1,600-meter relay: Polk County 4:23.04., 30126=Shot put: Cameron\u00a0Harris (KM) 46-9; Discus: Cameron\u00a0Harris (KM) 131-10; Long jump: Tim Hines (KM) 21-10.5; Triple jump: Henry Bustle (SI) 42-9.5; High jump: Grant Rivers (Hen) 6-0; Pole vault: Joey Jones (Hen) 12-0; 3,200-meter relay: East Lincoln 8:36.13; 110-meter hurdles: Demonte Wilson (Cr) 14.91; 100-meter dash: Harvey McSwain (Cr) 10.99; 800-meter relay: Shelby 1:31.06; 1,600-meter run: Dylan Belles (EL) 4:52.29; 400-meter relay: Shelby 43.59; 400-meter dash: Marcus McDowell (EL) 51.13; 300-meter hurdles: Demonte Wilson (Cr) 39.79; 800-meter run: Seth Rhodes (Pis) 2:03.25; 200-meter dash: Harvey McSwain (Cr) 21.18; 3,200-meter run: Daniel Harder (Hen) 10:59.62; 1,600-meter relay: Hendersonville 3:29.52. \u00a0, 243635=Copyright \u00a9 2011 www.citizen-times.com.

That can be viewed in one of two ways. One, White is a versatile athlete who can adapt to various situations. Two, he isn\u2019t a very good running back. It\u2019s not the latter, as he posted 720 rushing yards on 130 attempts in 2010. White also showed decent ability to catch the ball out of the backfield, as indicated by his 24 receptions and 289 yards. In addition, he was a nice special teams player, racking up 16 tackles while producing decent numbers in the return game. That type of versatility will get him drafted, perhaps as high as the third round, by some indications. He ran a 4.5 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine, with a 32 1/2-inch vertical leap. He is coming off a collarbone injury, but that shouldn\u2019t dissuade any club that is interested., 209558=North Buncombe graduate Cody Geyer established the NCHSAA baseball mark for homers (45) late in the 2010 regular season., 55038=The Wolverines will hold a signing ceremony for the four players\u00a0Tuesday morning.
