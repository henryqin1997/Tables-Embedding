Just days after John Calipari said his team couldn't \"whomp\" any opponent, the Wildcats put a hurt on the Tigers at Auburn Arena. Kyle Wiltjer scored 17 points and UK, playing without injured freshman Willie Cauley-Stein, outscored Auburn 45-28 in the second half. Nerlens Noel had 10 points, nine rebounds and seven blocks for Kentucky, and the Cats' defense was as tough on the perimeter as in the post. Auburn shot 0-for-15 from three-point range., 57769=3. Full Strength: Auburn guard Chris Denson has been something of an offensive bright spot of late, averaging 12.3 points per game over his last four. That's part of an up-and-down season for Denson. The junior guard started hot, averaging 15.2 points per game through the Tigers' first five games. Then he missed four straight with a stress fracture in his right foot. He returned for Auburn's Jan. 19 game with Kentucky but went scoreless in 13 minutes, then scored one point in 18 minutes at Vanderbilt. He's been in double figures in three of four games since., 64459=Top 10 upsets: A November to remember}",
