            "It's pretty safe around here as long as people pay attention. Every once in a while, there's a security alert. They notify the whole campus and attend to the victim/incident. They could give a greater effort in solving crimes, I think. But, honestly, I feel more unsafe because of the ice on the ground and the stairs than because of people around. The weather does get brutal, so your health may not be safe here. Oh, and our crossing guards will do everything within their power to keep you safe.",
            "Currently, about 35% of campus is Greek. This is partially because the community within Greek life is very strong. Although there are parties and everything, Greek life is not about that, whatsoever. Here, it's about the values we hold, what we can give to the community, and how we can grow every single one of our members. There are many things catered toward Greek students on this campus, since there are so many, including Greek InterVarsity and an AWESOME Greek Week!",
            "You can find whatever you want or make it. The clubs often hold events for all of the campus community to enjoy, so even if you don't join, there's a lot to benefit from the student activities culture at Case.",
            "People who really like to think and learn, though it may be a struggle because there are times when you will have to focus yourself so much that you're cutting off cool learning opportunities. It's also really good for people who have many opinions but are still learning how to voice them. We have plenty of people who have been well versed in this since their first two word utterance, but a lot of people grow to a point where they become leaders of orgs or just always speak up in conversations, though they never spoke up before Case. (A lot of this is through Greek life, as we have the model Greek life, with values based organizations and a very passionate community)",
            "There are the elephant stairs, which are horribly long (I relate them to amusement parks without the fun) stairs that lead up to our top of the hill dorms and commons. We also have the Hudson Relays, a race between the classes, presided over by the president. If a class wins all 4 years, they get a steak dinner with the president.",
            "Way too much of our buck goes into professors' research, which some people appreciate. I, however, believe that dorm life, security, the shuttles, parking, and more could be so much better if they would care a wee bit less about the research and more about the students. Alas, that's what you get from a top tier research institution.",
            "There are tons of things to do. You can keep it simple and just hang out, or you can join a club and they'll show you an awesome time. You could also explore Cleveland (alone, with a mate, with a group) and the various venues it has to offer. The random open mic nights at coffee shops, restaurants, museums, sports (depending on how invested you are), theater, and more can serve as exhilarating outings. And, believe it or not, you could have a lot of fun volunteering at different places, too. It will show you new and cool places you never would have come across otherwise.",
            "There are plenty of options, but the dining halls can get old after a while. It only makes it worse if you complain with your friends about it, because you focus on all of the negative. The cost of the meal swipes (~$15) is almost never worth it, especially at lunch places like Bag it and Grab it, but at least you have quick, accessible food during the day.",
            "Put yourself out there (whether by groups or by talking to people or sitting in the common room waiting for someone to talk to you) and find people to connect with. Otherwise, it's easy to feel left out of the dorm life. Also, in terms of freshman dorms, Smith and Taft are best (both were remodeled and Smith has the biggest rooms).",
            "There are a few lax classes, but most classes will come at you hard and fast. You won't know what to expect, so just try to get ahead and then roll with the punches.",
            "Be prepared to work like you NEVER have before if you come here. Make it up in your mind that you won't let things like the cold or a lack of sleep keep you from doing your work. Ask someone who's been through your classes how they made it through and take their advice. But, with all advice, always consider who you are and apply accordingly. Don't read for math, if you'll learn better by doing problems, just because someone else succeeded by reading.",
            "Case is a great place for people who feel the need to produce something tangible. Whether you're in the classroom or with extracurricular activities, there are many opportunities to shine. Some people get caught up in this, but it turns out alright if you find a community."

There is a pumpkin throwing every Halloween, Homecoming weekend is important, a campus wide service day every September or October, and the cycle club does free bike tune ups every fall, Hudson Relays, Halloween at Home, and study overs to name a few., 16625=This school is great for student who enjoy cold climates. Cleveland receives tons of snow from November to April. Students who are interested in Medicine, Art, Music, and Engineering will find a home at CWRU., 303729=I've only lived in freshman housing and then one of the nicest Greek houses on campus, so I can't speak for the sophomore or upperclassmen housing from experience. However, what I do know is that you are paying a lot of money for some ehhhhhh housing. Freshman dorms were pretty drab. Sophomore housing is in a suite style which is nice, but the singles are horrifically small and cramped. Maintenance is pretty unreliable; I had a friend whose heat went out in January, and it took two maintenance requests, two phone calls, and finally a visit to undergraduate services to have something done about it. And if you know anything about winter in Cleveland, you don't want your heat out for ten minutes, let alone three days. However, DON'T take that as a reason not to come here or to live on campus. The way the dorms are laid out makes it so easy to socialize with friends, especially in your first year. Laundry is FREE!!! Overall a positive experience that I have loved, especially being in my Greek house. Be sure to bundle up in the winter because it is about a 15 minute walk to the main quad from north side and 10 minutes from south side.}",

If you are content discussing pokemon and star trek for hours, then you will fit right in. If you want to party with friends, then you will also fit in. However, you might have to limit yourself to one night during the weekends, and do work during the other. Tips for prospective students Don't be afraid to check out Case Greek life. It doesn't fit the normal stereotype, and you will meet a lot of great friends. Go to the book swap",
