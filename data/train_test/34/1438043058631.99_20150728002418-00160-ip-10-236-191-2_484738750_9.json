No. 08/036,047, filed Mar. 23, 1993, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,481,178., 64551=In accordance with the present invention, control circuit 70 maintains MOSFETS 16 and 17 OFF over periods of time when the output current is low enough to allow the output capacitor COUT to maintain the output voltage substantially at the regulated voltage. Typically, such periods of OFF time, wherein both MOSFETS 16 and 17 are maintained OFF even though the switching regulator is providing a regulated voltage, can extend from less than 100 microseconds to over a few seconds (respectively corresponding to a few switch cycles to over one-hundred-thousand switch cycles for a switching frequency of 100 kiloHertz). Such OFF times typically allow high efficiency to be obtained (e.g., over 90%) over an output current range in excess of 100:1. Because other components in addition the switching transistors can also be maintained OFF during such periods, even higher efficiencies can typically be obtained., 90891=Whenever P-MOSFET 16 is ON, its gate-to-source voltage also appears across MOSFET 334, turning MOSFET 334 ON. This pulls the drain of MOSFET 334 HIGH, and inhibits N-drive 27. Following a LOW-to-HIGH VSWB transition, the voltage on the gate of P-MOSFET 16 must rise to a level where MOSFET 334 is conducting less than current source 335 before the drain voltage of MOSFET 334 falls and allows the N-MOSFET 17 to be turned ON. Current IM1 is purposely made small so that the gate of MOSFET 334 must rise to within 2 volts of the input voltage VIN before the drive is enabled, ensuring that the P-MOSFET is completely OFF when N-MOSFET 17 turns ON. In a similar manner, MOSFET 332 and current source IM2 333 ensure that the N-MOSFET 17 is completely OFF when the P-MOSFET 16 turns ON. This prevents simultaneous conduction regardless of the driver speeds or MOSFET sizes, ensuring maximum possible efficiency. This feature of the present embodiment is discussed in more detail in copending commonly-assigned U.S. patent application (LT-20) Ser. No. 07/893,523, filed Jun. 4, 1992, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. If desired, the control circuit of the present invention can also include circuitry for accommodating transient switch signals as described in copending commonly-assigned U.S. patent application (LT-20CIP) Ser. No. 08/035,423, filed concurrently herewith, which is also hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patentzitate One skilled in the art will thus appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other than the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of illustration and not of limitation, and the present invention is limited only by the claims which follow. Thus, a control circuit and method for maintaining high efficiency over broad current ranges in a switching regulator circuit has been provided. It will also be apparent that although the present invention has been discussed above with reference to FIGS. 1-10, wherein the power switches were either a pair of complementary MOSFETS (i.e., one p-channel and one n-channel) or a single p-channel MOSFET (FIG. 3), the present invention is applicable to other types of switches as well. For example, the power switch could include a pair of N-channel MOSFETS, a pair of P-channel MOSFETS, or bipolar junction transistors. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that although the present invention has been discussed above with reference to a hysteretic voltage comparator for generating the sleep mode control signal to cause the switching regulator to go into and awake from the sleep-mode, other means for performing the same function are also possible. For example, if desired, the sleep mode control signal could be generated in response to a monitored output current. Furthermore, the switching regulator could be taken out of the sleep mode a predetermined time period after going",
