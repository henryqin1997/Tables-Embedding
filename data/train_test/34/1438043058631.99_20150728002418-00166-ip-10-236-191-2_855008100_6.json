    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{3199=Well, 2009 might have been extremely painful, even brutal,\u00a0but it was not the end of the financial world. Principally because governments flooded the financial markets with Keynesian-style support (we gave up counting at $12 trillion against global GDP of $65 trillion or 20% in the form of TARPs, investments, liquidity, investments and guarantees)., 4928=It didn\u2019t seem that way in the first half of 2009. Lehman did\u00a0not appear to affect the final quarter of 2008, when our like-for-like revenues were flat globally. Maybe because most of our clients budget are on a calendar-year basis, there is little or no immediate institutional reaction even to violent financial events. The effect is inevitably delayed until the next calendar year. Certainly, I saw little or no impact in that final quarter on my travels, perhaps with the exception of those companies that despite their size were more focused and less diverse., 4329=We certainly were shaken out of any complacency by the second quarter of 2009. Having ourselves budgeted for a 2% decline in like-for-like revenues for calendar 2009, -3% in the first half\u00a0and -1% in the second half, we finished the first half down 8%, without having made any significant reduction in\u00a0our cost base. That certainly was the wake-up call and, beginning in the second quarter of 2009, we started to make the necessary cost adjustments, which sadly resulted in a reduction of over\u00a015,000 positions. By the end of 2009, point-to-point headcount on a like-for-like basis was down over 12% and incentive pools had been reduced to below 16%\u00a0of headline operating profits before bonuses and taxes. Interestingly, as a\u00a0result, the second half of 2009 saw our operating margins achieve the same level as the second half of 2008. Certainly in\u00a02009, most of our clients had thought the financial world, at\u00a0least, had come to an end and were cutting costs indiscriminately, focusing on effectiveness (better work), efficiency (more for less) and liquidity (act as our banker)., 10504=Annual Report & Accounts 2011, 6375=On Monday 14 September 2008, Lehman Brothers went into bankruptcy. If you had asked me at that point when things would get back to normal \u2013 or when our business would return to pre-Lehman levels \u2013 I\u2019d have said it would be a very, very long time. True, we\u00a0had felt the sub-prime and insurance monoline tremors in\u00a0June 2007, and had witnessed the dismemberment of Bear Stearns in March 2008, but the sacrificing of Lehman seemed an altogether more significant event. Warren Buffet was to call it America\u2019s financial Pearl Harbour. Jeffrey Immelt would declare, according to Andrew Ross Sorkin in Too Big to Fail, that GE Capital was 48 hours away from being unable to extend its credit facilities. The crucifixion of Lehman was a\u00a0seminal moment, an inflection point., 2828=2010 turned out, however to be completely different. Once\u00a0bitten, twice shy, we budgeted flat like-for-like revenue growth and it came in at 5%. Why? Well, certainly, clients realised the world had not come to an end. Severe cost actions in 2009, combined with stimulatory monetary and fiscal policies saved the day, and gave clients the headroom to\u00a0focus, once again, on geographic and functional growth. I\u00a0could not\u00a0find a client CEO who was not hesitant about increasing capacity in mature, mainly Western markets, while I could not\u00a0find a client CEO who was hesitant to invest in the\u00a0growth markets of Asia (except Japan), Latin America, Africa and the\u00a0Middle East, and Central and Eastern Europe., 641=2011 was similar. We budgeted like-for-like revenue growth of more than 5% and achieved 5.3%, with gross margin growing even faster at 5.9%, pretty much at the increased level we indicated at the end of the first quarter of\u00a02011. The recovery continued, but this year it was more LUV-shaped, with the BRICs, Next 11 and digital regaining their greater prominence, and the mature markets and media slowing, mainly affected by the Eurozone crisis and the US budgetary deadlock, particularly in the second half of the year., 2076=Two forces seemed to be at work and confirmatory evidence came from Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve. In late 2010, he told CNBC (which he confirmed again in mid-2011) that he had seen little evidence that fixed-capital formation among US non-financials had shown any lift. While that statistical series included about 40% of earnings from outside the US, the point was made. First, in 2010 we saw a snap back in traditional markets that had become overly depressed. For example, in the US, advertising as a proportion of GDP seemed to have fallen to levels not seen since the 1970s. At the very least, there was an opportunity for dead cat bounce. Secondly, there was a growing realisation, that although growth rates had slowed in the BRICs and Next 11, relative growth opportunities were still considerable., 5516=Well, here we are three years later, beyond where we\u00a0were in 2008, reflecting on a record year against almost all measures in 2011 and on a 2010\u00a0that surprised us, as the US and traditional media bit back (see last year\u2019s think piece). Of course, it is foolhardy to\u00a0be arrogant or complacent. We should remain paranoid, but what has happened? How did things snap back relatively quickly? Why the surprise?}",
    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{83320=Source: The Fututres Company, Global MONITOR survey 2011, 3963=The impact on\u00a0corporate behaviour, however, seems to have been more profound. Ever is a long time, but I am not sure corporates will ever behave in the way they did before 2009. US-based multinationals are sitting on cash balances of\u00a0as\u00a0much as $2 trillion, with relatively unleveraged balance sheets. Boards remain unwilling to take excessive risks. External governance pressures are so intense and non-executive rewards so slim, it is really not worth it. With the\u00a0average CEO lasting about 4.5 years in the US and the\u00a0average CMO only two, why take a big chance?, 31225=To be fair the growth of the BRICs, the Next 11, the CIVETS (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey, South Africa), MIST (Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey) and the new G8 is nothing new. Some 200 years ago, the BRICs and Next 11, for example, accounted for almost half of worldwide GDP, just as they were forecast to do again by Goldman Sachs in its ground-breaking paper in 2001., 30585=While protectionism rears its ugly head, particularly at\u00a0election time, broadly globalisation continues to provide the\u00a0biggest opportunity for corporate growth both internationally for multinationals and locally for national companies. Myanmar is the latest example, a not so mini-Vietnam, with 48 million people, and Rangoon, a historic cultural, educational and university centre. Perhaps Cuba will be next, albeit on a smaller scale. We clearly have to get better at explaining the benefits of globalisation to electorates in the mature markets, especially to displaced employees in\u00a0traditional industries., 51377=There is no doubt that these new digital organisations are \u2018frienemies\u2019. On the one hand, we do considerable business with them on behalf of our clients. In 2011, for example, of\u00a0a\u00a0total media investment of approximately $75 billion, GroupM invested around $1.6 billion with Google and $200 million with Facebook (helped by our investment in Buddy Media, the Facebook platform that manages eight of Facebook\u2019s top 10 advertisers). By contrast, we only invested $6 million with Twitter., 26715=2013, however, may be a little more challenging. There are no maxi or mini-quadrennial events to boost advertising and marketing services spending. True, we may well continue to muddle through the Eurozone crisis. There may well be a Chinese soft landing. The well-telegraphed 12th Five-Year Plan promises 7% compound growth, with social security protection to stimulate consumption and the service sector. The Middle East may also benefit from recent developments in the longer run. But the big issue may well be how a reelected President Obama deals with a Republican-dominated Congress over the US budget deficit., 27518=There are already those who believe, however, that 2013 will be a better year than 2012. I do not share that view currently. They argue that forecasts for World GDP, both real and nominal are in excess of 2012, at around 3-4% and\u00a05-6% respectively (as the IMF has just confirmed) and\u00a0that advertising as a proportion of GDP will continue to\u00a0recover, driven by new markets and new media. Again I\u00a0would rather be cautious at this stage, at least until there are signs that America is not kicking the deficit can down the\u00a0road any more., 83983=We tend to over-intellectualise the point. Doing good is just simply good business. As long ago as 1997, Lord Browne pointed out that if you are in business for the long term you will not offend society, government or the environment. If, however, you are in it for the short term you do not have the same approach. In the oil exploration business, for example, you might\u00a0well decide to rip the maximum amount of oil out of\u00a0the\u00a0ground in the quickest time at the lowest cost. That, thankfully, now seems to be the exception rather than the rule \u2013 particularly as our consumer insight agencies clearly show that consumers and employees value more highly those companies and brands investing in the communities with which they work., 66833=Source: Compete.com As at January 2012, 25974=Prospects for 2012 look similar, perhaps a little more muted, despite the maxi-quadrennial impact of the UEFA Football Championships in Poland and the Ukraine, the Summer Olympics and the US Presidential election, which troika usually adds about 1% to global advertising and marketing services demand. We are budgeting like-for-like revenue growth of more than 4% and have achieved that in the first three months. Real GDP is forecast at 2.5-3.5%, with nominal GDP at 4.5-5.5%. Our forecasts are balanced across the year taking into account the grey swans (the ones we know) of the Eurozone, a Chinese hard landing and Middle Eastern uncertainty, although not the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear capacity., 27347=We will see, but in any event I would prefer to go into 2013 with a relatively tight level of capacity and high levels of\u00a0variable cost, just in case., 28780=2014 may be a different story if the new US Administration shows signs of dealing with the deficit issue, perhaps by embracing the Simpson-Bowles $4 trillion, 10-year plan for deficit reduction. By then Europe will have had another year to muddle through its crisis and should be showing some signs of growth, albeit slow ones. In addition, 2014 will be a mini-quadrennial year with the Winter Olympics in Sochi (which President Putin will ensure is successful), the FIFA World Cup in Brazil (another iconic event to position this decade as the decade of Latin America) and, would you believe it, more elections again in the US\u00a0\u2013 the mid-term Congressionals., 84885=So in summary, the short to medium term looks set fair, with\u00a0the exception of some concerns in the US in 2013. The long term looks reasonably good with communications services expenditure driven by nine factors \u2013 globalisation, overcapacity and the shortage of talent, the web, retail, internal communications, central and local organisational focus, the rise of finance and procurement, the role of government, and sustainability. I hope that prediction proves\u00a0to be right.}",

Functionally, the change in the consumer's media consumption habits meant growth in digital media was also faster. The result was a multi-speed world. The Premier League teams were BRICs, Next 11 and digital. The Championship teams were the US, Germany, free-to-air television and outdoor. League One was Western Europe, mainly the UK, France, Italy and Spain, and magazines and radio. Finally, League Two was Japan and newspapers. What we thought might be a LUV-shaped recovery, in fact was more LVV- or LuVVY-shaped, with the US being V-shaped rather than U-shaped.
