I've recently started teaching myself to crochet. There is no way that I could even tackle a project like that, but I am wondering where you found the pattern for it. Truly is stunning, and it definitely caught the eye of this Irish lass! Thank you for posting the pictures. :-) Happy St. Patricks Day!
