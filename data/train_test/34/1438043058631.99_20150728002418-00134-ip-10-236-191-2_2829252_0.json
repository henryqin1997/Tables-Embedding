The first-generation model of the FALKEN, utilized by the Usean Rebel Forces in 1998, featured an external pod on the vertical stabilizer below the aircraft.[8] A second-generation model was created soon afterward to place the TLS within the nose of the aircraft, which splits apart to fire the laser and closes again to obscure it from view or damage. It still features the ability to recharge even while firing.[9], 4069=Yuktobania became very close to manufacturing their first FALKEN model by early November of 2010.[14] However, due to the development taking place during the Circum-Pacific War, in which Osea quickly invaded the country, Yuktobania could not complete a model by the time Osea raided all of their facilities. No FALKENs were produced by Osea during the rest of the war, likely due to Gr\u00fcnder still holding a part of the blueprints in their facility in Sudentor. Following the Battle of Sudentor, during which the loyalist Oseans invaded the last FALKEN facility, Osea became the only country to possess all of the FALKEN blueprints.[16] The country would later go on to develop their own FALKENs for use among the Osean Air Defense Force.[7] One such FALKEN was featured during an airshow at November City alongside a Morgan as well as an X-02 Wyvern.[17], 6926=On September 18, 1998, the Z.O.E.-equipped FALKEN engaged in battle against Scarface Squadron; regardless of its technological superiority, Phoenix managed to best it, resulting in the aircraft's destruction.[1] It is unclear if Gr\u00fcnder managed to recover the aircraft's remains from North Point. It is also unknown if any more first-generation models were built by the company, but the plans were never scrapped. Instead, Gr\u00fcnder began working on a second version of the aircraft, where the its laser pod would be integrated inside the body. This would become the standard design of the aircraft from then on., 18543=The ADF-01 FALKEN has been featured in various games since 2, including Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War and Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War as its main appearances on consoles. Its appearance in The Unsung War is notable for requiring the destruction of special hangars before it can be unlocked. In January 2015, the ADF-01 FALKEN was added to Ace Combat Infinity, its first console appearance in about a decade., 19488=The ADF-01 FALKEN (sometimes referred to as ADF-01F FALKEN[2][3]) is a next-generation fighter aircraft. It was the first original aircraft design to be featured in an Ace Combat game, namely Ace Combat 2 in 1997. It was also the first aircraft in Strangereal history to feature COFFIN technology, as well as the first aircraft to be flown in combat by a computer program, namely Zone of Endless.}",
