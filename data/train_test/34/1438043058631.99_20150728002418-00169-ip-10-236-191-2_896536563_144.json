            "UNC is a really diverse place, it doesn't matter who you are, you will be able to find a group of friends. The campus is also really nice, especially on warm Spring days. The academics are challenging, but not impossible."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{29271=You do a lot of studying for the test, meaning you cram as much information as possible into your head for exams and to get homework done, but it's so much information in a short period of time that you don't remember much of it in the long run. I personally don't feel like I will graduate a well-rounded person with knowledge of many subjects, because the constant onslaught of new info makes it impossible to remember any past info. Plus you don't get a whole ton of real-world experience unless you're wanting to go into science or a research-heavy field (e.g. history). My biggest issue is that the there are so many gen ed credits you have to take. I know all colleges have them, but UNC's are ridiculous (2 Englishes, 2 Maths, 2 Sciences plus 1 Lab, up to level 4 in Foreign Language, 1 Lifetime Fitness 1 Experiential Education, 1 US Diversity, 3 Social Sciences, 1 Literary Arts, 1 Visual and Performing Arts, 1 Philosophical and Moral Reasoning, 1 Word Before 1790, 1 Beyond the North Atlantic, 1 Global Issues) so if you have no interest whatsoever in a class it makes it difficult to stay motivated. By the time you get to college, you know what your general strengths and weaknesses are, so (for example) having to take 2 sciences when you know you struggle with science is miserable. Moreover, some labs like chemistry or biology are about 4 hours long but you only receive one credit hour for it and have a separate exam for it - how does that make sense? This is especially frustrating in light of the fact that you're being forced to spend all that time in lab if you may not want to take it in the first place. However, if you want to learn skills like how to succeed in an interview or to build a resume, their career services is VERY helpful and work with you a lot. All these things considered, I am still only a freshman and so can't really know if you start learning more/learning more practical skills when you start taking upper-level courses. Also, the teachers tend to be very caring and want to help you as much as they can, even if it's a huge lecture class and their only exposure to you is through office hours. Many classes are taught by TAs though, and I've only heard of maybe 2 or 3 good TAs - most people hate theirs and say they are awful teachers., 164681=We protect the old well from NC state students trying to mess with it before football games. Everyone rushes Franklin on Halloween, and at the beginning of the year when the clubs are being advertised. LDOC-Last day of classes means there will be so many parties. Also we rave in Davis Library in huge numbers on Dec 9th., 13579=Set in a small town not far from just about everything, there isn't much not to love about UNC. If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of classes and academic life, just relax on the beautiful and historic campus of the nation's oldest public institution, head to Franklin street for the typical college town experience, or catch a free bus ride to nearby Carrboro and relax in the Bohemian city center. There's also never a shortage of things to do on campus, as students can watch the 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball champions for free in the Dean Dome, meet like-minded people in student organizations, or watch a movie in the student union., 2663=The great academics are one major plus, but the social scene makes this the ideal college environment! Located in a safe community, this University has everything an undergraduate could ask for. Local places to eat, entertaining attractions, and a world renowned area (Franklin st.) that is home to some of the university's biggest celebrations (i.e: the celebrations of the 2009 NCAA Basketball championship & the 2008 presidential election). It is also a short distance from Durham, home of the famous Minor League Durham Bulls and Raleigh, the states capital! No matter the day of the week, the University of North Carolina is very enjoyable for its students!, 170715=Students who love sex. UNC was rated #1 for the best sex life for Playboy in 2012., 816222=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 201348=The University of North Carolina is required by state law to admit North Carolina residents as 82% of their prospective feshman class (a fact you wont find on their admissions website). They only accepted 800 out-of-state students in their freshman class of 2013 (from over 20,000 out-of-state applicants). So, unless you're a North Carolina resident, getting in to this school is more competitive than most Ivy League schools!}",

If you love meeting new and different types of people, this school is perfect for you. In regard to academics, there are fewer better options out there for the price and excellence of the education you can obtain at UNC. This college was my first choice, and I have been blessed to be able to attend it, because it is now my only choice. Excellent school, excellent, environment, and an excellent education. Five stars all around. (and let's not forget UNC Basketball!) Tips for prospective students You application should reflect YOU in the purest form. Be honest, and be yourself. UNC is a place that prides itself on diversity, so there is nothing too 'weird' for any of us! Take the time to revise and think through your",
