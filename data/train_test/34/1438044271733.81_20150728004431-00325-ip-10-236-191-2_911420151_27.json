It's big enough to have exceptional, experienced faculty, but small enough that I am more than just a number. Through my experiences so far, I have seen students of ALL ages/backgrounds/situations, and the faculty will go out of their way to help each and every one!!!, 146645=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Tips for prospective students Keep in touch with your advisor, join a campus clubs such as CAB or theatre, and be prepared do some typing. Bang for the buck With relatively large dorm rooms this place is comfortable. Some art students are even allowed to attend the Art Institute their junior year. The Campus Activities Board always keeps events lined up and if that's not enough for you, the college is located in Pittsburgh, so there's tons of stuff to do off campus as well including free admission to Phipps Conservatory and the Carnegie Museums of Art and History. Am enjoying being here Although it seems like the elevator is always breaking, this campus is wonderful. It is a small campus, and flowers bloom around every corner. Everyone is friendly and the whole campus has a peaceful feeling. The Campus Activities Board always has activities lined up for students. Am learning a lot The professors are all knowledgable and take pride in their jobs. They help the students who ask, and care about their success. Login to rate or flag the reviews Anonymous",
