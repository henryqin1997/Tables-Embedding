A sample known to contain only KCl and NaCl and weighing 0.4263 g is dissolved in water and treated to an excess of AgNO3, using standard methods of precipitation. The AgCl precipitate is caught on a Gooch Crucible of original dry weight of 15.2748 g. The AgCl precipitate is dried at 150oC, cooled and the crucible and precipitate are found to weigh 16.2872 g. Determine the %KCl and the %NaCl in this sample., 21650=Example 3-1: A 0.3427 g sample of bronze-age jewelry is analyzed for silver content by first dissolving it in concentrated nitric acid and precipitating it as AgCl. The precipitate is transferred to a dry sintered glass filter weighing 12.2347 g where it is separated from the filtrate and washed with dilute nitric acid. The filter and precipitate are dried at 150oC, cooled, weighed and found to weigh 12.4373 g. Calculate the %Ag in the jewelry.}",

    "textBeforeTable": "Here is a table of common reagents useful for the preparation of ions often needed for precipitation processes. http://155.135.31.26/oliver/demos/prechomo/prechomo.htm See the demonstration of this effect at The model we use to explain why this happens also uses the concept of relative supersaturation. The initial nucleation of sparingly soluble particles offers a surface template which favors \"locking\" onto ions in the vicinity which by the luck of the draw (and the kinetic molecular theory) find themselves at the right energy and orientation to enter the crystal lattice. Ions isolated from a growing crystal are not favored to enter this process because at least two are required, both at the right energy and orientation to start the growth of a new crystal. If the concentration of one ion of a sparingly soluble salt increases gradually by slow homogeneous synthesis in a solution, then as its concentration reaches the threshold of supersaturation for the ion pair, a relatively small number of nucleated particles grows to larger size (because the probability of finding a place in an existing crystal lattice for any single ion is greater than that of a spontaneous creation a new crystal from dissolved and randomly arranged ions) rather than a large number of nucleated particles growing in constant competition with the rest and thus remaining small. The result for the latter is a non-filterable precipitate, but one in the former which filters quite well.",
