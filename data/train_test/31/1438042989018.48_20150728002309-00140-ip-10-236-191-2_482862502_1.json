This book is told from Julian's perspective on his interactions with his classmate, Auggie. Auggie was born with major facial deformities, attracting stares wherever he goes. Julian finds himself making fun of Auggie's predicament, and leaves him harassing notes in his locker. Once his behavior is caught, Julian realizes the impact of his actions and attempts to remedy the situation. An excellent example of learning from one's mistakes and realizing no one is perfect. A great companion read to \"Wonder\" and continues on the theme not to judge people on face value. Good for 4th grade and up. ...more",

Emery is fasc Local Seattle authors Elisheba Johnson and Dr. Charles Johnson have done a wonderful job with character Emery Jones, Boy Science Wonder. Emery is fascinated with science and technology. He surprises his teachers and classmates with his smarts and knowledge. Emery devises a time machine that actually works, but he accidentally sends a classmate back to the Jurassic age. Emery and his friend Gwen have to figure out how to save him from the dinosaurs and other child eating creatures. Their wits and brains save the day and Emery is rewarded for his good deeds. Emery is a strong character, not intimidated by bullies. He gets mercilessly teased about his intelligence, but stands up for what he believes in. He's got solid role models in his life, and is keenly aware that his education is key to his success in life. The cartoon illustrations are quirky and add a fun whimsy to the story. Highly recommend for 3-5th graders. ...more",

His dream Carlos Duarte is really good at make-up. He's fashionable, knowledgeable and has a lot of experience with making his friends look fabulous. His dream job opens at a local department store. He really wants to work the make-up counter at FeatureFace. But how do you get a job without the right experience? You make it up! But having skills doesn't make Carlos popular. He deals with bullies, both at school and in his personal life, including his sister's boyfriend. Being different doesn't hold him back, and he's determined to stay true to himself and follow his dreams. I heard about this book at a recent conference session on GBLT issues. Good timing for pride month. An easy, enjoyable read for teens. ...more",
            "review True story, mostly. I like the disclaimer at the beginning (no repeat of James Frey's saga). David Fitzpatrick had a pretty normal childhood, friends, True story, mostly. I like the disclaimer at the beginning (no repeat of James Frey's saga). David Fitzpatrick had a pretty normal childhood, friends, siblings, bullies, girlfriends. However, when he went to college, things started to get dark. He found himself in a vicious cycle of depression and he turned to self mutilation. As the years progressed, his mental illness intensified, as did his cutting behaviors. Determined to harm himself, and unable to stop, David began seeing a psychiatrist, and eventually ended up at a mental hospital. He's unable to cut himself deep enough to release some of the inner darkness that plagues him daily. His grotesque behavior is shocking and filthy to healthy people, but to him, his routines have symbolism and meaning. David spends most of his 20s and 30s institutionalized. He has some brief stints in half-way houses, until he relapses, and finds himself a professional in the mental health circuit. This book is written well, but took me a while to get sucked in. The beginning seems vague and disoriented, most likely David's own experiences when he was in college. He does a good job of explaining the reasoning behind cutting and self-mutilation, while not validating or encouraging the behavior. It's disturbing and dark, but important to know about, and know that people do get better, and that there is help available. ...more",
            "review Before Jeffrey Dahmer went on his killing spree, he went to high school. And Derf Backderf was his classmate and ocassional friend. Dahmer was awkward Before Jeffrey Dahmer went on his killing spree, he went to high school. And Derf Backderf was his classmate and ocassional friend. Dahmer was awkward, an outcast, and had problems socializing with his peers. He drank heavily throughout high school, most likely to avoid the dark thoughts that were overtaking his behavior. This is a dark, grisly graphic novel, but well executed. Backderf's illustrations paint a unique and somber look into Dahmer's high school career. From his parents unhappy marriage, to his bizarre behavior at school, lots of warning signs were present, but no one took action. Shortly after Dahmer's graduation, he commited his first murder. A tragic story of a mentally unstable man, with no one reaching out to help. Highly recommend. ...more",

He spent most of his Auggie was born with major facial deformities. His eyes are lower than they should be, and his ears don't look like normal ears. He spent most of his childhood going through plastic surgery to try to look \"normal.\" But, most people still struggle to look at him without shock and amazement. His mom has homeschooled Auggie for years, but his dad decides its time for him to attend public school. Auggie doesn't know what to think, and is terrified of how his classmates will react to him and his face. This is a unique book, focusing on how we teach each other, based solely on appearances. Alternating chapters give points of view from Auggie, his sister, his friends and various classmates. He struggles with his appearance, and the effect it has on those around him. But Auggie is a loveable, likeable kid, with a unique personality. There are great examples of the impact of bullying. I think the author is targeting an adult readership too, since there are lots of references to dated celebrities, i.e. Mr. T. This can be a great teaching book about kindness, for all ages, but definitely good for 4th-8th grades. ...more",

Her dad is the manager, her mom helps with waitressing, and older Harry's is the name of the restaurant that Fern's family has been running for years. Her dad is the manager, her mom helps with waitressing, and older siblings Sara and Holden help out when needed. Fern's younger brother, Charlie, is too young to work, but he's constantly entertaining the family with his humor and innocence. Fern's tired of being overlooked by her family members, and blends into the background at school. She spends lots of time with her guy friend, Ran, although it's never been anything romantic. Holden is slowly coming out of the closet, and in the process, he's enduring taunting and bullying from classmates. Something devastating happens to Fern's family, and they must bond together as a family to stay strong. Knowles writing is clear and focused. A clean read for tweens, probably more girl appeal. ...more",

He\u2019s a pretty Russel feels like the only gay student at his high school. Well, he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s gay, but he\u2019s never dated or kissed a guy before. He\u2019s a pretty average guy, has friends, gets good grades, and has a decent social life. But if anyone knew he was gay, he knows his reputation would be ruined. So he keeps this secret to himself, and even goes on dates with girls to avoid questions about his sexuality. One night Russel goes online in a chat room, and discovers he\u2019s not the only gay student at his school. Turns out that Kevin, the star baseball player, is also in the closet, and Russel learns that other gay students feel just as isolated as he does. How can they hang out together and talk about these issues without being discovered? Start an after-school club that sounds so boring and lame that no one would ever want to join. That is how the Geography Club got founded. Meeting after school, the group members learn about each other, and start to realize how important it is to be true to yourself and be honest with your friends. This is a great GBLT novel about discovering yourself, appropriate for 8th grade and up. Brent Hartinger is the keynote at WLA this year, so I am proud of myself for reading one of his books before the CAYAS breakfast. \uf04a ...more",
            "review Published in conjunction with the \"It Gets Better Project,\" this collection of essays gives hope to those who have struggled with bullying, intimidati Published in conjunction with the \"It Gets Better Project,\" this collection of essays gives hope to those who have struggled with bullying, intimidation, and loneliness in high school. Dan Savage was inspired to ignite the \"It Gets Better\" YouTube campaign, after a number of high school students commited suicide after enduring relentless taunting and bullying. A number of these students were LBGT and felt isolated in their homophobic and judgemental communities. Savage encouraged adult survivors of bullying to submit videos encouraging young people not to commit suicide, with the premise that \"it gets better.\" Included are essays by our President Barack Obama, Ellen DeGeneres, Hilary Clinton, Suze Orman, and Al Franken. Other testimonials include an assortment of LBGT adults ranging from actors, dancers, military veterans, doctors, activists and parents. They all survived high school, and have created happy, fulfilling lives with strong support systems. While the book isn't as emotionally charged as the videos, it is an excellent resource for any struggling LBGT youth or family member. Highly recommended for public and school libraries, especially those in conservative communities. ...more",
