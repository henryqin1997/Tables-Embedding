No. 5,327,511, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein. Other suitable polarization controllers are described in, for example, F. Heismann and M. Whalen, \"Broadband Reset-Free Automatic Polarization Controller,\" Electronics Letters, Vol. 27, No. 4, pp. 377-379, February, 1991; F. Heismann et al., \"Polarization-Independent Photonic Switching System Using Fast Automatic Polarization Controllers,\" IEEE Phot. Tech. Letters, Vol. 5, No. 11, pp. 1341-1343, November, 1993; F.

Wolfe and R. A. Lieberman, \"Fiber Optic Magnetic Field Sensor Based on Domain Wall Motion in Garnet Film Waveguides,\" Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 58, No. 16, pp. 1733-1735, April, 1991, all of which are incorporated by reference herein., 25443=In lightwave communication systems which utilize optical fiber as a transmission medium, polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) often presents a significant obstacle to achieving higher data rates and/or longer repeaterless transmission distances. PMD refers generally to variations in the delay time of an optical signal through the medium as a function of .signal polarization, which can cause randomly varying pulse width distortion in the received signal. PMD arises in optical fiber because a fiber core is usually not perfectly symmetric, and therefore the propagation speed of a signal at one polarization, such as an s-polarization, may be different than the propagation at another polarization, such as a p-polarization. In a single-mode fiber, at each signal wavelength there generally exists a pair of orthogonal input polarization states, referred to as the principle states of polarization (PSPs) in the fiber, for which the corresponding states of polarization at the output of the fiber are orthogonal and independent of wavelength to first order. See, for example, C. D. Poole and R. E. Wagner, \"Phenomenological Approach to Polarization Dispersion in Long Single-Mode Fibres,\" Electronics Letters, Vol. 22, pp. 1029-1030, September, 1986, which is incorporated by reference herein. Ignoring wideband frequency-dependent effects such as fiber chromatic dispersion, and to a first-order approximation, an optical signal transmitted through the fiber in either fiber PSP is generally undistorted at the receiver but has a different time delay depending upon the PSP in which it was transmitted. An optical signal with an arbitrary state of polarization (SOP) can be expressed as a sum of signals in each fiber PSP, and when received after transmission through the fiber the signal can therefore be characterized as a combination of two orthogonally-polarized signals with different time delays. Because the fiber PSPs and corresponding time delays typically vary as a function of, for example, temperature and changes in position or other movement of the fiber, the received signal exhibits time-varying distortion. The fact that PMD-induced distortion manifests itself in single-mode fiber is of particular concern because much of the existing or \"embedded\" optical fiber infrastructure throughout the world utilizes this type of fiber., 39137=The polarization controllers 12, 14 align the PSPs of the received optical signal with the polarization axes of a polarization beam splitter (PBS) 16. The transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarization outputs of the PBS 16 will therefore each substantially correspond to one of the PSPs of the received optical signal. The PBS 16 separates the received optical signal into first and second polarization components. The first and second polarization components are supplied to receivers 18, 20, respectively. The receivers 18, 20 generate clock signals CLK1 and CLK2 from the first and second polarization components of the received optical signal, respectively, in a manner well-known in the art. Suitable receivers operating at a data rate of about 10 Gbits/sec are described in, for example, C. D. Chen et al., \"10 Gb/s Prototype System Performance in Field Experiment,\" Fifth Optoelectronics Conference (OEC '94) Technical Digest), Paper 15C1-2, July, 1994; and C. D. Chen et al., \"A Field Demonstration of 10 Gb/s-360 km Transmission Through Embedded Standard (non-DSF) Fiber Cables,\" Optical Fiber Communication (OFC '94) Technical Digest, Paper PD27-1, pp. 124-127, February, 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference. A phase detection circuit 22 measures a phase difference \u0394\u03c6 between the clock signals CLK1 and CLK2. In this embodiment, the phase difference \u0394\u03c6 is maximized by supplying a control signal corresponding to the phase difference to the polarization controllers 12, 14 via line 28. Maximizing the phase difference between CLK1 and CLK2 ensures proper alignment of the first and second polarization components at the PBS output with the PSPs of the received optical signal. As noted previously, the PSPs of the received optical signal generally vary with time. Adjustment of the polarization controllers 12, 14 is designed to maintain maximum phase difference between the polarization components over time, which will generally occur if the polarization components are aligned with the varying PSPs of the received signal. Under these conditions, detected signals S1 and S2 at the output of receivers 18 and 20, respectively, represent undistorted versions of the original modulation waveform but with a phase difference \u0394\u03c6 between them. The phase detection circuit 22 may be a phase detector based on a Gilbert cell active mixer, such as the Model Nos. IAM-81 or IAM-82 available from Avantek and described in Avantek Application Note No. AN-S013. Many other phase detectors are well-known in the art and may be used in circuit 22. Furthermore, in alternative embodiments a phase difference control signal may be generated from detected data signals rather than clock signals, or directly from the polarization components. Suitable means for generating such control signals will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art., 47257=FIGS. 4A and 4B show the rotator element 65 of the polarization controller 14 in more detail. A support 70 includes two grooves 71A and 71B that are substantially collinear and provide alignment trenches for single-mode fiber 15 at the input and output of rotator element 65. The optical signal is collimated by spherical collimating lenses 76, 78 that are suitably arranged in etched depressions 72, 74, respectively. The collimating lenses preferably have a low numerical aperture such that the portions of the optical signal coupled out of rotator element 65 generally do not include those portions, if any, which are subject to excessive scattering. Although beam scattering is primarily reduced by the output collimating lens 78, the embodiment of FIGS. 4A and 4B also includes low numerical aperture lens 76 to couple the optical signal into the rotator element. In one exemplary embodiment, a suitable low numercial aperture lens is one which produces an output beam diameter of about 300 \u03bcm at a signal wavelength of about 1550 nm. The present invention provides improved polarization control in part by providing a Faraday rotator which exhibits reduced sensitivity to scattering of the optical signals passing through it. Other low numerical aperture optical elements could be used as an optical signal coupling means in place of collimating lenses 76, 78. The operation and arrangement of these alternative optical elements will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. The collimated optical signal passes through a stack 80 of Faraday effect crystal material comprised of several distinct active garnet layers 82. The stack 80 rotates the input signal polarization by an angle \u03b8 which is a function of the field B and the total thickness of active garnet material., 28781=Another technique for reducing PMD-induced distortion, described in M. Yoshimura et al., \"Polarization Mode Dispersion Equalization,\" Technical Digest, Fifth Optoelectronics Conference (OEC '94), Paper 14E-12, July, 1994, includes a PMD equalizing circuit which is driven by an error signal. The error signal is generated as the difference between a detected optical signal and a reference waveform derived from the detected signal. This technique uses an equalizing circuit which includes a number of different phase shifters and variable TE/TM converters to provide suitable optical signal adjustments in response to the error signal, and is therefore complicated, expensive to implement and overly sensitive to factors unrelated to PMD-induced distortion including, for example, chromatic dispersion. Other techniques are described in, for example, T. Okoshi et al., \"New Polarization-Control Scheme for Optical Heterodyne Receiver Using Two Faraday Rotators,\" Electronics Letters, Vol. 21, No. 18, pp. 787-788, August, 1985, and F. Heismann et al., \"Automatic Polarization Demultiplexer for Polarization-Multiplexed Transmission Systems,\" Electronics Letters, Vol. 29, No. 22, pp. 1965-1966, October, 1993. These techniques are generally directed to varying input signal polarization such that the detected signal power level in a particular polarization state is maximized. Because factors unrelated to PMD may alter detected signal power level, these and other prior art techniques may be unable to adequately compensate for PMD-induced distortion., 51352=FIG. 5 shows a system 100 suitable for demonstrating the detection of an optical signal in accordance with the present invention. The delays in each of the three primary optical signal paths designated CH1, CH2 and CH3 in system 100 are first equalized with a length of high-PMD fiber 110 removed from the system. The three channels CH1, CH2 and CH3 correspond to a coupled portion of a received optical signal, a first polarization component and a second polarization component, respectively. An optical pulse generator 102 operates in this example at a bit rate of about 10.0 Gbits/sec and provides either a periodic 1010 pattern or a pseudo-random bit sequence of length 223 -1. The pulse generator 102 drives a 10.0 Gbits/sec optical transmitter 106 that operates in this example at a wavelength of about 1552 nanometers. The optical transmitter 106 supplies an input optical signal to a first polarization controller 108 and then to the length of high-PMD single-mode fiber 110. The high-PMD fiber 110 in this example is comprised of two different sections of dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) having average PMD of about 30 and 35 picoseconds, respectively. Polarization controller 108 controls the polarization of the optical signal launched into the high-PMD fiber 110, and may be, for example, a mechanical paddle-type polarization rotator. The output of the high-PMD fiber 110 is the received optical signal. An amplifier 112, which may be an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), amplifies the received optical signal. The amplified signal is monitored through a 10 dB coupler 120 and a variable attenuator 122 on a CH1 monitor 124. A second polarization controller 130 is used to rotate the polarization of the received optical signal before it is applied to a PBS 132. The PBS 132 separates the received optical signal into two orthogonally-polarized polarization components which are applied to CH2 monitor 140 and CH3 monitor 142, respectively. Each of the monitors 124, 140 and 142 includes a detector or regenerator for recovering the 10 Gbits/sec data generated in pulse generator 102. The monitors may also include an oscilloscope or other suitable detected signal display means.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations Although the above description illustrates the utility of the present invention primarily in terms of compensating for PMD-induced distortion in optical signals transmitted over single-mode fiber, it should be understood that the present invention is generally suitable for use with any optical system which includes PMD or would otherwise benefit from polarization diversity detection. Furthermore, the polarization control aspects of the present invention may be utilized in applications other than polarization diversity detection. Many variations may be made in, for example, the transmission medium, the type, number and arrangement of polarization controllers used to adjust optical signal polarization, the Faraday rotator, core, and other elements of a particular polarization controller, the polarization beam splitters and combiners, the signal receivers, the phase detectors, and the type and arrangement of other optical and electrical components in the diversity detection circuits. These and other alternatives and variations in the arrangements shown will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. FIG. 6 illustrates an exemplary system in which variations in optical signal loss through a polarization controller, such as that shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, are compensated using a feedback control circuit. An optical system 200 includes an optical source 205 which provides an optical signal to a polarization controller 210. The source 205 may be, for example, a laser diode. The polarization controller 210 adjusts the polarization of the optical signal in accordance with a control",
