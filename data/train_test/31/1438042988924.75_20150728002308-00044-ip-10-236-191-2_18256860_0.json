            "Analysis",
            "Clemson (5-0, 3-0): It\u2019s almost becoming routine for the Tigers. Clemson\u2019s offense has a big day, and the defense wrecks havoc against opposing quarterbacks. The Tigers had little trouble with Syracuse on Saturday, opening a 21-0 lead in the first quarter and finishing with a 49-14 victory. Quarterback Tajh Boyd was sharp, setting a school record with 455 passing yards, including a 91-yard bomb to receiver Sammy Watkins. The defense held Syracuse to just 74 passing yards and sacked quarterback Terrel Hunt four times. The Tigers have one more tune up before the huge showdown against Florida State on Oct. 19. Next Week: Boston College",
            "Florida State (5-0, 3-0): Total dominance. That\u2019s the easiest way to describe Florida State\u2019s 63-0 win over Maryland. Quarterback Jameis Winston threw for 393 yards and five touchdowns, and the defense pitched their first shutout since Sept. 15, 2012. Florida State\u2019s defense needed a good performance after struggling against Boston College, and the Seminoles allowed just 234 yards to a Maryland offense that entered Week 6 averaging 498.5 yards per game. Florida State now has two weeks to prepare for a showdown against Clemson, which could decide which team wins the ACC Atlantic. Next Week: Bye",
            "Miami (5-0, 1-0): Thanks to a 45-30 win over Georgia Tech on Saturday, the Hurricanes are 5-0 for the first time since 2004. The Hurricanes trailed 17-7 in the first quarter but outscored the Yellow Jackets 38-13 in the final 45 minutes to win 45-30. Despite an injured ankle, quarterback Stephen Morris threw for 324 yards and three scores. Running back Duke Johnson pitched in 184 yards on 22 attempts. Miami\u2019s defense isn\u2019t dominant but has improved this year. Next Week: Bye",
            "Virginia Tech (5-1, 2-0): The product on the field isn\u2019t always flashy this year, but the Hokies are quietly building momentum. Virginia Tech opened its three-game home stand with a solid 27-17 victory over North Carolina on Saturday, improving the Hokies to 2-0 in conference play. Quarterback Logan Thomas threw for 293 yards and three touchdowns against the Tar Heels and most importantly, completed 67.9 percent of his throws. Virginia Tech\u2019s defense forced two turnovers and has held four of its six opponents this year to 17 points or less. Next Week: Pittsburgh",
            "Maryland (4-1, 0-1): After cruising to an easy 4-0 start, the Terrapins failed their first real test of 2013. Maryland was outmanned on both sides of the ball against Florida State, and things didn\u2019t get any better on offense when quarterback C.J. Brown suffered a concussion in the first half. The Terrapins are without their top two cornerbacks, and the secondary was torched for 431 yards by the Seminoles. Maryland is clearly improving, but the gap between Florida State and Clemson and the rest of the Atlantic is still significant. Next Week: Virginia",
            "Georgia Tech (3-2, 2-2): The Yellow Jackets had a chance to climb back into the Coastal title picture in Miami, but after a 17-7 lead, few things went Georgia Tech\u2019s way. The Yellow Jackets went without a score from the start of the second quarter to 10:38 in the fourth quarter, lost three turnovers and completed 6 of 19 throws for 66 yards. Georgia Tech\u2019s defense \u2013 which was reliable through the first four games \u2013 allowed Miami to average 10.4 yards per play. It\u2019s only October, but the Yellow Jackets will need a lot of help to get back into the top spot in the Coastal. Next Week: at BYU",
            "Pittsburgh (3-1, 2-1): The Panthers had a bye in Week 6 and return to action at Virginia Tech. Pittsburgh has a three-game winning streak and should have some confidence going into Blacksburg, as the Panthers defeated the Hokies 35-17 last year. Quarterback Tom Savage suffered from concussion-like symptoms in the 14-3 win over Virginia, but all signs point to the senior returning to the lineup against Virginia Tech. Next Week: at Virginia Tech",
            "Boston College (3-2, 1-1): Anything after No. 7 in the power rankings is up for grabs. We give a slight nod to the Eagles for the No. 8 spot, as Boston College surpassed its win total from 2012 with a 48-27 victory over Army on Saturday. Running back Andre Williams gashed the Black Knights for 263 yards and five touchdowns, and quarterback Chase Rettig was efficient (11 of 13, 203 yards). The Eagles had their hands full on defense with Army\u2019s option attack in the first half, but held the Black Knights to just one score in the second half. It may not seem like a huge win in the overall scope of the ACC, but beating Army was critical for Boston College\u2019s bowl hopes. Next Week: at Clemson",
            "NC State (3-2, 0-2): After Boston College, any team in Athlon\u2019s ACC power rankings could be ranked anywhere in the 9-14 range. The Wolfpack\u2019s struggles in Winston-Salem continued on Saturday, as Wake Forest upset NC State 28-13. NC State has lost six consecutive games on the Demon Deacons\u2019 home turf. While the Wolfpack are 0-2 in ACC play, good news could be coming in the form of quarterback Brandon Mitchell. The senior has not played since the season opener due to a foot injury, but is expected to have a chance to return this Saturday. Next Week: Syracuse",
            "North Carolina (1-4, 0-2): A 27-17 defeat to Virginia Tech dropped North Carolina to 1-4 and easily the ACC\u2019s most-disappointing team after Week 6. Quarterback Bryn Renner was sidelined with an ankle injury, but Marquise Williams filled in admirably, completing 23 of 35 throws for 277 yards and two scores. Williams was also the Tar Heels\u2019 leading rusher (56 yards). North Carolina\u2019s struggling defense forced eight punts against Virginia Tech but created no turnovers and gave up 15.4 yards per completion. Next Week: Bye",
            "Virginia (2-3, 0-1): The Cavaliers finally showed some signs of life on offense, but four turnovers and 13 penalties was simply too much to overcome against opportunistic and upset-minded Ball State. Quarterback David Watford completed 21 of 36 passes for 209 yards, and running back Kevin Parks recorded 104 yards and two scores on 16 attempts. Although Virginia\u2019s offense didn\u2019t have a perfect outing, the defense also shares blame by allowing Ball State to record 506 yards \u2013 including 346 through the air. The Cavaliers have played a challenging schedule so far, and it won\u2019t get any easier the rest of the way. Next Week: at Maryland",
            "Wake Forest (3-3, 1-2): The biggest surprise in the ACC from Week 6 took place in Winston-Salem. After struggling to generate anything on offense through five games, Wake Forest recorded 28 points and 382 yards to beat NC State 28-13. The Demon Deacons have defeated the Wolfpack six consecutive times at home, and at least for a week, have quieted some of the critics for coach Jim Grobe. The win gives Wake Forest a little momentum heading into the bye week and manageable games against Syracuse and Duke gives this team a chance to make a run at bowl eligibility. Next Week: Bye",
            "Duke (3-2, 0-2): The Blue Devils had a bye in Week 6 and are slated to return to action against Navy on Saturday. Quarterback Anthony Boone missed the last three games due to a collarbone injury but resumed throwing prior to Duke\u2019s 38-31 win over Troy. It\u2019s uncertain if Boone will return in Week 7, but the junior is getting close, and Brandon Connette is a capable fill-in until he\u2019s ready. Next Week: Navy",
            "Syracuse (2-4, 0-2): The Orange drew a tough assignment in their ACC opener, losing 49-14 to Clemson. After showing signs of life on offense against Wagner and Tulane, Syracuse generated only 74 passing yards, and starting quarterback Terrel Hunt tossed three picks. The Orange had concerns about their secondary entering this game, and Clemson quarterback Tajh Boyd had little trouble finding open receivers, finishing with 455 yards and five scores. Syracuse has time to rebound with seven ACC games remaining. However, four out of the next five contests are on the road. Next Week: at NC State"
