    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes It should be noted that the foregoing structure and procedure may be subject to various modifications and enhancements to further enhance the utility of the circuitry in detecting various types of defects. For example, similar test circuitry may be incorporated for selectively testing driver circuitry for defects such as shorts to high voltage bias lines or other supplies in a multi-level driver. Similarly, the circuitry may be employed various devices other than digital detectors to test for shorts and other defects. Such devices might include any application wherein rows, columns, lines, or similar series of circuits are driven, such as solid state displays, thermal facsimile machines, and so forth. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the circuitry described above may be implemented along with driver circuitry in an economical and compact manner, with the test circuitry itself occupying only minimal real estate in the overall design. Moreover, the test circuitry, permitting verification of each row driver individually in a very straightforward process, includes a minimal number of small individual components for the tasks performed. Through the test sequence, row test circuits add very little to the cost of the row drivers, with minimal likelihood of test circuitry-induced failures. It should also be appreciated that the circuits discussed in FIGS. 5 and 7 may be used in conduction to provide a means of testing for shorts between rows, shorts between rows and",
