            "Sarasota is mostly old people, so not a lot of crime here, from what I saw.",
            "This college is best for the 3D Animation, Illustration types. They boast about their alumni's work in films with Pixar, and the recent Oscar winner animated short film, yet little from any other majors.",
            "They have a place called The Cove, sounds cool, right?",
            "If you feel this is the school for you, go for it. However, they're not as generous as other schools - they only offer one scholarship to one person in each major. Meaning out of all the Graphic & Interactive Communication acceptees, only one actually gets a merit aid scholarship. Prepare to take out some loans, unless you can afford it, of course.",
            "There is nothing here - this is Sarasota. Besides the beach, most of it is just art museums and a lot of old people. Its not a bustling city, its a resort town for retirees really and tourists looking to spend a quiet Spring Break. Don't expect a lot to be happening, I visited and I was bored out of my mind after a day or two. The beach can only be fun for so long.",
            "In my acceptance package, Ringling gave me a guide to Sarasota with all the best dining places, shopping, etc. They have a lot of nice cafes in Sarasota, but very expensive. They have a Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, so can't complain there.",
            "I didn't visit the dorms, but from what I've read, seem nice.",
            "It is one of the top art schools in the U.S., so you must expect to be challenged, especially during freshman year with the foundation courses. They want to weed out those who simply can't keep up with the demands of an artistic environment.",
            "As all art schools do, they love still life and figure sketches to be put into your portfolio. However, I got accepted into the Graphic & Interactive Communication department and a majority of my portfolio was graphics. While they do like still lives, try to put things that are more with the major you're going to pursue.",
            "It is a good school with state of the art technology. The professors are educated and very friendly, and so are the students. However, the location is uninspiring for an art school."

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck This school definitely has some of the highest quality technology for every major, great food and facilities, an extensive library, LEED certified buildings, and highly qualified staff. The one downside to all of this is that all of the money you spend to go to this wonderful school is used to improve the technology and facilities for future students, but little financial aid is provided. However, for prospective artists (ESPECIALLY Computer Animation majors) the name of this school on your resume will get you further than nearly any other art school in the United States. Well-known creative companies such as Pixar, Disney, Blizzard Entertainment, Dreamworks, Hallmark, and even the CIA come to Ringling to hire graduates straight out of college, with the likelihood of a pretty hefty paycheck, because they know and expect that Ringling College students are the best of the best. Am enjoying being here The atmosphere at this school is great! There's the warm and sunny Florida atmosphere most months of the year, the gorgeous campus, and most of all the diverse and creative student body. The beach is not far away at all, Downtown Sarasota is beautiful, and the cultured city of Tampa is only 45 minutes away. The student body is very small, and everyone seems to know each other. If people don't know you,",
