            "For the most part, campus is very safe. As long as you walk in pairs late at night, you should be just fine. I have personally never felt threatened or worried walking home from the library late at night. There are only a few instances of petty crime.",
            "Greek life is HUGE. Even if you're not in a fraternity/sorority, their presence can be felt. Nevertheless, there are plenty of people who did not go Greek that have great social lives. You certainly don't need to go Greek to be involved (I didn't).",
            "There are hundreds and hundreds of club, organizations, sports, ensembles, and activities. It's very easy to get involved and meet people with similar interests. There are plenty of professional clubs and organizations, as well as less serious ones. Cornell is known for its lacrosse, crew, hockey, and (occasionally) basketball teams. The Glee Club is well-known, too.",
            "To succeed at Cornell, you have to be self-motivated. You have to be willing to go the extra mile to set yourself apart from the pack; everyone at Cornell is naturally bright. Some students spend their days cooped up in the library or their room, but the most successful students get involved, both on campus and in the community.",
            "Dragon Day is a competition between the architecture students and the engineering students (the architects always win). The architects build a dragon and the engineers build a phoenix. There's a parade across campus that attracts people from Ithaca as well. Slope Day is held on the last day of classes. It's a massive, campus-wide celebration that features a concert on one of the big hills (hence slope). This past year, Taio Cruz and Neon Trees performed. It's a crazy, awesome day.",
            "Tuition is steep, especially if you don't qualify for financial aid. (By the way, Cornell has fantastic financial aid). That being said, Cornell has an extensive- and active- alumni network. Not only that, a Cornell degree looks good; it's an Ivy League school.",
            "There's always something to do on the weekend. You can hang out with friends in your dorm or apartment or rage at a bar or fraternity party. There's a little something for everyone. You don't need to drink to have a social life, but alcohol is quite prevalent. Drugs are popular in certain groups, but if you're not interested in that, you won't encounter it. Explore Ithaca! There are tons of trails and waterfalls to see when it's warm outside, and the town itself is fun to explore when you have the time. Just be warned, the mall is awful.",
            "The food on campus is amazing; it's been voted some of the best in the country. The best all-you-can-eat dining halls are on West Campus. There's a wide variety of food on campus to choose from. Off-campus food is great as well. Collegetown has many good restaurants, and Ithaca is full of high-quality cuisine. Collegetown Bagels is very popular. There's a great (and affordable) Mexican restaurant called Viva Taqueria in the Commons. Vegetarians like myself will have no time staying well-fed with or without a meal plan.",
            "The quality of freshmen dorms varies. I was in what is considered one of the worst dorms (the Low Rises), but I had a great time and made tons of great friends on my floor. Housing is rather pricy, and laundry is not free. Upperclassen housing is very nice, but also varies. Most upperclassmen live off-campus in Collegetown.",
            "If you don't work hard, you're not going to do well. Most of your intro classes will be based on a curve, so you have to push yourself to be above the median. Everyone is naturally smart, so don't expect to skate by like you might have in high school. In my opinion, the academic rigor is what makes Cornell so great. You're surrounded by brilliant people-students and professors- that will inspire you and motivate you.",
            "If you're looking for a school that will be academically challenging while still being able to have a good time, Cornell is the place to be. Cornellians work very hard, but play just as hard on the weekends. If you want the quintessential college experience, you can find it here. You can take classes across every academic discipline and make friends from a vast variety of backgrounds.",
            "My favorite thing about Cornell is the people; you'll meet passionate students and professors in your discipline as well as people with very different backgrounds and interests. Cornell will challenge you, no doubt, but you'll have a lot of fun, too. If you're willing to work hard and get involved, you'll enjoy your time here."

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{9825=The administration doesn't exactly fend of the sense that it extorts its students. It often delivers financial aid packages late, and fails to make provisions taken for granted at many college institutions, such as a free gym membership, free printing, or unrestricted internet use. This year 2000 students' social security numbers were stolen on an unencrypted administrative computer in the school's CIT dept. Despite these gaffes and the exorbitant prices, Cornell's prestige as a university and it's extensive alumni and research networks make up for these pitfalls by providing many unique opportunities to its students., 443437=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 200793=Classes are tough, but I found them very manageable if you are willing to put in the time and effort. Because it's a really big undergrad population (about 14,000) a lot of classes are taught by TAs, especially 1000 and 2000 level courses, so a lot of the time the rigor/enjoyability of classes depends on the competence of your TA., 125892=There are SO many things! There's the Ithaca commons, over 1000 clubs, hiking, gorge jumping, nature walks, and so much more. Cornell also makes a point to put on numerous events to keep the students preoccupied and busy in their free time!, 123911=There are over 1000 clubs on campus, ranging from professional and activist clubs, cultural clubs, to learning how to play instruments or watching certain tv shows with one another., 238829=There are over 1000 student organizations on campus, and although I am sure you've heard this many times already, there really are clubs for every interest! At ClubFest you will find hundreds of tables set up with people trying to get you to sign their email lists, and if you have even the slightest interest, I suggest signing up. The worst that will happen is that you will receive many emails from tons of clubs, but it may be worth it when one email catches your eye! Many of these clubs hold activities like skating at Lynah Rink or potlucks., 230116=For fun, there is always something to do on campus except during study period and finals week. If you join a club or two and keep your eyes open for flyers finding something to do will be easy. Word of mouth always works too. As far as off-campus goes, Ithaca is one of those towns that would not exist if not for the universities that reside there, but there are a couple things you can do. In October, the city hosts a weekend-long apple festival where many local vendors come out to showcase many edible goodies for sale such as apple cider, funnel cake, caramel apples, and much more. The apple cider donuts are to die for. In February, you can warm up to Ithaca's Chili Festival. There are also tons of restaurants in Collegetown and the Commons that serve a diverse cuisine (this is how I first tried Indian food). If this isn't enough for you, there is a list of 161 things Every Cornellian Should do. If you start running out of stuff to do, refer to this list. http://cornellsun.com/blog/2005/02/27/big-red-ambition-161-things-every-cornellian-should-do/, 238311=Greek life is very dominant on campus, and there are a large number of diverse houses. Sororities and fraternities are always holding fundraisers or formals. Rush week in January is said to be an unforgettable experience!, 357509=Visit during the months of January or February so you can get a feel for the weather. It's definitely not for everyone. Have an open mind and explore as many new clubs and classes as you can the first year. Don't be afraid to take chances., 228476=1) Cornell has a small lake between North and Central Campus along with many gorges and rivers. 2) There is also a botanical garden and arboretum that is part of the campus that is very beautiful during the spring and summer. 3) The biggest celebration at Cornell is called Slope Day where everyone gathers on Libe Slope after the last day of classes for a massive concert with guests such as Ludacris, Kendrick Lamar and many more. Not to mention great food., 755=Be prepared for the winter weather, it doesn't stop snowing until April. Make friends with an upperclassman- they give the best advice and can provide answers for the best way of doing something (workload assigned by professors, how to store things, best bus to take to the mall)., 73709=Psych 1101 is amazing, regardless of your major., 294928=Great school academically with a beautiful campus and great opportunities, but it is EXTREMELY cold. Visited in September and it was already freezing., 2512=There are so many diverse classes that are just waiting to be taken including: PLPA 2010 Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds, HADM 4430 Introduction to Wines (must be 21 or older to take), and HD 3620 Human Bonding (for those trying to figure out the opposite sex). There are a lot of opportunities to learn whatever you want, you just have to find the right people.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot With the exorbitant amount of majors offered, it is extremely easy to find your niche at Cornell. As an engineer, I was worried about immediately being funneled into classes filled to the brim with only math and science majors and engineers. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offer all classes to all students. Therefore, if you come into Cornell with some AP or IB credits, it opens up a world of options from culinary classes with the Hotelies to MatLab with the engineers.

Keeping up with classes and clubs on a regular basis minimizes the stress of crunch times throughout the semester. Cornell is also the place to be for determined opportunists ready to take advantage of the many resources",
