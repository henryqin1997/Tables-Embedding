Farin et al.: Technology of Argon Plasma Coagulation with Particular Regard to Endoscopic Applications; Endoscopic Surgery and Allied Technologies, No. 1, Vol. 2, February 1994, 71-77). As a result heat is introduced to the tissue, both endogenously by the HF current and exogenously by the higher temperature of the plasma relative to the tissue, so that the temperature of the tissue rises. Depending on the temperature various thermal effects are caused in the tissue, which can be used by surgeons for various therapeutic purposes such as blood coagulation or hemostasis and/or the thermal devitalization or destruction of pathological tissues (K. E. Grund et al.: Argon Plasma Coagulation in Flexible Endoscopy, Endoscopic Surgery and Allied Technologies, No. 1, Vol. 2, February 1994, 42-46).}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citations de brevets In the manufacture of the probe, the metal tube connected to the current conductor is pushed into the tubular probe, the probe is clamped and the slitlike outflow opening is made by sawing through the wall of the probe and the metal tube. Thereafter the probe is completed by closing the end. In this way the material of the metal tube ends flush with the plastic material in the outflow opening, so that here, again, no direct touching of the tissue can take place and the uniformity of the distance from the electrode to the opening is ensured. In another embodiment of the invention, not shown here, a small metal tube is set into the interior of the tubular probe. This serves on one hand as electrode and on the other, it brings about a cooling. For this purpose the metal tube has a low thermal resistance and is made sufficiently long that the heat generated in the region of the electrode and the slit is carried away by the gas flowing through the metal tube, far enough that the temperature does not reach a level damaging to the plastic material. In the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 7 no probe is shown but rather an instrument 30 for open surgery. The outflow opening 10 is here situated in a funnel shaped end piece held by a handle 5. Here, again, the outflow",
