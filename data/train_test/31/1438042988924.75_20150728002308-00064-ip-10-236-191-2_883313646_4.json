He debuted the lead single, \"One of Those Nights,\" at the CMA Awards on November 1, 2012. Other new songs will include, \"Nashville Without You,\" and \"Mexicoma.\", 5318=With total album sales exceeding 40 million units in the United States and 11 consecutive albums that debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album charts, it may have been foolish to think anything or anyone could derail the career of one of country's hottest stars. But a contract dispute between Tim McGraw and his former label, Curb Records, put the brakes on the release of his 11th studio album, \"Emotional Traffic,\" until 2012, though it was completed in late 2010., 6552=McGraw performed in support of his album on the \"Two Lanes of Freedom Tour,\" with the trek unofficially wrapped in late July with shows in Canada, New York and Virginia.

After that, McGraw and his wife, Faith Hill, will return to the Venetian in Las Vegas in limited encore performances of their joint stage show \"Soul2Soul.\" It returns to the Strip beginning October 25-26 and includes 10 select weekends through April 2014., 4055=The most recent of McGraw and Hill's three tours together ended in 2007. McGraw is coming off the Brothers of the Sun tour with Kenny Chesney. Their stadium dates ended with back-to-back concerts at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mass.

It debuted at No. 2 on the charts by selling 108,000 copies, and spawned smash hits \"Truck Yeah,\" \"One of Those Nights\" and \"Highway Don't Care,\" featuring Taylor Swift and Keith Urban.
