            "SU is known for their Business and Creative Writing programs, but I've heard wonderful things about their other programs as well. Anyone looking for a small, close-knit school would feel very at-home here.",
            "Watch your Flex money. Most new students run out of it three weeks before the end of the semester, if not sooner. Ask the cashier on your way out of Benny's or Clyde's so you can keep tabs on it. Be prepared to work hard, but have fun at the same time. The Student Activities Committee plans several bus trips to NYC and Washington, D.C. for a small bus fee throughout the year, and hosts free concerts and comedians as well (Spring 2009 consisted of comedian Josh Blue, and two concerts, Ryan Star and David Cook, and Fabolous)",
            "As with most schools, the education you pay for is the education you get. However, when it comes to extracurricular activities and meals, there are some areas I think could use some clarification. Not all meals are entirely covered in your meal plan. The Evert Dining Room in Deg is considered a meal, but in Clyde's or Benny's Bistro, some of your meal may be taken out of your Flex money (the additional money you get for meals, which is around $200 depending on your meal plan).",
            "The people and surroundings that make up the Susquehanna University campus are what make it such a great place. The school size is approximately 2,000 students. With such a small school, students get to know each other well. There's always something going on, whether at Charlie's Coffeehouse in the Degenstein Campus Center, in the dorm, at the on-campus club Trax, or on Market Street in Selinsgrove which is approximately a half-mile away.",
            "The faculty at SU is wonderful. Everyone wants you to succeed. If going to class and taking notes aren't enough, professors are more than willing to take time out of their schedules to sit down with you to discuss the material until you truly understand (that is, so long as you actually show up for class!). Professors won't give you the answers flat-out, but will work with you until you understand on your own. The student-to-faculty ratio is about 13-1, so professors really get to know you. Though it may not seem like it at times, professors do have your best interests at heart and you do learn a lot."

In March of 2010, Susquehanna University opened its New Science Building (see here: http://www.susqu.edu/26110.asp) for classes. This $32 million complex was designed specifically for biology, chemistry, and earth and environmental science classes, complete with all new laboratories and a roof-top greenhouse. Susquehanna University\u2019s New Science Building has earned silver-level LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. In short - if you're looking for science like I was, Susquehanna is the place for you!, 141821=We have some fun traditions like playing our rival school, Juniata College, for an actual goal post that they stole from us in 1952. We battle it out each year in football to see who will get the goal post back and it's became such a fun game! We also have a joke about the numerous squirrels running around on campus, they're so much fun!, 187905=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 37104=The Thursday before Thanksgiving, the professors serve a big Thanksgiving dinner for the students. Also, there is a Candlelight Service in December, which is a really beautiful service with many great hymns., 53223=Join sports! With the school taking off the off-campus housing for the 2014-2015 year there will be almost NOTHING to do on the weekends so hopefully if would change., 846=Watch your Flex money. Most new students run out of it three weeks before the end of the semester, if not sooner. Ask the cashier on your way out of Benny's or Clyde's so you can keep tabs on it. Be prepared to work hard, but have fun at the same time.

An annual tradition since 1981, the faculty serves the student body at a formal dinner, acknowledging that we help make the school what it is. Another nice tradition is the welcome incoming students receive at the Opening Convocation. It helps you to realize that you will travel full circle in your 4 years at Susquehanna.}",

If science and music are your two greatest interests, there is no better place than Susquehanna. If business and accounting are what you're after, then the Sigmund Weis School of Business will do an excellent job preparing you for whatever future you intend. Although I am not personally familiar with any of the other departments, Susquehanna is great for anyone who wishes to succeed after high school. Tips for prospective students If you are looking to attend Susquehanna, please do not be discouraged by the price tag. As I mentioned before, the Financial Aid Office is more than willing to work with you. They will help you in every way they can - trust me! Another piece of advice: before you decide that SU is",
