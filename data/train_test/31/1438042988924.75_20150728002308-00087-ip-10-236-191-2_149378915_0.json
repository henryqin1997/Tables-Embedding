It just came down to making pitches when you need to, and time and time again, I couldn't do that. Unfortunately, that got me a high pitch count and I was behind in the count. I had to give into some pretty good hitters and they made me pay.\" Beckett labored, giving up back-to-back homers to Jorge Posada and Curtis Granderson in the second, and then surrendering three runs in the fourth. He was gone after 4 2/3 innings, having walked three and struck out just one. For the first few innings, it looked like it would be a one-sided matchup, with Sabathia taking all the accolades. As it turns out, neither one of them factored in the decision of a game in which each side drilled 12 hits and the Red Sox reeled off a 9-7 win. Then again, the Red Sox and Yankees have a habit of doing the unexpected, and on Sunday night, that consisted of both Beckett and Sabathia turning in subpar performances.

    "textAfterTable": "But the biggest price Beckett paid was having a 5-1 deficit to a pitcher of Sabathia's caliber. Early on, the lefty had performed as advertised, allowing just one hit over the first four innings. What happened? The Red Sox were persistent. They got one back in the fifth and three more in the sixth to tie it. \"I was behind a lot today,\" said Sabathia. \"I had good stuff early. I just started nibbling a little too much. I had a lead and I should have just thrown it over the plate and said, 'Here it is, hit it' -- instead of trying to pitch a little too much. It hurt me. I normally don't do that, especially with a lead. It was just one of those kinds of days today where I lost focus.\" And nobody was more grateful than Beckett, who seemed all but sure to be headed toward a loss. \"It's awesome,\" Beckett said. \"They definitely picked me up today. That was definitely nice to see. Obviously, any time you make a start and it doesn't go the way you [planned, you] want the team to still win the game. It just kind of speaks to the character of a lot of guys on this team.\" CC only so-so early on",
