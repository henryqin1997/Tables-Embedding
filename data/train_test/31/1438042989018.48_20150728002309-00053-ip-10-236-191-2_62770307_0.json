Deerfield continues to have one of the premier prep school football programs in New England. We have a varsity and junior varsity team, totaling approximately 70 players. Both teams play an eight game schedule, and since we are seriously committed to developing a strong program, coaches use identical concepts in all aspects of the game. This allows players to move between teams, if and when the need arises.
