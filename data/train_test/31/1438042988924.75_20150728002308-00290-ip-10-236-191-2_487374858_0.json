    "textAfterTable": "More About The Little Mermaid In September 2007 the Walt Disney Corporation opened a theatre production of the show, setting a trial run in Denver, Colorado. For the entire six-week running period, the seats were completely sold out. After a few minor adjustments following the tryout, the production was ready for Broadway. The doors opened in November of 2007 for previews of Disney's The Little Mermaid Broadway performance, with the actual production starting in January of the following year. The stage performance consists of two acts, roughly following the basic storyline of the original movie. The story speaks of a forbidden love between the mermaid Princess Ariel and the human Prince Eric, as well as the hardships of growing up as Ariel and her father, King Triton- who distrusts and despises humans- come to terms with each other over their differences. Together the three learn to accept one another and defeat the wicked sea-witch Ursula, who is intent on stealing Triton's throne. The Little Mermaid shows will forever remain a classic and a well-loved tale. The Broadway production is a magical experience for the child at heart, as many can agree. Tickets to The Little Mermaid can be bought at our site to see this wonderful performance. Purchase your tickets for The Little Mermaid now from GreatTickets.
