They are one of the true symbols of our independence and freedom. But the mustangs that once roamed free throughout the West are disappearing at an alarming rate. The very survival of these majestic creatures is at stake as they are rounded up, put into holding pens, and often sold for slaughter. Madeleine Pickens is striving to create awareness of the situation and she's come up with a plan... Mustang Monument. This wild horse eco-sanctuary will provide a permanent home for some of these horses, and a place for the public to experience the beauty and history of the American West. In this episode, we meet with Madeleine in her Dallas home, where she talks about the importance of preserving our wildlife, natural resources, and heritage. Her passion and patriotism are truly inspiring. More from this Series Season 2,\u00a0Episode 5 of 13 Madeleine Pickens (Animal Advocate) Episode of Inspiration With Lance Heft",
