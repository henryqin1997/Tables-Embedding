    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{20802=A wide variety of stents have been proposed for use in various applications. Intravascular stents and coronary stents such as the Palmaz-Schatz stent illustrated in Palmaz, have been used to treat occlusions of blood vessels. A commonly suggested material for making stents is pseudoelastic and/or shape memory alloys such as Nitinol. For example, Sugita, Catheter, U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,890 (Nov. 13, 1990) proposes use of a shape memory alloy for an intravascular stent, and shows a device for percutaneous delivery of the stent to an occluded stenotic region of a blood vessel. Harada, et al, Method of Implanting a Stent Within a Tubular Organ of a Living Body and of removing Same, U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,427 (Aug. 4, 1991) proposes use of a two-way shape memory alloy stent in a blood vessel. Two-way shape memory is useful in a stent, according to Harada, to allow removal of the stent. As explained in Harada, it is not possible to remove a one-way shape memory stent after implantation. Harada proposes use of two-way shape memory stent with a hot, large diameter shape which holds a blood vessel open and a cold, small diameter shape which can be moved within the vessel and removed. Harada also discloses a device for percutaneous placement of the stent. Dotter, Transluminally Placed Expandable Graft Prosthesis, U.S. Pat. No. 4,503,569 shows the use of shape memory alloy stent proposed for use in blood vessels. Each of these references use saline solution injected through a catheter to control the temperature of the stent, thereby controlling the shape of the stent., 18201=Devices for heating the prostate are illustrated, for example, in Edwards, et al., Medical Probe Device and Method, U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,490 (Nov. 22, 1994), which shows a device for application of RF or microwave energy into the prostate while protecting the prostatic urethra from damage during the treatment. Hyperthermia treatment, as the term is generally used, is accomplished in the temperature range of 40-60\ufffd C. Thermotherapy, as the term is generally used, is accomplished by heating the prostate above 60\ufffd C. Both heat treatments have been beneficially used in the treatment of prostate enlargement., 15083=This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/629,650 filed Apr. 9, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,179., 17142=Prostate enlargement can be treated with heat treatments such as hyperthermia or thermotherapy, cold treatment (hypothermia or cryotherapy), and ablation. It has long been known that heating a swollen prostate gland can lead to a decrease in swelling and eventual relief from the condition. Heat treatment denaturizes the proteins in the prostate tissue, like a slow cooking of the tissues. The biological effects of heat treatment and the appropriate thermal dosage are discussed in more detail in articles such as Terai, et al., Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy For Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, International Journal of Urology 24 (March 1995) and Pow-Sang, et al., Thermocoagulation Effect Of Diode Laser Radiation In The Human Prostate, 45 Urology 790 (May 1995), but it is sufficient for the purposes of this disclosure to understand that application of heat at sufficiently high temperature for sufficient lengths of time to destroy some or all cells in a portion of the prostate gland eventually produces a therapeutic effect.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations While the preferred embodiments of the devices and methods have been described, they are merely illustrative of the principles of the invention. Other embodiments and configurations may be devised without departing from the spirit of the inventions and the scope of the appended claims. While the inventions have been described in the environment of urology, the application of the inventive concepts in other areas of heat therapy and temporary stent application will be beneficial. It is specifically contemplated that the materials employed in the illustrated embodiments be improved upon, that methods and patterns of irradiation and heating of the stent be improved upon, and that the time tables for therapy discussed above be improved upon, and that all such improvements fall within the scope of the claims. These characteristics may be employed in the stent as follows. The stent is preferably made with an upward transition temperature (either Tas or Taf) slightly above body temperature. The stent is also made with a downward transition temperature (either Tms or Tmf) below body temperature. The stent is trained using known techniques to memorize the high temperature shape illustrated above. Thus, once heated to cause the high temperature state with its memorized shape, the stent will remain in that shape at body temperature, and will hold the prostatic urethra open indefinitely. When it is desired to move the stent, cooling the stent with cold saline flow to a temperature",
