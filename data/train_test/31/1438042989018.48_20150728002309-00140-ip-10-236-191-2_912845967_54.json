            "The caf right now doesn't always have the highest quality food. However, Belmont is currently building a new Dining Hall which is said to be completed in 2015. There are plenty of other good on campus and close to on campus eating options as well.",
            "The freshman dorms are amazing. The older ones have a great sense of community and the newer dorms are top of the line. You can either have suite style or community style bathrooms, people tend to like both! Big rooms too!",
            "Depending on your year or course of study, some classes will be harder than others, which is to be expected. What makes up for the harder classes are the great teachers and small class sizes. You get a lot of one on one time with the teacher and they truly want you to succeed.",

            "Belmont is great for musicians and music lovers alike! There is so much to get involved with on campus and Nashville is so diverse with a multitude of things to do. The campus is stunning and the class sizes are perfect for a focused college environment."

Thankfully, you can't usually hear it in your dorm room., 366995=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 338315=Depending on your situation, the most accessible source of food is the cafeteria and though it may not be the best at times, it is the best choice due to your meal plan than spending seven to ten dollars eating out. For the year 2014-2015 there will be a new dining hall and other food places being opened to the students which expands the variety of food offered to them., 129606=the dorm life is strict but fair. the students have a curfew of 11:00 pm or weekdays and 1:00 am on weekends. the opposite sex has to sign in at the front desk to go to the other persons room. this system is very safe and allows the students to get their school work done but also have a good time at school., 39947=Even though the newer dorms are certainly nicer, the older dorms are the best place to be. Everyone bonds so quickly through the events hosted by Residence Life. I live in a dorm built in 1960, and all of the people who live in the new dorms come to hang out in our dorm because there's always something to do!, 201399=You need to realize that tuition goes up between $1000 and $2000 each year. Be prepared. Your professors are great sources of help and wisdom - use them!, 239665=The caf right now doesn't always have the highest quality food.

They hold eight different sororities and fraternities. All of which get to participate in Greek Week come March}",

During basketball season, there are so many chances to go show your school spirit and support for the student athletes! There are also a plethora of interesting convocation events scheduled throughout the year- from personal development events dealing with sex and religion to culture and arts events with African drum demonstrations to community service events that allow student to get involved with the community surrounding Belmont! I love Belmont! I have made some great connections within the few months that I have been here! With the large amount of music and music business majors, there are some many opportunities to start a professional career! I have already sang back-up for an artist here on campus for one of their performances. I have recently started working with this producer, and I have a recording session coming up! I am also involved with organizations that are helping me develop a wide array of skills! I do 60 hours of volunteer service every semester, and it is awesome! I also work with Am learning a lot Coming from a public high school background makes Belmont a wealth of knowledge to me.
