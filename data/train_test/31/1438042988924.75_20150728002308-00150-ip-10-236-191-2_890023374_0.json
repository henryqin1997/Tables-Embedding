The song list includes most of the available chart hits by the group, the major omission being the 1999 Top Ten R&B/Top 20 pop hit \"Take Me There\" from the film The Rugrats Movie, credited to Blackstreet and Mya featuring Ma$e and Blinky Blink. Although the soundtrack album was on Blackstreet's then-label, Interscope, and the song appears on the group's third album, Finally, it is not included here, presumably due to some licensing conflict. Also missing, if more understandably, is Blackstreet's featured appearance on Janet Jackson's number one R&B hit \"I Get Lonely,\" issued on Virgin Records. Otherwise, all of the group's biggest hits are featured, among them, of course, the platinum-selling title cut, \"Don't Leave Me,\" and \"Before I Let You Go.\" There are also album tracks such as Blackstreet's ballad treatment of the Beatles' \"Can't Buy Me Love\" and a couple of hard to find items: the non-album B-side of \"No Diggity,\" a revival of Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean\" that mixes in plenty of \"No Diggity,\" and \"Coming Home to You\" from the soundtrack to the Spike Lee film Get on the Bus. The compilers have included much more from the group's first two albums, Blackstreet and Another Level, than from the less successful third, Finally, and that's a reasonable decision. The collection is not perfect, but it gives a good sense of Blackstreet's music of the 1990s., 135291=\u00a9 2014 Apple Inc. Todos os direitos reservados.}",
