            "Despite common misconception, the campus at UC is incredibly safe. There are emergency phones located everywhere across campus and the university has it's own police department.

The student recreation center also has a variety of classes offered to students such as hip hop hustle, belly dancing, spinning, boxing, and even rock wall climbing. UC also hold a spring concert every year for students that headline artists such as Juicy J, T-Pain, Kendrick Lamar, Big Boi and many others., 760319=Rated the #1 best value in 2013 for a reason!, 860040=Although Cincinnati has a reputation for being dangerous, that is not the case on campus. I've always felt completely safe on campus, even at night. The UCPD has done an excellent job of keeping an eye out, but students have to be smart too. You shouldn't go wandering about on Jefferson by yourself carrying all of your valuables at 3:00 in the morning. Be smart, and stay on campus when in doubt, and you will be very safe!, 801796=When I went to the campus I was able to tour the entire campus and dorm. Which I chose to live in when I arrive in the fall of 2014. an unusual location on campus to me was how the dorms are right by the class building their not set apart. So making a choice of living is easy for the students., 510164=The greek Life is about 1000 to 2500 students so about 5%-8% of the total student population and the greek houses are right next to campus., 368939=There's things to do in there area. Be smart around the neighborhood. Don't wander around drunk at 3:00 in the morning., 735=Use office hours, study groups, learning communities, and learning center hours to your advantage. There are tons of resources at your disposal when you are a student at UC. Apply early -- even if you're not sure, because applying before December guarantees you a $2000/year scholarship. Go on a campus visit, but also wonder around campus on your own (during the school day) and try to drop in a couple classes (discreetly of course)., 42600=I am currently a college freshman at the University of Cincinnati for the 2010-2011 school year. At UC, I am studying interior design in the School of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning, also known as DAAP. The interior design program is ranked nationally as the best interior design school in the United States. As a result, I am learning leaps and bounds of new information and new techniques in this program. I am learning to think outside the box, to solve different kinds of problems, and to develop my creativity to a whole new level., 173368=I'm born and raised a UC Bearcat fan so I know I'll enjoy being here. Everyone is so energetic and so passionate about everything they're involved in. It's been my dream to march with the UC marching band., 575608=There is the nearly naked mile run every October. The football field is very unusual because it is one of the only fields in the nation that is totally accessible during the day and night to any student at any time because it sits directly in the heart of campus. You can use the stadium at anytime., 896511=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 243809=try your best to get your applications in before december so you are eligible for more of the scholarship opportunities that aren't available later in the registration process.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Am learning a lot There are a lot of good teachers, but be warned about TAs. They are part of major classes and teach once a week. There knowledge varies heavily, but there are some who do know their topic well. the recitation (one with a TA) is a class where you should ask questions if you don't understand. To make it less intimidating think of it as asking a friend who happened to take the class before you. As for the lectures themselves with your professor, I've had a lot of good professors. If you don't manage to get something out of your professor during lecture, there are office hours where you can talk to the teacher, and there's half a dozen centers where graduates and upper classmen can help you.
