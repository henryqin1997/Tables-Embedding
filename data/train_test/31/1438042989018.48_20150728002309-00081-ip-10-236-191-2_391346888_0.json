Party, have been closely following events in Washington. There is a clear disconnect between our politicians and reality. Our government has been spending, in ever increasing numbers, money which it does not have. The congress and the senate have not submitted an agreed upon budget in many years. Senator Reid has just announced that he will not submit a budget this year as well., 25716=The Cynthiana Democrat | circulation@cynthianademocrat.com | 859-234-1035 P.O.
