This gives\u00a0analytically-minded\u00a0\u00a0fans like you the chance to see one stat that is \u201ceasy-to-digest\u201d as opposed to reading a long line of the 10-15 most commonly used statistics. \u00a0I wrote this article in hopes of providing a weekly \u201cleaderboard\u201d of SPv and to also give my opinions and some notes about how they (starting pitchers) have done of late.\u00a0 Here are your season-to-date SPv leaders (as of \u00a0August 12th). Enjoy!, 40431=Now back to our example. Tim Lincecum\u2019s SPv has declined dramatically compared to his 2009 season. Here are the results (drum roll please):, 13778=Posted on 16 August 2012 by Dylan Cain, 38717=Using this formula, we can determine that Lincecum scored a 62.5 in 2009 but has scored just a 35 this year.\u00a0 This year\u2019s score is nowhere near \u201cFreakish\u201d., 55727=The next group of players are those with a RAWs of 199 down to 170 and includes the two best fantasy baseball players in 2011., 29682=16) A.J. Burnett (74.81%)- I would\u2019ve expected the Pirate\u2019s righty to be higher on this list, with 14 wins and a new beginning in Pittsburgh, however, he is not.\u00a0 Like many of the pitchers ranked above him, he doesn\u2019t possess a high number of K\u2019s.\u00a0 Through 21 starts, he already has the most wins in his career since 2008 in Toronto.\u00a0 Not only does he have a career low WHIP (with 21+ games started), but he has a one-hitter under his belt., 38292=\u201cThe Freak\u201d had an ERA of 2.48 and a WHIP of 1.047 in 2009.\u00a0 His score on the \u201cbase runners/earned runs\u201d chart is a 76.\u00a0 This year, so far, he\u2019s had an ERA of 5.72 and a WHIP of 1.487.\u00a0 That scores only a 42., 35317=Posted on 25 July 2012 by Dylan Cain, 39020=In this portion, we examine how many batters a pitcher strikes out to how many batters he walks.\u00a0 We know Timmy is a king when it comes to strikeouts, so this should be the section of SPv where he dominates.\u00a0 In 2009, Lincecum struck out 10.4 batters per 9 (innings pitched) and walked only 2.7 batters per 9.\u00a0 This performance gave him a score of 90.833.\u00a0 This season, he\u2019s obviously done worse in both of these categories, compiling a score of 83.35. Now that we have crunched all the numbers necessary, let\u2019s put them all together and see what SPv tells us., 49009=Standard 5\u00d75 scoring leagues (BA/R/HR/RBI/SB) don\u2019t use walks in any of their scoring calculations but the idea of a high RAWs score seems to relate to a valuable fantasy baseball asset. Only six players topped a RAWs score of over 200 in 2011 and all six players were ranked within the top 16 of ESPN\u2019s Player Rater (batters only)., 19531=5) Justin Verlander (78.62%)- Finally on the list, Verlander comes in at fourth place in the junior circuit, quite surprising for the Detroit Tigers ace. In my opinion, he is the most overrated pitcher in baseball.\u00a0 Sure, he has a blazing fastball. Sure, his ERA is under two and a half.\u00a0 But, he has been inconsistent at moments and is on pace to have the most losses in his career since 2008.\u00a0 I will give him credit, however, because he tends to dominate one of my favorite statistics (WHIP)., 37861=So I will give you an example.\u00a0 How about Tim Lincecum\u00a0of the San Francisco Giants?\u00a0 He has struggled and lost his Cy Young Award winning form (until recently). Let\u2019s compare how he performed in 2009 to how he\u2019s performed in 2012., 44341=Posted on 14 February 2012 by Daniel Aubain, 22439=9) Madison Bumgarner (76.4%)- When looking at the ERA leaders, you could easily think his fellow teammate Ryan Vogelsong has the edge. However, Bumgarner has a higher SPv for a couple of reasons.\u00a0 One, he strikes out more batters and walks less, as opposed to Vogelsong.\u00a0 And secondly, Bumgarner has a better WHIP.\u00a0 Walks plus Hits divided by Innings Pitched is a crucial statistic in the makeup of SPv.\u00a0 The first round pick in the 2007 draft is off to a good start in his career and he makes a good #2 behind Matt Cain., 23507=10) Kyle Lohse (76.27%)- I was very surprised when I realized Lohse had made the Top 10. When we look at his stats, he has the second most wins on the St. Louis Cardinals staff (12, just behind Lance Lynn\u2018s 13) against only has 2 losses.\u00a0 He hasn\u2019t had much popularity since 2008 when he had 15 wins but the baseball community should know that Kyle still has his stuff.\u00a0 His WHIP and ERA are at career bests and along with Jake Westbrook and Lance Lynn, they are filling the hole left by the\u00a0Chris Carpenter\u00a0injury quite nicely., 66929=Of the 97 players with a RAWs of 100+, exactly one had the same number of Runs and Walks during the 2011 season. Kevin Youkilis had 68 Runs and 68 Walks for the only \u201cperfect score\u201d of 1.0 in the group. Twelve players in this group had more Walks than Runs, which takes their dRAW into the negative (less than 1.0). Here\u2019s a look at that group:}",

I\u2019ve got all the makings of a great, new, fake statistic but what about the data? What results do the formulas produce and what hypothesis can we draw these numbers? Well, I guess I should give you access to the file with the data (OpenOffice spreadsheet; PDF) I used for dRAW and RAWs. This list includes all players with a RAWs total (Runs plus Walks) equal to or greater than 100. Ninety-seven players made the cut; from a high of 237 for Jose Bautista to a low of 100 for Eric Hosmer. So let\u2019s review some of the points up until now that could make a fake statistic go mainstream. The name of the statistic(s) should be easy to say. CHECK! It should be easy to calculate. Easy division and easy addition. CHECK! And I guess the data should be readily available. CHECK! \u201cThat\u2019s gold, Jerry. Gold!\u201d So now that we have the data we need, Runs and Walks, what are the formulas used to calculate the values of these new, fake statistics? Simple. Firstly, dRAW is calculated",
