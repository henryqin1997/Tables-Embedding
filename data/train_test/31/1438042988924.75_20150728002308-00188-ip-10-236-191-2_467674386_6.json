No. 620,647, filed June 14, 1984, on Miniature Monolithic Multilayer Capacitor and Apparatus and Method of Making, discloses methods and apparatus for making miniature electrical capacitors. The process involves vapor deposition in a deep vacuum environment, and one material that is deposited is a resin in monomer form that, when deposited and cured, forms the dielectric layers of a monolithic capacitor structure.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations The basic structure represented by the tip portion 31, vibration device 32 and electronics 39 can be found in standard laboratory equipment such as ultrasonic emulsifying devices and this utilization of relatively standard components makes the atomizer structure economical to manufacture and maintain. It has been found that a material like titanium alloy 6AL4V is suitable for the tip portion 31. The diameter of the passage 37 is dependent upon the flow rate of the liquid being conveyed through the line 11, and diameters of 20 mils to 1/8\" have been found suitable. The lengths of the coupling 43 and tip portion 31 correspond to one-half wavelength of the vibration, and the device 32 is operated at their fundamental frequency mode with maximum amplitude of motion at the surface 36 and minimum movement, or node positions, at the attachment points of the coupling 43 and tip portion 31. Accordingly, end surface 36 will be located at approximately one-quarter wavelength from a nodal position and the length of structure 15 will correspond to one wavelength of the vibration imparted by device 32. To protect the vibration device 32 from heat, the structure 15 includes a cooling coupling 43 interposed between and rigidly connected to the tip portion 31 and the vibration device 32. Cooling water is directed through a passage in the coupling 43 using lines 44. The coupling 43 and the cooling water absorb and remove",
