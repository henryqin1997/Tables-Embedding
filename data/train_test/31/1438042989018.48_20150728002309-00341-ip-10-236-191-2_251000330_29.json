L. 89\u2013670, 80 Stat. 931) by Executive Order No. 11340, March 30, 1967 (32 F.R. 5443). The word \u201cconsider\u201d is substituted for \u201cdetermine\u201d for consistency., 432436=Pub.

Those laws include the source provisions restated in chapter 31 of the revised title and 45:4, 5, 6 (in carrying out 45:4 and 5), 11, 12, 13 (proviso), 13 (less proviso in carrying out 45:11, 12, and 13 (proviso)), and 61\u201364b, and 49:26(a)\u2013(f) (words before last semicolon) and (h). The administrative powers of the Secretary under the chapter are based on the administrative powers of 49:1655(f)(2). That provision lists administrative powers the Commission had under the Interstate Commerce Act (ch. 104, 24 Stat. 379) to carry out the Act, and certain other laws authorized the Commission to use its powers under the Act to carry out those other laws. The administrative powers listed in 49:1655(f)(2) and codified in the chapter therefore apply only to a law listed in 49:1655(e) that was a part of the Interstate Commerce Act or to which the powers of the Commission under the Act were applied. The text of 45:61\u201364b is included because section 4 of the Act of March 4, 1907 (ch. 2939, 34 Stat. 1417), stated, \u201cIt shall be the duty of the Interstate Commerce Commission to execute and enforce the provisions of this Act, and all powers granted to the Interstate Commerce Commission are hereby extended to it in the execution of this Act\u201d. The transfer to the Secretary was executed on March 31, 1967. The Act of March 4, 1907, was restated by the Act of December 26, 1969 (Pub. L. 91\u2013169, 83 Stat. 463); section 4 was not included in the restatement. However, repeal by implication is not favored and the transfer was completed on March 31, 1967. Therefore, the text of 45:61\u201364b is included within the scope of the chapter. The text of 49:304(a)(3) (last sentence 1st\u20137th words) and (3a) (last sentence 1st\u20135th words) is omitted as executed., 1074753=(Added Pub.
