            "People who want to get an okay education or transfer into a four-year school, but don't have a lot of money. It's not particularly stressful, either.",
            "The textbooks are really expensive and in most of my classes, not needed. You should check if you're definitely going to use them in your class, especially software classes (the buyback on software textbooks is about 5 dollars).",
            "Compared to other colleges, it's pretty cheap and it's a good stepping stone to transfer into a four-year college.",
            "All the teachers are very friendly and helpful, and prepared to help people one-on-one. The class sizes are also perfect: not crowded at all, but not so small that it gets awkward. About 20 students per class.",
            "I'm in the Multimedia Graphic Design program here. I've had past experience with many of the programs required in the course, but I'm still learning new things about many of them. However, classes in my course don't seem to have everything sorted out: one teacher will assume you've learned something in another class, when that other teacher has completely glossed over it. While I am getting some good education, I feel like I wouldn't be completely prepared in graphic design after getting my degree here."

I love PPCC because of the degree plan I had set up and the staff. The staff members there try to work with you and help as much as they can, also the class sizes are perfect not to big and not to small., 268265=Will start classes August 2013 but so far has been great, 1742=The tuition of Pikes Peak is a decent price and financial aid really helps too.

Clubs and Activities there are limited numbers of clubs and activities at pikes peak. Great for these types of students students who want one-on-one help from the teacher and great interaction between fellow students. Bang for the buck with in-state tuition at less than $3500, earning a two year degree cannot be cheaper. What to do for fun find a study group. this is a great way to meet new people and get help outside the classroom. Food and Dining",
