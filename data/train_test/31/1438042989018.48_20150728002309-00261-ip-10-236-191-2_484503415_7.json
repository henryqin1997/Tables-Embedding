    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{6642=Referring now to FIG. 7, the power supply circuits 58 are depicted in greater detail. The battery may be used to drive a voltage regulator U6, which outputs a +3.3 DC volt power supply rail. The regulator in this embodiment is an integrated circuit chip, Part No. LP2985 which may be obtained from National Semiconductor, of Santa Clara, Calif. Another voltage regulator chip U5 is used to provide a +5 volt rail from a +12 volt power supply voltage, which is another LP2985 regulator device (also available from National Semiconductor). FIG. 7 also depicts a boost switching regulator, which uses a +12 volt DC input power supply voltage and a switching regulator chip U7, which is an integrated circuit chip, Part No. LM2586 device, and also is available from National Semiconductor. Such voltage regulator chips are available from other semiconductor manufacturers as well. The boost regulator is generally designated by the reference numeral 28, which is referred to in the earlier figures as the high voltage power supply. The output voltage is located at the node indicated by the reference numeral 39, and this represents an electrical conductor that carries the high voltage to the electrode 38 that charges the benefit composition in the reservoir 26, or at the nozzle 24. FIG. 7 also shows a solid state relay U9 that directly provides current for the high voltage power supply rail (i.e., conductor 39) from the battery voltage.}",

Another type of motion sensor that may be used in the present invention uses a light source to direct (infrared) light at a surface, and the relative motion of that surface can be detected by the intensity and/or frequency of the returning light. Such sensors can measure the actual speed of rotation, if that information is desired.}",
    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention. All documents cited in the Detailed Description of the Invention are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention. . FIG. 5 As noted above, one type of pump 30 that can be used in the present invention is a peristaltic pump, including for use in an electrostatic spraying application. Another preferred type of pump 30 usable in the present invention is an ultrasonic piezo pump, which has the advantage of having no major moving parts. While certain membranes or laminations (or other types of layers) may vibrate in a reciprocating-type fashion, the piezo pumps do not have major moving parts that can wear out, such as rotating shafts and bearings used with a rotary member to displace a liquid or gaseous fluid. Also, reciprocating pumps require major moving parts that can also wear, and thus require some type of bearings or bushings",
