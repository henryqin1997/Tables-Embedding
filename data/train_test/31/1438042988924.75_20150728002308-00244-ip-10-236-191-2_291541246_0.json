    "textBeforeTable": "Track Listing This bespectacled blue-eyed soul wunderkind with the wavy blond mop has taken the music world by storm, and he\u2019s only 24 and barely signed. You wouldn\u2019t guess that such a raw, bluesy soul voice would come out of a kid who looks like this, but give him a spin and you\u2019ll be hooked. His newest features Raphael Saadiq\u2019s rhythm section and the Tower of Power horns, and it\u2019s a seriously funky southern-soul workout, dominated by Stone\u2019s striking vocals, which bear comparison to Stevie Wonder, Chris Robinson or Jamie Lidell. Songs of love and inspiration from a magnetic performer. Amoeba Review SHIPS FREE in U.S. $12.98 BUY Allen Stone Allen Stone (CD) Tweet Allen Stone (CD) Home View More",
