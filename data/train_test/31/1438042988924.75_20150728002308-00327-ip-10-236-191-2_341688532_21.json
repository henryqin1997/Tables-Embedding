    "textBeforeTable": "Voodoo Extreme. GameTap Blog announces a large number of games will be removed from their library of free offerings as of Thursday, at which time one of their paid \"Gold\" memberships will be required for continued access. Their reasoning is this: \"As many of you know, over the past year or so we\u2019ve released well over one hundred games for free, in order to entice people to sample what GameTap has to offer and, hopefully, subscribe to our service. This strategy has worked incredibly well for us, and now we\u2019re ready to move on.\" This leads to a pitch to subscribe, but they offer the following outlook for penny-pinchers: \"If you can\u2019t afford that, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve still got quite a few games for you to try out. Not only are we keeping over 40 games around for you, we\u2019ll also continue to entice you with weekly samplers - full, free games you can play for one week only. Going into the future, these games include Sid Meier\u2019s Pirates!, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, X-Com: UFO Defense, and many more we have not yet announced. You can guarantee that a lot of the games we\u2019re removing will make brief appearances in the future!\" Thanks The [Jan 19, 2009, 12:28 pm ET] - Share - Viewing Comments GameTap Free Game Cutbacks",
