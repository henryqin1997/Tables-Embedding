            "People who love to be social and aren't afraid of making new friends are going to blossom here. Dorming your first year is the best way to meet new people. People who are coming internationally will also love SCSU. We have a large population of international students and have made a lot of accommodations for them to still feel at home.",
            "Know what you are getting into before you come. Make sure you look into your majors of interest before you apply. SCSU offers tours and Saturdays @ State events. These are a great way to figure out if SCSU fits you and your families needs. You can also take a drive around town to see what the City of St. Cloud has to offer. There are many Churches and restaurants for your convenience.",
            "There is so much to do here and with all that SCSU has to offer with the wide variety of culture and activities, that I can't believe I am paying under $10, 000 a year to go here. They have great programs that at any other college, you would be paying over $20, 000 a semester to attend. If you dorm and have a meal plan, you'll be getting the most of your college education because you never have to leave campus!",
            "I enjoy living close to campus, as well as living in the dorms last year. SCSU has concerts and speakers come from all over the world for our entertainment and different interests. Last year Plain White Tee's, Ne-Yo, and Snow Patrol came. Not to mention all the student organized activities. There are talent shows, visual arts performances, and a lot of other activities right on campus. The city isn't too bad either. Crossroads Mall isn't but a 5 minute drive away, and the grocery stores are even closer. St. Cloud Metro (bus system) runs 7 days a week and stops right in front of our Miller Center Library (on campus). So you can go to and from anywhere very easily. Did I mention the SCSU Hockey team? Those games are a blast to go to as well.",
            "SCSU has a lot to offer. They have a great Nursing program, they are highly recognized for their Education programs (Special Ed., Sports Ed., etc.), and the Business programs are some of the best in the nation. I love that all my teachers aren't locals. SCSU makes sure that you learn as much as you can about new things before you apply to your major. The General Education classes are very interesting and you have a bunch to chose from."

There is a few different options but when I attended school there 2007-2009 I wasn't impressed with the options. There is also a Subway and Dominos but I personally don't like either.

There are students from all over the world, many different backgrounds, and perspectives on life. I guarantee you will find someone just like you. Tips for prospective students SCSU is known for it's partying, and there is a lot of that going on at campus but stay focused and remember that you are in college to get an education for your future. You have the rest of your life to party so don't waste the money on tuition if you're not going to try. Bang for the buck The education is exactly what I would expect for what I pay. The price is very reasonable compared to other campus' around the area. All in all, you get what you work for. So if you want",
