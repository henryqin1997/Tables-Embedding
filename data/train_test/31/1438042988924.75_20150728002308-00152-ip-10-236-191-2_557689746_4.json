He died in 2001 after a typically brave battle against cancer., 1031=At 6'5\" tall and weighing more than 16 stone, the Scotland second row was an obvious cornerstone of the Lions pack across three tours during the 1970s. But there was much more to his game than mere beef in the tight. In 1971, coach Carwyn James described him as the ideal all-round lock and, in South Africa three years later, he scored eight tries in 12 matches, a record for his position.}",
