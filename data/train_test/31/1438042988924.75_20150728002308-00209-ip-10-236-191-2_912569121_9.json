            "Notre Dame is great for students who are serious about their studies and willing to work hard.",
            "Take advantage of the program Notre Dame offers in which prospective students visit campus and stay with a student in the dorms overnight. It's the best way to understand what it's really like to be a student at Notre Dame and to see if it's a good fit for you! If you cannot participate in this program, I recommend at least taking a tour. But be careful--you're sure to fall in love with Notre Dame as soon as you set foot on our campus!",
            "I must admit that Notre Dame is expensive, but you really do get what you pay for.",
            "I love being at Notre Dame. The aspect of Notre Dame that I personally enjoy most is the Catholic atmosphere. I love going to Mass in the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, especially during Holy Week. Another part of Notre Dame that I particularly enjoy is the dorm life: the unique and tight-knit communities formed in each dorm, the awesome dorm events, and the high level of dorm pride are special at Notre Dame. I love that Notre Dame has single-sex dorms, and that each dorm is paired with a sister or brother dorm. Visiting other colleges, I simply did not see what Notre Dame has. I say these things particularly in regards to my own dorm, Pasquerilla West, which I love! As a dorm, we volunteer together at the South Bend Shelter for the Homeless, pray together in Lent through a reading group, compete (and win!) in intramural sports together, and participate in our signature event, Queen Week. In the dorm, older students are paired with freshmen, who become their little sisters, and we also have regular meetings for freshmen to come talk to older students about academics so they can be better equipped to choose a major. This is only a small fraction of the events in P.W., but it gives you a taste of what dorm life is like! Moreover, I love walking across our beautiful campus. In the fall, there is nothing like the leaves changing to red and yellow as the campus is packed with crowds excited to see the football games. In winter, I love seeing the Golden Dome outlined sharply against a blue-gray sky and the snow clinging to the pine trees. Spring is the most beautiful (in my opinion), with bright yellow daffodils, sweet-smelling lilacs, and the swans on the lakes.",
            "Part of Notre Dame's mission is to educate the mind and heart. I am learning a lot academically from our many wonderful professors, many of whom are renowned experts in their fields. For example, my professor for a course in Hebrew Scriptures actually worked with the Dead Sea Scrolls, translating and publishing them, for many years. In addition, my time at Notre Dame has truly helped to educate my heart and to grow in my spiritual life. Because of so many opportunities for community service (through the Center for Social Concerns and through the dorms), deepening in faith (through Campus Ministry, other religious groups, and many opportunities for Mass and the sacrament of reconciliation), and experiencing true friendship, it is an excellent environment in which to acquire virtue. In other words, Notre Dame students' minds are educated in the classroom, and their hearts are educated through invaluable experiences outside the classroom. Notre Dame provides students with the opportunity to receive a well-rounded education."

Being Catholic doesn't hurt, considering the school's Catholic values and reputation effuses through everything at Notre Dame. Tips for prospective students APPLY EARLY--I applied early action and it was great to know in *December* that I had gotten in. Waiting until March or April is not fun, as I learned with other college applications. Bang for the buck Considering the about $50,000/year price tag (and the low financial aid for anyone who has parents who make over $100,000 annually), I can't make myself giving five out of five stars here. HOWEVER, when you graduate you are practically *guaranteed* great connections from the ND family that will get you where you want, whether it's a job, graduate school, volunteering, or",
