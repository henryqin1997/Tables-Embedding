            "Check to make sure there are no telephones off the hook. Unplug all telephone equipment on that phone line for 5 to 10 minutes and then plug in a single hardwired phone. If you are able to restore dial tone temporarily, call 611 for assistance. If you are not able to restore dial tone, use a different phone; or contact us.",
            "Check the volume and ringer controls on your phone to make sure the settings are correct. If the problem persists, call 611.",
            "If your phone is giving only one short ring, you may have Call Forwarding activated on your line. To disable call forwarding dial *73.",
            "Try plugging another telephone into the jack to verify that the problem is not the telephone itself. Check all connections to make sure that all telephones are securely plugged in. If you continue to experience problems with the jack, call 611 for assistance.",
            "If you are unable to clear the stutter tone by retrieving your messages, try adding commas in front of the phone number you are dialing. Commas tell the equipment to delay before dialing. Try adding 6 to 8 commas to delay the equipment until the stutter dial tone for voice mail goes away.",
            "Not necessarily because cable outages can occur for a variety of reasons that may not affect the telephone service. Cox's Network Operations Center constantly monitors the network for potential problems, quickly identifies interruptions in service, and remedies the problem. Cox provides back-up power for a small fee. For more information, contact us at 855-324-7700 or visit any Cox Retail Store to order a battery for your telephone modem."

Issue Resolution I have Anonymous Call Rejection enabled, but I am still receiving out-of-area and unavailable calls. Anonymous Call Rejection does not block unknown or out-of-area callers. This feature only blocks callers that have Caller ID blocking. I cannot dial 900 numbers. If you are having a problem dialing a 900 / 976 number, call 611 for assistance. I cannot block 800 or 888 calls. Use Selective Call Rejection (*60) to block most numbers, including 800 numbers. Note: Selective Call Rejection does not currently work with the SBV5222 Motorola modem. Contact us to find out more. I'm having problems dialing an international number. When dialing an International number, it is not necessary to start your dialing with a \"1\" as it is replaced by the \"011\" code. I cannot use some of my phone features. I hear a fast busy signal. If you hear a fast busy signal when you try using a feature, this sound means that you do not subscribe to the feature. Contact us to add the feature to your telephone services. I cannot dial out. When I try, I hear beeps and clicks.",
