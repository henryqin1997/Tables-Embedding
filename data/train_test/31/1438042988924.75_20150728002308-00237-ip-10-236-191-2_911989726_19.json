The teacher to student ratio is 12:1 and the average class size is 15. The professors and dean are nice, accessible and approachable. Lake Forest College is mainly what you make of it., 33886=Although I know students often have difficulty with roommates, the dorms themselves are beautiful. There is currently both academic and all-female housing available. While there is usually a substance-free dorm, the dorm is being completely renovated and will be available again in Fall 2013. Nollen and Deerpath are the newest residence halls, and Harlan and Blackstone are the most historic. There are quad spaces available with balconies for an apartment feel, and there are also several apartments available on campus. Cleavland-Young is the international house, and has a kitchen available for use to every student on campus. The college recently opened up the opportunity for students to live off-campus in the Fort Sheridan Apartments as part of a housing plan. The dorms are cleaned well, as general maintenance is updated regularly, but I have heard of a small bug problem in some dorms that is easily taken care of each year., 160230=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",

    "textAfterTable": "Share any unusual traditions or locations on campus A few times every month Lake Forest has ACPs or All Campus Programs which allow students to go out on the weekend and dance and eat and have a good time away from their studies. Bang for the buck Lake Forest seems expensive at first but they give some of the most financial aid I have ever heard of. What to do for fun Because Lake Forest is so close to the Lake Forest train stop, Chicago and all of its glory is only a train ride away. More locally however, there are many cute shops and restaurants a walk away from campus. In the surrounding towns there are also many options for entertainments which the provided shuttle from the school will bring you to. Food and Dining The dining experience at Lake Forest is pretty good. There is always something that I end up finding appealing and themed food nights add a little excitement to a busy student's life. On Sundays there are usually less options because the kitchen is getting ready for the week but other that that it is great. Also, there is a smaller cafe called Boomer's where sushi and other options are served regularly.",
