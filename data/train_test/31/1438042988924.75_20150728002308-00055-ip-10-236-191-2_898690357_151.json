            "The campus is extremely safe--walking around at night is not the least bit unnerving.",
            "There is a wide variety at Ohio University--you have to try to not find something of interest, and starting your own club is simple.",
            "There are two types of students--those with a full-ride who are focused on academics and those who love to party. Take your pick.",
            "Fest Season is very popular at Ohio University, and these include street-wide alcoholic binges that are named for the streets on which they take place.",
            "I would say you can get a fairly good GPA with effort, as well as a great social experience with a venturesome spirit.",
            "Generally students go Uptown to the shops, bars, and restaurants. Many get involved with Greek life or other extracurriculars, or simply hang around the dorms.",
            "The dining halls are mostly renovated and serve fairly good food, but can get old at times. Luckily the shops and restaurants Uptown are a 2-5 minute walk.",
            "Depending on the green you are in and the type of dorm you live in (renovated or not) your experience will be different. Generally the staff are helpful, and the dorm set-up is conducive to easy networking.",
            "If you put in effort, you can generally pass classes easily. Depending on your program, requirements and rigor changes.",
            "Do your research, and make sure you have established what you want to get involved in before you come.",
            "Ohio University has a variety of students that attend, ranging in diversity as well as academic interest. It has a great outdoor space that is fantastic in the warm periods, and the faculty for the undergraduate program are highly involved. The people who attend are generally warm, and the environment is very safe."

The 110 performs at all football and basketball games (men and women). They have performed around the world; from Rome and Ireland in 2013 to being invited to perform in China during the 60's. Along with the band though, the university's sports have been performing extremely well over the past few years, including 5 straight bowls for the football team, and a recent Sweet 16 run for the men's basketball team. There are other events that happen on Court Street in Athens, the craziest 1/2 mile in all of Ohio. Home to over 20 bars and a ton of restaurants, there is always something to do in Athens, Ohio!, 339987=I am not familiar with a lot at this time since school just started this week but there is a March 110 that takes all the incoming freshman. The band plays and marches across the main campus bridge with freshman class following them. It is really cool!, 645160=Halloween is HUGE at Ohio University. Rated the best campus to be on in the United States on Oct. 31st.}",
