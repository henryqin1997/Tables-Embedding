I'm sure plenty of column inches have been filled with 'Cesc will play', 'Cesc won't play', 'Cesc has Barca DNA', blah blah blah. It's all too predictable. Well whatever the papers said, I can confirm that Fabregas is in the starting XI, along with William Gallas. Take a look for yourself. Arsenal Starting XI: Almunia, Sagna, Gallas, Vermaelen, Clichy, Song, Diaby, Fabregas, Arshavin, Nasri, Bendtner You know what? Besides van Persie, that`s probably our best lineup. Arsenal Bench: Fabianski, Eboue, Campbell, Denilson, Rosicky, Walcott, Eduardo Barcelona Starting XI: Valdes, Alves, Puyol, Pique, Maxwell, Busquets, Keita, Xavi, Messi, Pedro, Ibrahimovic Barcelona Bench: Pinto, Marquez, Bojan, Henry, Milito, Yaya Toure, Jeffren Massimo Busacca is the head official for this match. The Swiss referee is one of UEFA`s top rated officials, and he managed the United v. Barca final in Rome last May. Enjoy the match Gooners; let's hope it lives up to expectations. Also, remember to bundle up, it`s cold in the N5!}",
