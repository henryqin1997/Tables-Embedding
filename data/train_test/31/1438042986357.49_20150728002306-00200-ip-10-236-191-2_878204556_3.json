It was followed up by album \"Black Sands\" in 2010, which spawned the single \"The Keeper\" featuring vocals by Andreya Triana. In turn, Green produced Triana's debut album \"Lost Where I Belong.\", 2734=In February 2012, \"Black Sands Remixed\" was released, featuring tracks from the original album remixed by noted electronic producers such as Lapalux, Mark Pritchard, Machinedrum and more.
