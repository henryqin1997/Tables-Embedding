It's just a bit of purple tinging. I love spectro green tinges personally that can appear with fast lenses. That said, I have noticed that people loose sleep over the wrong things in this forum. Almost all of them. Look at the edge of the buildings, the poles, the tree leaves, the pillars in shot 4, the buildings in shot 12...it's all over the place. How can you not see all the CA. I also see too much halo action happening here (over sharpening)...otherwise",
