Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2. Nature Methods. 2012, 9:357-359.): Is a bioinformatics application that aligns sequencing reads to long reference sequences. This benchmark uses Bowtie 2 to align RNA data to the human genome. The benchmark measures the throughput for aligning read data to the human genome by running multiple processes simultaneously with each process aligning 500,000 read data. The number of simultaneous processes run is equal to the number of hardware threads available on the machine.\u00a0, 39046=DDR3-1600}",
