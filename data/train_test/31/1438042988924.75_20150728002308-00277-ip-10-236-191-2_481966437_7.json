The authoring and publishing software 1702 starts by (a) obtaining data corresponding to the pertinent aircraft, (b) populating electronic libraries with supporting functions, tasks, and/or data for the aircraft, (c) creating data structures specific to a particular aircraft, and (d) creating document definitions based on the data structures 1704. An administrator 1706 then defines a book by (a) entering aircraft-specific data, (b) creating a work order, (c) associating aircraft to the work order, and (d) creating a published book 1706. An author 1708 then writes or edits the book and creates illustrations 1710. Once created, the book is validated and published. Once published 1714, the book may be distributed to suppliers 1716, manufacturers 1718, archival servers 1710 and 1712, and to airliners 1720. Such books may include maintenance, repair, and installation information for the various components of an aircraft or family of aircraft.}",

The revision history can be stored in the storage database 110. In another embodiment, data elements 1121-1134 contain security levels that restrict user access to modify the data elements 1121-1134., 35302=The present Application for Patent is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/553,437, entitled \u201cAutomatic Authoring and Publishing System\u201d, filed Oct. 26, 2006, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/379,769, entitled \u201cAutomatic Authoring and Publishing System,\u201d filed Apr. 21, 2006, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/674,157, entitled \u201cDocumentation Preparation System,\u201d filed Apr. 21, 2005., 92198=The final output format 118 can be based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). The output published document can be hard copy and/or stored in a storage medium. SGML is an ISO standard: ISO 8879:1986 information processing language. SGML allows the writer to be focused on the structural aspects of a document and leave the visual presentation of that structure to the publishing engine 112. SGML supports the development of common retrieval systems as well as the creation of product databases. The use of common elements and structures for all documents promote the use of common software such as parsers, printing and display software using Format Output Specification Instances (FOSIs), SFQL clients and SFQL servers., 88682=In one embodiment, the publishing engine 112 for producing output from the system is configured to gather document data elements 1121-1134 and place them in a predetermined form according, for example, to a document template. The publishing engine 112 may add images to the predetermined form, for example, a maintenance troubleshooting flowchart., 39542=U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0022118 describes using a template where all the required elements that form the output must be maintained in exactly the same location otherwise the template is unable to recreate the document accurately. This technique is rigid, inflexible, and in most cases requires the author to make the template out of a document description language as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,377,956. This requires the author to have extra knowledge about the structural requirements of the book/manual and how the selected templates may affect the final output. For example, in the airline industry the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) require documentation to meet specific standards. Authors constantly review the formatting requirements to comply with changing governmental regulations. Further, U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0022118 only allows the structure of the book to be shown, and does not preview the final product for the author to see the effect of any changes. Thus, the author has to wait until the content is published and then make alterations in a repetitive cycle until the document is satisfactory. Any changes made during the review process starts the cycle over again wasting time and delaying production of the documentation required., 87605=In some embodiments, the document editor 106 is configured to place data elements 1121-1134 in a tree-like structure. The user can modify the tree-like structure, add content to the elements in the tree-like structure, and/or display a preview of a modification to the tree-like structure. For example, a user can move document data elements 1121-1134 from an existing tree-like structure to another tree-like structure (i.e. cut and paste the document data elements 1121-1134), or copy a part or the entire tree-like structure into a new or existing document definition. User modifications to the tree-like structure operations need not affect the document data elements 1121-1134, only the structure or relationship of the document data elements within the tree-like structures. In one embodiment, the document data elements 1121-1134 are selected from the group consisting of one or more text, quantity, descriptions, procedures and graphical metadata.}",

Although the present invention has been described with a degree of particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure has been made by way of example. For example, the present invention is not limited to aircraft manuals but may be implemented with any other products (e.g., cars, boats, electronics, etc.) where manuals are needed. Since various changes could be made in the above description without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be illustrative and not used in a limiting sense. It should be noted that the scope of the present invention is not limited to a system that has all of these advantages. Lastly, the data revision process is also improved in terms of revision control, revision time, and automated revision markings. Data usage is improved by retrieval software/browsers resulting in improved access time to digital data, searching of pertinent data utilizing the intelligence of the data structure, data customization based on document definitions. Data modification is improved by decreasing the time needed to incorporate modifications, decreasing the",
