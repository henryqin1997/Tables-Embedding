            "Evanston has a plethora of bars and restaurants, including a great icecream shop a block from campus. Most offer some form of wildcard advantage. On campus, Norris is a center of activity, and there's always the Frat Quad if you want a party.",
            "Evanston and the North Shore is the dining capital of Chicago. Name a genre of food: you can find it here. As for dining on campus, it's a little above average.",
            "There are good dorms and bad dorms, both in facilities and atmosphere. The Residential Colleges tend to be closer knit, but they are also small and more specialized, and lack a dining hall.",
            "Unless the idea of becoming an icicle appeals to you, you might want to bring a variety of heavy winter gear for when it gets quite cold. A bike is also handy for getting around campus.",

    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{154833=2 stars, from what I hear. The newer apartments are much nicer than my freshmen year. The university has purchased some area hotels.I chose to live off campus because they offer apartments and not dorms and you had to share with 5 people. The new apartments require less roommates. They just added a food service option this 2012 academic year, which is a real plus., 78435=We paint a giant rock over and over, but you have to guard it first. Also, along the lakefill are these giant rocks which also get painted. Dillo Day is a concert that goes up at the end of May and lasts all day. Primal Scream happens the Sunday right before finals week when everyone goes outside and yells., 257619=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 2998=Northwestern offers so much to students that it seems like too much. There's plenty of different social scenes (Greek life is a big one, but you don't have to be in a frat or sorority to be social), plenty of arts and entertainment, hundreds of student groups, opportunities for work, research and internships, volunteer groups, easy transportation, great dorm life... The professors I've had were generally really accessible, too. Again, the problem with all the NU offers is that it's hard for someone to have a job, be in a sport, be in ten extracurriculars, double major, volunteer, do research *and* have a normal social life without getting three hours of sleep and having no time to eat or relax. A problem I've encountered is that the course listing is difficult for freshmen. Upperclassmen and declared majors get class registration priority, so freshmen and undeclared majors have slim pickings when it comes to classes. I haven't met anyone who got into all the classes they wanted to. I'm ambivalent about the quarter system - it's nice that you only have to take four classes at a time, but when you take a class you like, it's upsetting because it's over so quickly. It's also nice that you get to go back to school in September, but on the other hand, you have to stay around until June. It's really easy to get distracted with all of Nortwestern's small faults when you get used to all it has to offer.}",
