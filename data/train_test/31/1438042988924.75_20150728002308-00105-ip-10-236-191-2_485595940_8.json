    "textBeforeTable": "Patent Citations As discussed above, the present invention enables substrate determination of high reliability. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY In the foregoing examples, although carbon was used as the material of the third electrode, the present invention is not limited to carbon electrode and those made of other conductive material or a silver/silver chloride electrode can also be used. In the foregoing examples, specific electrode systems were shown, but the present invention is not limited to those electrode systems with respect to the shape of the electrode and location of the electrodes and leads. The above-exemplified enzymes and electron mediators may be dissolved in the sample solution or may be prevented from dissolving in the sample solution by fixing the reaction layer onto the base plate and so on. When the enzyme and the electron mediator are to be fixed, the reaction layer preferably contains the hydrophilic polymer. As the electron mediator, potassium ferricyanide, p-benzoquinone, phenazine methosulfate, methylene blue, and ferrocene derivatives may be exemplified. These electron mediators may be used singly or in combination of two or more. The oxidoreductase to be contained in the reaction layer is selected depending on the substrate contained in the sample solution. Exemplary oxidoreductases include fructose dehydrogenase, glucose oxidase, alcohol oxidase, lactate oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and amino-acid oxidase. In the foregoing examples, although carboxymethyl cellulose was used as the hydrophilic polymer, a variety of hydrophilic polymers can be used for",
