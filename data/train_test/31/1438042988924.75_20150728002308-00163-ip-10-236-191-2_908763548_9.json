            "Business major Accounting major ( its in top 10 accounting program!) Students who are career-oriented and don't care about no-campus life Students who love diversity and city life",
            "As I am an international student and entering in Spring term , it is not an easy process. I would advice every international student to apply for Macaulay Honor Program if you have good GPA and SATs. I thought I could apply it later and now I feel like I have wasted taking SATs. Also, ISSC takes so long to issue i20. So be sure you send in all the required proofs as soon as possible.",
            "It is very affordable compared with other schools in the States. Besides, it is in the New York City! Also, the reputation of Baruch in accounting programme is a plus for student like me. I think Baruch is worth every penny!",
            "Even though Baruch is on the list of College with least happy students, I think I will love the career-oriented atmosphere. Yet there are many clubs that we could participate in. As long as I am getting new good friends and learning about interesting topics ,I will truly enjoy my college years.",
            "I really hope that I will learn a lot not only in academic area but also in other aspects because this is situated in one of the most vibrant and crowded of New York City and it is also known for its diversity."

It has its perks, but if you come from out of state or do not plan on being a business major, good luck. This goes for any potential CUNY student, the CUNY system may implement something called PATHWAYS in Fall 2013, look it up because it may change your mind on going to a CUNY school., 100043=May be convenient for students who live far away but as for those who live near, it won't play a big role in your time spent at Baruch College. Other than that, the dorms can be a great place to hang out with friends and study., 302792=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 58757=If you think you deserve a treat, maybe after getting that first A in Eng 2150 or acing the philosophy midterm, you should head over to the student life office on the third floor to get some discount tickets! Broadway plays in Times Square or hop by the theatre on 23rd. Retail therapy is available in Union Square or by Penn Station (34th & Lexington)., 76074=As an out of state student, I feel like I could get a better education somewhere else for the price I am paying. Once I get in-state-residency rate come Fall of 2013 (which is considerably lower than out-of-state), I hopefully won't feel like I wasted time and money here., 256098=There came across a small mice inside the classroom in one of my classes in the year 2011. That was extremely unusual., 146945=$2500 for a semester. Respected as highly as Harvard Business School, do the math.}",
