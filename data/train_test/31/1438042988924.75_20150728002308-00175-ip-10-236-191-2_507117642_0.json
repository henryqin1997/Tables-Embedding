If you\u2019re feeding twice a day, it doesn\u2019t have to be at exactly 12-hour intervals. You may choose to feed at 8 in the morning and then again at 4:30 in the afternoon. However, it is important to be consistent. Feeding calves \u201csometime during the morning\u201d and then again \u201csometime during the evening\u201d will add to your risk of bloat. If you have a bloated calf, it is important to call your veterinarian. These calves often will die fairly quickly, so rapid evaluation and treatment is important.}",
