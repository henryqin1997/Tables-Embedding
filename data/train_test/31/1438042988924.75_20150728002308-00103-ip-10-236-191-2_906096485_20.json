            "Campus security is the best. They really care about our safety. If you get out of class late and have to walk back to your dorm, you can call security and they will escort you back. They don't mind at all.",
            "Sigma Sigma Sigma and Kappa Delta.",
            "There are a couple of sororities on campus: Sigma Sigma Sigma and Kappa Delta. There is also fashion modeling group where students can be the models for fashion students. They put on a fashion show every year.",
            "Stephens is great for Interior design, fashion, theater, dance, creative writing, and equestrian students. I am an interior design major and this is my second year at Stephens. We are already working with a real client so we are getting some real life experience.",
            "Okay, so it's pretty expensive but the amount of financial aid they offer is pretty amazing. Anyway I think it is worth it for the quality of education we are getting here. Classes are small which means one-on-one time with teachers (no appointment necessary), and close knit, friendly classes. Small classes mean easier presentations.",
            "There are lots of fun things to do around campus. Groups and organizations are always hosting events. The other night we had casino night (no actual money involved) and there were prizes. There are also plays, fashion modeling group, and sororities. But if you don't want to hang out around campus it is only a couple of blocks away from downtown. There are plenty of shops, restaurants, a theater, and an art museum all within walking distance of campus.",
            "Stephens has pretty good food. They offer gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian in the dining hall and have recently added a new student union (hang out area) complete with a Wii and bean bag chairs. They are also getting frozen yogurt soon.",
            "I like living in the dorms but sometimes it can get loud on the weekends. Security is the best here. They really care about our safety and will walk you around campus if you don't feel safe. They don't mind. They will also unlock doors for you if you lose your keys. :)",
            "Classes can be pretty intense. As an interior design student I started working with real clients my sophomore year. Every teacher I have had here is really helpful though. They like it when you ask questions.",
            "Get your financial aid situated before the last minute. Save up some money, you will need it for supplies if you are a design major.",
            "Overall Stephens College is great. Last October we got to volunteer for Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in Joplin. Who knows where Stephens will take us next."

This is really good because it is preparing me for when I graduate. It is giving me the upper hand because, unlike most college graduates, I will have already had real life experience in my field. Also, last October the interior design department got to go to Joplin, Missouri and help with the Extreme Makeover: Home Edition project there. Stephens is really good about giving their students stuff to put on their resumes., 91892=You can call the Security number at 3:28 am and say you need an escort across our tiny campus, and they will either walk with you or pick you up in a van and bring you to your room. Locked out of your dorm? Give them three minutes. Lost downtown? Give them ten. They are some of the hardest working and most compassionate people on campus--and they'll let you in to just about any building on campus at any hour of the night if needed., 105080=Overall Stephens College is great. Last October we got to volunteer for Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in Joplin. Who knows where Stephens will take us next., 169694=Midnight Breakfast. One night during finals, the faculty and professors all dress up in a certain theme and host a breakfast for all the students at 10:00 at night! It's a great way to unwind and de-stress during finals week., 193403=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 84489=1. There are an abundance of ghost stories around here, if you're into that sort of thing. Several buildings are said to be haunted and many of the girls here will confirm that they've seen some pretty strange stuff go down. 2. Our dean wears only red shoes, and her reasons are quite hilarious. 3. The most prominent tradition however, dates back to 1921. Stephens has a list of Ten Ideals to which the students are supposed to adhere; respect, courage, independence, support, sensitivity, responsibility, belief, creativity, intelligence, and leadership. Originally it was the mission statement of the school to educate young women and help them realize these ideals within themselves. Today that tradition is going strong with the selection of The Ten. Every year ten girls are selected secretly by the staff and administration and rewarded for embodying one of these ideals. It is quite an honor to be selected as one of The Ten.}",

I have had a few not so good meals there, but all in all, its good. In three sentences When I started at Stephen's College, I was trying to choose between them and another school. I chose Stephen's and I have not been disappointed yet. Everyone is so caring and my education is very personal.
