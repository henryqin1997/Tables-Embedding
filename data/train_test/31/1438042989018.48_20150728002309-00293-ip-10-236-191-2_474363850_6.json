Requests for a number of logical partitions may be processed by an application (with one or more child threads or processes, with a number of associated application caches) that may be responsible for undertaking the processing on behalf of a number of logical partitions where the logical partitioning per application can be changed at runtime. While it is anticipated that each logical partition may have a dedicated process, by allowing multiple logical processing partitions to be dynamically assigned to a process allows consolidation of the number of network, cache, and I/O resources needed to allow the system to be divided into a large number of logical partitions to give fine grained control of the system processing. Each partition can communicate with the other partitions as if the other partition may be in a separate machine., 282932=[0599] Last resource via loan request: Consumer Server resource left at last loan request or other interactive Consumer Server/Wallet Server message. Used to be the latest Consumer Server resource for loan determination. (May not be persisted, and may never be committed to the Consumer Server log file, but potentially the most recent resource change seen by the Wallet Server)., 207803=[0325] January wallet\u2014100 minutes, valid for January, February, March., 207917=[0326] February wallet\u2014100 minutes valid for February, March, April, 137445=[0143] Referring to FIG. 6, to support complex Consumer hierarchies not all the information associated with one product/consumer/account needs to be contained within one LDS. There are very controlled cross linkage points between LDS to allow large and complex entities to be mapped. FIG. 6 illustrates consideration of wallet consumption in determination of the Logical Consumer Server (LCS) (926, 927). Two consumers (12345, 78998) allocated to different Logical Consumer Servers (926, 927) are provisioned to the same Logical Consumer Server (927) if a CRM modification causes them to share a common wallet (C). Under normal operating conditions, this capability to manage resources across multiple Consumer Servers may be only required when the consumers allocated to share wallets cannot be managed within a single logical consumer server, for example, a very large account with many consumers sharing a single resource. The mechanism may be also used when Consumer Server fail-over occurs., 195901=[0295] Referring to FIG. 2, Wallets (250 . . . ) may be created when a consumer buys a Product (210) which entitles them to a Wallet Allowance (220). This figure illustrates a Product (210) with a Wallet Allowance (220) and Wallet Consumption Rates (230) for a Free Minute Wallet (230). This diagram also illustrates the validity period for the Wallets (250 . . . ) associated with the Allowance (220). Each Wallet (250 . . . ) may be valid for two months, so during February both the January (250) and February (251) Wallets can be used., 204051=[0312] Thresholds (alerts) may also use the loan strategy, by setting a \u2018false\u2019 lower loan limit. For example, if a user has 1000 minutes across a number of Consumer Servers (925), the Wallet Server (940) may act as if the wallet limit was only 900 minutes and, when that limit may be consumed or substantially consumed (including any inter-consumer reallocation that may occur), the Wallet Server (940) may generate an alert and then release the final 100 minutes. Where only one shadow wallet exists, the wallet server will delegate threshold detection to the consumer server, and the consumer server will alert the wallet server once a limit may be exceeded., 278877=[0581] Wallet number: Allocated by Wallet Server. This may be a wallet sequence number and may be the same for all wallets that cover the same period. Used to tie together wallets of different Consumer Server that cover the same period as the wallet number will be the same. (So for periodic wallets stating in March, we can get March 2003=1, April 2003=2 . . . March 2004=13. For long duration cash wallets there may be only one wallet of sequence 1)., 71707=[0001] This non-provisional patent application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/417,706, which was filed on Oct. 10, 2002., 205457=[0317] Referring to FIG. 4, an illustration of one embodiment shows the state of the wallets after a number of events. In this case as only 10 minutes of the wallet was left (1000 minutes\u2014100 minutes in master wallet\u2014890 minutes in Shadow wallets), the Wallet Server (940) has proactively reduced the loans on each Shadow wallet to match their usage. The 10 minutes remaining may be held centrally and requests for any more usage (loan) must be referred to the Wallet Server (940). The Wallet Server is also up-to-date on usage in case of a logical server failure., 202667=[0310] In this example, the Master Wallet (310) may have an initial value that can be consumed of 1000 min. The Master Wallet (310) has a \u2018used\u2019 value of 100 minutes that is not associated with any Consumer Server (925). This may be the usage that was associated with the failed Consumer Server (925). On failure of a Consumer Server (925) the journalized usage in any Shadow wallet (320 . . . ) may be \u2018emptied\u2019 into the master wallet, and any unused loan value may be recycled. There may be 900 minutes that can be loaned and consumed by Shadow wallets (320 . . . ) within the Consumer Servers (925-6). In this case 450 minutes has been allocated to each of the Shadow wallets (320 . . . ). The Consumer Servers (925-6) can therefore consume locally up to 450 minutes without reference to the Wallet Server (940).}",

The upgrade may be completed by moving shadow wallet Servers from one physical Wallet Server to another server.

The shadow wallet loans data in the Wallet Server associated with the failed Consumer Server may be \u2018released\u2019 in a timer or when the Consumer Server Work Manager reports that the server has failed (typically as the machine has rebooted and re-registered).
