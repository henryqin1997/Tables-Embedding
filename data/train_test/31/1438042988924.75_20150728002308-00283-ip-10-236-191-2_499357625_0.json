The all-new Hesston by Massey Ferguson 2170XD Large Square Baler is no exception, producing a denser bale without compromising the Hesston tradition of proven high-capacity baling.\u201d, 8051=The 2170XD model creates 3- by-4-foot bales, up to 9 feet in length, with bale weights 15 percent greater than the standard MF2170 baler and 30 percent greater than standard MF2170 balers sold before 2010. To produce increased bale weight and density at lower operating pressures, the 2170XD features larger hydraulic tension cylinders equipped with heavier pivots to create greater overall tension within the system., 6592=08.15.2011, 7614=Compared to its current Hesston 2170 counterpart, the XD model has a redesigned flywheel that is not only larger and wider, but 91 percent heavier to help create a heavier bale while operating smoothly at normal load in most conditions.}",
