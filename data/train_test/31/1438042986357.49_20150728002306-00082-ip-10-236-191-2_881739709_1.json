Leaked surveillance footage that has been played countless times on television and online show him deflecting the blows, but otherwise making no aggressive moves to counter the attack. Still, his reputation appeared in question and was unceremoniously dragged through the mud until a joint statement was issued proclaiming that Jay-Z, Beyonce and Solange had moved past the incident.}",
