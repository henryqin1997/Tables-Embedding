    "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 With its $161 million opening, \u2018The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\u2019 has not only topped the opening weekend of the first film, it now has the fourth biggest box office opening of all time, wedging it right between the final \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 movie and \u2018The Dark Knight Rises.\u2019 Its predecessor went on to break the $400 million mark, so we expect that this one will follow suit. After all, it\u2019s a significantly better (and better reviewed) movie than the first \u2018Hunger Games,\u2019 so the sky is really the limit. Expect it to break $200 million by next week. However, the success of \u2018Catching Fire\u2019 had to come out of somewhere. One of those hardest hit was \u2018Thor: The Dark World,\u2019 which fell from the number one spot and only grossed $14 million over the weekend. That\u2019s not exactly devastating (the movie is already a huge international hit), but it does make the road to $200 million a little tougher. With a little elbow grease, it should hang around for another month and get where it needs to go. In third place, \u2018The Best Man Holiday\u2018 fell 58%, but with $50 million grossed, it\u2019s already more than paid for itself. Everyone\u2019s happy and we\u2019ll definitely get a follow-up sooner than you think. The biggest victim of the \u2018Catching Fire\u2019 success was \u2018Delivery Man,\u2019 which bombed with an $8 million opening weekend. The film is another nail in the coffin of Vince Vaughn\u2019s",
