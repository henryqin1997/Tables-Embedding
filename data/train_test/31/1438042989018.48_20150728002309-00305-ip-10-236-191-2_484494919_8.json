Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, and representative devices, shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. In addition, FIG. 5, shows the ROM address control shown in FIG. 4. In this ROM address control, M-bit ROM address data is converted into (M-m)-bit ROM address data. This feature allows the SIN ROM and the COS ROM to be reduced in size, without decreasing the resolution of the ROM address data. Referring now to FIG. 5, m bits of the LSBs of M-bit ROM address data and m bits of the MSBs of M-bit binary data are input to an m-bit adding circuit. Further, (M-m) bits of the MSBs of the M-bit ROM address data are input to an (M-m)-bit adding circuit. Generally speaking, data such as SIN and COS (digital) data which is comprised of a relatively large number of bits and is depicted as substantially a curve in a graph, can be converted into PWM data having only a small number of errors. However, if the number of bits is large, use of a correspondingly large-sized ROM will be required. A small-sized ROM can be used if a ROM address controlling",
