The CFO said mobile payments has the potential to encourage higher user engagement on the OpenTable app and attract new users, according to a Bank of America note., 10745=Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500., 14417=OpenTable indicated earlier this year that it plans to spend $9 million in consumer marketing in the U.S. and internationally in 2014, ramping up after spending just $1.7 million for each region in the first quarter. Up until 2013, the company invested a negligible amount of money on advertising, relying on growth through viral and word-of-mouth marketing., 14043=The company also expects to roll out its mobile payments solution to 20 cities in 2014. Robertson said if the payment initiative achieves some scale, the company may be able to negotiate lower credit card fees to add incentive for restaurants to join the program., 16747=The acquisition comes at a time when shares of OpenTable, which books 15 million diners a month at more than 31,000 restaurants, were struggling to regain momentum. The stock suffered a steep setback from March and April's substantial tech selloff that was spurred by concerns about high valuations and another dotcom bubble., 15610=Holders of the stock have seen shares decline more than 11% this year, following a more than 15.5% drop between the sharply swooning March and April months. But even prior to Friday's announcement, the selloff appeared to have bottomed. Shares were trying to make their way back up and the stock was at $70 a share Thursday while the company appeared poised for a round of fresh new strategic initiatives.}",
