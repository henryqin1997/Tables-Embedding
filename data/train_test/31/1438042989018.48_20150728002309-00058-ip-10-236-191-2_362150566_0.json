Last year, 24 Florida panther deaths were recorded, but FWC biologists also observed 11 radio-collared females giving birth to 32 panther kittens. Overall, the known number of newborn panthers in 2011 appears to have offset the known number of panther deaths., 25891=Th 26 High 3:07 AM 3.5 7:24 AM Rise 9:12 AM 7 26 Low 9:41 AM -0.2 6:05 PM Set 9:33 PM 26 High 3:53 PM 3.3 26 Low 10:00 PM 0.3, 19457=The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission voted on Wednesday, Feb. 8, to change how gag grouper is managed in Gulf of Mexico state waters (excluding Monroe County). The decision, which came during day two of the three-day February Commission meeting, will achieve consistency with federal management efforts while potentially providing a region-specific recreational season in four counties.}",
