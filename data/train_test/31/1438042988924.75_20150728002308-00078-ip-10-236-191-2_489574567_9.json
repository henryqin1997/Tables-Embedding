    "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{38421=LINK 222 and PHY 224 make up the IEEE 1394 Serial Bus interface for DSS IRD 100. All 1394 commands transmitted by CPU 312 are transferred to LINK 222 through extension bus 212. The 1394 commands are sent via PHY 224 and are ultimately transmitted to a destination node in the network 10. The commands from other devices in network 10 are received by PHY 224 and transmitted to LINK 222. LINK 222 transfers these commands to CPU 312 through extension bus 212. Audio-video data is transferred between DSS IRD 100 and LINK 222 through 1394 data bus 320. When DSS IRD 100 sends data, TC 306 transfers the data from external RAM 304 or DES engine 302 to LINK 222. When IRD 100 receives data, LINK 222 sends the data to TPP 300 via 1394 data bus 320., 33520=FIG. 1 illustrates a digital network 10. Network 10 corresponds to the IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Standard. A digital satellite system integrated receiver decoder (DSS IRD) 100 is connected to TV (television)/audio set 102 with an analog cable 104. In one embodiment, IRD 100 may obtain topology information and generate a map from the topology information. In an alternate embodiment, TV/audio set 102 may obtain the topology information and generate a map from that information if TV/audio set 102 has IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Standard interface capability and is connected to network 10. IRD 100 is also coupled to various devices in network 10 including digital video disc (DVD) player 106, digital video cassette recorder 1 (DVCR1) 108, mini-disc (MD) recorder 110 and DVCR2 112., 52850=For example, in FIG. 10, a drag and drop implementation is illustrated. A user selects the icon 900 associated with DVD player 106 and drags it toward a receiver icon using cursor 908. In the example shown, the DVD icon 900, which is highlighted, is dragged and dropped to the DVCR1 icon 903. The select and drag and drop operations are performed using a cursor control device such as an infrared remote control. In response to these operations, CPU 312 of DSS IRD 100 sends a play command to the DVD player 106. The DVD player 106 responds by beginning to play output data into the network. The CPU 312 also sends commands to DVCR1 108 to record the data from the DVD player 106. The commands are generated and transmitted through network 10 in accordance with the IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Standard., 32303=A method and an apparatus for providing device control with a topology map in a digital network are disclosed. The present invention is applicable to any digital network which is capable of providing topology information. A digital network corresponding to the IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Standard will be described herein as an exemplary digital network within which the methods and apparatus of the present invention operate., 26215=The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) has promulgated a number of different bus architecture standards including IEEE standards document 1394, entitled Standard for a High Performance Serial Bus (hereinafter \"IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Standard\"). A typical serial bus having the IEEE 1394 standard architecture is comprised of a multiplicity of nodes that are interconnected via point-to-point links, such as cables, that each connect a single node of the serial bus to another node of the serial bus. Data packets are propagated throughout the serial bus using a number of point-to-point transactions, wherein a node that receives a packet from another node via a first point-to-point link retransmits the received packet via other point-to-point links. A tree network configuration and associated packet handling protocol ensures that each node receives every packet once. The serial bus of the IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Standard may be used as an alternate bus for the parallel backplane of a computer system, as a low cost peripheral bus, or as a bus bridge between architecturally compatible buses., 37653=Central processing unit (CPU) 312 controls all of the above processes. CPU 312 communicates with on-chip RAM 314, ROM 316, extension bus 212 and traffic controller 306 through an internal high speed bus 315. CPU 312 also communicates to ROM 220, modem 214 and remote command unit interface (RCU-IF) 218 through extension bus interface 318 and extension bus 212. RCU-IF 218 receives commands from a remote control unit (RCU) (not shown) and transmits them to CPU 312 via extension bus 212. Link layer IC (LINK) 222 and physical layer IC (PHY) 224 communicate with CPU 312 through extension interface bus 318 and extension bus 212. PHY 224 is coupled to LINK 222 via data and control lines and to other nodes of the IEEE 1394 Serial Bus as indicated., 39185=FIG. 3 is a flow diagram illustrating the general steps followed by the present invention in constructing a topology map. There are several steps followed in configuring a cable environment, namely, bus initialization, self identification and device identification. In step 402, bus initialization is performed. Upon start up and again whenever a new node joins network 10, a reset signal forces all nodes in network 10 into a special state which clears all topology information and starts the next phase. During the bus initialization phase, PHY 224 internally latches the connection status of each port. PHY 224 will automatically initiate the bus initialization phase if the connection status of any port changes, for example, where an adjacent device is removed or added. In 1394 parlance, nodes with no connected ports are isolated. Nodes with a single connected port are leaves (or children) and nodes with two or more connected ports are branches (or parents). The eventual root node may be either a branch or a leaf., 27360=A communications protocol of the IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Standard specifies two primary types of bus access: asynchronous access and isochronous access. Asynchronous access may be either \"fair\" or \"cycle master\". Cycle master access is used by nodes that need the next available opportunity to transfer data. Isochronous access is used by nodes that require guaranteed bandwidth, for example, nodes transmitting video data. The transactions for each type of bus access are comprised of at least one \"subaction\", wherein a subaction is a complete one-way transfer operation., 28868=Accordingly, in one embodiment, a topology map for a digital system is generated and displayed on a display device to indicate the various components which make up the system. The various components are indicated using icons, each of which represent a respective one of the components. A user specifies a source device and a receive device by manipulating the corresponding icons so as to cause a data transfer between the source device and the receive device. The data transfer may include the transfer of video data, audio data, or both. In a preferred embodiment, the digital network corresponds to the IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Standard., 35004=A point-to-point link such as cable 114 is used to connect two nodes to one another. The DSS IRD node is coupled to the DVCR1 node by cable 114 and to the DVD node by cable 114a. The DVCR1 node is coupled to the MD recorder node by cable 114c and to the DVCR2 node by cable 114b. The MD recorder node is capable of being coupled to other peripherals (not shown) by cable 114d. Each of the cables 114-114d may be constructed in accordance with the IEEE 1394 Serial Bus Standard and may include a first differential signal pair for conducting a first signal, a second differential signal pair for conducting a second signal, and a pair of power lines.}",

Although features and examples of the present invention have been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will appreciate that certain modifications may be possible without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention which should be limited only by the claims which follow. FIG. 13 illustrates how device information may be retrieved using the connection map implementation of the present invention. If an INFO button 930 is selected from a pop-up menu 916 associated with DVCR2 icon 904, DSS IRD 100 transmits a command to DVCR2 112 to send information regarding the video tape being played. DVCR2 112 returns the tape information. The information will then appear in a window 918 on the screen as illustrated in FIG. 13. The contents of the information window 918 depends on the device selected and its features. Examples of device information include: time (tape/disk remaining time, total playback/recording time, etc.); title (name of the loaded tape or disk); write protection (on or off); and play mode (long play or standard play).
