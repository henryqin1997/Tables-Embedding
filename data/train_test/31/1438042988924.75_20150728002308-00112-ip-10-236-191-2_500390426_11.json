Also, in this example, a differential pressure sensor 374 is provided in the fore- and aft-locations of trapping device 316 so that the rate of loss of the sacrificial material or the degree of obstruction in the line can be estimated from the signal from the differential pressure sensor 374. FIG. 21 shows another embodiment of the evacuation system in which thermal trapping devices 370, 372 are provided in a downstream location of the system shown in FIG. 16. This arrangement is used to eliminate residual components from exhaust gas which had not reacted with the sacrificial material and/or to eliminate their reaction products so that they can be trapped before reaching the vacuum pump 312. In this example, two trapping devices operating at two different temperatures are shown, and this arrangement is convenient in separately trapping and regenerating gaseous elements which have different solidifying temperatures. FIG. 20A shows another type of reactive trapping device in which a cylindrical casing 360 contains a permeable sacrificial material plate 362. The sacrificial material plate 362 can be made as a laminated mesh sheets or by sintering powders, particulates or aciculates, or a plate formed with fine holes therein,",
