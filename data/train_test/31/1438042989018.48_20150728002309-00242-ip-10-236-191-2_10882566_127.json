As an additional component of the carriage fee in the initial Agreement, NIC issued to AOL fully vested common stock warrants representing the right to immediately purchase 624,653 shares of NIC common stock at an exercise price of $6.71875 per share. The warrants expire five years from the date of the Agreement. The exercise price per share was calculated based on the average closing price of NIC common stock for the four trading days prior to the August 28, 2000 announcement date of the Agreement. The fair value of the warrants issued to AOL was determined to be approximately $4.75 million on August 25, 2000, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model., 453537=on a long-term, sustained basis. If we are not able to sustain profitability, our cash collateral requirements may increase. Had the Company been required to post 100% cash collateral at December 31, 2003 for the face value of all performance bonds (which are supported by letters of credit), our line of credit in conjunction with a corporate credit card agreement and our bank note payable, unrestricted cash would have decreased and restricted cash would have increased by approximately $2.0 million., 1178261=Company recognized this $1,306,569 of stock compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2002 and had no deferred compensation expense remaining at December 31, 2002., 995016=shares of unregistered NIC common stock. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated September 8, 2000 (the \u0093Merger Agreement\u0094), fifty percent of the total number of shares of NIC common stock issued was held in escrow as collateral for the indemnification obligations of the selling shareholders under the Merger Agreement. The shares of NIC common stock placed in escrow were held and released subject to the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement, whereby 60 percent of the escrow shares were delivered to the IDT shareholders one year after the date of closing, and the remaining escrow shares were delivered to the IDT shareholders two years after the date of closing. As of December 31, 2002, no shares of NIC common stock remained in escrow., 478315=profitable in the second half of 2002 and expect the Company to be profitable and generate taxable income in 2004 and beyond. We have focused the business on operations we believe have demonstrable ability to produce positive taxable income and cash flow in the future. To achieve a sufficient level of future taxable income, we intend to pursue our current strategy of adding new government partners, broadening our service offerings, and increasing transactional revenues from our existing government portals. Based on information currently known to management, we believe it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the deferred tax assets. The table below reconciles income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for financial statement purposes with taxable income (loss) for federal income tax purposes (in thousands):, 1129682=and to provide additional incentive for such employees and directors to promote the success of its business through sharing the future growth of such business. The NIC plan was adopted in May 1998 and amended in November 1998 and May 1999. Under the NIC plan, the Company is authorized to grant options for up to 9,286,754 common shares. Employee options are generally exercisable one year from date of grant in cumulative annual installments of 25% to 33% and expire four years after the grant date. At December 31, 2003, a total of 1,679,759 options were available for future grants under the NIC plan. The SDR plan was adopted in May 2000 in conjunction with NIC\u0092s acquisition of SDR. Under the SDR plan, the Company is authorized to grant options for up to 229,965 common shares. No options that are in addition to those granted upon the close of the SDR acquisition will be granted under the SDR plan. There have been no option repricings under the plans., 911066=4. ACCOUNTING FOR THE 1998 EXCHANGE OFFER, 1533=For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, 1100910=to developments arising in the second half of 2001 relating to NIC Conquest\u0092s migration to a common operating platform for its core UCC and corporations filing applications, the Company determined that the balance of revenues remaining to be recognized under existing application development contractual obligations was not expected to cover anticipated costs of developing and implementing the related applications and accrued losses of approximately $6.0 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2001. These losses coupled with the significant underperformance of this business and uncertainty regarding future performance of this business cast substantial doubt as to whether NIC Conquest\u0092s NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets could be used in the future. Consequently, in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company provided a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $5,284,576 for the net deferred tax asset relating to NIC Conquest. The Company acquired 100% ownership of NIC Conquest on April 8, 2002. As a result of the change in ownership, the Company released the portion of the valuation allowance that was not related to NIC Conquest\u0092s tax NOL carryforwards generated through the date of the change in ownership. The NIC Conquest deferred tax asset valuation allowance was $3,214,026 at December 31, 2002., 364427=Financial Analysis of Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, 43440=In a November 2002 survey, the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that 66 million people, or 65% of all Internet users in the Unites States, had sought information directly from a local, state or federal government Web site during the last three months, a 65% increase in the same period in 2000. In the same survey, 80% of all Americans said they found the information they needed while visiting a local, state or federal government Web site., 425308=expense in cost of software & services revenues, which approximated $0.3 million in the prior year period. In addition, we have significantly reduced the number of dedicated employees related to AOL and, as a result, have reduced employee payroll costs by approximately $0.2 million in 2003., 1257191=2001, 801201=was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated period of benefit. Had the Company been accounting for its goodwill under SFAS No. 142 for the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company\u0092s net loss and net loss per share would have been as follows:, 361758=years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, total net deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards, were the largest asset included in our consolidated balance sheets and comprised approximately 48% and 41%, respectively, of our total assets., 1025498=approximately 27% of Tidemark, a non-public company, through 4,530,396 shares of Series B voting Preferred Stock. The investment was accounted for under the equity method. In 2000, the Company determined that it would not be able to recover the entire carrying value of its investment and adjusted the carrying value of its investment, primarily relating to goodwill, to its estimated fair value. This adjustment resulted in a noncash impairment loss of approximately $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2000. In addition, NIC recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately $2.0 million to offset the deferred tax asset the Company had recognized relating to its investment in Tidemark. In May 2001, a private technology company acquired Tidemark for cash consideration of approximately $1.6 million. NIC received approximately $700,000 in cash from the transaction and had no investment balance remaining after the acquisition. NIC realized a gain of approximately $300,000 from the transaction, which the Company deferred until the end of the two-year indemnification period following the closing of the acquisition that covered the selling shareholders\u0092 representations and warranties made in the acquisition agreement. The Company recognized this gain in May 2003, which is included in Equity in net loss of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003., 849626=exercise of employee common stock options and common stock warrants using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003:, 439507=subcontractors that are not directly tied to payments to us by the California Secretary of State. The increase in accrued expenses in the current year was partially due to accrued subcontractor costs on this project, as we are not required to pay certain subcontractors until we receive major milestone payments under the contract. For additional information on the major milestone payments we expect to receive under this contract, refer to the discussion below. The increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable in the current year were mainly attributable to an increase in revenues from our portal businesses in Alabama and Kentucky, which began to generate DMV revenues in the current year (a $1.6 million increase in accounts receivable), and to an increase in fourth quarter tax receipts from tax filing applications in Hawaii, Indiana and Dallas County (a $2 million increase in accounts receivable). The majority of these tax receipts were remitted to our government partners in January 2004., 343127=underperformance of this business. NIC Technologies had been integrated as the application development organization for our portal businesses. However, a series of organizational restructurings completed in the third quarter of 2001 led to significant layoffs at NIC Technologies and a shift in application development from what were previously centralized development operations in Westlake Village, California and Pune, India to regionalized operations in selected state portals. In total, less than 25 employees who were employees of the original SDR Technologies were employed with NIC at September 30, 2001, down from a previous high of approximately 85 employees at the date of acquisition in May 2000. Additionally, we determined that the value of the technology intangible relating to the SDR acquisition was impaired. We significantly curtailed funding of all research and development-stage technology projects that did not have demonstrable and immediate positive financial returns for the Company. Specifically, future funding to actively develop and market the Company\u0092s Web iVR technology was significantly scaled back. This Web iVR technology was the primary value driver of the product technology intangible resulting from the SDR acquisition. Goodwill related to the SDR acquisition primarily represented the benefits we expected to receive from a centralized application development organization. Since we abandoned that strategy and eliminated most of the development resources acquired with SDR, management concluded the goodwill no longer had value. We recognized a $27.6 million impairment loss in the third quarter of 2001 representing the unamortized balances of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the SDR acquisition. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2001 we continued to evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software at NIC Technologies. We determined that the expected future cash flows of NIC Technologies would not be sufficient to recover the capitalized software assets and $1.0 million was expensed as an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2001., 1031942=to project cost overruns on outstanding contracts in Arkansas, Minnesota and Oklahoma. In the fourth quarter of 2002, management reversed $800,000 of accruals recorded in the second quarter of 2002 related to its contracts in Arkansas and Oklahoma as these contracts are expected to cost less to complete than management estimated. At December 31, 2002, the Company had fulfilled all obligations under its contract with the state of Minnesota. At December 31, 2003, the Arkansas and Oklahoma systems had been accepted and are currently in the maintenance phase. At December 31, 2003, the accrual for remaining application development contracts in Arkansas and Oklahoma was approximately $0.5 million, which management believes is adequate. Because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating the costs of completion, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimate will change in the near term., 432570=depreciated. We expect depreciation expense for 2004 to range from $1.9 to $2.1 million. We expect amortization expense for 2004 to be less than $0.1 million, the majority of which will consist of the amortization of internal use capitalized software development costs., 336456=revenues when notified of the amount due from AOL, which is approximately one month after the advertisement is provided. We experienced a significant decrease in revenues from our AOL business in 2003 as compared to prior periods due to continued weakness in AOL\u0092s online advertising operations. Our contract with AOL ends in December 2004, or earlier if quarterly advertising revenues do not reach specified levels. The AOL business is no longer considered to be of continuing significance to the Company as further discussed below., 395789=to generate DMV revenues in mid-September 2003, and 6%, or approximately $2.2 million, was attributable to an increase in same state portal revenues (states in operation and generating DMV revenues for two full years). Same state portal revenues in the current year increased 7% over the prior year primarily as a result of increased transaction volumes from our Iowa, Indiana, Utah and Maine portals. Our Iowa portal began to generate DMV revenues beginning in January 2003 as a result of a new contract with the state of Iowa, which was previously a time and materials portal management contract. The increase in revenues from our Indiana, Maine and Utah portals was the result of the addition of several new non-DMV applications during the year. Our same state revenue growth in the current year was less than the growth we have achieved in recent years due primarily to a 1% year-over-year decrease in same state DMV revenues. While we generally expect same state DMV revenues to grow only 1% to 3% per year, we experienced a large increase in same state DMV revenues in 2002 due in part to more robust U.S. automobile sales than in the current period. Same state non-DMV transaction-based revenues increased 35%, or approximately $2.5 million, in the current year due to the addition of new revenue generating applications throughout our existing portal businesses.}",
