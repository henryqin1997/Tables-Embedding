We always have an open salad and cereal (so when in doubt!). For those people that don't do gluten then there is always a gluten free option of the meal. The food is mostly always good. You will see the same meal every time throughout the semester but you will always get a surprise here or there. The dining is good (in Fall 2012 the new DC will be revealed). With the new DC there is going to be a lot of options of where to eat. What I find nice is that professor come and eat with us along with there families. It's always nice to see the theology department start a debate and students start crowding around.}",
