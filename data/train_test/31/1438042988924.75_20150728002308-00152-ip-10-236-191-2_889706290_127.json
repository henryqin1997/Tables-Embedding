            "I am vegan, so it is awesome! There is something every day for me to eat and it varies. There are also days I come across vegan cookies and brownies:) It you are not vegan/vegetarian there is a lot to choose from also. There are 3 main dining halls. I eat mostly at West Campus and the new dining facility at Bay Street.",
            "It is what you make of it, Busy schedules don't leave a lot of time for social interaction on the floor. I met my roommate on BU facebook page class of 2017. We chatted for several weeks before we felt we were compatible. We love the same music, books, poetry and we are both science majors. Our floor has monthly meetings, but we haven't had any social outings yet.",
            "Each class is four credits, which leaves two credits remaining to fill in with physical education classes which vary from .5 to 2 credits. The four classes fill up you time quickly, including the outside study and prep of these classes. If you add a job into the schedule, it is tough. I currently have only 1 credit physical education class in my schedule. Adjusting to living away for home for the first time, and taking science base classes, I am finding I like BU very much, but it is HARD.",
            "West campus is a space that gives you the most traditional campus feeling , all other housing, is definitely city living; you walk right out of your dorm onto the city street. The BU shuttle is a great way to travel to classes, but I have gone through 75.00 in two months using the T to visit friends at Emerson, Northeastern and just visiting Boston. If you live in the dorms, a meal plan is required. I have the 14 day plan which gives me two meals a day. I use convenience points for a day I can't get to the dining halls and also use the points when I do my laundry.",
            "A sense of community has been apparent from orientation to now my second month at BU. I am very busy from morning to night with my classes and job. But, my roommate and other friends from Northeastern and MIT are able to see each other and enjoy some concerts and fun in Boston!"

Also, study hard because Boston University accepts mainly AP class kids and 2000 SAT score kids., 40346=As soon as I visited BU on Accepted Students Day in Spring of 2010 I knew I wanted to go here! Ever since it's been perfect. I can absolutely see myself here for the completion of my undergraduate career. The only reason why I'm not really considering it for graduate school is because of the weather - coming from Maine, I'm already sick of the winters. I always say that BU is in its own corner of Boston; if we want to stay only around college peers all we have to do is stay on campus, but there's literally a 5 minute walk to Kenmore Square, 10 minutes to Fenway, and 20 minutes to Newbury St. It's amazing!, 584975=It is what you make of it, Busy schedules don't leave a lot of time for social interaction on the floor. I met my roommate on BU facebook page class of 2017. We chatted for several weeks before we felt we were compatible. We love the same music, books, poetry and we are both science majors. Our floor has monthly meetings, but we haven't had any social outings yet., 548355=The new mean SAT score at BU is 2016, and it's rising every year-- 2013 had an all time low admittance rate of around 30%. It sits right across the river from the mavericks: MIT and Harvard-- and it's doing everything in its power to compete., 612040=Unfortunately, SATs are one of the most important things BU looks at when awarding financial aid. Make sure you score above a 1950 and you'll probably get a merit scholarship., 694949=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 608687=There is a huge seal on the ground in Marsh Plaza (located in central campus) that is rumored to hold bad luck (namely, no diploma awarded) for those students who walk over it. After graduation in May, one can see many graduated seniors triumphantly standing on top of it, having their pictures taken., 225778=I love living in Warren Towers. It houses about 1800 students (primarily freshman) and you get that true dorm living lifestyle!, 329832=All dining foods are great. There are special nights in each dormitory where chefs come in and compete. The GSU (student union center) also has good food. There is a new dining place opening fall 2012 with a whole new variety. There are literally tons of good restaurants in nearby Boston that anyone could access although the food may be a little overpriced., 126853=Let this be a cautionary tale for those with tight budgets (or budgets at all...)- This is the only field I can really fill out- I just got accepted here as a transfer student, and I was nominated for a scholarship through my community college. Shortly after my acceptance, however, I received notice of my financial aid assistance. Out of the $50,000+ in tuition and fees, I was eligible to receive only $9,100, which includes the loans they offered me, which is a hole I am not planning on digging for myself. No- I did not receive my scholarship, and I was frankly not expecting to. A scholarship is a gift, a happy surprise. But still - the ONLY need-based aid they were willing to give me was my $2600 Pell Grant! Seriously? Let me give you my background- I am one of four children. We live in a *tiny* condo. Only *one* of my parents works full-time, and his pay schedule is at times unreliable. OK, we do have enough money to eat, be clothed, and have heating and electricity, but still! We don't go on exotic vacations. We do stay-cations in Boston. Or sometimes hop on a bus to NYC to visit my aunt and baby cousins. C'mon. I'm sorry, no matter how great of an academic/social/whatever experience other students have had, this is a big deal-breaker. I kind of hope this some mistake- someone forgot to add an extra zero, or they fell asleep at the calculator. But I am only too sure that I would be so wrong., 352084=You name it they have it. I am into music, accapella and theater groups. However, there are so many to mention. SPLASH, in September, is where they all come together.}",

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Great for anyone! There is definitely something for anyone as long as you are willing to look. Tips for prospective students Save save save your money and work work work hard! Then you will get the bang for your buck. Bang for the buck Simply put, BU is expensive. Am enjoying being here There is so much to do here! Thousands of students that provide student-led activities as well as the school providing stuff to do. For example, at BU Central, students book bands to come and play for students for FREE! The school also does things for students, like teh parade held last year to honor the hockey team in their national victory. Am learning a lot I've only given four stars due to my lack of interest in the required courses. I understand the purpose behind them, but they really put a damper on my enjoyment of my classes for my major. I absolutely love those classes (SMG Business) and the Professors are amazing!
