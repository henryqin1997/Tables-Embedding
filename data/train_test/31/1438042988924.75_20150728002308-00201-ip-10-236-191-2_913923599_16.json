The dining is only open for a few hours, so if you can't go because your in class until 7:30 good luck eating dinner. They have now opened the grill until later and allowed students to use their swipes for meals instead of their cash., 33949=It is quite expensive to go here. For the fall 2012 semester, it is about $17,000. During the spring of 2012, it was about $16,000, so tuition is rising, but so is everything else in the economy.
