The Sydney Airport Jets turned in a collective shocker in this Premier League competition match, with North Sydney winning their first game of the season by 28-18. The Bears thoroughly deserved their victory by out-enthusing Newtown, making fewer errors and by punching holes through some rather brittle Newtown backline defence. The Jets fought back to trail 24-18 late in the second half, but missed opportunities and individual lack of discipline brought them undone. Best players for the very out of sorts Jets were Billy Najarrin, Tabua Cakacaka (who was placed on report, and is likely to miss next Saturday's game against his former club Canberra), Nathan Marles and Russell Richardson (whose two tries kept Newtown in the game). The Jim Beam Cup match away to Woy Woy was cancelled due to the waterlogged ground, and will probably be played in late August. The Sydney Airport Jets are drawn away this coming Saturday (May 24) to the Canberra Raiders at Seiffert Oval, Queanbeyan, while Newtown's Jim Beam Cup team travel to Erina., 24178=THE preliminary 25-member NSW squad for the rugby league State of Origin series beginning June 11 has been selected. Centre's Mark Gasnier and Matt Gidley have been included after previously being snubbed, along with rookie prop Ryan O'Hara after his stirring performance on Friday night for Country. The squad will be trimmed back to 17 a week before the game with a lot of attention placed on the five-eighth position now that Trent Barrett has been injured and overlooked. Braith Anasta would be the obvious replacement with Craig Wing possibly providing some versatility off the bench in that area., 12946=THE NZ Warriors are working hard to secure the majority of their player roster for 2004. With just over a month before anti-tampering restrictions come off on June 30, coach Daniel Anderson said the club had already sealed deals with two players.}",
