    "TableContextTimeStampBeforeTable": "{3827=To her name, Beyonc&eacute has more awards and accolades than one can count, among them 16 Grammys, 11 MTV Video Music Awards, and the Billboard Millennium Award. She has sold 75 million records worldwide, has been ranked first on Forbes list of the \"100 Most Powerful and Influential Musicians in the World,\" and has been involved in countless philanthropic projects, marketing initiatives and entrepreneurial activities. Alongside husband Jay-Z, her greatest accomplishment may be the birth of a daughter, named Blue Ivy Carter, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York on January 7, 2012., 5799=Beyonce's fifth studio album is scheduled for release later this year. It was recorded in 2012 in the Hamptons, New York, and features production from Timbaland, Pharrell, The-Dream and Justin Timberlake., 6197=Of course, what would Beyonce be without controversy? She created plenty of it when she and Jay-Z visited Cuba for their fifth wedding anniversary \u2013 a trip that came under fire by two U.S. congressmen. It was followed by the start of Knowles' \"The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour,\" which kicked off on April 15 in Belgrade, Serbia and runs 92 dates worldwide until December., 2653=The Jay Z-curated, Budweiser-sponsored, and all-American Made in America Festival will once again grace the City of Brotherly Love. Made in America is set to return to Philadelphia\u2019s Benjamin Franklin Parkway this Labor Day weekend, September 5-6, with headliners Beyonce,\u00a0Beyonce and Beyonce. Need we say more? OK, The Weeknd, Axwell & Ingrosso, J. Cole, Bassnectar\u2026, 7624=Was it their 'destiny' to reunite? The start of 2013 saw the solo career of Beyonce Knowles take a back seat to Destiny's Child as the group released \"Love Songs,\" a compilation album of romance-themed songs from their previous works and the newly-recorded \"Nuclear.\" And the fan fervor it sparked was a much bigger PR score for Knowles than the debacle of her lip-synching performance of the U.S. national anthem at President Barack Obama's second inauguration in Washington D.C. on January 21st., 5240=Born September 4, 1981, in Houston, the superstar-in-training was just 9 years old when the groundwork was laid for the early beginnings of the group Destiny's Child. The quartet signed with Columbia Records in 1997, scoring its first No. 1 a year later with \"No, No, No\" \u2013 the first single from the act's self-titled debut album., 6651=The ball kept rolling for Beyonce when her feature-length documentary, \"Life is But a Dream,\" aired on HBO on February 16. The film, which she directed and produced herself, featured footage from throughout her life, straight through the birth of her first daughter. Following its premiere, she signed a global publishing agreement with Warner/Chappell Music, which will cover her future songwriting and upcoming studio album., 9006=What's more impressive about the aforementioned video? It contains gunfights, explosions, dancers and excerpts for several different songs. A closing screen also showcases the director, the producers and various behind-the-scenes roles like editor, sound designer and wardrobe stylist. In the middle of it all are both Jay Z and Beyonce, whose first collaboration on such a project was 2002's \"03 Bonnie & Clyde,\" and its 2013 sequel \"Part II (On the Run).\", 7988=The 16-city \"On the Run\" tour will mark the first time Beyonce and Jay Z have toured jointly. The trek kicks off June 25 in Miami. It will visit cities like Atlanta, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle before wrapping August 6 in San Francisco., 3210=Beyonc&eacute has since begun work on two new albums, and took the stage at Revel Atlantic City's Ovation Hall (May 25-28, 2012) to celebrate the resort's grand opening. In August it was announced she will produce, direct and star in a documentary about her life and career., 7089=Beyonce was quick to move along, because only one other event can upstage a Presidential inauguration. Try the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, held at the Mercdes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. The event not only allowed Knowles the chance to recover from her Presidential faux-pas, but she marched on to the 55th Grammy Awards and won for Best Traditional R&B Performance for \"Love on Top\" on February 10., 4874=The success was just a microcosm of what Beyonc&eacute would experience as an individual artist. When the group disbanded in 2005, she had solo projects already recorded (including 2003's \"Dangerously in Love.\") Her second studio album \"B'Day\" was released in September 2006 and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. Two years later came the emergence of her musical alter ego, formally introduced on the 2008 album, \"I Am\u2026Sasha Fierce.\" The album spun a string of hits: \"If I Were a Boy,\" \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),\" \"Halo,\" \"Ego\" and \"Sweet Dreams.\" The project also earned six Grammys, smashing the record for most Grammy Awards won by a female artist in one night., 4094=Beyonc&eacute's fourth solo project, \"4,\" bowed on June 24, 2011. It became her fourth consecutive No. 1 album on the Billboard 200, making her just the third artist in history to have her first four studio albums debut atop the chart.}",
