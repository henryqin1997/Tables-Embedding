            "This community and school has a very close-knit feeling to it. The teachers are all fantastic and always willing to help you and discuss issues with the class. Plus, it always feels like there's always activities for the students to do when they're not in class."

There is an area of town called Fairhaven where there are a ton of different little shops to go to as well as Boulevard Park to relax and goof off at. You can buy books, crafts, or even make your own piece of art at Creativity. In the downtown area, we have theaters (movies and plays), an imporv theater (where Ryan Stiles sometimes appears) and if you are 21 or over, this is where the bar an club scene is located. Also around town we have a mall where the discount movie theater is located, as well as the Value Village and Spirit Halloween store in October. There is also a location on Lake Watcom where you can rent Kayaks, sail boats, and wind surfers for really cheap., 362253=Apply early! Preferably before November 1st.

    "textAfterTable": "Bang for the buck Having just finished my first year at Western, I can honestly say that my time there thus far has been well worth the price. I have absolutely loved living in Bellingham, and being a part of the Western community is a ton of fun! Not only are classes fun and engaging, but there is always something going on on campus. Advisors and professors make themselves easily available to students, and the campus Tutoring Center is another great resource for helping students to succeed. I lived in the dorms this past year and found it to be comfortable and enjoyable. I would recommend that all students try living on campus for a year just for the experience if nothing else. In comparison to some other colleges around the state, Western definitely gives you the most bang for your buck. Am enjoying being here There is always something going on at Western, and Bellingham is a beautiful city. The campus is on top of a hill overlooking gorgeous Bellingham Bay and the eastern side of the San Juan Islands. Residential living is very comfortable, and the residence hall staff does their best to make sure that everyone feels comfortable and included in their new environments.
