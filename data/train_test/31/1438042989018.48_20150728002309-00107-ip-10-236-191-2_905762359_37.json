Your mind is capable of more than you know. Shoot for a school that\u2019s in your price range, but don\u2019t be afraid to be in debt, in 2010 students that graduated a four year university who took out loans owed on average $25,250 (New York Times, College Graduates\u2019 Debt Burden Grew, Yet Again, in 2010) just know it\u2019s going to carry into your life after college. Try and learn something from your G.E.\u2019s even if they seem boring or unrelated to anything you will be doing in the future. One more thing. Be nice to everybody! You never know who you\u2019re friends will be once you get there. Be willing to go hang with different types of people until you find that right \u2018fit\u2019 of people you really enjoy spending time with., 143940=California State University, Monterey Bay was built on the Fort Ord Army Base, which closed in 1994. Beautiful abandoned buildings surround the campus, and several of the buildings previously utilized in the Fort Ord Army Base have been refurbished into the campus as we know it today., 27414=Stay on top of your school work, because it takes a lot of self motivation to stay on track when those around you aren't. This is a great place to strive to be at the top of your class. If you got above 1800 on the SAT, that is a definite possibility if you are willing to work just a little bit harder than the other students. Also, respond to professors emails, and go to their office hours. These things will set you apart. Also, bring a car. The campus is set away from everything, which makes public transportation a hassle., 393892=\u00a9 2015, Cappex.com, LLC}",
