The weather and the Red Devils had something in common as the game got underway. The rain showers began to fall as the Red Devils took over the football after forcing the Eagles to punt. It was then Hardee time, as Red Devil Keith Hardee slipped around the end and raced 56 yards for a Red Devil touchdown. Hardee then slipped in to the end zone on the 2-point PAT lifting the Red Devils to a quick 8-0 lead.\u00a0, 24814=Williston Pioneer Sun News | circulation@willistonpioneer.com | 352-528-3343 37 South Main Street, Suite F, Williston, FL 32696 Office Hours are 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, 32158=Copyright \u00a9 2015}",
