Instant classics. And it's hard to deny the Whispers any sort of praise for the kind of work they've done. Soul Clock album. One single they did hit the R&ampB Top Ten, and it had the name 'Seems Like I Gotta Do Wrong.' The Whispers Tickets - The Music Is a Whisper in Your SoulTheir defining single was the track 'I Was Born When You Kissed Me.' But they really climbed the charts all the way to the top with 'The Time Has Come' from their Whispers, a band formed back in 1964. Sporting a 23-year saga of clear-cut R&ampB that would make R. Kelly shiver in his shirt, the likes of Los Angeles-born twins Walter and Wallace Scott along with Nicholas Caldwell, Marcus Hutson, and Gordy Harmon came together",
