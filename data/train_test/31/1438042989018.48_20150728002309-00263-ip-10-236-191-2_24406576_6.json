The eggs have been allowed to develop into larvae, which have fed on the wool fabric, making holes in it. A second layer made of silk-organza fabric and printed in a Persian carpet pattern, can be seen through the holes. The two layers of fabric are isolated in a glass display case. The installation engages the audience in dialogue and discussion. Current location:\u00a0 THS Description:\u00a0 Pontus Hammaren, H\u00e5kan Torstensson, Maria",
