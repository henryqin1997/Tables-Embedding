            "Report by Kit Lok: 7 writers on a cold day. Cindi told us briefly about the possible involvement of the program for Stockton\u2019s Day of Scholarship, with her co-presenting with Lisa Cox and maybe a cloth line for samples of our writings. We are excited about the possibility. One of the ladies said she will even take leave that day.",
            "Congratulations to Time to Tell participant, Belinda Manning for her work titled: The Long Journey Home, selected as one of the winning entries to the 21st annual New Jersey Wordsmith Competition. Her piece will be presented by members of the Unlimited Potential Theatre Company during the Joyce Indik NJ Readers Theatre on Saturday, May 30th at 2:00pm at the Crossroads Theatre in New Brunswick. Encouraged to submit her work by her instructor, Cynthia Inman Graham, Belinda is thrilled by the honor. We all wish her great success.",
            "Report by Kit Lok: Only seven braved the cold, six read. Most of us brought our Scar project embroidery and poem, as well as other poems from the class for Cindi, who will display them on the clothesline for the Day of Scholarship presentation with Lisa Cox. She encouraged us to turn up and read our poem that day. Cindi also told us about the possibility of our participation in the SCOSA May Festival. The festival is always well attended. Maybe we can do a clothesline display there too.",
            "Reported by Kit Lok: The sun was smiling and bestowing its warmth again today. Maybe that was why only 6 of us were at the workshop. Everyone read and we had more time for critique and suggestions. Also allowed Cindi to update and discuss with us at length our upcoming readings at DOS and SCOSA May Festival. We all voted to stay on at Noyes, but may occasionally meet at Stockton should we know in advance that there may be conflicting events at Noyes. Cindi and I went out for lunch after the workshop and enjoyed a lovely chat and sharing about our travels and writing experiences.",

Cindi strung the clothesline from the dropped media screen. It provided a nice backdrop to the presentation. Lisa and Cindi gave a short introduction. And then we all enjoyed the delicious hot buffet lunch provided. Marilyn also attended and read at the Tour of Poetry reading at 4.30pm facilitated by Emari.

A good representation from the Noyes and Northfield workshops. Started at 1.15pm, ended 2.50pm. Thank you very much to SCOSA for the opportunity and you for all your help. We hope this showcase will become an annual event for us as part of the SCOSA Festival.",
            "Reported by Kit Lok: We spent part of Saturday, May 16 morning discussing the rest of the series while Cindi is away. Decided that: - Group will continue to meet at Noyes on June 6, July 25, August 29. 10.30am to 12.30pm - Cindi supplied a set of prompts, one per month, which Kit or Meryl will scan and issue to the group, 2 \u2013 3 weeks prior to each meeting - Group to have an extra meeting on June 20, at Stockton. Meet at fireplace in Great Hall Campus Center, then adjourn to quieter spot nearby. - Cindi will email to inform group of her absence during June \u2013 July, back on Aug 29.Reported by Kit Lok on 5/20: I managed to get us the same training room for our extra summer 7/11 meeting. So group will continue to meet at Noyes on June 6, July 11, July 25, August 29. 10.30am to 12.30pm. See you in June with your inspired piece from Cindi's prompt posted by Meryl.",
            "Reported by Marilyn Weisman: The workshop this morning was a small group. It consisted of myself, Audrey, Lucy, Meryl and Gay. I brought a sign in sheet and had everyone sign it. We presented our pieces based on Cindy's prompt from a photograph and also presented Cindy (the groupie member)'s piece which she had e-mailed to us as she was not attending. After we all read, it was suggested that we keep copies of each of our pieces in Cindy's absence (this is Cindy the teacher) and to give them to her upon her return. We went over the remaining prompts so that everyone had a copy and was aware of what was to be done. At this point, without consulting my calendar or pages I don't remember when the next meeting is. Meryl will be sending through a copy of the list of prompts to everyone on the mailing list before the next meeting.",
