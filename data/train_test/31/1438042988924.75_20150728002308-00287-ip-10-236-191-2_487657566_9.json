At the end point A, there is an optical transmitter (not shown), and at the end point (B) there is an optical receiver (not shown). The optical signal to be transmitted from A to B has a wavelength \u03bb1 of 1540 nm. The transmission link is implemented with a single-mode optical waveguide 15 which has sufficiently good transmission properties at the wavelength \u03bb1., 31581=The wavelengths mentioned in the foregoing description are only examples of wavelengths for which the available system components are suitable.

    "textBeforeTable": "Citas de patentes The preferred embodiments admirably achieve the objects of the present invention; however, it should be appreciated that departures can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which is limited only by the following claims. Thus it can be seen from the foregoing specification and attached drawings that the optical signal transmitting system of the present invention provides an effective means for providing a second optical signal, such as a service channel signal, from the location of the fiber-optic amplifier in one direction or the other. The wavelengths mentioned in the foregoing description are only examples of wavelengths for which the available system components are suitable. It is, of course, possible to use other wavelengths, with the signal wavelength \u03bb1 lying in the range between 1520 and 1570 nm, and the pump wavelength being 532 nm, 800 nm, 980 nm or 1480 nm. By combining the two embodiments, a fiber-optic amplifier is obtained whose doped length of fiber is fed from a pump source at each of its two ends, so that two additional signals can be transmitted from the location of the fiber-optic amplifier in different directions of the transmission system. Thus, the embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 1 can be used if an additional signal has to be transmitted from the location of the pump source of the transmission link in",
