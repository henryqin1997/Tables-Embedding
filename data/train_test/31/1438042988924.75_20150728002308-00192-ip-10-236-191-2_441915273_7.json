            "Description",
            "IMAGE CAPTURE SYSTEM AND IMAGING OPTICAL SYSTEM - An image capture system including two imaging systems of the same structure each having a wide-angle lens, which includes a front group, a reflection surface, and a rear group arranged in order from an object side, has a field angle larger than 180 degrees, and bends an optical axis of the front group toward the rear group by the reflection surface, and an imaging sensor, obtains an image in a solid angle of 4\u03c0 radian by combining images imaged by the imaging systems. Each of the two wide-angle lenses includes the reflection surface between the front group and the rear group, the reflection surfaces are made to be common to the two imaging systems. This reduces an interval between lenses nearest to the object side in the front groups of the two wide-angle lenses, thereby reducing a distance between maximum field angles of the two wide-angle lenses.",
            "IMAGE PROCESSOR, IMAGE PROCESSING METHOD AND PROGRAM, AND IMAGING SYSTEM - An image processor includes a first converter to convert input images into images in a different coordinate system from that of the input images according to first conversion data based on a projection model, a position detector to detect a connecting position of the images converted by the converter, a corrector to correct the first conversion data on the basis of a result of the detection by the position detector, and a data generator to generate second conversion data for image synthesis from the conversion data corrected by the corrector on the basis of coordinate conversion, the second conversion data defining the conversion of the input images.",
            "IMAGE ADJUSTER AND IMAGE ADJUSTING METHOD AND PROGRAM - An image adjuster includes an area evaluator to calculate an area evaluation value for each color in each of divided areas of each of images captured by a plurality of imaging units, a brightness adjuster to calculate a brightness adjustment value for overlapping divided areas between photographic areas of the images on the basis of the area evaluation value for each color, and an adjustment value calculator to calculate a balance adjustment value for each of the overlapping divided areas from the area evaluation value for each color on the basis of the brightness adjustment value.",
            "IMAGE-PROCESSING SYSTEM, IMAGE-PROCESSING METHOD AND PROGRAM - An image-processing system includes a receiver which receives an input value defining an output range, a generator which generates a three-dimensional model having a target image attached to a three-dimensional conformation, a decision part which decides a position of a viewing point and a viewing angle in accordance with the input value, and a projector which projects the three-dimensional model from the viewing point, wherein the decision part changes a range of a target image inside a viewing field by changing the viewing angle preferentially when the input value is in a first range, and changes the range of the target image inside the viewing field by changing the viewing point preferentially when the input value is in a second range which is a wider-angle side than that of the first range.",
            "IMAGE CAPTURE SYSTEM AND IMAGING OPTICAL SYSTEM - An optical system includes a first lens to focus incident light, a first prism including a reflection surface by which light having transmitted through the first lens is reflected, a second lens to focus incident light from a different direction from a direction of the incident light on the first lens, and a second prism including a reflection surface by which light having transmitted through the second lens is reflected, in which the reflection surface of the first prism and the reflection surface of the second prism oppose each other.",
