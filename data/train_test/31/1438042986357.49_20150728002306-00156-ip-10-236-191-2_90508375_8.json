This is reserved for the Fedora design team, who will be creating the theme. If you find no collisions, make that notation in the \"Tested\" column. If the collision is outside the IT/computing market, you can still submit the name but you should note the collision in the \"Tested\" column, and include a link to the site where the collision was found. If you find a collision, it is best to find another name. Names that cause collisions will be eliminated by Red Hat's Legal department and thus waste their time, which is a valuable commodity for Fedora. Help us maximize their effectiveness by weeding out names that are trademarks of other entities, especially those in the IT industry. Use Google to search for possible trademark collisions. First search for the term itself along with \"+software\", and then broaden your search to include \"+computer\", \"+hardware\", \"+technology\", \"+IT\", and so on. Do not skimp on this step. Do make sure there are at least a couple of ways to link out of the new name to the next name -- and they must be unique too! Do avoid all previous links wherever possible.",
