            "So far, I've seen security roaming around the parking lot a lot. We also have those Blue Security things around campus in case of any emergency. Although I have heard a story about some kid a year ago where his car somehow got stolen (don't ask me how). So I'm not sure how well it explains the safety at school. The smartest thing to do is make sure you have your keys in a safe place, lock ALL your windows AND doors. For the women, don't leave your purses out in your car where people can steal them. Same goes for any cell phones or electronic devices. Just hid them in your cubby or underneath your seat.",
            "Phi Theta Kappa is the only thing that looks like Greek Life; however, it is only an Honor Society. The only way in is to receive a 3.5 GPA or greater. Once you're in, you need to have a 3.0 GPA or greater. It is your best bet in receiving a transfer scholarship when you transfer to a bigger university. It also gives you better way to get involved in leadership skills and in your community through volunteering.",
            "There are A LOT of clubs and activities to do at Valencia-East. They usually have the tables out front to have people join early in the semesters in front of the library outside. There are always activities going out between building 3 and 5 outside in front of the library that NO ONE should miss.",
            "Anyone who can't afford a lot for college , anyone who feels uncomfortable attending a big university, anyone who didn't receive scholarships after finishing high school or their GED who will find scholarships after transferring from Valencia (Transfer scholarships): This is the best place to be, no doubt.",
            "Behind the East Campus library, or when you're going to pass the International Breezeway (I believe that's what it's called) heading North, go downhill and you'll see a few benches underneath a tree and such. I've been there once or twice with friends to talk or eat lunch there. Don't be afraid to go there because the Environmental Science (or some other kind) apparently have classes there to study plants and such.",
            "The best part of Valencia is knowing that many UCF professors actually teach at there as well, so it's not like you're missing out from the difference in teaching because they all teach very similar. PLUS, UCF professors at Valencia...at a cheaper price= BIGGEST SAVINGS towards your money. Also Valencia is another great way to take courses that are available at the big universites at affordable and cheaper prices. Think about it, want to pay an extra $100-300 course at a big university when it's the same thing for a cheaper price at Valencia or any other community college?",
            "Join clubs. I've also seen on Tuesdays and Thursday at the East Campus, from about 11 or noon until about 2 or 2:30pm, that they have activities and games and food outside the library. So definitely buy some time and stop around to really get the environment of Valencia in you because you could meet more people that way.",
            "The coffee here is pretty good!! Although...if you're a Starbucks fan, nothing beats it. The only problem I have is the prices for the food and coffee. The coffee is nearly the same price for one at Starbucks (which is why I mentioned it earlier) because quality is a little less than Starbucks, but even then, it's still pretty good. I've had breakfast there, and the French toast is REALLY good; however, the price [again] is pretty up there.",
            "I live with my parents so Dorm Life is something I'm not aware of a lot. ALTHOUGH, I've heard about the pricing around UCF/Valencia area and it is expensive. There are REALLY nice apartments just outside of UCF that a bit expensive but practically brand new. Ones towards Valencia may not be as nice looking though~ So best thing to do is find some good roomates and equally distribute the pay that goes to the rent and such.",
            "I was in the I.B. program back in high school and it is because of how rigorous the courses were that I've done fairly well with my college classes. Sometimes it can be a challenge because you do have to discussions in many of your classes and I'm not the type who talks a lot in class, but once you open up, you REALLY learn a lot. The transition from high school to college (through Valencia) shouldn't be too hard except for more reading out cf class and writing and studying a lot as well.",
            "Don't be afraid of coming here. It really is a place to be when you're wanting to go to college but can't afford to go to the big universities. Enjoy being able to come here, go join clubs, meet new people and don't be shy because college is all about learning and obtaining experiences!",
            "It is a fantastic way to start college! The way the school has risen even after receiving the Aspen Award for being THE BEST Community College in the NATION has never stop them for caring for our education as students. Those involved in the school (professors, staff, office, etc) want us to thrive and succeed to the best of our abilities."

But if I found myself having to do so I'd be paying roughly $1200.00-1400.00 per semester for a full time schedule., 703953=Valencia is a very well kept school. It was very Spacious yet cozy when it came to the one-on-one relations with students and teachers from what I saw. I really don't know that much about Valencia so far. however, what I've seen already has me anxious and excited for Spring Semester 2013., 320741=Every year on October 13Th, Valencia campuses celebrate Matador Day which is there mascot. They have tons of free food and activities available to all the students, to just have fun and enjoy being a Valencia Student, 951051=Winner of the 2012 Aspen Award and it shows. Great school, there are many different avenues for support and the class sizes are small.

    "textAfterTable": "Categories Comments Great for these types of students Valencia is a great choice for those who want to go full time or those wanting to choose less credits per semester. Valencia allows you to work or tend to your family life while taking classes that will lead to your career goals. You choose the path and the pace. I strongly recommend Valencia Community College as the place to further your education! Tips for prospective students Choosing to further your education is the best decision you can make. Starting at Valencia then transitioning into UCF is a not only wise move, but more economical. Do your research and visit the campus and you will agree that Valencia Community College is a great school. Bang for the buck The cost of community college is what I like best. My family was unable to send me to university to start out so when we checked into starting out at Valencia we were sold. In state residents get a great tuition rate and the housing in the area is very reasonable. Will enjoy being here Because Valencia is in a very popular area, you will enjoy not only the school, but the area. Most student housing in",
