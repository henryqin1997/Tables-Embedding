The scope of the invention is determined by the claims that follow. Therefore, a method and apparatus for generating a process gas via a sublimation process for a semiconductor processing chamber is provided. It is to be appreciated that the sublimation and delivery methods of the present invention may be used in semiconductor, micromachining, MEMS, optics and other processing chambers that would benefit from reliable generation of process gas or gases using the sublimation methods and advantageous apparatus described herein. A thermally controlled carrier gas is used to drive a subliming reaction that produces a processing gas. The rapid response of the subliming reaction to the temperature of the carrier gas allows for rapid production and stoppage of processing gas production, providing subliming material conservation and faster system response times. Moreover, a canister that holds the subliming material is modular and isolatable, thus facilitating rapid replacement during use to limit system downtime while providing a transportable vessel that may be recharged with new subliming material for future use. Optionally, the second end 516 of the tube 512 may be adapted to diffuse the carrier gas flowing out of the tube 512 into the canister 500. The second end 516 may include a plurality",
