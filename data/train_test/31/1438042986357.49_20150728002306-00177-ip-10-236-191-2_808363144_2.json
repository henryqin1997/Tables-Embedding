    "textBeforeTable": "Grammar 6. Palatalization and Reduced Vowels 6.1. Palatalization of Velars As mentioned in the previous lesson, palatalization of consonants was a very productive process in the OCS language. Knowledge of such sound changes will be of assistance in looking up forms in the dictionary. For example, when confronted with ro\u017ed\u01eb, one must know to look up roditi. Thus it is appropriate to devote attention to some of the broad patterns governing palatalization. Palatization is a term denoting a change of a consonant in certain environments. When next to a \"front\" sound, a consonant becomes more \"front\". This is similar to the process whereby American English \"aren't you\" becomes \"arenchoo\". The t and y are brought closer to each other in pronunciation in a smoothing-out process. The dental t picks up some of the palatal articulation of the y, giving the ch sound. The same holds for palatalization of consonants in OCS, with a perhaps slightly different sense of what \"smoothed-out\" means. In the stages of linguistic prehistory leading up to the documents of OCS, there appear to have been three separate stages of palatalization which affected the velar sounds k,g,x. To see what distinguishes the stages, one must first briefly note the history of some of the OCS vowels. In particular, in Common Slavonic, there had been vowels e:, i: (long e and long i) and diphthongs ej, oj, aj;",

Given something to the right of \">\", in looking up a word in a lexicon, check under spellings to the left of \">\". 7. Reduced Vowels Reduced vowels is a common term denoting the jers \u016d and \u012d. In the language of the OCS texts, these reduced vowels were still pronounced. However, in the language of the scribes writing the manuscripts, they were well on their way out, and so one finds spellings of OCS words that reflect the scribes' own tendencies. In particular, jers are at times omitted, at other times changed into full (i.e. non-reduced) vowels. Whether omission or change to a full vowel would occur depended on the position the jer occupied within a word. One must realize, however, that \"word\" could mean any part of an utterance pronounced \"together\", without a break. 7.1. Strong and Weak Jers Of special importance is the distinction between strong and weak position",
