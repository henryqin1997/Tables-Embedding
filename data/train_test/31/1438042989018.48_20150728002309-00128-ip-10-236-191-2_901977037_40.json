The courses are easy to understand and each student has the option to take 7-10-15 week courses and are able to complete there degree. If it was not for the advisers, financial aid and instructors then I would not be close to graduation., 202034=I loved Davenport because it allowed me to return to school full-time as a wife, mother and full-time working adult. I received my Associate and Bachelors from there starting classes in the Fall of 2010 and ending in August of 2013. It was a great experience and I found an interesting new field in Health Information Management. The instructors were helpful and for both degrees I completed my courses primarily online with the exception of 2 on campus courses. I graduated with honors and feel so proud ad thankful for my experience there!, 125342=Be prepared to put in many study hours to do well. The 7 week accelerated courses are a great way to complete the program much faster. Apply for the in-house scholarship for $1500 per semester.}",
