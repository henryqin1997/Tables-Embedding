However, after such a wonderful start, he failed to secure his place in the senior side because of occasional lapses behind the stumps. He was recalled for the crucial 1995-96 tour of Australia, the turning point of his career as he combined with Sanath Jayasuriya to form a devastating pinch-hitting opening partnership. The pair's scoring rate revolutionalised one-day batting, and he was an integral figure in Sri Lanka's astonishing World Cup victory that winter. From then on, his batting style tempered somewhat and he set himself to play longer innings. The emergence of Kumar Sangakkara led to his marginalisation after 2000, although he made sporadic returns for both the one-day and Test team. The selectors' decision to ask Sangakkara to concentrate on his batting in Tests paved the way for a Test return in 2004 but his performances with the bat were patchy and, despite scoring 54 in his last Test innings, the selectors indicated a desire to look to the future when he was omitted for a 20-man training pool for New Zealand later in the year. He announced his retirement the day after, insisting that the time had come to focus on life after cricket. He coached Colts CC while conducting a career as an insurance executive. He was appointed by Sri Lanka Cricket to be a member of the 2006 ACC Committee to Evaluate China, and in 2008 took temporary charge of Malaysia.
