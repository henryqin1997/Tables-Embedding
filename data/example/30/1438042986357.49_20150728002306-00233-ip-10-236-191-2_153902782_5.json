Please correct me if I make any mathematical errors here. According to my experience (charts to back it up of course), for example, a 22\u2019 X10\u2019 log would weigh right at 1500 lbs. Using Doyle scale for milling that same log would yield 200 bft\u2026or starting at $3.75 bft in log form at $.50 a pound ? I can only assume that includes bark too at $.50 a pound as a bonus., 1944=05-11-2008 10:17 PM, 12695=Of course that was supposed to be a 22 inch x 10 foot log in the above example, mistype, sorry for not proofreading and any confusion. I will try to simplify the math a 1500 lbs log is $750, it should yield 200 bft = $3.75 bft., 24048=#12 posted 09-16-2008 05:22 PM, 14124=#7 posted 05-12-2008 06:18 PM, 10343=#5 posted 05-12-2008 02:48 AM, 3966=#1 posted 05-11-2008 10:38 PM, 5446=#2 posted 05-12-2008 01:14 AM, 21018=#10 posted 05-13-2008 02:45 AM, 47680=\u00a92015 Verticalscope Inc.
