It's good to see that there are still some clans playing clanwars every now and then and maybe max could give us a new years present by releasing RPM, hehe. \u00a0 I think it's kinda unique that a demo game is still being played 12 years after the release date so I guess we could be proud on ourselves to keep it alive",
