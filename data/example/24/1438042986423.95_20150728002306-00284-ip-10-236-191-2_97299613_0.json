(not to be confused with a regular flashing wich means your battery is too hot). I had to change my 9 cell battery after just 1 year and it's easy to find similar cases on a lot of forums. You can also check your battery health's meter. Turn your battery and use the charge meter button's secondary fonction. Keep it pressed down for 5 to 10 seconds and check the lights. In this mode, each lit up light represents a 10-15&#37; degradation. If all 5 lights are lit up, less than half of your battery's \"health\" remains and the laptop will refuse to boot if the battery is inserted. You can however continue to use the laptop with the battery out and the cord plugged in. Dell sells",
