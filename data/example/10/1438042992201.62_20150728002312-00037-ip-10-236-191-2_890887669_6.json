Copy cataloging Policy The College of Education Media Center (CoEMC), formerly the Learning Resource Center (LRL), regularly receives kits and game materials. This policy addresses the local cataloging of these resources. CoEMC purchases and receives materials as kits. Additionally, CoEMC takes accompanying or other materials and requests that M&C catalog these materials as a kit. Mathematics manipulatives and readers both fall under the latter category. A separate policy exists for College of Education Media Center Mathematics Manipulatives kits. For other created kits, please consult your supervisor. Help Viewing restrictions apply",
