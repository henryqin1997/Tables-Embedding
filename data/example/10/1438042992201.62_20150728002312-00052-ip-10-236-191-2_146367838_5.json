I am a wee bit happy to see a post here explaining it. I bought a WS 2000 when it came out and soon discovered that it wasn\u2019t really what I needed. I am very disappointed that its limitations were not explained well enough as they are now in the FAQ on your website. If the differences between 2000 and 3000 were apparent, I would have sprung for the 3000 and we would both be happier., 14440=#6 posted 10-14-2010 11:23 PM, 25091=I just talked with a CSR Spokesperson at Worksharp.Their modest cost to upgrade from a 2000 to a 3000 is 100 dollars, which ain\u2019t to bad but ain\u2019t too modest either as I told the CSR spokesperson on the phone. However, she did say she would through in an extra plate, a 31 dollar value if I decided to upgrade. Does this sound like a deal to you guys? Not bad as far as I\u2019m concerned. mike, 23088=#11 posted 10-15-2010 02:57 AM, 4915=1136 posts in 2432\u00a0days, 26579=#13 posted 10-19-2010 10:57 PM, 19569=#9 posted 10-15-2010 01:29 AM, 29680=#15 posted 10-20-2010 04:31 AM, 28087=#14 posted 10-19-2010 11:14 PM, 17890=#8 posted 10-15-2010 12:20 AM, 19417=1537 posts in 2169\u00a0days, 50715=\u00a92015 Verticalscope Inc.

David I have much respect for the Work Sharp folks and while I am ignorant of the issue, I agree with Neil and Dennis that seeing a company buck up, take responsibility and publicly apologize is admirable. I have had the WS 3000 for about 6 months now and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the product. Good technology has a price tag on it. But I think the price reasonable for the end result of what this product does. #15 posted 10-20-2010 04:31 AM 2136 posts in 2082\u00a0days",
