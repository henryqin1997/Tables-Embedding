But since some of the bands in the poll have done really amazing works, I left DT and Opeth aside, and voted for Ayreon. I love Arjen's every work, and music nowadays needs more artists like him. Also want to mention Evergrey, I'm a big fan of their early works. And Riverside did a damn GREAT job in their last album... I was really amazed with it. Did you check out Riverside early albums? It's not JUST their last album that is good. Oh, yes I have all of them, and I specially like the debut album, Out",
