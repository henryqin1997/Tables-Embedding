I found some data about the top 9 fields from various sources on the web and from Simmons's book (Twilight in the Desert). Application to Saudi Arabia with: a + b.log(i) + c.log(i)^2 > Size_Min URR= Sum_i(a + b.log(i) + c.log(i)^2) GraphOilogy for details). Once the PFL parameters are estimated we can derive an URR value by computing the area under the PFL curve given a small fieldsize cutoff: c=-0.1518/log(10)=-0.07. Interestingly, we get also the same value for the UK oil fields (see b=-1. Jean Lah\u00e8rrere has estimated the curvature for the world (excluding North America) and came up with the value c=0 and c the PFL curvature. In case of perfect self-similarity, we have i. we call Size(i) is the size of the oil field of rank where log(Size(i))= a + b.log(i) + c.log(i)^2 Parabolic Fractal Law (PFL) is an unperfect self-similar law where a quadratic term is added: The Fig. 1 Example of a simple self-similar object size distribution represented in a log(rank)-log(size) plane.

Because we have so little data, it will be difficult to reliably estimate a valid parabolic curvature. So we proceed asfollowing: The Field URR are ranked according to their size and represented in a log(rank)-log(URR) plane as shown on Fig. 2. When only an interval is available, we take the center value. a robust linear fit (no curvature) is applied on the data points (red line on Fig. 2). A parabolic model is then fitted using the slope established in 2) as first guess for the linear term b and a fixed curvature value c (blue lines on Fig. 2). The algorithm used for this step is the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The URR values are estimated from the areas under the PFL curves conditionally to a particular minimum oil field size as shown on Fig. 3. Fig. 2.
