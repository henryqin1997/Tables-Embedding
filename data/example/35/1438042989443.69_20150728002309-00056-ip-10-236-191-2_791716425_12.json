Lewis' article, an analysis of Boccaccio's work of that name as a source for Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, became for decades the most cited study of Chaucer's great poem, not only because of the insightful analyses of specific passages it offered but more importantly because of the powerful theory that drove it. Lewis contended that Boccaccio's version of the story was a product of the emerging Italian Renaissance, while Chaucer systematically re-medievalized it, emphasizing a medieval interest in didactic rhetoric and Courtly Love.[DL 2/1] \u00a319.95, 26549=[F1622] Tolkien, J R R.

The first publication of a deluxe edition of The Silmarillion, featuring the revised, reset text, The Silmarillion is an account of the Elder Days, of the First Age of Tolkien's world. It is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back, and in whose events some of them such as Elrond and Galadriel took part. The tales of The Silmarillion are set in an age when Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, dwelt in Middle-Earth, and the High Elves made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils, the jewels containing the pure light of Valinor. Included in the book are several shorter works. The Ainulindale is a myth of the Creation and in the Valaquenta the nature and powers of each of the gods is described. The Akallabeth recounts the downfall of the great island kingdom of N\u00famenor at the end of the Second Age and Of the Rings of Power tells of the great events at the end of the Third Age, as narrated in The Lord of the Rings. This was the first luxe edition of this pivotal work, featuring the revised, corrected text and including, by way of an introduction, a fascinating letter written by Tolkien in 1951 in which he gives a full explanation of how he conceived the early Ages of Middle-earth. Bound in quarter black leather, and set in a protective slipcase, still shrink wrapped. Immaculate copy \u00a3150.00, 39112=[F1561] Tolkien, J[ohn] R[onald] R[euel]..
