The Jet clamps were rated as the Top Tool choice while Woodcraft\u2019s were designated as the Top Value choice since there was a \u201d$7.00 difference per clamp for both 24\u201d and 50\u201d models., 27343=#13 posted 11-12-2008 06:37 AM, 23868=#11 posted 11-11-2008 08:55 PM, 1926=11-11-2008 01:01 PM, 17290=#7 posted 11-11-2008 07:58 PM, 12718=#5 posted 11-11-2008 07:21 PM, 20568=#9 posted 11-11-2008 08:49 PM, 22032=11776 posts in 2657\u00a0days, 28823=#14 posted 11-12-2008 07:54 AM, 10351=1426 posts in 2843\u00a0days, 17138=1271 posts in 2723\u00a0days, 3411=-- Tony - All things are possible, just some things are more difficult than others! - SKYPE: Heron2005 (http://www.poydatjatuolit.fi), 30562=#15 posted 11-12-2008 09:24 PM, 51336=\u00a92015 Verticalscope Inc.
