    "textBeforeTable": "Table 12. Proposed zones data structure. The data structure proposed for zones (see table 12) meets current AMS needs and provides the flexibility to expand in the future. In this structure, a zone can have many nodes and links. Specifically, a zone is the \"parent\" of nodes and links. For consistency, it is suggested that a zone is initially defined in accordance with TAZs and that a super zone or jurisdiction is a collection of zones. Proposed Structure When zones are manually defined by an analyst, it is possible that there are portions of a network that do not belong to any zone. A function should be included in the user interface (such as NeXTA) to check for and correct these gaps. A link can be dissected by a zone boundary and as a result is physically located in more than one zone. One solution is to include Link_a in Zone_i if more than 50 percent of the link length is located within Zone_i. In rare cases where a link is evenly split between two zones, the link can be assigned to the zone with fewer links or smaller ID. Generally, there are no obvious challenges to define zones for all resolutions. However, a few minor definition issues include the following: Challenges In the existing practice, zones are used in TDM and DTA. TDMs include TAZs that typically list the number of automobiles per household, household income,",

Table 14 shows some types of data that would go into a socioeconomic table. Note that different planning agencies have their own definitions of socioeconomic variables that are used for travel forecasting. Examples are as follows: Households can be divided into the following different groups: Dwelling unit types (e.g., single family, multi-family, etc.). Income categories (e.g., income quartiles). Age of head. Auto ownership category. Employment is often divided into different categories (e.g., manufacturing, service, retail, etc.). Table 14.
