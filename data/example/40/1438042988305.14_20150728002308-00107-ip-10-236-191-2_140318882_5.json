I really like them. I have not been turning for too long, but I learned an important lesson already: If you cannot sharpen your turning tools, you are going to have a bad time. Do some research on keeping your tools sharp. You will need to sharpen them a lot more often than you think. I had a lot of maple scraps that I practiced on. I think that turns quite well. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t learn on pine. As Terry mentioned it catches really easy. I wanted to play with some other lathe tools (skews, parting tools) so I chucked up a 2\u00d74 scrap. It actually looked really cool when I was done with it. I found it was a lot more difficult to turn than hardwood though.

You must be Have your say...show last 8 replies showing 1 through 15 of 23 replies View all replies \u00bb Pine is good because it\u2019s soft. It requires sharp tools to cut well, plus it\u2019s cheap/free. I also use branches from trees in the yard that I trim, firewood, storm cleanup debris, and like someone mentioned, make friends with a tree service, and you\u2019ll never be wanting. Most times, people want them to clear the debris, and the less they have to haul away, the better. That being said, make sure you don\u2019t get in their way or keep them waiting on you (They won\u2019t). Don\u2019t hesitate to walk right up when you see some working and ask if you could have a few slices from the tree\u2026the worst they can say is no. #",
