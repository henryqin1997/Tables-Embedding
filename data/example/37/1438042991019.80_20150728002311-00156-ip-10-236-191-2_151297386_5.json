Bought it in 1978 when I bought the RAS, and still have both of \u2018em. Bill, 4419=Yup, looks just like the radial arm saw book I got from Sears when I bought my radial arm saw back in 1972. I still have it in my bookcase and review it every once in a while. By the same token, I just finished refurbishing that radial arm saw with a new table (I replace them every 40 years), removed some surface rust that had accumulated, turned a new handle on the elevation mechanism that I had broken a couple of years ago, and generally brought it back to semi-new condition. It\u2019s still a workhorse and so accurate that I have often told my kids I thought I could shave with it. If yours is like mine, you\u2019ve got a gold mine. I realize Craftsman may not have the best reputation, but 40 years ago they were tops. And they just keep working., 9388=#4 posted 04-27-2011 06:35 AM, 30882=\u00a92015 Verticalscope Inc. All Rights Reserved. | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy, 2213=Just picked up an old RAS from someone that bought it, he thinks around 1972 for a home project. Beautiful condition but I don\u2019t have a camera for picks yet. The 3 drawer cabinet had some accessories and original owners manual as well as this book. Anyone ever seen one of these books before?, 2530=http://s1143.photobucket.com/albums/n636/Jahness59/?action=view&current=RAS.jpg}",

You must be Have your say... -- excuse my typing as I have a form of parkinsons disease I bought by fortune from a dear friend of mine who was in the tool business a large dewalt r.a.s three phase 440 volts complete with the large dewalt table completely dismantled and sold to me for a fair but not small price.I am very pleased with it.I guess many people didn\u2019t want a three phase industrial model with key locking electrics but I love it. Always have a set up for three phase which I don\u2019t have directly in and has to be accomplished via rotary convertors and invertors great fun.Alistair #5 posted 04-27-2011 10:38 PM 5774 posts in 2558\u00a0days home | projects | blog SCOTSMAN",
