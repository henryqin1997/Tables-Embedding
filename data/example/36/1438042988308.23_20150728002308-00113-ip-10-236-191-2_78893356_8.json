In the Functional Setup Manager (FSM), click Go to Task for the Manage Data Role and Security Profiles task. Searching for the Abstract Role Oracle Fusion Applications users may need to access Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM) person data, such as lists of person names, in their product interfaces. To provide this access, you assign predefined HCM security profiles to relevant abstract roles, such as Employee. This example shows how to assign security profiles to the Employee abstract role. Setting Up Data Security for Employees: Worked Example Therefore, one security profile can inherit the data instance set defined by another. In a position security profile, to secure positions by department or business unit In a person security profile, to secure person records by department, business unit, or legal employer You can include security profiles in other security profiles.

Roles are part of a user's identity and define the user's purpose and responsibilities. Within identity management, resources define what a user can and does do. In an enterprise, this typically translates into what resources a user has access to, what privileges they have on that resource, and what they have been doing on that resource. Resources can be application accounts or physical devices such as laptops or access cards. The enterprise owns the resources, secures them, and manages access to the resources by managing the user's identity and access. Relationships establish the portion of user identities that involve organizational transactions such as approvals. An Oracle Fusion Applications user and corresponding identity are usually created in a single transaction, such",
