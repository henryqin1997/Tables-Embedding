Feel free to ignore it, I won't be offended. 1) Minor nit: At the beginning of Part 3 you talking about swapping crafts for \"10 copper per skill point\". In the paragraphs above you talk about Skill Points and swapping for \"10 copper per crafting level\". I found \"per crafting level\" much more clear. I recommend saving the phrase \"Skill Points\" to talk about what the game calls Skill Points, since they are a factor in crafting. 2) Throughout when you talk about ways to get mats, you never mention the Gaiscioch Marketplace. That's where I plan to get a lot of my mats and \"sell\" a lot of what I make, personally. ;) For folks new to Gaiscioch, the marketplace is where crafters and buyers in our guild connect to fulfill orders, request items, or restock supplies. You place an order here on the website, and a crafter in the guild fills the order via in-game mail. Participating in the marketplace (even as a gatherer) is one way to earn contribution and raise your rank in the guild. It works great, and rewards helping out guildies if that's your thing. (But not required: it's against our credo to tell members how to play; if you prefer to buy/sell on the AH that's perfectly fine too.) \u00bb Edited on: 2012-08-21 12:50:57, 222159=Replied On: 08/11/2012 at 10:51 PM, 297170=Replied On: 08/20/2012 at 09:53 PM, 191065=Replied On: 08/08/2012 at 10:34 AM, 313424=Velad Freiceadan na Sailetheach GW2: Velad.1253 ESO: @Velad, 368520=Replied On: 09/04/2012 at 08:55 PM, 332843=Replied On: 08/23/2012 at 03:25 AM, 335749=Replied On: 08/23/2012 at 09:50 PM, 276056=Replied On: 08/18/2012 at 04:00 AM, 182583=Themau Saighdear na Iompr\u00f3idh GW2: thexmau.1805 ESO: @themau, 355415=Replied On: 08/27/2012 at 01:01 AM, 264933=Great guide, I really enjoyed reading that. No, strike that, this is an awesome guide! One small addition - for cooking only I believe - it's possible to have items listed in the discovery window that show up in red - because they are ingredients used in a recipe that you don't yet have the skill for. For example (completely making this up) say that potatoes are used in two discoverable recipes: french fries with a skill level of 50 and scalloped potatoes with a skill level of 75. If you have a cooking skill of 60, when you go to the discovery panel, you'll see your potatoes listed there as an ingredient. So you fiddle around and discover the french fry recipe. Yay! The potatoes will remain in the discovery grid, but they will turn red, because the undiscovered recipe (scalloped potatoes) is above your cooking skill! It's just another weird way that Cooking is different from other skills. @Lakshmi: I am going to guess you can possibly get yellow items in T2 by purchasing a rare insignia recipe off the crafting master and discovering an item that uses that rare insignia. I know this can happen in T3. \u00bb Edited on: 2012-08-17 07:02:34, 182785=Replied On: 08/08/2012 at 03:25 AM, 362959=Replied On: 08/31/2012 at 05:12 AM, 291472=Replied On: 08/19/2012 at 05:55 AM, 229147=Very nice post there, thanks for putting that together.

It would rock if Master Crafter is account based, cause I like crafting on alts. :) @Jerich -- I have some feedback on your OP now that I've had a chance to read it carefully. I hope this doesn't come off as harsh -- the guide is fantastic. All of this is =suggestions= regarding minor points. But this is your baby, and I won't be offended if you decide not to use them. :) - \"Guild Wars 2\". On the official site \"Guild\" and \"Wars\" are two separate words. - The \"Why?\" section. While gathering is a separate system, I think it's worth giving it a nod here. Mainly because it's SO MUCH XP! Even if none of the other Why Crafting? reasons appeal to a person, they should consider gathering for the XP alone. - The Chart (overall this is awesome!). The \"Item Upgrades\" the Jeweller can craft can only be used in Accessories. (Much like armor professions make armor-only Runes, and weapon professions make weapon-only Sigils). It's confusing, since raw gems can be used in any gear. Once a jeweler improves them, however, they become Accessories-only. I discovered a few in my testing and they all had the word \"Jewel\" in them. So a good analog to \"Weapon Sigils\" for jeweler might be \"Accessory Jewels\". - \"What are the steps?\" Section. For \"Break down drops\" I'd recommend you add a half sentence about _how_. Many folks will have no GW1 experience, and be unfamiliar with Salvage Kits. (Actually, a big source of materials for me when I'm crafting is salvaging that thing I just crafted.) - \"Choosing your profession\" section. You say \"N out of ten armor slots\" -- what qualifies as an armor slot? There are the six key armor pieces: Head, shoulders, chest, legs, hands, feet. Then 5 accessory slots: Neck, fingers x2, ears x2. If you are lumping Armor + Accessories together (which I agree is useful) shouldn't the total be 11? - Presentation of \"armor slots\" counts. Maybe rename the count to \"gear slots\"? Also, presenting the count as a fraction -- \"(6/11 gear slots)\" -- might make comparison between the various professions easier. - Crafting Material Distribution chart. First I just want to say how awesome this chart it -- it does a perfect job of expressing the inherent difficulties in each craft. I _love_ that Fine Crafting Mats are in red, because in my experience they have been the gating factor for crafting in every craft that uses them. More red = harder to level. I think there's an implication of this that belongs somewhere in your guide(s): unless you have a character able to hunt the creatures that drop the Fine Crafting Mats, you may find it difficult to level a craft that is dependent on them. Possibly, if you have lots of Family Vault Credits stockpiled you get enough through the Marketplace to level that craft without adventuring, otherwise expect to hunt those Fine mats down in the world (or the Trading Post). - \"Sell your goods\" section. First let me say my hat's off to you for tackling this topic -- it's a complex one! I think it's a good start but there are some other factors left to consider still. Your chart shows Demand, with two assumptions: 1) Supply is proportional to Demand, and 2) items for all crafts have equal competition from other sources (rewards from drops, hearts, dungeons, WvW, etc). You've already mentioned popular vs. unpopular classes (which skews Demand); there are sure to be other factors like relative ease of leveling a craft (which skews Supply), appeal of specific items based on cosmetic appearance, stats or bonuses, and more. My two suggestions are: 1) revisit/refine this topic periodically after the game goes live and we see how the Market behaves, 2) have a few different charts to illustrate the key factors rather than trying to sum it up in a single chart. - Alts/epic weapons. I read speculation somewhere that the components of an epic weapon will Account-bound. If so, then this is a non-issue in the One Character vs. Alts discussion. Again let me congratulate you on a great guide Jerich. :) \u00bb Edited on: 2012-08-11 18:27:41, 207302=Replied On: 08/10/2012 at 11:13 AM, 262748=Great stuff, as always. Love the new chart! Do Rare items start in T2? I'd have to check again in the next stress test (or launch) but I think my T2 tailor was able to discover only Green recipes. If there's a way to get Yellow recipes for T2, what's the trick? :) For tier 3 ore, what do non-jewelers use? Iron (refined into Steel)? \u00bb Edited on: 2012-08-17 05:56:59, 364882=Replied On: 08/31/2012 at 09:52 AM, 341330=Replied On: 08/24/2012 at 05:33 AM, 329220=Replied On: 08/22/2012 at 12:09 PM, 378889=Replied On: 09/14/2012 at 03:58 PM, 343474=Luneaus Muinntir GW2: rakesha.2081 ESO: @rhombazoid, 376733=Replied On: 09/13/2012 at 05:39 PM, 374534=Replied On: 09/09/2012 at 11:15 PM, 303048=Replied On: 08/21/2012 at 05:48 AM, 372122=Replied On: 09/06/2012 at 02:46 PM, 287470=Replied On: 08/19/2012 at 01:10 AM, 251811=Thanks guys, I am glad you are finding it useful.

That graph was kind of hard to read (It was not just your eyes)so I spent this afternoon fiddling with it. Altogether it took me about 10 tries to get the darn chart to a more readable state. It is just so much information in boxes that when I added color it created some optical illusions. I then desaturated the colors and that helped some, but I still wasn't satisfied. Eventually I switched from boxes to circles of various sizes. I think this helps because it adds a second level of visual cue as well as adds some much needed white space that you can rest your eyes on. I think that is all I am going to do for now with this chart as I already have about 8 hours invested in it. Thanks for noticing that Wolfox! Playing as a level 33 in a newbie zone, I did find it easier than being level appropriate. That being said, I can see how the wording was missleading because the level scaling does make early content much more difficult when over-leveled than any other MMO I have played. I can't just go in and two shot champions or veterans. I updated that box to be more informative. Let me know if that clarifies it enough.

I bumped chef up 2 levels. For weapon I did greater than 50 percent extreme. Between twenty five and fifty, very. Artificer makes 4 of guardian's 11 weapons. That would be very useful. Potions bumped it up to extremely. I was originally going to make it very, but I switched so I would be more consistent. Thanks for checking out the image size!:) Edit: I think you have a good point though. I am kind of torn in respect to making it very good or extremely good. If you still think it should be very good, I will change it. Thanks! \u00bb Edited on: 2012-08-16 15:29:15, 239467=Replied On: 08/14/2012 at 06:15 AM, 273834=Thank you for all the positive feedback! T3 non-jeweler is Steel (Iron alloyed) T4 non-jeweler is Darksteel (Platinum alloyed) Should I add that info to the chart?

If the invisible bag and safe box prevent you from seeing the item when at a vendor... would it also prevent an item from being sent to your bank when you select \"deposit all collectibles\"? Yes, invisible bags do not send their contents to the bank when you choose \"deposit all collectibles.\" I found this pretty annoying, to tell the truth, as I got used to displaying my inventory as bagless, and I'd pick \"deposit all collectibles\" then I'd say 'why didn't those totems go anywhere?' \u00bb Edited on: 2012-08-21 19:21:46, 195020=Replied On: 08/08/2012 at 02:40 PM, 283459=Replied On: 08/18/2012 at 07:16 PM, 337637=Replied On: 08/24/2012 at 12:00 AM, 181005=Also, do you like graphics like the at a glance crafting chart, or should I just stick with text?

Crafting Cycle and Guild Wars 2 Discipline Usefulness by Profession - Put the Profession / Discipline Lists into a table to make them more compact - Added a Three things Everyone Should know about GW 2 to the top to highlight the usefulness of crafting. Small Changes - Increased the size of the starting image - Modified the Crafting at a Glance chart to correctly show that jewelcrafting upgrades are accessory specific. - Added a line after the Crafting at a Glance chart to clarify questions people may have. - Added a phrase to the Guildwars Crafting Steps Section to explain salvaging. (The cycle chart should help too) - Added another line to the crafting material distribution section to highlight that fine crafting materials are a bottleneck. - Modifies the Discipline by Profession list to correctly show 5 out of 11 gear slots (I played around with fractions, but they did not look right on the list to me) - Added a line to the crafting for profit section explaining that supply will also be a factor and directing people to part 6 of the guide for more information. - Modified all infographs and text (that I saw anyway) to say Guild Wars 2 instead of Guildwars 2.
