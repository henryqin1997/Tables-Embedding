            "In the dystopian future of the year 2052, society slowly spirals into chaos. A lethal virus, the \"Gray Death\", ravages the world. The only vaccine, \"Ambrosia\", is in such short supply, it is only available to those wealthy enough and deemed \"vital to the social order\". With no hope for a cure for the common people, riots occur worldwide and a number of terrorist organizations have formed. As a response, the United Nations has created The United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO). You assume the role of JC Denton, a nanotechnologically augmented UNATCO agent. After completing his training, JC gets slowly plunged into the world of augmentations, human misery, and conspiracies, determined to uncover the truth behind the real world order. Deus Ex is an unquestionable masterpiece of a game. With its excellent blending of genres (RPG and FPS), ambitious and multi-layered storyline, and highly interactive and expansive environments it is a \"living legend\" among gamers. The level of flexibility in character development allows you to follow your own style of gameplay. Stealth, combat, deception, hacking - whatever works, and there is no \"best\" choice, only \"your choice\". Every skill you invest in counts (except for swimming!) and opens new possibilities. So find out for yourself why Deus Ex is on all those \"Greatest Games of All Time\" lists.",
