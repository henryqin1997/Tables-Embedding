I installed it in my own home in 1976 or 1977 and it was still serviceable when we sold the home in 2000. I think it is competitive with Formica. I have laid Formica brand plastic laminate that wanted to separate into layers and also had a 5\u2019 x 12\u2019 sheet that started breaking at an inside corner like it had internal stress. It wouldn\u2019t stop cracking. The pieces were set back and used on a later job but it is funny stuff. I have no problem with Wilsonart but like you I have never heard of vertical laminate in my area., 17928=#8 posted 02-09-2012 03:45 PM, 16118=#7 posted 02-09-2012 12:41 AM, 4012=#1 posted 02-08-2012 06:30 PM, 7249=2141 posts in 1390\u00a0days, 9721=1124 posts in 1661\u00a0days, 11760=There are several brands of plastic laminate available, Formica, Nevamar, Wilsonart, and others that I can\u2019t remember at the moment. Vertical grade laminate is for vertical surfaces only and will not stand up to the abuse of a countertop. Most of these brands are comparable in quality and should serve the purpose well. There is also a product called color-core that has the same color all the way through it. It works great for places you don\u2019t want the dark line showing from the under layers of Formica and the others. Color-core is more brittle and more money but has it\u2019s purpose. Be careful not to mix brands as each has their own \u201cfinish\u201d and like colors of different brands may not match., 9873=#4 posted 02-08-2012 09:54 PM, 37456=\u00a92015 Verticalscope Inc.

These were for work surfaces, secretaries\u2019 stations and patient areas that we did not want to wear through and show brown patches. In the nurses\u2019 work room with constant shifting of metal trays no wear through. It is more brittle but easy to use. Formica brand has a similar product.
