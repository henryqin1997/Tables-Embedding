He is an 84 year old gentleman who has to give up woodworking because of health problems. He wants to sell me an older Craftsman 12\u201d wood lathe for $50.00. I\u2019ve never done lathe work but figure for that kind of money, I ought to give it a try. What kind of parts and accessories should I be asking about? He also has a 1994 Jet JDP 14JF Drill Press with 1/2 hp motor that looks pretty good. Don\u2019t know how much money I ought to offer for that. He also has a 2001 Porter Cable Omni Jig Dovetail Machine Model 5116 16\u201d. I\u2019ve never tried dovetail jigs either, but wondered if this might be a useful tool if I ever wanted to give it a try or if I should consider something else. I don\u2019t like the machined dovetailed drawers that are real close together like you see in most factory built cabinets. I like the larger dovetails that look like they were done the old fashioned way \u2013 don\u2019t know if this jig can do that or not. It looks like it\u2019s not been used much and I think he has all the parts. Anything I should be aware of when considering this \u2013 and what kind of money should I offer? I don\u2019t have a clue what would be fair pricing for the press or the jig. I would think 50 bucks for the lathe would be reasonable?, 4831=#1 posted 10-07-2012 08:45 PM, 25742=\u00a92015 Verticalscope Inc.
