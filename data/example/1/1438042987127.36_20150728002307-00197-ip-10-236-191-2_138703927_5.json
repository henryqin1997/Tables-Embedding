Mart\u00edn - Argentina La idea de Kaleb es una idea muy buena y simple, pero creo que su utilidad puede depender del peso del caj\u00f3n (y lo que vaya a contener). A entender, cuanto m\u00e1s liviano, mejor funcionar\u00e1. Otra soluci\u00f3n que se me ocurre es colocar una rueda de este tipo en el mueble, sobre la cual deslizar\u00e1 el caj\u00f3n, y hacer en la corredera del mismo un rebaje para que calce cuando esta en la posici\u00f3n cerrado. En este caso se puede obviar el efecto de tope para que no se salga el caj\u00f3n, pero de \u00faltima, no es el principal problema. #7 posted 09-03-2013 08:53 PM 195 posts in 2255\u00a0days home | projects | blog Marpintero",
