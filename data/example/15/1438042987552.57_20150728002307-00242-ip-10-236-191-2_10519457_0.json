This opens the Product Settings window. Select the Product Settings tab in the package catalog. Setting price points using the UI Back to top After you initially set price points, you can perform management operations on them such as update or delete. Management operations on price points are performed by issuing calls to the /organizations/{org_name}/products/{product_id}/price-points/{pricepoint_id} resource. If you use the API, you set price points by issuing a POST request to the /organizations/{org_name}/price-points resource. You can set price points using the management UI or monetization API. If you use the UI, you set price points using the Product Settings tab in the package catalog. Toolbox Back to top In monetization, price points specify the minimum price (gross or net) and maximum price (gross or net) that developers can charge for the use of apps that access resources provided by an API product. This step is optional. It only applies if you set up a revenue share plan and you want to",
    "textAfterTable": "Click Save (or Revert to cancel). Back to top Setting price points using the API You can set price points by adding one or more price points to an API product. You can add price points to an API product before you create API packages or after you create the API packages. Monetization does not mandate the order in which you perform these actions. To add a price point, issue a POST request to /organizations/{org_name}/products/{product_id}/price-points. When you add a price point, you can supply input such as the minimum and maximum net price or minimum and maximum gross price that a developer can charge, when the price point goes into effect (the start date), and when it ends (the end date). Only the start date is mandatory. You also must specify whether the price point should be published (true) or not (false). See Price point configuration settings for a list of price point options exposed to the API. For example, the following request sets a minimum and maximum gross price, specifies a start date, and sets the published flag to false:  $ curl -H \"Content-Type:application/json\" -X POST -d \\ '{ \"grossStartPrice\": \"10.0000\", \"grossEndPrice\": \"30.0000\", \"published\": \"false\", \"startDate\": \"2013-08-15\" }' \\ \"https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/mint/organizations/{org_name}/products/location/price-points\" \\ -u myname:mypass The response should look like this (only part of the response is shown):  { \"grossEndPrice\" : 30.0000, \"grossStartPrice\" :",
