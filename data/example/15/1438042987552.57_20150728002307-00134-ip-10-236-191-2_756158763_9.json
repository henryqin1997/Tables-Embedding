Continue the conversation... \u201c Never heard of these cards or the show (movie?)...kids would have been one and three years of age respectively about this time and that explains why! \u201d -bkklaos \u201c Not much to say about this one. During its first season I watched one maybe two episodes of Supernatural. It was OK and I sort of wanted to continue with it, but put it off. \u201d -captkirk42 \u201c I have no idea what this is. \u201d -carthage44 \u201c huh? \u201d -wax_house \u201c Do sets like this really have much of a demand? \u201d -koloth42 \u201c I assume Supernatural Connections is a movie I've never heard of. Shouldn't the name of the card be Dean Winchester? I'm sure my collection will never feel incomplete without this card. \u201d -switzr1 \u201c Not a bad looking card.Great T.V.series,time for it to move on though. \u201d -uncaian \u201c I never watched this show, but that looks like a foil card...if so, that is an excellent scan. \u201d -Billy Kingsley Thursday, July 30, 2015 Set: 2008 Inkworks Supernatural Connections Card: #24 Family Connection: Separation \u00a0",
