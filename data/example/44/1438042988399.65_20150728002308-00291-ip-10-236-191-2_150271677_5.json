Always remember to deliberately leave a 1/4-inch or so gap at each end of a long run IN CASE YOU GAIN MOISTURE AND THE WOOD EXPANDS. You don\u2019t want it to buckle. That 1/4 inch will be covered by the baseboard OR quarter-round trim. Well, if your room is 20 feet, and you have ONE end joint in the middle, you could easily see that 1/20 of an inch gap, as it is almost 1/16. To minimize that gap you can use one of two methods: (1) use more nails \u201cclose\u201d to the joint, so that when the wood shortens it moves mostly in the zone of sparsely spaced nails, keeping the joint tight, (2) Use more than one joint\u2014instead of two 10-foot boards, use five 4-foot boards\u2014now you have four joints and 1/4 of that 1/16th inch gap becomes 1/64 which is hardly noticed.
