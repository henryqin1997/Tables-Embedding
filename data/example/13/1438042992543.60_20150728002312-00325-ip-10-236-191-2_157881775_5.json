Epoxies (true epoxies, you never know what someone may market as an epoxy) are sold in two parts because the are two reagents in a chemical reaction that will form a polymer. When mixed they will react and form new molecules in what ever ratio is required (like the 2:1 ratio for hydrogen and oxygen to make water), 1810=1137 posts in 2956\u00a0days, 22622=#12 posted 09-12-2011 12:42 PM, 3811=#1 posted 09-10-2011 01:38 PM, 19453=#10 posted 09-11-2011 10:00 PM, 1958=09-10-2011 01:30 PM, 43051=\u00a92015 Verticalscope Inc.

Here is a pic of the plane , and no that is not me, just a pic from the hobby shop. (http://www.horizonhobby.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=EFL2725) The epoxy was some no named brand I got at a local hobby shop to glue my air plane wings together. It has hardened after 4 days to the point that I feel confident in its ability to stay together <laugh> There is a carbon fiber tube adding rigidity to the wing so I will test fly it this week when the weather is a bit nicer and see if I can crash it :) #12 posted 09-12-2011 12:42 PM 1137 posts in 2956\u00a0days home | projects | blog snowdog",
