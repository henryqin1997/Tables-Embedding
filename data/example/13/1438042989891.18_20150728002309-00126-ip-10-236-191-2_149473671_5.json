Thanks for the replies so far and here are a few answers to your questions: I\u2019m currently planning on making 20 books per EP release. Release date for the standard EP physical copies is April 28th so ideally I\u2019d like to start releasing the steel books around then as well.A hinged box would be ideal and as far as budget goes I\u2019m trying to keep things down to a minimum \u2013 if it\u2019s too much I\u2019ll knock the idea on the head and release them without the box. As to actual figures, I honestly don\u2019t know at this stage, once I start getting quotes I\u2019ll know more. And no, I\u2019d rather not be a box maker! Only because the process of making the books is fairly involved in itself and I\u2019ll be sailing close to the wind as it is to get them finished in time (after the book is put together they each get dipped in a bath of muriatic acid before I finish them by using a chemical process to transfer images, either photographs or paintings I\u2019ve made, onto the steel pages themselves). I\u2019ll try and post up a couple of photos and a short video of the book prototypes so you can get a clearer idea of what I\u2019m talking about. Thanks to everyone that\u2019s read and replied (about to have a look at that Nedson Woodworks link, thank you for that! :) )., 7372=#2 posted 03-22-2014 02:57 PM, 9506=#3 posted 03-22-2014 04:09 PM, 3213=I know next to nothing about carpentry and with the final date for the release now fixed for April 28th I thought I\u2019d look into a couple of ways I might be able to get them done: 1. Finding a good set of instructions and having a crack at them myself or 2. Find some kind soul willing to take the job on while I continue trying to finish off the steel books!, 5442=#1 posted 03-22-2014 07:30 AM, 7220=2169 posts in 1822\u00a0days, 32320=\u00a92015 Verticalscope Inc.
