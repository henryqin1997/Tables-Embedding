The frame is heavy, yes, but if you're carrying gear on an unsupported ride, nothing can compete. I had 2 fellow riders on that tour. Both were on \"normal\" road bikes and had constant issues. I had to replace the tires in Iowa, but other than that the 520 was perfect. I replaced the saddle with a Brooks for a more comfortable ride, and added a front rack for carrying capacity. I found the 520 very enjoyable to ride around without weight, too. (Which is how I got it stolen, and why I need another one.) It's faster than you'd think, in spite of its own weight. The gear system takes a bit of getting used to, but it soon feels natural. The most distinctive difference between this and my racing bike is the wheels. They're wider than a standard road bike, which is perfect for touring. If you ever end up on gravel or dirt, you won't be totally sunk. They also bear weight well. I don't just mean this in terms of balance. I carried about 50 lbs of gear everyday for 52 days and never broke a spoke. This bike is tough as nails, and comfortable to ride., 84482=Jun, 117761=I have a 1997 Trek 520 which has serviced my needs admirably. However, in deciding on a replacement I am facing the same issue now that I was then - I am between sizes, which in Trek's case are simply too far apart to be made up for by stem and seat adjustments. I am a 55-56 cm frame size. And yet Trek only has 54cm (in reality slightly less) and 57cm (in reality slightly more). When is Trek going to move away from the old fashioned 2 inch increments (which it has for every other model) for the 520?, 138541=I just rode my first century on the 2011 520 I purchased last month, and I continue to love this bike! It's very comfortable, with a relaxed geometry that still feels good after 100 miles. I especially like the ease of riding on the drops, as well as the easy access to the bar-end shifters from the drops. Great for short grocery trips as well as longer rides. I swapped in half-SPD, half-platform pedals since the stock pedals weren't great for around-town trips. Also, I'm still undecided about the stock saddle, but I think I'll probably replace it with something softer., 84591=2012, 104326=2011, 75176=Sep, 46209=2015, 87769=Went from [...] to [...] in 2010, I put over 5,000 miles on the bike in the first year. Only a few modifications like a new saddle but everything else was the same with one tire change and a few tubes along the way. As a 5'2 woman this bike was perfect for me., 157871=BALLWIN 13922 Manchester Road Ballwin, MO 63011 (636) 394-2453, 46100=May, 97338=I bought my 520 in 1995, and since then it's done over 80,000kms. Only the frame and front derailleur are original, but I've had the frame repainted. It is a beautifully balanced bike with touring load on front and rear and is as solid as a rock descending with load, but the brakes are underpowered. Probably better with disks. For my touring I use a 48-36-24 chainring setup and 12-36T cassette. Still have the occasional walk up some hills, but it's considerably better than the standard setup. Price in Oz when they were last imported a year or so ago was double the US cost despite our dollar being almost at parity. It's a good bike, but not at any cost., 55575=Mar, 65612=Oct, 124488=Aug}", "textBeforeTable": "Specifications close open \u00a0 Get out the maps and plan your countryside tour. Trek's 520 features a compliant chromoly frame and fork for all-day comfort and stability \u2014 even when you're carrying a load. Its Shimano shifting is slick and smooth with a wide-range 27-speed drivetrain that makes easy work of long rides and big climbs, and its linear-pull brakes stop you with authority. You'll also love the ride and puncture resistance of the wide Bontrager Race Lite Hardcase tires and the fact that this sweet tourer comes with a rear rack, fender mounts and pedals.
