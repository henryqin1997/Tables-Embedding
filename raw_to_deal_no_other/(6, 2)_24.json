Conditional Viewports The width and height values may also be negative which means almost the same as above (e.g. %V(50,-,-50,-,-) will go from 50 to 170 on a 220-pixel display). The x, y, width and height value may be specified as percentages, the actual value will be calculated from the target's display at load time. Percentage parameters can be mixed with normal ones. Percentages can carry upto 1 fractional digit for increased precision. Example: %V(10.5%,10,80%,80,-) The x and y values may be negative which means \"pixels from the far edge\".. i.e x == -50 means 50 pixels from the right edge default shade (2bit lcd's) is black FG on white BG default colour (16 bit lcd's) is the theme colours default font is the user font default width/height is the remaining part of the screen Only the x and y values need to be specified. The rest can be left empty if you want to use their default values (use '-' to achieve this, e.g. %V(0,0,-,-,1)). Viewports cannot be layered transparently over one another.

The bottom layer is used for the backdrop image (the static parts of the display behind text for example), and the upper layer (the text/images).

If the skin has this any %X() tag will be ignored and the whole screen will have a solid background (with the colour specified in the settings), so to get the most out of this feature: Add a full screen viewport at the start of the skin .. i.e %V(0,0,-,-,-) %VB Use %x(filename, 0, 0) to draw a backdrop image (If you want one!) Then add %V(0,0,-,-,-) and continue with your skin as normal. Any viewports you want drawn on the backdrop need the %VB tag but otherwise code as normal. Draw a rectangle!
