The list box on the left side of the form displays a list of all the types that Wincv.exe finds, based on the name you entered. The System namespace is implied on the class names. Therefore, type \"Object\" is displayed in the list of class names instead of \"System.Object\". When you select a type from the list, the type definition appears in the area on the right. The type definition is displayed using a C# like syntax. Note, however, that not all type definitions will compile in the C# compiler exactly as they are shown in the viewer. The following example demonstrates how to look up information on the ButtonBase class. To locate a type definition using Wincv.exe Type wincv at the command prompt. This loads the default assemblies and displays the Class Viewer. Type Button in the text box at the top of the form. Select the ButtonBase class name in the System.Windows.Forms namespace from the types displayed in the list box on the left side of the form.
