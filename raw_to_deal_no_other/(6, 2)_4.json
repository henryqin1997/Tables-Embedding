Programming Jakarta Struts: Using Tiles, Part 4 We conclude this book excerpt series on using tiles from Programming Jakarta Struts by showing you how to use definitions. You'll also find coverage on support for internationalization of tiles.

In a layout tile, the insert tag prescribes where the content will go using attribute values. In a regular, non-layout tile, the insert tag is used to retrieve a layout and allow content to be passed to the layout using put tags. Table 14-2 lists the attributes for the insert tag. Table 14-2: Attributes for the insert tag Attribute name Description attribute The name of an attribute in the current tile/component context. The value of this attribute is passed to the name attribute. beanName The name of the bean used as a value. The bean is retrieved from the specified context, if any. Otherwise, the pageContext.findAttribute( ) method is used. If the beanProperty attribute is also specified, retrieve the value from the corresponding bean property. If the bean (or bean property value) is an instance of one of the Attribute classes (Direct, Instance, etc.), the insertion is done according to the class type. Otherwise, the toString( ) method is called on the bean, and the returned String is passed to the name attribute. beanProperty The name of the bean property. If specified, the value is retrieved from this property. beanScope The context scope the bean can be found within. If not specified, the pageContext.findAttribute( ) method is used.
