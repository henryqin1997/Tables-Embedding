DESCRIPTION This manual page describes the GNU version of eqn, which is part of the groff document formatting system. eqn compiles descriptions of equations embedded within troff input files into commands that are understood by troff. Normally, it should be invoked using the -e option of groff. The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn. The output of GNU eqn cannot be processed with Unix troff; it must be processed with GNU troff. If no files are given on the command line, the standard input will be read. A filename of - will cause the standard input to be read. eqn searches for the file eqnrc in the directories given with the -M option first, then in /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac, /usr/share/groff/site-tmac, and finally in the standard macro directory /usr/share/groff/1.18.1.1/tmac. If it exists, eqn will process it before the other input files. The -R option prevents this. GNU eqn does not provide the functionality of neqn: it does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices (although it may work adequately for very simple input).

Most of the new features of GNU eqn are based on TeX. There are some references to the differences between TeX and GNU eqn below; these may safely be ignored if you do not know TeX. Automatic spacing eqn gives each component of an equation a type, and adjusts the spacing between components using that type. Possible types are: Tag Description ordinary an ordinary character such as 1 or x; operator a large operator such as S; binary a binary operator such as +; relation a relation such as =; opening a opening bracket such as (; closing a closing bracket such as ); punctuation a punctuation character such as ,; inner a subformula contained within brackets; suppress spacing that suppresses automatic spacing adjustment. Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
