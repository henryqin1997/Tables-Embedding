However, you can create customizations, such as overriding a default behavior or creating new monitoring objects, and then save them to a different management pack. By default, Operations Manager 2007 saves all customizations to the default management pack. As a best practice, you should instead create a separate management pack for each sealed management pack that you want to customize., 19956=Applies To: Windows Server 2008 R2, 31237=For instructions about importing a management pack, se How to Import a Management Pack in Operations Manager 2007 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=142351)., 21483=The RRAS Management Pack works by collecting, analyzing, and responding to events that RRAS places in Windows Server\u00ae 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 event logs. It highlights events, alarms, monitors, and performance instrumentation that might indicate possible service outages or configuration problems so that an administrator can quickly take corrective or further preventive actions., 24234=You can find the RRAS Management Pack in the System Center Operations Manager 2007 Catalog (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=82105) on TechNet., 20275=This guide describes how to install the Routing and Remote Access Service Management Pack in Microsoft\u00ae System Center Operations Manager\u00a02007 (Operations Manager\u00a02007)., 42281=Microsoft.Windows.Server.RRAS.2008.Server is the class defined in the RRAS Management Pack.

This management pack monitors events that are placed in the Application and System event logs by various RRAS components and subsystems. It also monitors the overall health of RRAS and alerts you to critical performance issues., 34033=For more information about management pack customizations and the default management pack, see About Management Packs in Operations Manager 2007 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=108356).}", "textBeforeTable": "You may need to customize your management pack.

You can delete the original management pack without needing to first delete the default management pack. A management pack that contains customizations is dependent on the original management pack. This dependency requires that you delete the management pack with customizations before you can delete the original management pack. If all of your customizations are saved to the default management pack, you must delete the default management pack before you can delete an original management pack.
