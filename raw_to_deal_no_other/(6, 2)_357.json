The message\u2019s lifetime, specified when the message is sent, is added to this value and the result is stored in the JMSExpiration header field. (The default lifetime value of 0, represented by the static constant Message.DEFAULT_TIME_TO_LIVE, denotes an unlimited lifetime. In this case, the expiration time is also set to 0 to indicate that the message never expires.) As with the message identifier, client applications that do not use a message\u2019s time stamp can improve performance by suppressing its generation with the message producer method setDisableMessageTimestamp (see Sending Messages).}", "lastModified": "Thu, 24 Feb 2011 15:30:14 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Table\u00a02\u20134 Message Header Fields Every message must have a header containing identifying and routing information. The header consists of a set of standard fields, which are defined in the Java Message Service Specification and summarized in Table\u00a02\u20134. Some of these are set automatically by Message Queue in the course of producing and delivering a message, some depend on settings specified when a message producer sends a message, and others are set by the client on a message-by-message basis. Message Header The following sections discuss each of these in greater detail. A body containing the actual content of the message Optional properties that can be used to convey additional identifying information beyond that contained in the header A header containing identifying and routing information A message consists of the following parts: Message Structure This section describes how to use the Message Queue Java API to compose, send, receive, and process messages.
