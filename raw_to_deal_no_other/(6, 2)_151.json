Functions Table F-31 shows the functions provided by this module. These functions provide straightforward XML parsing and XPath queries. All arguments are of type text, so for brevity that is not shown. F.42.2. Description of functions From PostgreSQL 8.3 on, there is XML-related functionality based on the SQL/XML standard in the core server. That functionality covers XML syntax checking and XPath queries, which is what this module does, and more, but the API is not at all compatible. It is planned that this module will be removed in a future version of PostgreSQL in favor of the newer standard API, so you are encouraged to try converting your applications. If you find that some of the functionality of this module is not available in an adequate form with the newer API, please explain your issue to <pgsql-hackers@postgresql.org> so that the deficiency can be addressed.

F.42.3. xpath_table  xpath_table(text key, text document, text relation, text xpaths, text criteria) returns setof record xpath_table is a table function that evaluates a set of XPath queries on each of a set of documents and returns the results as a table.
