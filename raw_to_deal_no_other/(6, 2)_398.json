You can get information about a notification's current state from the admin portal, on the Message History panel. What are the state stages for a notification message? To drive the most engagement, our suggestion is to send highly targeted push notifications to small groups of individuals. Also, scheduling the push notifications to be sent at certain times (for example, lunchtime, before work, or just after work) will increase the effectiveness of the notifications. You can schedule your push notifications throughout the day based on your customers' geographic locations. I\u2019ve got millions of devices to send notifications to. What\u2019s the best way to send the notifications? Free Apigee Developer accounts include 10 million push notifications per month at no cost. Tiered pricing is available for additional capacity. Is there a limit to how many push notifications I can send per month? No, but for best performance we suggest you limit the number of push notifications to 10,000 per single request. If you need to send the same message to more than 10K devices, we suggest that you break up up the devices into batches (for example, use groups), and send each batch. You can also potentially speed up the delivery of all the messages by sending notifications in parallel. Is there a limit to how many push notifications I can send at one time?", "textAfterTable": "The normal flow from state to state is as follows:  CREATED > SCHEDULED > STARTED > FINISHED |\u00a0FAILED | CANCELED | EXPIRED Back to top App Monitoring (formerly Mobile Analytics) What happened to Mobile Analytics? Apigee's Mobile Analytics product has now been fully integrated into API Services as app monitoring. All of the features of Mobile Analytics are fully available using the SDKs for iOS and Android. For more information on using app monitoring features with the SDK, see Monitoring app usage data. Why don't I see a crash report after experiencing a crash? The app wasn't re-started after the crash. Crash reports are uploaded when the app is re-started after a crash. iOS The app was launched by Xcode. Crash reporting is disabled when the app is launched by Xcode because the debugger interferes with crash detection. Why don't I see errors reported? iOS or JavaScript The app isn't reporting any errors. Apigee-provided macros (in iOS) or functions (in JavaScript) must be used to log errors. iOS You can turn on the monitoring option (using the ApigeeMonitoringOptions class) by setting autoPromoteLoggedErrors to YES. That way, any NSLog statement whose message begins with \"error:\" will automatically be identified as an error and reported as such. iOS If there are other crash reporting frameworks running in your app, you must disable them.
