This utility supports the options listed in Table 7.2a. All of the options, except for -r, assume that the .pbi file has already been downloaded and is in the current or specified directory. pbi_add(1) The following commands are installed by PBI Manager. For more details, refer to that command's man page. Note that single character commands can not be stacked. As an example, you must type pbi_add -i -v as pbi_add -iv will fail.
