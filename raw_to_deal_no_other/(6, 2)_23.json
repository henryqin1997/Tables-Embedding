The event attributes and keywords can be used in CLR programs and in native C++ programs. Event handling supports single- and multithreaded usage and protects data from simultaneous multithread access. It also allows you to derive subclasses from event source or receiver classes and support extended event sourcing/receiving in the derived class. Event handling is also supported for native C++ classes (C++ classes that do not implement COM objects), however, that support is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. For more information, see Event Handling in Native C++. Event handling is primarily supported for COM classes (C++ classes that implement COM objects, typically using ATL classes or the coclass attribute). For more information, see Event Handling in COM.
