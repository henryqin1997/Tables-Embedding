Disks configured in a RAID can preserve your data in the event of a disk failure and continue to operate. Information can be mirrored (with two volumes containing the same information), or striped (where information is spread across many disks) in different ways. Disks in a RAID are combined into a single logical unit that can then be partitioned. There are two types of RAID: Software RAID: Included in the operating system. Software RAID functions are handled by the server CPU and can be I/O intensive. To get the best performance, you want a system with available CPU resources to manage the RAID functions. This solution works well for data warehousing and video streaming. Hardware RAID: Included in the HBA. Processor-intensive RAID operations are off-loaded from the server CPU to the RAID controller to enhance performance. Some solutions include a battery-backed write cache that can increase performance and reduce the risk of losing data. This solution works well for web servers and transaction databases. Disk controllers with \u201cRAID\u201d as part of their name provide hardware RAID. For information on RAID levels, see Selecting the Best RAID Level.", "Serially Attached SCSI.

It includes the following sections: Types of Disk Controllers Identifying Your Server's Disk Controller Identifying Your Disk Controller Using OS Commands Types of Disk Controllers Sun servers can come with a variety of disk management solutions (or disk controllers). These solutions are used to control either internal or external disks (in some cases, both). There are several types: On-board chip (also called integrated circuit) disk controller on the mother board, or mezzanine card (example: Integrated LSI SAS 1068E disk controller) Disk controller accessory card (PCI, PCIe, PCIx, etc.) that comes either as an integrated (or bundled) solution with the system, or as an orderable option (example: Sun StorageTek SAS RAID Internal HBA) Expansion Module disk controller that comes standard or can be purchased as an option and is installed in a blade server using a proprietary mother board connector (example: Sun Blade RAID 0/1 Expansion Module) PCI ExpressModule (EM) that is installed in the blade chassis (example: Sun StorageTek SAS RAID ExpressModule) Identifying Your Server\u2019s Disk Controller Disk Controller Support/Feature Matrix\u00a0 describes where each disk controller is used, how each controller is configured, whether it includes disk management software, and how its firmware is maintained.
