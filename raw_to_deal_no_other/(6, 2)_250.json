An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see CVE-2011-3396. Mitigating Factors for PowerPoint Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3396 Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation: The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability. For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
