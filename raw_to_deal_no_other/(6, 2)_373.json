In subsequent generations, the type mechanics were corrected so that Ghost-type Pok\u00e9mon became immune to Seismic Toss. Seismic Toss inflicts damage equal to the user's level, for example, if the using Pok\u00e9mon is Level 25 the opposing Pok\u00e9mon will take 25 HP of direct damage. The damage is not altered by weakness or resistance, except when a Pok\u00e9mon is immune. Seismic Toss doesn't receive STAB.
