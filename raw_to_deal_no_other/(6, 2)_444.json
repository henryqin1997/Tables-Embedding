You can display page metrics for both full and partial pages associated with WebCenter Spaces and WebCenter Portal applications. Full Page and Partial Page Metrics Full page metrics do not include partial page metrics. Partial page rendering of a component on a page increases only partial page metrics and does not cause any change in full page metrics. For example, a calendar refresh on a page increases partial page invocations by 1, but full page invocations remain unchanged. Partial page requests render only portions of the page. Therefore, you can monitor the performance of pages within a page. Partial page refresh behavior is called partial page rendering (PPR). PPR allows only certain components on a page to be rerendered without the need to refresh the entire page. A common scenario is when an output component displays what a user has chosen or entered in an input component. Similarly, a command link or button can cause another component on the page to be rerendered without refreshing the entire page. For example, if a user takes a quick poll and clicks the Vote button, only the quick poll component is updated and rendered. Hence the full page invocations remain unchanged and", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
