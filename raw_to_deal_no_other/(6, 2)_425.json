Standard Attributes HTML5 attributes are case insensitive and may be written in all uppercase or mixed case, although the most common convention is to stick with lowercase. Attributes may only be specified within start tags and must never be used in end tags. <div class=\"example\">...</div>  Following is the example of an HTML5 attributes which illustrates how to mark up a div element with an attribute named class using a value of \"example\" \u2212 Some attributes are defined globally and can be used on any element, while others are defined for specific elements only. All attributes have a name and a value and look like as shown below in the example. As explained in previous chapter, elements may contain attributes that are used to set various properties of an element.

A custom data attribute starts with data- and would be named based on your requirement. Following is the simple example \u2212  <div class=\"example\" data-subject=\"physics\" data-level=\"complex\"> ... </div> The above will be perfectly valid HTML5 with two custom attributes called data-subject and data-level. You would be able to get the values of these attributes using JavaScript APIs or CSS in similar way as you get for standard attributes.
