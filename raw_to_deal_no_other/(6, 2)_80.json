By default,\u00a0Reporting Services\u00a0accepts requests that specify Negotiate or NTLM authentication and could therefore benefit from Extended Protection support in the operating system and the Reporting Services extended protection features. The main authentication enhancements that are part of extended protection are service binding and channel binding. Channel binding uses a channel binding token (CBT), to verify that the channel established between two end points was not compromised. Service binding uses Service Principal Names (SPN) to validate the intended destination of authentication tokens. For more background information about extended protection, see Integrated Windows Authentication with Extended Protection. Extended Protection is a set of enhancements to recent versions of the Windows operating system. Extended protection enhances how credentials and authentication can be protected by applications. The feature itself does not directly provide protection against specific attacks such as credential forwarding, but it provides an infrastructure for applications such as Reporting Services\u00a0to enforce Extended Protection for Authentication.

A data access technology is used to connect to SQL Server data sources and to the Reporting Services catalog database. Failure of a data access technology to support extended protection impacts Reporting Services in the following ways: The SQL Server that runs the Reporting Services catalog database cannot have extended protection enabled or the report server will not successfully connect to the catalog database and return authentication errors. SQL Servers that are used as Reporting Services report data sources cannot have extended protection enabled or tries by the report server to connect to the report data source will fail and return authentication errors.
