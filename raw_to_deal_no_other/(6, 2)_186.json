The Packager resolver is based on the URL resolver and is configured similarly, except the artifact child tags specify where to find the packager.xml files, rather than the artifacts themselves. For security reasons, the XSLT transform ensures that (a) all downloaded archives have verified SHA1 checksums (including cached resources); and (b) only a very limited set of ant tasks can be performed during the artifact \"build\" phase; currently these include move, copy, mkdir, zip, unzip, tar, and untar (this restriction may be overridden however; see below). The packaging instructions are contained in \"packager.xml\" in a simple XML format. At resolve time this file gets converted into a \"build.xml\" file via XSLT and then executed using ant. Therefore, ant must be available as an executable on the platform. The ant task executes in a separate ant project and so is not affected by properties, etc. that may be set in any existing ant environment in which Ivy is running. However, Ivy will define a few properties for convenience; see the \"Properties\" listed below. The Packager resolver supports a \"resource cache\", where downloaded archives can be stored to avoid duplicate downloads. This cache is entirely separate from the", "textAfterTable": "quiet True to run ant with the -quiet flag No; defaults to false validate True if this resolver should validate (via XSD) the downloaded XML packaging instructions No; defaults to true preserveBuildDirectories True if this resolver should not delete the temporary build directories in which the ant tasks are executed (for debugging purposes) No; defaults to false Setting a resourceURL will cause the resolver to override the URLs for resources specified by the packaging instructions. Instead, all resources will be downloaded from an URL constructed by first resolving the resourceURL pattern into a base URL, and then resolving the resource filename relative to that base URL. In other words, the resourceURL pattern specifies the URL \"directory\", so it should always end in a forward slash. If a resourceURL download fails, the resolver will fall back to the original URL from the packaging instructions. Configure a resourceURL in situations where you don't want to rely on (or wait for) the web sites configured in the packaging instructions, and have access to a better (perhaps private) mirror site.
