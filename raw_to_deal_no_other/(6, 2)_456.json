It is not possible to implement != and <> operators that do different things. Comparison operators are available for all data types where this makes sense. All comparison operators are binary operators that return values of type boolean; expressions like 1 < 2 < 3 are not valid (because there is no < operator to compare a Boolean value with 3). In addition to the comparison operators, the special BETWEEN construct is available.  a BETWEEN x AND y is equivalent to  a >= x AND a <= y Similarly,  a NOT BETWEEN x AND y is equivalent to  a < x OR a > y There is no difference between the two respective forms apart from the CPU cycles required to rewrite the first one into the second one internally. To check whether a value is or is not NULL, use the constructs  expression IS NULL expression IS NOT NULL or the equivalent, but less standard, constructs  expression ISNULL expression NOTNULL Do", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
