Unlike previous generations, if Focus Sash, Focus Band, or Sturdy activate before the last hit is dealt, the following hit will cause the defending Pok\u00e9mon to faint; however, Focus Band can still activate repeatedly to prevent fainting, but each chance is independent of the previous one. Each hit will cause Weak Armor to activate. Generation V Due to the introduction of the Ability Skill Link, a Pok\u00e9mon with said Ability will always hit five times when using Fury Swipes, if it does not miss. However, no Pok\u00e9mon could naturally obtain Skill Link and Fury Swipes until Generation V. Same as previous generations, except it will continue attacking after a substitute is broken. Generation IV If the target has an Ability which activates upon contact, each hit counts individually, enabling the Ability to activate multiple times. Generation III Same as Generation I, but all hits will do damage independently, consequently enabling any of them to be critical.", "textAfterTable": "Learnset By leveling up # Pok\u00e9mon Type Level I II III IV V VI 027 Sandshrew Ground Ground 38 37", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
