Affected users are those who use the crypt(text, text) function with DES encryption in the optional pg_crypto module. Passwords affected are those that contain characters that cannot be represented with 7-bit ASCII. If a password contains a character that has the most significant bit set (0x80), and DES encryption is used, that character and all characters after it will be ignored.
