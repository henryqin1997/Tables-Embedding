Usage Guidelines To use this command, you must be in a user group associated with a task group that includes appropriate task IDs. If the user group assignment is preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for assistance. Use the address-family command to enter various address family configuration modes while configuring BGP routing sessions. When you enter the address-family command from router configuration mode, you enable the address family and enter global address family configuration mode. The IPv4 unicast address family must be configured in router configuration mode before configuring the IPv4 labeled-unicast address family for a neighbor in neighbor configuration mode. The IPv6 unicast address family must be configured in router configuration mode before configuring the IPv6 labeled-unicast address family for a neighbor in neighbor configuration mode.
