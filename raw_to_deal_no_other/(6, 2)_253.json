For Windows\u00a07, use NetRequestOfflineDomainJoin. The offline domain join scenario uses two functions: NetCreateProvisioningPackage is a provisioning function that is first called to perform the network operations necessary to create and configure the computer object in Active Directory. The output from the NetCreateProvisioningPackage is a package used for the next step. NetRequestProvisioningPackageInstall, an image initialization function, is called to inject the output from the NetCreateProvisioningPackage provisioning function into a Windows operating system image for use during installation.
