The match argument specifies a match that will be applied to the filter's dispatch criterion. The match may be a string match (exact match or substring), a regex, an integer (greater, lessthan or equals), or unconditional. The first characters of the match argument determines this: The dispatch argument is a string with optional req=, resp= or env= prefix causing it to dispatch on (respectively) the request header, response header, or environment variable named. In the absence of a prefix, it defaults to a response header. A special case is the word handler, which causes mod_filter to dispatch on the content handler. provider-name must have been registered by loading a module that registers the name with ap_register_output_filter. This directive registers a provider for the smart filter. The provider will be called if and only if the match declared here matches the value of the header or environment variable declared as dispatch. mod_filter Module: Base Status: Options Override: server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess Context: FilterProvider filter-name provider-name [req|resp|env]=dispatch match Syntax: Register a content filter Description: FilterProvider Directive", "textAfterTable": "FilterTrace Directive Description: Get debug/diagnostic information from mod_filter Syntax: FilterTrace filter-name level Context: server config, virtual host, directory Status: Base Module: mod_filter This directive generates debug information from mod_filter. It is designed to help test and debug providers (filter modules), although it may also help with mod_filter itself. The debug output depends on the level set: 0 (default) No debug information is generated. 1 mod_filter will record buckets and brigades passing through the filter to the error log, before the provider has processed them. This is similar to the information generated by mod_diagnostics. 2 (not yet implemented) Will dump the full data passing through to a tempfile before the provider.
