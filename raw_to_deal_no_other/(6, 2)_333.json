The tables contain the following information: List of capabilities/flags The difference between the context flags and the context capabilities is more an abstract logical separation than a functional one, because they are handled very similar. Consider the context capability sufficient for a specified functionality, even if the Linux Capability says something different. For example mount() requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN which adds a dozen other things we do not want, so we define VXC_SECURE_MOUNT to allow mounts for certain contexts. Require one or a number of context capabilities to be set in addition to a given Linux capability, each one controlling a distinct part of the functionality. For example the CAP_NET_ADMIN could be split into RAW and PACKET sockets, so you could take away each of them separately by not providing the required context capability.
