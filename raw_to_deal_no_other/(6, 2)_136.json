Simply start the Works Task Launcher and click on the Help button. If the last option in the Help menu reads, \"About Microsoft Works Suite 2004,\" then you are eligible to update. If the last option reads, \"About Microsoft Works,\" then select that option. In the \"About Microsoft Works\" dialog, look for the version number. If the version is 8.0, then you are eligible to update. If it displays Works 8.5, then you already have the most current version of the software., 12720=*In order to be offered this security update, customers running Microsoft Works 8.0 must first update to Works 8.5 as described in Microsoft Works Update. This includes all customers using Microsoft Works 8.0, Works Suite 2004, and Works Suite 2005. For customers running Works Suite 2006, Works 8.5 is already included., 21743=This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft Office Word 2000 and Microsoft Office Outlook 2007.

For more information, see the subsection, Affected and Non-Affected Software, in this section., 7834=This is a Microsoft Office Word update. Why are Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 referenced in the Affected Software table? The files that are updated to address the vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin are core files to Microsoft Office Word. For Microsoft Office Word 2007 and Microsoft Office Word 2007 Service Pack 1, some of these core files are shared with Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1, and provide functionality, such as editing, to Outlook. Therefore, Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 need to be updated as well, and Word 2007 and Word 2007 Service Pack 1 and Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 are serviced by the same package. Users with only Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 installed will still need to apply this Word update to their systems. Users with Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 that also have Word 2007 or Word 2007 Service Pack 1 installed will also need to apply this update but they will only need to install it once.

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2007, when a users of Microsoft Office 2007 RTM install this update, their systems will be upgraded to functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 1. All updates released after December 8, 2007 for Microsoft Office 2007 will include these security features, which were introduced in Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 1. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems., 5421=What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?\u00a0 The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin., 9787=MS08-074 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. How does MS08-074 relate to this bulletin (MS08-072)?\u00a0 This security update for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (960402), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (960401), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (960403) also addresses the vulnerabilities described in MS08-074.

For more information about how to obtain this service pack, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934736., 8286=Why is this update Critical for Word 2000 but only Important for all other affected versions of Word? Microsoft Office Word 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit., 6550=I am using Works 8.0, how do I update to Works 8.5? Microsoft has provided a free update for Works 8.0 users to Works 8.5. As a result, all customers using Microsoft Works 8.0, Works Suite 2005, or Works Suite 2004 should update to the security-enhanced Works 8.5. Please see Microsoft Works Update for more information., 8729=Why is this update rated Critical for Outlook 2007? Outlook 2007 default configuration uses Microsoft Office Word 2007 as the default e-mail editor.
