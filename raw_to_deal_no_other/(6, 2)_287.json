Users wanting a longer view of changes in sea ice were directed to products like the Sea Ice Index. This was because operational products, like that upon which MASIE is based, can change suddenly and unpredictably in response to changing needs, data sources, and capabilities at an operational center such as the National Ice Center. However, in response to user demand and because the product appears to be consistent back through 2006, we are releasing the entire archive of MASIE products as of June 2014 with the exception of the masie_extent_sqkm.csv file which still only contains that last 28 days of data.

It is produced relatively consistently when compared to chart and edge products, but also benefits from the same careful manual analysis that is used for those products, which is why it was chosen as the input for the MASIE product.

New satellites and other sources have been introduced to replace those that are no longer available. Metadata that records which imagery was used to generate the snow and ice maps are not kept at this time. Helfrich et al.

Hydrological Processes 21(12): 1576-1586., 9253=Note: From publication of MASIE in November 2010 until June 2014, only the last four weeks of data were made available. This was because MASIE is based on an operational product that may not be consistently produced and may not be appropriate for looking at changes in ice over time periods longer than a few weeks. In June 2014, we decided to make the MASIE product available back to 2006. This was done in response to user requests, and because the IMS product output, upon which MASIE is based, appeared to be reasonably consistent. Prior to 2006, the IMS product is different in format and cannot be used for MASIE., 2468=MASIE products include an ASCII text file of sea ice extent values in square km over the entire Northern Hemisphere with 16 separate Arctic regions identified, time series plots of the 16 regions, and image files that visually show where the sea ice is. The MASIE-NH imagery are provided at a nominal 4 km resolution. The input data comes from the 4 km Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow and ice product produced by the National Ice Center (NIC). NIC utilizes visible imagery, passive microwave data, and NIC weekly analysis products to create their data product. The MASIE-NH products are distributed in a number of formats including ASCII text, GeoTIFF, PNG, shapefiles, and Google Earth files and are available from 01 October 2006 to the present. The most recent days worth of imagery plus the ASCII text data file are provided via the MASIE Web site. A complete archive of the imagery can be obtained via FTP., 69572=Following visits in 2009 to NSIDC and NIC by Rear Admiral David Titley, at the time Commander Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command (CNMOC), the concept for a collaborative MASIE product was developed through further discussions between NIC's Chief Scientist Pablo Clemente-Col\u00f3n and NSIDC's NOAA Liaison Florence Fetterer. Product development objectives included wider dissemination of information from NIC products and more accurate daily sea ice edge position views for NSIDC's user base. Commander Denise M. Kruse, NIC's Director at the time, endorsed the collaboration that made MAISE possible. Sean Helfrich of NIC leads work on the IMS and helped shaped MASIE development., 65393=Fetterer, F., compiler. 2006.

IGARSS Proceedings, INT_A32_04, Toronto, 24-28 June 2002., 49401=As of 2010, the primary visible band imagery that analysts use comes from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Other visible satellite data sources include Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer visible band (AVHRR-VIS), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager, Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), and the Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) Imager. AMSR-E 89 GHz brightness temperature at 6.25 m resolution is an important passive microwave data source. Analysts directly interpret areas with high 89 GHz brightness temperatures as areas covered by ice when this interpretation is supported by information from other sources. Other passive microwave sources include AMSR-E derived ice concentrations, Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) derived ice concentrations, and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) derived ice concentrations. Automated NOAA ice cover output (Sean Helfrich, citing the work of Peter Romanov, personal communication 08 November 2010) applying AVHRR, SSM/IS, GOES imager, and SEVIRI at the same IMS resolution are also examined as an objective evaluation of ice conditions. SAR imagery from RADARSAT-2, European Remote Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2), Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) are used but are not analyzed on the same screen with other IMS data sources. SAR data are examined in adjoining NIC Sea Ice Prediction and Analysis System (SIPAS) workstations and referenced as the IMS analysis is produced.}", "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 16 382 x 304 Cook Inlet 16 15 339 x 373 Yellow Sea 15 14 527 x 1079 Sea of Okhotsk 14 13 530 x 420 Baltic Sea 13 12 423 x 932 Bering Sea 12 11 573 x 631 Central Arctic 11 10 591 x 665 Hudson Bay 10 9 531 x 564 Canadian Archipelago 9 8 807 x 1257 Baffin Bay/Gulf of St. Lawrence 8 7 582 x 850 Greenland Sea 7 6 612 x 533 Barents Sea 6 5 415 x 523 Kara Sea 5 4 524 x 513 Laptev Sea 4 3 476 x 457 East Siberian Sea 3 2 416 x 297 Chukchi Sea 2 1 497 x 449 Beaufort Sea 1", "textAfterTable": "Sample Images Figures 1a and 1b show an example of the GeoTIFF files.
