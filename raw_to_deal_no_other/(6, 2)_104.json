Usage Guidelines The pos, atm, and ge-wan keywords are supported on Cisco 7600 series routers that are configured with a Supervisor Engine 2. The interface-number designates the module and port number. Valid values depend on the chassis and module that are used. For example, if you have a 48-port 10/100BASE-T Ethernet module that is installed in a 13-slot chassis, valid values for the slot number are from 1 to 13 and valid values for the port number are from 1 to 48. Examples This example shows how to list all of the VLAN mappings that are configured on a port and indicate whether such mappings are enabled or disabled on the port:  Router# show interfaces gigabitethernet 5/2 vlan mapping  State: enabled Original VLAN Translated VLAN ------------- --------------- 1649 755 Router# Related Commands Command Description", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
