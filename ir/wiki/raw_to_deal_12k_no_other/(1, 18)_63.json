        "summary": "Johanna Jussinniemi (born 13 September 1976), better known by her stage name Puma Swede, is a Swedish pornographic actress and feature dancer. The first part of her stage name comes from the sports car, the Ford Puma. Since 2005, she has appeared in over 200 movies.She is of Finnish descent, as both her parents were originally from Finland, and she has resided in California since 2004.Swede worked as a computer sales representative in Sweden and later on as a glamour model before moving into adult films. She initially only performed in girl–girl scenes, but made her hardcore boy–girl debut in the 2005 video School of Hardcore by the studio AntiInnocence Video, with whom she was previously a contract performer.She has received a 2009 AVN Award nomination for Web Starlet of the Year, and a 2009 XBiz Award nomination for Web Babe/Starlet of the Year. In 2010, she made her first mainstream film appearance, a cameo in the comedy The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It with comedian/actor Bryan Callen, formerly of MADtv fame.\nIn October 2012, Swede released her autobiography published by Lind & Co. The autobiography tells the cautious tale of her life paying specific attention to her childhood growing up, her introduction into the adult industry and her troubled relationship then inevitable divorce from Sunit Patel.\nIn 2014, she made an appearance in the third episode of the seventh season of Sons of Anarchy. She makes an appearance as \"Skankenstein\" in the first film produced by the club's porn studio along with Jenna Jameson. In 2014 she appeared in two episodes of the Swedish reality series Svenska Hollywoodfruar as a friend to Åsa Vesterlund.Swede received attention in January 2016 when the newspaper Aftonbladet publicized articles about the Swedish Municipal Workers' Union. People within the union had used the union funds for luxurious dinners and the hiring of Swede to perform a strip show at a restaurant owned by the union, which led to the dismissal of the union cashier.  Many working members cancelled their memberships in the union.In October 2017 Puma has announced she is opening her first restaurant, “Puma Burger,” in Sweden the final week of October.\nThe restaurant is located in a prime location of Lilla Torget in the city of Malmo, she reported. Puma is partnering with an experienced restaurateur and has high hopes for success.\n”We are focusing on gourmet style burgers and are hard at work creating an awesome menu and tasty burgers,” Swede said. “Just wait until you see the names of the burgers. I did have to contain myself from the craziest names since the restaurant will be family friendly. The premiere is the last weekend of October, and we are planning a huge Halloween theme with costumes. I can’t wait to open the doors for business. I am learning the restaurant business and adding my personal touches.\"",
