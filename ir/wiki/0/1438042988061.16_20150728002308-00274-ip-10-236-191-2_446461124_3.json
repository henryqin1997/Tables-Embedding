These names were later Latinised as Albania and Anglicised as Albany, which were once alternative names for Scotland.\nNew Albion and Albionoria (\"Albion of the North\") were briefly suggested as names of Canada during the period of the Canadian Confederation. Arthur Phillip, first leader of the colonisation of Australia, originally named Sydney Cove \"New Albion\", but later the colony acquired the name \"Sydney\".",
