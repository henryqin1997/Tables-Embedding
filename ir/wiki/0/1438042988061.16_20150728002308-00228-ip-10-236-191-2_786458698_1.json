In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).\nGold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia, a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion. Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects, giving rise to the term acid test. Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating. Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, but this is not a chemical reaction.\nA relatively rare element, gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage, jewelry, and other arts throughout recorded history.

Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use). Gold is also used in infrared shielding, colored-glass production, gold leafing, and tooth restoration. Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine.

Branko Crvenkovski was elected as the party's first president. Its current leader is Zoran Zaev. The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia is a member of the Progressive Alliance and an associate affiliate of the Party of European Socialists (PES). SDSM is a centre-left positioned political party with social democratic ideology. The party supports a practical solution to the Macedonian naming dispute with Greece. \nFrom September 1992 to 1998 and from 2002 to 2006 the SDSM was the largest party in the Macedonian parliament and the main party in the government, and has shown a moderate and re-conciliatory attitude towards ethnic minorities in Macedonia. On the first parliamentary elections in 1990, the party finished second behind VMRO-DPMNE and was part of the national unity government from 1991 to 1992. From 1992 to 1994 SDSM was in a coalition government with the Liberal Party and the Socialist Party. SDSM won the parliamentary elections in 1994 and 2002 and won the most municipalities at the local elections in 1996, 2000 and 2005. From September 2006 to December 2016 SDSM was the biggest opposition party in the parliament. On early parliamentary elections in late 2016, SDSM lead the center to left-wing coalition \"For life in Macedonia\" and won 440,000 votes and 49/120 MPs in the Macedonian assembly, the second best result in the party's history, after the win at the parliament elections in 2002; SDSM lost the popular vote to VMRO-DPMNE who won 460,000 votes and gained 51 parliamentary seats. However, SDSM managed to form Government via coalitions with various minority parties.",
