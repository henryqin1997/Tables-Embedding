CFR Cluj returned to the top flight in 2004 and the following season took part in their first European competition, the Intertoto Cup, where they finished as runners-up. In 2007–08, they were champions of Liga I for the first time in their history, taking the national title away from Bucharest-based teams after 17 years and consequently qualifying for the UEFA Champions League group stage in the process. Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the third tier of the Romanian football league system. Since their major ownership change in 2002, the team has won eleven domestic trophies: four Liga I, four Cupa României, and three Supercupa României.\nSince rejoining the first division in 2004, the club has been known for relying heavily on foreign players, particularly Portuguese, but also African, South American and more recently European.\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring Universitatea Cluj.
