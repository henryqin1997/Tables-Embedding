A reproductive toxicant is a chemical that adversely affects the male or female reproductive system. A neurotoxin is a chemical that affects the nervous system, and can adversely affect intelligence, cause memory deficits, and result in cognitive and behavioral problems and sexual dysfunction, among other problems.\u00a0 A developmental toxicant is a chemical that can produce adverse health effects prior to conception, during pregnancy and during childhood. The adverse health effects can manifest themselves in a variety of ways, including death, stillbirths, malformations, reduced birth weight, mental retardation, sensory loss, growth alteration and/or functional deficit.\u00a0 A carcinogen is a chemical that can cause cancer. A brief glossary of toxicology terms So if we have a general understanding that toxic chemical exposures aren\u2019t healthy for us, why do we blissfully ignore the toxic chemicals that are found in our homes, our schools and the products that we use every day? A recent study confirmed that while we are all concerned about toxic chemicals in the environment, most of us don\u2019t realize that our greatest exposure to such chemicals is in our homes, mostly from our household cleaners, beauty care products and other common household items. So why do we ignore these exposures? At least part of the answer, I think, is that it is easier", "textAfterTable": "*Based on animal and/or human studies.
