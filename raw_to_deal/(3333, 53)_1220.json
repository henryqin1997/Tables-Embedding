But, XHTML continues to be the preferred syntax for respondents by some way. Those who use HTML syntax exclusively grew from 5.9% to 9.8%, while the number who used mostly HTML also rose, a little, from 15.9% to 16.4%. When asked which syntax they used, well over half of respondents relied either exclusively (34%) or mostly (32%) XHTML, as opposed to 42.4% and 29.7% in the previous survey. Since version 1, XHTML has been considered by many web developers to be \u201cthe future of HTML\u201d. There has also long been a group of developers who were sceptical of the value of XHTML syntax. In HTML5, while both HTML and XHTML syntax are permissible, it could be argued that HTML syntax is being given predominance by the developers of the language. But just how much is this reflected in current developer practice? What versions of HTML/\u200bXHTML do respondents use? Language Features We asked respondents two sets of questions \u2014 one related to language features they use, the other markup practices (for example how frequently they validate). Given that this survey asked developers what their practices are, there\u2019s the chance that they\u2019ll provide answers about what they think they should be doing, rather than what they actually are doing,", "textAfterTable": "2008 Markup Count % Exclusively HTML 73 5.92% Exclusively XHTML 523 42.38% Mostly HTML, sometimes XHTML 196 15.88% Mostly XHTML, sometimes HTML 367 29.74% XML 9 0.73% Other 10 0.81% What doctypes do respondents declare?
