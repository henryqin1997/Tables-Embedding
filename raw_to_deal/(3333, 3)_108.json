The Type property of the Process command specifies the processing option to use when processing the object. For more information about processing options, see Processing Options and Settings (Analysis Services). Specifying Processing Options To control the processing of objects, the Process command has various properties that can be set. The Process command has properties that control: how much processing will be done, which objects will be processed, whether to use out-of-line bindings, how to handle errors, and how to manage writeback tables. Partitions Mining structures Mining models Measure groups Dimensions Databases Cubes To process an Analysis Services object, you can use the Process command. The Process command can process the following objects on an Analysis Services instance: In Microsoft\u00a0SQL Server\u00a0Analysis Services, processing is the step or series of steps that turn data into information for business analysis. Processing is different depending on the type of object, but processing is always part of turning data into information.

Specifying Objects to be Processed The Object property of the Process command contains the object identifier of the object to be processed. Only one object can be specified in a Process command, but processing an object also processes any child objects. For example, processing a measure group in a cube processes all the partitions for that measure group, while processing a database processes all the objects, including cubes, dimensions, and mining structures, that are contained by the database. If you set the ProcessAffectedObjects attribute of the Process command to true, any related object affected by processing the specified object is also processed. For example, if a dimension is incrementally updated by using the ProcessUpdate processing option in the Process command, any partition whose aggregations are invalidated because of members being added or deleted is also processed by Analysis Services if ProcessAffectedObjects is set to true. In this case, a single Process command can process multiple objects on an Analysis Services instance, but Analysis Services determines which objects besides the single object specified in the Process command must also be processed. However, you can process multiple objects, such as dimensions, at the same time by using multiple Process commands within a Batch command.
