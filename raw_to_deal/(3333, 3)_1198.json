All the best. Hostel Inn Team Hostel Inn - Sarajevo, Tue 06 May 2014 Excellent hostel I stayed in big room with my friends. Our room was comfortable and spacious. The beds were comfortable, the shower was great and the room was very clean.. You can also get a Tea/Coffee 24/7 free at the same place . This hostel is GREAT considering it is steps away from busiest part of the town. The entire staff was extremely friendly 100% recommended. 100%", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
