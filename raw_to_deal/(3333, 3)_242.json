Occupancy is 74%, while RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) increased by 14%, the highest increase of any big city in the western region of the United States.[101] Both Oakland and San Francisco were forecasted to experience the highest increases in ADR (Average daily rate).[102], 188640=The metropolitan area is served by Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) from eight stations in Oakland. The system has headquarters in Oakland, with major transfer hubs at MacArthur and 19th Street stations. BART's headquarters was located in a building above the Lake Merritt BART station until 2006, when it relocated to the Kaiser Center due to seismic safety concerns., 180264=Oakland is served by the Oakland Tribune, which published its first newspaper on February 21, 1874. The Tribune Tower, which features a large clock, is an Oakland landmark. At key times throughout the day (8:00\u00a0am, noon and 5:00\u00a0pm), the clock tower carillon plays a variety of classic melodies, which change daily. In 2007, the Oakland Tribune moved its offices from the tower to an East Oakland location, before folding in 2011.[154], 153464=Jean Quan was elected mayor in November 2010, beating Don Perata and Rebecca Kaplan in the city's first ranked choice balloting.[122], 62429=Oakland's highest point is near Grizzly Peak Blvd, east of Berkeley, just over 1,760 feet (540\u00a0m) above sea level at about 37\u00b052\u203243\u2033N 122\u00b013\u203227\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff37.8786\u00b0N 122.2241\u00b0W\ufeff / 37.8786; -122.2241. Oakland has 19 miles (31\u00a0km) of shoreline,[52] but Radio Beach is the only beach in Oakland., 200394=Water and sewage treatment are provided by East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). Pacific Gas and Electric Company provides natural gas and electricity service. Municipal garbage collection is franchised to Waste Management, Inc. Telecommunications and subscriber television services are provided by multiple private corporations and other service providers in accordance with the competitive objectives of the Telecommunications Act of 1996., 50642=Soon after the war, with the disappearance of Oakland's shipbuilding industry and the decline of its automobile industry, jobs became scarce. There was also an increase in racial tension.[37] Oakland was the center of a general strike during the first week of December 1946, one of six cities across the country that experienced such a strike after World War II.[38], 74771=The U.S. Weather Bureau kept weather records in downtown Oakland from October 4, 1894, to July 31, 1958. During that time, the record high temperature was 104\u00a0\u00b0F (40\u00a0\u00b0C) on June 24, 1957, and the record low temperature was 24\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0C) on January 23, 1949. Dry, warm offshore \"Diablo\" winds (similar to the Santa Ana winds of Southern California) sometimes occur, especially in fall, and raise the fire danger. In 1991, such an episode allowed the catastrophic Oakland Hills fire to spread and consume many homes. The wettest year was 1940 with 38.65 inches (982\u00a0mm) and the driest year was 1910 with 12.02 inches (305\u00a0mm). The most rainfall in one month was 15.35 inches (390\u00a0mm) in January 1911. The most rainfall in 24 hours was 4.27 inches (108\u00a0mm) on February 12, 1904.[57] Rainfall near the bayfront is only 23 inches per year, but is higher in the Oakland Hills to the east (up to 30 inches)., 194633=In 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake caused the Cypress Street Viaduct double-deck segment of the Nimitz Freeway to collapse, killing 42 people. The old freeway segment had passed through the middle of West Oakland, forming a barrier between West Oakland neighborhoods. Following the earthquake, this section was rerouted around the perimeter of West Oakland and rebuilt in 1999. The east span of the San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge also suffered damage from the quake when a 50-foot (15-m) section of the upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck; the damaged section was repaired within a month of the earthquake. As a result of Loma Prieta, a significant seismic retrofit was performed on the western span of the Bay Bridge. The eastern span is currently being replaced, with a projected completion date of 2014., 46265=During World War II, the East Bay Area was home to many war-related industries. Oakland's Moore Dry Dock Company expanded its shipbuilding capabilities and built over 100 ships. Valued at $100\u00a0million in 1943, Oakland's canning industry was its second-most-valuable war contribution after shipbuilding. The largest canneries were in the Fruitvale District and included the Josiah Lusk Canning Company, the Oakland Preserving Company (which started the Del Monte brand), and the California Packing Company.[32] The war attracted tens of thousands of laborers from around the country, though most were poor whites and blacks from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas\u2014sharecroppers and tenant farmers who had been recruited by Henry J. Kaiser to work in his shipyards. These immigrants from the Jim Crow South brought their racial attitudes with them, and the racial harmony that Oakland blacks had been accustomed to prior to the war evaporated.[33] Also migrating to the area during this time were many Mexican Americans from southwestern states such as New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado, many working for the Southern Pacific Railroad, at its major rail yard in West Oakland. Oakland experienced its own \"zoot suit riots\" in downtown Oakland in 1943 in the wake of the one in Los Angeles.[34], 85629=Ruptures along the nearby San Andreas fault caused severe earth movement in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1906 and 1989. San Andreas quakes induces creep (movement occurring on earthquake faults) in the Hayward fault, which runs directly through Oakland, Berkeley, San Jose and other Bay Area cities.[59] In 1991, an urban conflagration, the Oakland Hills Fire, destroyed nearly 4,000 homes and killed twenty five people in the Oakland hills range; it was the worst urban firestorm in American history.[44], 128319=Downtown Oakland has an assortment of bars and nightclubs. They include dive bars, dance clubs, modern lounges and jazz bars. The Paramount Theater features headlining musical tours and productions, while Fox Oakland Theatre draws various musical genres including jam bands, rock, punk, blues, jazz, and reggae. The Paramount and Fox theaters often book simultaneous events, creating busy nights uptown.[108] In 2012, Oakland was dubbed a \"New Sin City\", following its 2010 decision to relax its cabaret laws, which gave a boost to its nightclub and bar scene.[109], 42010=The original extent of Oakland, upon its incorporation, lay south of today's major intersection of San Pablo Avenue, Broadway, and Fourteenth Street. The city gradually annexed farmlands and settlements to the east and the north. Oakland's rise to industrial prominence, and its subsequent need for a seaport, led to the digging of a shipping and tidal channel in 1902, which created an island of nearby town Alameda. In 1906, its population doubled with refugees made homeless after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire., 19259=Oakland /\u02c8o\u028akl\u0259nd/ is a major West Coast port city in the U.S. state of California. The Port of Oakland is the busiest port for San Francisco Bay and all of Northern California. Oakland is the third largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area, the eighth-largest city in California, and the 45th-largest city in the U.S. with a population of 413,775 as of 2014[update].[12] Incorporated in 1852, Oakland is the county seat of Alameda County. It serves as a major transportation hub and trade center for the entire region and is also the principal city of the Bay Area Region known as the East Bay. The city is situated directly across the bay, six miles (9.7\u00a0km) east of San Francisco., 187320=Bus transit service in Oakland and the inner East Bay is provided by the Alameda and Contra Costa Transit District, AC Transit. The district originated in 1958 after the conspiratorial dissolution of the Key System of streetcars. Many AC Transit lines follow old routes of the Key System.[36], 131968=Modern-day Oakland has turned the quote on its head, with a statue downtown simply titled \"There.\" Additionally, in 2005 a sculpture called HERETHERE was installed by the City of Berkeley on the Berkeley-Oakland border at Martin Luther King Jr. Way. The sculpture consists of eight-foot-tall letters spelling \"HERE\" and \"THERE\" in front of the BART tracks as they descend from their elevated section in Oakland to the subway through Berkeley.[115], 201930=Originating in Oakland, Kaiser Permanente, is an HMO started in 1942, during World War II, by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser to provide medical care for Kaiser Shipyards workers. It is the largest managed care organization in the United States and the largest non-governmental health care provider in the world.[163] It is headquartered at 1950 Franklin Street in Downtown Oakland and maintains a large medical center in the Piedmont Avenue neighborhood., 61095=Oakland is on the east side of San Francisco Bay; in 1991 the City Hall tower was at 37\u00b048\u203219\u2033N 122\u00b016\u203221\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff37.805302\u00b0N 122.272539\u00b0W\ufeff / 37.805302; -122.272539 (NAD83). (The building still exists, but like the rest of the Bay Area it has shifted northwest perhaps 0.6 meter in the last twenty years.), 37530=In 1851, three men\u2014Horace Carpentier, Edson Adams, and Andrew Moon\u2014began developing what is now downtown Oakland. On May 4, 1852, the Town of Oakland incorporated. Two years later, on March 25, 1854, Oakland re-incorporated as the City of Oakland, with Horace Carpentier elected the first mayor, though a scandal ended his mayorship in less than a year. The city and its environs quickly grew with the railroads, becoming a major rail terminal in the late 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, the Central Pacific constructed the Oakland Long Wharf at Oakland Point, the site of today's Port of Oakland., 102226=In 2008 the median income for a household in the city was $48,596 and the median income for a family was $55,949. Males had a median income of $46,383 versus $44,690 for females. The per capita income for the city was $30,094. In 2007 approximately 15.3 percent of families and 17.0 percent of the general population were below the poverty line, including 27.9 percent of those under age 18 and 13.1 percent of those age 65 or over. 0.7% of the population is homeless.[72] Home ownership is 41%[72] and 14% of rental units are subsidized.[72] The unemployment rate as of August 2009 is 15.2%.[73], 101475=Oakland ranks in the top 20 of American cities in median household income, with a 2012 value of $51,863.[69] In 2012, the median income for a household in the city was $51,863 and the median income for a family was $59,459. The mean income for a household was $77,888 and the mean income for a family was $90,948. Males had a median income of $50,140 versus $50,304 for females.[70] The unemployment rate as of December 2013 was 9.7%.[71], 106482=Oakland is one of the most ethnically diverse major cities in the country.[75][76] Oakland was ranked the 4th most diverse city in America, with an overall diversity score of 91.4.[77] The city's formerly most populous ethnic group, whites, declined from 95.3% in 1940 to 32.5% by 1990. Since the 1960s, Oakland has been known as a center of Northern California's African-American community. However, between 2000 and 2010 Oakland lost nearly one-fourth of its black population.[78] The city demographics have changed due to a combination of gentrification, along with many blacks relocating to Bay Area suburbs, or moving to the Southern United States.[79][80][81] Blacks formed a strong plurality for many years, peaking in 1980 at about 47% of the population of Oakland., 24826=In recent years, Oakland has gained national recognition as a travel destination. In 2012, Oakland was named the top North American city to visit, highlighting its growing number of sophisticated restaurants and bars, top music venues, and increasing nightlife appeal.[14] Oakland also took the No. 16 spot in \"America's Coolest Cities,\" ranked by metrics like entertainment options and recreational opportunities per capita, etc.[15] In 2013, Oakland topped the No. 1 spot in \"America's Most Exciting Cities,\" notably having the most movie theaters, theater companies, and museums per square mile.[16] In \"America's Most Hipster Cities,\" Oakland took the No. 5 spot, cited for luring San Francisco \"hippies\" into the city.[17], 70584=Lake Merritt, an urban estuary near downtown, is a mix of fresh and salt water draining in and out from the Oakland Harbor at the San Francisco Bay and one of Oakland's most notable features.[54] It was designated the United States' first official wildlife refuge in 1870.[55] Originally a marsh-lined wildlife haven, Lake Merritt was dredged and bordered with parks from the 1890s to the 1910s. Despite this reduction in habitat, Oakland is home to a number of rare and endangered species, many of which are localized to serpentine soils and bedrock. Lake Merritt is surrounded by residential and business districts, including downtown and Grand Lake., 164231=Oakland's police force has dropped to 612 officers, down from more than 800 in 2009, and far below the 925 recommended by the city's strategic plan, but Oakland recently started to rebuild its force by hiring more often and recently graduating 34 officers.[132] Although the police department's resources have been diminishing, according to former Police Chief Howard Jordan the Oakland Police Department is committed to improved public safety by increasing police presence during peak crime hours, improving intelligence gathering, and moving more aggressively to arrest violent crime suspects.[137][138], 58793=Due to allegations of misconduct by the Oakland Police Department, the City of Oakland has paid claims for a total of $57 million during the 2001\u20132011 timeframe to plaintiffs claiming police abuse\u2014the largest sum of any city in California.[49] On October 10, 2011, protesters and civic activists began \"Occupy Oakland\" demonstrations at Frank Ogawa Plaza in Downtown Oakland.[50][51], 131223=Gertrude Stein wrote about Oakland in her 1937 book Everybody's Autobiography: \"There is no there there,\" Stein wrote on learning that the neighborhood where she lived as a child had been torn down to make way for an industrial park. The quote is sometimes misconstrued to refer to Oakland as a whole.[113][114], 55299=The Loma Prieta earthquake, a rupture of the San Andreas fault that affected the entire San Francisco Bay Area, occurred on October 17, 1989. The quake's surface wave measured 6.9 on the Richter magnitude scale, and many structures in Oakland were badly damaged. The double-decker portion of the Interstate 880 freeway structure collapsed. A section of the eastern span of the San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge also collapsed and was closed to traffic for one month., 165315=Among Oakland's 35 police patrol beats, violent crime remains a serious problem in specific East and West Oakland neighborhoods. In 2008, homicides were disproportionately concentrated: 72% occurred in three City Council districts, District 3 in West Oakland and Districts 6 and 7 in East Oakland, even though these districts represent only 44% of Oakland's residents.[139], 189944=The Oakland City Council adopted a Bicycle Master Plan in 1999 as a part of the Land Use and Transportation (LUTE) element of Oakland's 1998 General Plan. In addition, the Oakland City Council reaffirmed the bike plan in 2005 and 2007. Several miles of bike lanes were created as a result of the plan, with more awaiting funding.[citation needed] Facilities for parking thousands of bicycles have been installed downtown and in other commercial districts throughout Oakland.[citation needed] According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2011 American Community Survey, Oakland moved into 7th place in the nation by percentage of people that choose to commute by bike in 2011.[160], 57631=After his 1999 inauguration, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris' public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the Central Business District in Oakland's 1998 General Plan.[47] Brown's plan and other redevelopment projects were controversial due to potential rent increases and gentrification, which would displace lower-income residents from downtown Oakland into outlying neighborhoods and cities.[48] Further hampering Oakland's economic recovery were the economic crises in 2001 and 2008. These downturns resulted in lowered sales, rentals and occupancy of the new housing and slower growth and economic recovery than expected., 69008=Oakland has more than 50 distinct neighborhoods. The greater divisions in the city include downtown Oakland and its greater Central Business District, Lake Merritt, East Oakland, North Oakland, West Oakland, and the Oakland Hills. East Oakland, which includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses more than half of Oakland's land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt southeast to the San Leandro border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and Berkeley and Emeryville. West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the Oakland Point, and encompassing the Port of Oakland. In 2011, Oakland was ranked the 10th most walkable city in the United States.[53], 186582=The most recent census data compiled in 2007 before gasoline price spikes in 2008, show 24.3 percent of Oaklanders used public transportation, walked or used \"other means\" to commute to work, not including telecommuting,[157] with 17 percent of Oakland households being \"car free\" and or statistically categorized as having \"no vehicles available.\"[158], 21664=Oakland's territory covers what was once a mosaic of coastal terrace prairie, oak woodland, and north coastal scrub. Its land served as a rich resource when its hillside oak and redwood timber were logged to build San Francisco, and Oakland's fertile flatland soils helped it become a prolific agricultural region. In the late 1860s, Oakland was selected as the western terminal of the Transcontinental Railroad. It continued to grow in the 20th century with its busy port, shipyards, and a thriving automobile manufacturing industry. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated to Oakland, enlarging the city's population, increasing its housing stock and improving its infrastructure., 38402=A number of horsecar and cable car lines were constructed in Oakland during the latter half of the 19th century. The first electric streetcar set out from Oakland to Berkeley in 1891, and other lines were converted and added over the course of the 1890s. The various streetcar companies operating in Oakland were acquired by Francis \"Borax\" Smith and consolidated into what eventually became known as the Key System, the predecessor of today's publicly owned AC Transit., 51656=In 1960, Kaiser Corporation erected its headquarters; it was the largest skyscraper in Oakland, as well as \"the largest office tower west of Chicago\" up to that time.[39] In 1966, only 16 of the city's 661 police officers were black. Tensions between the black community and the largely white police force were high, and police malfeasance against blacks was common.[40][41] The Black Panther Party was founded by students Huey Newton and Bobby Seale at Merritt College.[42] During the 1970s, Oakland began to experience serious problems with gang-controlled dealing of heroin and cocaine when drug kingpin Felix Mitchell created the nation's first large-scale operation of this kind.[37] Both violent crime and property crime increased during this period, and Oakland's murder rate rose to twice that of San Francisco or New York City.[37], 35987=In 1772, the area that later became Oakland was claimed, with the rest of California, by Spanish settlers for the King of Spain. In the early 19th century, the Spanish crown granted the East Bay area to Luis Mar\u00eda Peralta for his Rancho San Antonio. The grant was confirmed by the successor Mexican republic upon its independence from Spain.[19] Upon his death in 1842, Peralta divided his land among his four sons. Most of Oakland fell within the shares given to Antonio Maria and Vicente.[20] The portion of the parcel that is now Oakland was called encinal\u2014Spanish for \"oak grove\"\u2014due to the large oak forest that covered the area, which eventually led to the city's name.[21], 116525=As of 2014, the top employers in the city were:[99], 161219=Oakland's crime rate began to escalate during the late 1960s, and by the end of the 1970s Oakland's per capita murder rate had risen to twice that of its neighbor city, San Francisco, or that of New York City.[128] The rise in crime may have been an effect of the different method that was used to deal with rebellious youth. Prior to 1960, there were successful government funded social programs, where workers would work in neighborhoods searching for rebellious teens to enter them in youth centers that would be able to teach them proper values and improve their behavior.[129] However, by the late 1960s,the police and Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) used military tactics to manage unwanted behavior, that then led to an increase in crime and imprisonment.[129] During the first decade of the 21st century Oakland has consistently been listed as one of the most dangerous large cities in the United States.[130] Until 2010 the homicide rate dropped four times in a row, and violent crime in general had dropped 27%. Violent crime in general, and homicides in particular, increased during 2011.[131] In 2012 Oakland reported 131 homicides, the highest since 2006 (when there were 148 recorded).[132][133] In 2013, there was a 33% decrease in homicides, allowing Oakland to record its lowest homicide count since 2004. Aggravated assaults were down 10% and rapes declined by 27%, reaching its lowest level in eight years.[134][135] In the first quarter of 2014, homicides, aggravated assaults, and burglaries were down 15% relative to 2013. Additionally, shootings were down 31% and robberies were down 36%.[136], 44509=Oakland expanded during the 1920s, flexing enough to meet the influx of factory workers. Approximately 13,000 homes were built between 1921 and 1924,[27] more than between 1907 and 1920.[28] Many of the large downtown office buildings, apartment buildings, and single-family houses still standing in Oakland were built during the 1920s; and they reflect the architectural styles of the time., 45113=Russell Clifford Durant established Durant Field at 82nd Avenue and East 14th Street in 1916.[29] The first transcontinental airmail flight finished its journey at Durant Field on August 9, 1920, flown by Army Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker and Navy Lt. Bert Acosta.[30] Durant Field was often called Oakland Airport, though the current Oakland International Airport was soon established four miles (6.4\u00a0km) southwest.[31], 54212=On October 20, 1991, a massive firestorm swept down from the Berkeley Hills above the Caldecott Tunnel. Twenty-five people were killed, 150 people were injured, and nearly 4,000 homes destroyed. With the loss of life and an estimated economic loss of $1.5 billion, this was the worst urban firestorm in American history.[44][45] During the mid-1990s, Oakland experienced an improved economy compared to previous decades, with large development and urban renewal projects, concentrated especially in the downtown area, at the Port of Oakland and at the Oakland International Airport.[46], 151878=Oakland has a mayor-council government. The mayor is elected for a four-year term. The Oakland City Council has eight council members representing seven districts in Oakland with one member elected at-large; council members serve staggered four-year terms. The mayor appoints a city administrator, subject to the confirmation by the City Council, who is the chief administrative officer of the city. Other city officers include: city attorney (elected), city auditor (elected), and city clerk (appointed by city administrator).[119] Oakland's mayor is limited to two terms. There are no term limits for the city council. Council member Larry Reid, also serving as vice-mayor, was elected to a fifth term in November 2012.[120], 170324=Oakland's three largest public high schools are Oakland High School, Oakland Technical High School, and Skyline High School. Oakland Tech has various academies, including its much renowned Engineering Academy, which sent more girls to MIT in 2007 than any other public school west of the Mississippi.[citation needed] There are also numerous small public high schools within Castlemont Community of Small Schools, Fremont Federation of High Schools, and McClymonds Educational Complex, all of which were once single, larger public high schools that were reorganized due to poor performance (Castlemont High School, Fremont High School, and McClymonds High School, respectively)., 177246=In 2001, the SFSU Oakland Multimedia Center was opened, allowing San Francisco State University to conduct classes near downtown Oakland.[151] The Oakland Higher Education Consortium and the City of Oakland's Community and Economic Development Agency (CEDA) opened the Oakland Higher Education Center downtown in 2002 to provide \"access to multiple higher education service providers within a shared urban facility.\" Member schools include primary user California State University, East Bay as well as Lincoln University, New College of California, Saint Mary's College of California, SFSU Multimedia Studies Program, UC Berkeley Extension, University of Phoenix and Peralta Community College District.[152][153], 168319=Most public schools in Oakland are operated by the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), which covers the entire city of Oakland; due to financial troubles and administrative failures, it has been in receivership by the state of California since 2002. The Oakland Unified School District (2006\u20132007) includes 59 elementary schools, 23 middle schools, 19 high schools, with 9 alternative education schools and programs, 4 adult education schools and early childhood education centers at most of the elementary schools[144] There are 46,000 K\u201312 students, 32,000 adult students, and 6,000 plus employees.[145] In the 2005 results of the STAR testing, over 50 percent of students taking the test performed \"below basic,\" while only 20 percent performed at least \"proficient\" on the English section of the test.[146] Some individual schools have much better performance than the city-wide average, for instance, in 2005 over half the students at Hillcrest Elementary School in the Montclair upper hills neighborhood performed at the \"advanced\" level in the English portion of the test, and students at Lincoln Elementary School in the Chinatown neighborhood performed at the \"advanced\" level in the math portion., 109457=An analysis by the Urban Institute of U.S. Census 2000 numbers showed that Oakland had the third-highest concentration of gays and lesbians among the 50 largest U.S. cities, behind San Francisco and Seattle. Census data showed that, among incorporated places that have at least 500 female couples, Oakland had the nation's largest proportion. In 2000, Oakland counted 2,650 lesbian couples; one in every 41 Oakland couples listed themselves as a same-sex female partnership.[85][86], 114814=As of 2013, the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward metropolitan area has a GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of $360.4 billion, ranking eighth among metropolitan areas in the United States.[96] In 2014, Oakland was amongst the best cities to start a career, the highest ranked city in California after San Francisco.
