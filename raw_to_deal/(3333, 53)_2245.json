Figure 4 shows a graphical example with two different activities (creation and publication) that happened at different points in time. Creation precedes publication, so instead of creating different blank nodes for their respective usage and generation, both activities share the same blank node (_:createdEntity). 2) Another solution is to sort all the activities according to their logical order, if known, and conflate the specialized entity (blank node) result of one activity with the specialized entity (blank node) input of the subsequent activity.
