Afterward, the judging team underwent numerous changes. Judges The televised portion of the show runs for approximately 14 weeks. Each week viewers are given the opportunity to phone in their vote for their favorite singer during a (typically) 2-hour period following the conclusion of each show. The results are announced the following night, and each week the singer with the least number of votes leaves the show. The group of singers decreases each week, until finally the one singer who remains wins the title of American Idol. Voting The singers are chosen by auditions in several cities throughout the United States. After over one hundred thousand contestants [1] [2] audition in several locations throughout the U.S., a group is chosen by the panel of judges to continue in the competition. These singers will appear on the television show.
