Detailed information about each key is available in later sections. Key Summary Launch Services keys use the prefix LS to distinguish them from other keys. For more information about Launch Services in OS X, see Launch Services Programming Guide and Launch Services Reference. Launch Services (part of the Core Services framework in OS X) provides support for launching apps and matching document types to apps. As a result, the keys recognized by Launch Services allow you to specify the desired execution environment for your bundled code. (In iOS, Launch Services is a private API but is still used internally to coordinate the execution environment of iOS apps.)
