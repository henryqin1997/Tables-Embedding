Table 3 presents the different shrimp culture systems in Sri Lanka. Shrimp also contributes significantly to the total foreign exchange earnings from aquatic products, which varied from 48.5 % to 70.3 % during the period 1985 to 1992 (Table 4). Except for the years 1987 and 1988, there was an increasing trend in the quantity of shrimps exported. After 1989, there was a sharp reduction in export quantities due to disease outbreaks in farms., 8596=Baticados, M. C. L and Paclibare, J. O. 1991.

The adverse effects of these disease outbreaks were reflected in shrimp exports up to year 1989/1990 (Table 4). Several symptoms have been observed and identified (Table 9). The same table summarises shrimp production before and during outbreaks at several farm sites. Average production has dropped from 5.3 t/ha/cycle to 1.9 t/ha/cycle due to disease outbreaks. There has been an average of 64% reduction in production due to disease outbreaks. Common symptoms observed were microfouling; reduced frequency of moulting; black/brown gill condition; reduced feeding; and shrimps dying on pond sides. Imports of contaminated larvae with MBV from South East Asia, bad management practices, relatively high stocking densities, poor water exchange, location of farms on acid sulphate soils and poor pond preparatory procedures have been identified as the probable causes of the disease outbreaks. Economic losses are indicated in Table 9 at selected farm sites during disease outbreaks. A deterioration of environmental quality in the main water source (Dutch Canal) has been identified as a main contributory factors to disease outbreaks., 90184=Removal of mangroves for construction of shrimp farms and for obtaining fence posts for shrimp farms has taken place in the North Western Province. Of a total area of 1,083 ha utilised or earmarked for brackishwater shrimp farming on the north western coast in 1987, 359.5 ha were located in healthy mangrove areas. Destruction of mangrove in the buffer zones between farms and open water sources has also been reported. With the further expansion of the shrimp farming industry, mangrove areas on the north western coasts of Sri Lanka are under threat. The Inter-Ministerial Scoping Committee does not approve the utilisation of dense mangrove areas for aquaculture projects., 45110=Aquaculture in Sri Lanka is a relatively new development, with interest in fish culture first appearing during the 1950's. Shrimp culture, however, was only initiated during the last decade and before this time shrimp production in Sri Lanka was based solely on capture fisheries. Shrimp culture started in the early 1980's and the first commercial production entered the market in 1984 in very small quantities. During 1992, the total production of cultured shrimps was around 1,200 tonnes. The annual per capita consumption of fish, shrimp and other aquatic products is currently around 17.5 kg. The target per capita consumption is 21 kg, in line with the Government policy to increase nutritional standards of the people. According to targets, Sri Lanka is expected to earn Rs. 1,252 million by 1994 from the shrimp culture industry (Table. 1). This will represent 63% of total foreign exchange earnings from the export of aquatic products. The fisheries sector contributes 1.9% to the gross domestic production (GDP) of Sri Lanka., 109461=Marshlands and mangroves (29.6%) and bare land (25.9%) are the main land use categories presently utilised for shrimp culture (Table 11).

Inland fish production, 1979\u20131989., 64658=National Plan In view of its great potential for development, fisheries and shrimp culture in Sri Lanka has been accorded a high priority in the National Fisheries Development Plan (1990\u20131994). A high priority has also been given to raising the production of shrimp by increasing the pond area from 750 ha in 1990 to 2,000 ha in 1994. Other activities, such as the culture of bivalves, groupers, seaweeds, crabs, milkfish and brine shrimp, have been identified as potential fields for future development. This plan also takes into consideration environmental issues, particularly environmental conservation and management. There are several schemes to finance aquaculture ventures in the Export Development Board (EDB), Board of Investment (BOI) and in banks. Low interest rates, tax concessions, tax holidays and duty free imports are some incentives given to developers., 87741=Most of the wetlands in demand for aquaculture developments are located in flood plains. Wetlands absorb flood water and release it slowly. In Puttalam, 450 acres of land to be used for aquaculture purposes form part of a total flood plain of 1,370 acres (Figure 4). Conversion of these lands to ponds will reduce the flood plain by around 33 percent. Various adverse effects are predicted including a rise in flood level, retention of floods for a prolonged period, inundation of paddy fields and the complete cut-off of several fishing villages downstream. During 1992, unusual flood levels were observed in Archchikattuwa AGA Division where there is considerable development of shrimp culture., 118113=NACA 1989.

This province is subdivided in to 10 administrative sub-divisions. The coastline of the NWP is approximately 120 km and includes several lagoons, estuarine systems and connected water areas. Three climatic zones (wet zone, dry zone and arid zone) can be identified in this district and shrimp farms are located in all of these zones.
