Let yourself be heard or just see what others have to say on the Baseball Challenge forum. Join Our Baseball Challenge Forum Best of luck in picking out superstars, landing those bargains and building the best team money can buy. Happy drafting! You have the option to play either weekly (where you lock in a roster once a week) or daily (you can change your roster each day), depending on what type of challenge suits you best. Obviously, the big wrinkle is the salary cap, as you'll have to balance drafting high-priced stars and potential bargain-priced sleepers who could eventually rise in value based on their performance. Luckily, we now have a floating salary cap, so if your players rise in value, so will your salary cap, giving you extra flexibility to improve your roster. Locking in those bargain sleepers early could pay off in the long run. That's all there is to it, scoring-wise. Pitching staffs get points in this way: 1 out = +1 (complete IP = +3), ER = -3, Hit = -1, BB =", "textAfterTable": "* - Denotes tiebreaker used Leaderboard of Weekly entries. - View Leaderboard - Prizes Play Baseball Challenge for your chance to win a $1,000 Best Buy gift card.
