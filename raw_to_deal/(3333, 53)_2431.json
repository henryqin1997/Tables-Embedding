We look at the leaders in YAC+ for 2014 and the last nine years., 16020=I remember in 2005 the Denver Broncos went 13-3 and had the #9 defensive DVOA despite absolute dreck at the D-Line (that was the height of the \"Browncos\" years, right after Trevor Pryce walked) by becoming the most blitz-happy team I have ever seen. It was almost surreal some of the stuff they did. Against the Eagles that year, for instance, they opened the game by rushing 6+ defenders on four of the first five snaps, including a 7-man blitz and an insane \"kitchen sink\" blitz where they rushed NINE. That was absurd- they basically had two defenders playing cover-2 in case the Eagles managed to get a pass off, and everyone else just took off after McNabb the second the ball was snapped. I have never, ever seen another 9-man blitz before or since in the NFL. For all of his faults, I will give Larry Coyer this- he had cajones. I sometimes wondered if he specifically unveiled that beauty against the Eagles to try to show up Jim Johnson., 2210=Of course, if you want to get this sort of information for every team, you can head to our Online Store and purchase the PDF of Football Outsiders Almanac 2009., 4185=The Bears have always had a more aggresive, blitzing, style of T-2, but yeah I'd say that much blitzing showed trouble. Specifically on the front 4. A Tampa-2 that can't consistently get pressure with it's front 4 is a bad Tampa-2 (Just look at how Indy's #1 scoring D did in the 2007 playoffs with Freeney on IR, Mathis playing on two bad knees and Raheem Brock playing DE with a rib injury while still bulked up to be a starting DT.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:45:46 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "The answer is, somehow, both yes and no. Here's the Ravens' blitz frequencies in 2008: Is Scott correct? Well, this is the exact sort of question the Game Charting Project can answer. Scott: A lot of people think that we blitz a lot, but when you break it down and see how many people are actually rushing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually not more than four. So if only four people are rushing, how is it a blitz? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about switching up your rushes and not having a blueprint. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly changing things up, how are teams going to get a read on you and expect you to be in certain places at certain times? You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. PFW: Ryan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defense has the reputation of being very blitz-happy. Is that accurate? Pro Football Weekly has an interview with Bart Scott (hat tip: PFT) that discusses Rex Ryan's love of the blitz. On Rex Ryan And \"Blitzing\" 11 Jul 2009 blog advertising is good for you Official", "textAfterTable": "Scott is technically right -- the Ravens did blitz four or fewer 64 percent of the time. However, as you can see from their league-wide ranks, they blitzed five or more far more than the average team. They did not, however, lead the league in blitzes of five players or more. Team 3-4 Rushers 5+ Rushers % of Plays w/5+ Rushers DAL 297 268 47.4% CHI 398 247 38.3% WAS 328 201 38.0% PHI 353 216 38.0% ARI 339 205 37.7% BAL 352 207 37.0% So then, it all depends on your baseline. If your baseline is in a vacuum, Scott is right. If your baseline is the rest of the league, Scott is wrong.
