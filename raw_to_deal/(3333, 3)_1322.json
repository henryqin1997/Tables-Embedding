In addition, the claim 'very low gluten' will be used for foods such as bread, produced using cereals that have been specially processed to remove most of the gluten and containing gluten less than 30 mg daily.

The inadequate fiber intake is likely to be related to the composition of many GF foods made with starches and /or refined flours with low content in fiber [ 25 ]. The analysis of diet of 47 adults in USA showed that the recommended amount of calcium, iron and fibers was consumed only by 32, 44 and 46% of women included in the study [ 32 , 25 ) [ Table 1 ] and some nutritional deficiencies have been described after treatment with a long-term GFD for about 8-12 years ( 25 , 24 ]. Other authors have shown that gluten free diet does not guarantee adequate nutritional intake [ 32 , 26 , 22 Previous studies have demonstrated that most of these nutritional deficiencies disappear after following strictly a gluten free diet [ ].

Subjects with celiac disease tend to compensate for the restrictions of a gluten-free diet by eating foods containing high levels of fat, sugar and calories, therefore celiac patients may show an excessive consumption of total fats and saturated fats [ 41 ]. Mariani et al. [ 41 ] reported that diet of CD adolescent patients was hyperproteic and hyperlipidic and contained low amounts of carbohydrates, iron, calcium, and fiber. Polito et al. [ 42 ] and Rea et al. [ 43 ] observed an excess in energy, animal protein, and lipid intake, which was partially responsible for the high percentage of overweight patients. As far as concerns fat composition of gluten-free products, it has been evidenced that they contain trans fatty acids [ 44 ] that may provoke metabolic imbalance when in association with a inadequate intake of essential fatty acids [ 45 ].
