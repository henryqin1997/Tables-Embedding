His memoir is one of the foundation stones of research on Auschwitz, an indispensable contribution to the complex and fearsome reality of the camp.\u201d People in Auschwitz is very different from other works on the most infamous of Nazi annihilation centers. Langbein\u2019s account is a scrupulously scholarly achievement intertwining his own experiences with quotations from other inmates, SS guards and administrators, civilian industry and military personnel, and official documents. Whether his recounting deals with captors or inmates, Langbein analyzes the events and their context objectively, in an unemotional style, rendering a narrative that is unique in the history of the Holocaust. This monumental book helps us comprehend what has so tenaciously challenged understanding. Hermann Langbein was allowed to know and see extraordinary things forbidden to other Auschwitz inmates.
