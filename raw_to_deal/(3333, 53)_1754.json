The permission descriptions are only for providing a general idea of the purposes of the permissions; a permission may mediate many operations. The document has the following caveats: This document contains a list of all of the object classes and permissions for modern SELinux systems (starting in kernel 2.6.0). Each permission has a brief description of of the semantics of each permission, in addition to the versions of the kernel which support the permission and the policy capability that enables its enforcement (if applicable).
