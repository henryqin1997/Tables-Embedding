Although the modesetting drivers live in the kernel, they are maintained by the same people who maintain our userspace graphics drivers. See KernelBugTriage#Video_Subsystem_bugs Determine which kernel subsystem or driver is involved. Prefix the bug subject with the driver/subsytem (e.g. ALSA, USB, ACPI, etc). Read over the bug and come up with a basic classification (kernel panic, boot issue, RFE, missing/broken functionality, etc). Add a comment to the bug that provides this classification. Steps (Start at the top, work to the bottom): So you've decided to do kernel bug triage. AWESOME! We could use the help. If you're already familiar with bugzilla and the kernel, here is a quickstart set of steps to help us triage the existing bugs. If you aren't familiar with kernel bugs, or need a refresher, the rest of the page has some good background on various aspects of kernel triage and we encourage you to read it before diving in. Triage Quickstart Upstream Kernel Bugs Fedora Kernel Security Bugs (all versions) Fedora rawhide Kernel Bugs Fedora", "textAfterTable": "If multiple categories apply, add them each to the CC list. For oopses, add the oopsing function to the end of the bug subject. E.g. IP:hci_send_sco. For things like __list_del_entry, which are common kernel functions, try to find the latest function that was called before that and use that as the suffix. Look for duplicate bugs across all Fedora releases. If you find a duplicate, use whichever bug has the most information as the \"active\" bug and duplicate the other in bugzilla. If you duplicate a bug from a newer release against one in an older release, then change the version on the active bug to the newest version the issue has been seen on. If the bug is new, try to determine which kernel version it was first seen with. Note this in the bugzilla whiteboard with \"first=X.Y.Z\" (e.g. first=3.1.0). Also try to determine which kernel version is the latest tested and still having the issue. Note this in the bugzilla whiteboard with \"latest=X.Y.Z\" (e.g. latest=3.8.7). If the bug is missing information, ask for it and put the bug in NEEDINFO. This can include things like dmesg, modules in use, full panic/oops backtraces, or questions as to what was occurring on the machine at the time. Information should be attached as text/plain attachments, or simple comments in the bug if the information is fairly short. In order to avoid information overload, please ask for only relevant missing information", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
