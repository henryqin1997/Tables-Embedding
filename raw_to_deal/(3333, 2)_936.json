Unfortunately for its fans, of which there seem to be very little, the ratings of Dracula are low. The past three episodes the ratings were only one tenth higher than cancelled show Ironside\u2019s lowest rating. There is still a little hope, but Dracula is likely to get cancelled. Just like ABC, NBC didn\u2019t air a lot of scripted series this week. One of the series that did air is Grimm. The series is in its third season which makes it more likely to get a fourth season so it well get to the syndication threshold. Since the ratings have somewhat settled down we predict Grimm is certainly going to be renewed. Dracula NBC Predictions: Welcome To Sweden to be cancelled?
