Display of these respective amino acid sequences on an idealized alpha helix revealed a periodic repetition of leucine residues at every seventh position over a distance covering eight helical turns. The periodic array of at least four leucines was also noted in the sequences of the Fos and Jun transforming proteins, as well as that of the yeast gene regulatory protein, GCN4. The polypeptide segments containing these periodic arrays of leucine residues are proposed to exist in an alpha-helical conformation, and the leucine side chains extending from one alpha helix interdigitate with those displayed from a similar alpha helix of a second polypeptide, facilitating dimerization. This hypothetical structure is referred to as the \"leucine zipper,\" and it may represent a characteristic property of a new category of DNA binding proteins., 3132=There are 41740 HOX domains in 38753 proteins in SMART's nrdb database.}", "textBeforeTable": "Metabolism (metabolic pathways involving proteins which contain this domain) OMIM:193500: Waardenburg syndrome, type I ; Waardenburg syndrome, type III OMIM:148820: Rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar OMIM:268220: Craniofacial-deafness-hand syndrome OMIM:122880: Paired box protein Pax-3 (P23760) (SMART) OMIM:300039: Deafness, X-linked 3, conductive, with stapes fixation OMIM:304400: POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 4 (P49335) (SMART) OMIM:137600: Iridogoniodysgenesis syndrome OMIM:601542: Rieger syndrome OMIM:180500: Iridogoniodysgenesis syndrome-2 OMIM:137600: Pituitary homeobox 2 (Q99697) (SMART) OMIM:600733: Pancreatic agenesis OMIM:260370: MODY, type IV Pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (P52945) (SMART) OMIM:142946: Holoprosencephaly-4 OMIM:602630: Holoprosencephaly-4 OMIM:142946: Homeobox protein TGIF1 (Q15583) (SMART) OMIM:602575: Nail-patella syndrome OMIM:161200: Nail-patella syndrome with open-angle glaucoma OMIM:137750: LIM homeobox transcription factor 1-beta (O60663) (SMART) OMIM:602225: Cone-rod retinal dystrophy-2 OMIM:120970: Leber congenital amaurosis due to defect in CRX OMIM:204000: Retinitis pigmentosa, late-onset dominant Cone-rod homeobox protein (O43186) (SMART) OMIM:168500: Parietal foramina OMIM:605420: Parietal", "textAfterTable": "map04111 Cell cycle - yeast This information is based on mapping of SMART genomic protein database to KEGG orthologous groups.
