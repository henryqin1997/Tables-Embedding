This effectively limits the resolution on the second display device to somewhere around 1280x1024 (for a description of how Pixel Clock frequencies limit the programmable modes, see the XFree86 Video Timings HOWTO). This constraint is not present on GeForce4 or GeForce FX GPUs -- the maximum pixel clock is the same on both heads., 1027595=Starting with Linux 2.6.9, the default size of the SWIOTLB is 64 MB and overflow handling is improved. Both of these changes are expected to greatly improve stability on Intel's EM64T platform. If you consider upgrading your Linux kernel to benefit from these improvements, NVIDIA recommends that you upgrade to Linux 2.6.11 or a more recent Linux kernel. See the previous section for additional information., 1110197=Linux distributions based on kernel 2.4.19 and later *should* incorporate the bug fix, but older kernels require help from the user in ensuring that a small portion of advanced speculative caching is disabled (normally done through a kernel patch) and a boot option is specified in order to apply the whole fix., 604750=the resulting virtual screen size will be 1600 x 1536., 1062368=This release includes support for the XVideo Motion Compensation (XvMC) version 1.0 API on GeForce 5 series, GeForce 6 series and GeForce 7 series addin cards, as well as motherboard chipsets with integrated graphics that have PureVideo support. There is a static library, \"libXvMCNVIDIA.a\", and a dynamic one, \"libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so\", which is suitable for dlopening. XvMC's \"IDCT\" and \"motion-compensation\" levels of acceleration, AI44 and IA44 subpictures, and 4:2:0 Surfaces up to 2032x2032 are supported., 854966=On ALi1541 and ALi1647 chipsets, NVIDIA drivers disable AGP to work around timing issues and signal integrity issues. See Chapter\u00a08, Common Problems for more information on ALi chipsets., 1012760=When using 1007, 1007A or 1009 adjust the IO Recovery Time to 4 cycles., 856835=The only web released NVIDIA Linux driver that is affected by this problem (i.e., the only driver to use either version 1.8 or 1.9 of the NV-CONTROL X extension) is 1.0-8756., 1001845=Some versions of the glibc package shipped by Red Hat that support TLS do not properly handle using dlopen() to access shared libraries which use some TLS models. This problem is exhibited, for example, when Quake3 Area dlopen()'s NVIDIA's libGL library. Please obtain at least glibc-2.3.2-11.9 which is available as an update from Red Hat., 1113735=On ALi1541 and ALi1647 chipsets, NVIDIA drivers disable AGP to work around timing and signal integrity problems. You can force AGP to be enabled on these chipsets by setting NVreg_EnableALiAGP to 1. Note that this may cause the system to become unstable., 592285=provides access to that dead area by allowing you to pan the 1024x768 viewport up and down in the 1024x1200 panning domain., 619557=This is not necessary. The driver contained within all 173.14.28 .run files will be identical. There is no need to reinstall., 1102415=parameter to the kernel (via LILO or GRUB, for example) to disable AGPGART support. As of Linux 2.6.11, most AGPGART backend drivers should respect this parameter., 839664=Many 2.4 and 2.6 x86_64 kernels have an accounting problem in their implementation of the change_page_attr kernel interface. Early 2.6 kernels include a check that triggers a BUG() when this situation is encountered (triggering a BUG() results in the current application being killed by the kernel; this application would be your OpenGL application or potentially the X server). The accounting issue has been resolved in the 2.6.11 kernel., 1012873=AGP is disabled by default on some ALi chipsets (ALi1541, ALi1647) to work around severe system stability problems with these chipsets. See the comments for EnableALiAGP in nv-reg.h to force AGP on anyway., 734551=Copyright \u00a9 2006 NVIDIA Corporation, 884253=If the EDID did not provide any detailed timings (or there was no EDID at all), the best valid mode not larger than 1024x768 is used as the \"nvidia-auto-select\" mode. The 1024x768 limit is imposed here to restrict use of modes that may have been validated, but may be too large to be considered a reasonable default, such as 2048x1536., 592435=Offsets can be used in conjunction with panning domains to position the panning domains in the virtual screen space (note that the offset describes the panning domain, and only affects the viewport in that the viewport must be contained within the panning domain). For example, the following describes two modes, each with a panning domain width of 1900 pixels, and the second display is positioned below the first:, 1012664=When using a P5A upgrade to BIOS Revision 1002 BETA 2., 754863=Enables RGB workstation overlay visuals. This is only supported on Quadro GPUs (Quadro NVS GPUs excluded) in depth 24. This option causes the server to advertise the SERVER_OVERLAY_VISUALS root window property and GLX will report single- and double-buffered, Z-buffered 16-bit overlay visuals. The transparency key is pixel 0x0000 (hex). There is no gamma correction support in the overlay plane. This feature requires XFree86 version 4.1.0 or newer, or the X.Org X server. When TwinView is enabled, or the X screen is either wider than 2046 pixels or taller than 2047, the overlay may be emulated with a substantial performance penalty. RGB workstation overlays are not supported when the Composite extension is enabled. Dynamic TwinView is disabled when Overlays are enabled. Default: off., 1046045=Extract the contents of ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-173.14.28.run, but do not run nvidia-installer., 880468=Once modes from all mode sources are validated and the mode pool is constructed, all modes with the same resolution are compared; the best mode with that resolution is added to the mode pool a second time, using just the resolution as its unique modename (e.g., \"1600x1200\"). In this way, when you request a mode using the traditional names (e.g., \"1600x1200\"), you still get what you got before (the 'best' 1600x1200 mode); the added benefit is that all modes in the mode pool can be addressed by a unique name., 1026395=Newer kernels provide a simple way to allocate memory that is guaranteed to reside within the 32 bit physical address space. Kernel 2.6.15 provides this functionality with the __GFP_DMA32 interface. Kernels earlier than this version provide a software I/O TLB on Intel's EM64T and IOMMU support on AMD's AMD64 platform., 989696=Previous releases of the NVIDIA Accelerated Linux Graphics Driver attempted to work around this problem. Unfortunately, the workaround caused problems with other applications and was removed after version 1.0-1541., 659241=For the most complete and accurate listing of supported GPUs, please see the Supported Products List, available from the NVIDIA Linux x86 Graphics Driver download page. Please go to http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html, follow the Archive link under the Linux x86 heading, follow the link for the 173.14.28 driver, and then go to the Supported Products List., 602306=Why can I not get a resolution of 1600x1200 on the second display device when using a GeForce2 MX?, 1072393=In April 2004 the X.Org Foundation released an X server based on the XFree86 server. While your release may use the X.Org X server, rather than XFree86, the differences between the two should have no impact on NVIDIA Linux users with two exceptions:, 843493=Unfortunately, current Linux kernels (as of 2.6.11.x) do not understand or support 64-bit BARs. If the BIOS does place any NVIDIA PCI I/O regions above the 32-bit address space, the kernel will reject the BAR and the NVIDIA driver will not work., 840130=We have added checks to recognize that the NVIDIA kernel module is being compiled for the x86-64 platform on a kernel between 2.6.0 and 2.6.11. In this case, we will disable usage of the change_page_attr kernel interface. This will avoid the accounting issue but leaves the system in danger of cache aliasing (see entry below on Cache Aliasing for more information about cache aliasing). Note that this change_page_attr accounting issue and BUG() can be triggered by other kernel subsystems that rely on this interface., 840676=If you are using a 2.6 x86_64 kernel, it is recommended that you upgrade to a 2.6.11 or later kernel.}", "lastModified": "Thu, 10 Oct 2013 20:49:30 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "The \"TVStandard\" option should be added to your screen section; valid values are: The Modes in the screen section of your X configuration file; you can use these to request any of the modes in the mode pool which the X driver created for this combination of TV standard and TV encoder. Examples include \"640x480\" and \"800x600\". If in doubt, use \"nvidia-auto-select\". To use your TV with X, there are several relevant X configuration options: Additionally, the NVIDIA driver contains a hardcoded list of mode sizes that it can drive for each combination of TV encoder and TV standard. Therefore, custom modelines in your X configuration file are ignored for TVs. Because these TV modes only depend on the TV encoder and the TV standard, TV modes do not go through normal mode validation. The X configuration options HorizSync and VertRefresh are not used for TV mode validation. The NVIDIA X driver populates the mode pool for the TV with all the mode sizes that the driver supports with the given TV standard and the TV encoder on the graphics card. These modes are given names that correspond to their resolution; e.g., \"800x600\".
