In decimal, 27 divided by 5 is 5, with a remainder of 2., 15202=In 1854, British mathematician George Boole published a landmark paper detailing an algebraic system of logic that would become known as Boolean algebra. His logical calculus was to become instrumental in the design of digital electronic circuitry.[3], 44974=Contohnya, nombor binari 1011 dan 1010 didarabkan seperti berikut:, 76117=The phenomenon that the binary representation of any rational is either terminating or recurring also occurs in other radix-based numeral systems. See, for instance, the explanation in decimal. Another similarity is the existence of alternative representations for any terminating representation, relying on the fact that 0.111111... is the sum of the geometric series 2\u22121 + 2\u22122 + 2\u22123 + ... which is 1., 48181=Here, the divisor is 1012, atau 5 perpuluhan, sementara the dividend is 110112, atau 27 perpuluhan. The procedure is the same as that of decimal pembahagian panjang; here, the divisor 1012 goes into the first three digits 1102 of the dividend one time, so a \"1\" is written on the top line. This hasil is multiplied by the divisor, dan subtracted from the first three digits of the dividend; the next digit (a \"1\") is included to obtain a new three-digit sequence:, 16017=In 1937, Claude Shannon produced his master's thesis at MIT that implemented Boolean algebra dan binary arithmetic using electronic relays dan switches for the first time in history. Entitled A Symbolic Analysis of Relay dan Switching Circuits, Shannon's thesis essentially founded practical digital circuit design.[4], 14237=The modern binary nombor system was fully documented by Gottfried Leibniz in his article Explication de l'Arithm\u00e9tique Binaire[1](1703). Leibniz's system uses 0 dan 1, like the modern binary numeral system. As a Sinophile, Leibniz was aware of the I Ching dan noted with fascination how its hexagrams correspond to the binary numbers from 0 to 111111, dan concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.[2], 57600=In a fractional binary nombor such as .110101101012, the first digit is , the second , etc. So if there is a 1 in the first place after the decimal, then the nombor is at least , dan vice versa. Double that nombor is at least 1. This suggests the algorithm: Repeatedly double the nombor to be converted, record if the hasil is at least 1, dan then throw away the integer part., 37203=Dalam contoh ini, dua angka sedang ditambah: 011012 (1310) dan 101112 (2310). The top row shows the carry bits used. Starting in the rightmost column, 1 + 1 = 102. The 1 is carried to the left, dan the 0 is written at the bottom of the rightmost column. The second column from the right is added: 1 + 0 + 1 = 102 again; the 1 is carried, dan 0 is written at the bottom. The third column: 1 + 1 + 1 = 112. This time, a 1 is carried, dan a 1 is written in the bottom row. Proceeding like this gives the final answer 1001002 (36 decimal)., 16940=In November 1937, George Stibitz, then working at Bell Labs, completed a relay-based computer he dubbed the \"Model K\" (for \"Kitchen\", where he had assembled it), which calculated using binary addition.[5] Bell Labs thus authorized a full research programme in late 1938 with Stibitz at the helm. Their Complex Number Computer, completed January 8, 1940, was able to calculate complex numbers. In a demonstration to the American Mathematical Society conference at Dartmouth College on September 11, 1940, Stibitz was able to send the Complex Number Calculator remote commands over telephone lines by a teletype. It was the first computing machine ever used remotely over a phone line. Some participants of the conference who witnessed the demonstration were John Von Neumann, John Mauchly dan Norbert Wiener, who wrote about it in his memoirs.[6][7][8]-->, 53932=Conversion from base-2 to base-10 proceeds by applying the preceding algorithm, so to speak, in reverse. The bits of the binary nombor are used one by one, starting with the most significant (leftmost) bit. Beginning with the value 0, repeatedly double the prior value dan add the next bit to produce the next value. This can be organized in a multi-column table. For example to convert 100101011012 to decimal:}", "lastModified": "Fri, 03 Jul 2015 17:17:56 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Jadual Penambahan[sunting | sunting sumber] Dalam contoh ini, two numerals are being added together: 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 02 (95810) dan 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 12 (69110). The top row shows the carry bits used. Instead of the standard carry from one column to the next, the lowest place-valued \"1\" with a \"1\" in the corresponding place value beneath it may be added dan a \"1\" may be carried to one digit past the end of the series. These numbers must be crossed off since they are already added. Then simply add that hasil to the uncanceled digits in the second row.

This notation eliminates the need for a separate \"subtract\" operation. Using two's complement notation subtraction can be summarized by the following formula: A \u2212 B = A + not B + 1 For further details, see two's complement. Pendaraban[sunting | sunting sumber] Pendaraban in binary is similar to its decimal counterpart. Two numbers A dan B can be multiplied by partial products: for each digit in B, the product of that digit in A is calculated dan written on a new line, shifted leftward so that its rightmost digit lines up with the digit in B that was used. The sum of all these partial products gives the final hasil. Since there are only two digits in binary, there are only two possible outcomes of each partial multiplication: Jika digit dalam B adalah 0, hasil separa juga adalah 0 Jika digit dalam B adalah 1, hasil separa sama dengan A Contohnya, nombor binari 1011 dan 1010 didarabkan seperti berikut:  1 0 1 1 (A)", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
