We excluded 168 normal weight individuals (40% males), therefore in this study 472 subjects (59% women; 41% men) were included. All individuals were Caucasian and underwent a collection of the medical history, by a standardized questionnaire administered to obtain information about current and past medication use, smoking habits and presence of cardiovascular disease. They underwent, also, a physical examination including the evaluation of the body mass index (BMI)(calculated as weight, in kg, divided by square of height, in meter); the measurement of the waist circumferences (WC)(a measuring tape was used for WC, measured right below the ribs); the measurement of the systemic blood pressure in both arms by a sphygmomanometer (systolic and diastolic blood pressure - SBP and DBP). The ankle-brachial systolic pressure index (Winsor Index) was determined by dividing the highest of the posterior tibial or dorsalis pedis systolic blood pressure by the highest brachial pressure.
