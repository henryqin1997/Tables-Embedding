There was an increase in body weight, cholesterol, triglycerides, ALT, AST and elevated glucose tolerance test glucose at 120 min in animals on a diet of high-fructose compared to animals on a normal diet. The groups treated with bezafibrate and FOS fraction showed differences in body weight, Lee index, cholesterol and triglycerides levels compared with isotonic saline solution-treated animals. They did not show differences in relation to animals on a normal diet. Glycaemia in fasted animals was not altered after the high-fructose diet in any of the experimental groups compared to animals with normal diet, and no reduction was observed in the area under the curve of glucose tolerance of animals treated with bezafibrate and FOS at 120 min.
