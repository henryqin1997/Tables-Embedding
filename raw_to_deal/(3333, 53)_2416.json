All can have associated adjectives in -cratic (bureaucratic, meritocratic), and nouns in -crat for a member of the relevant class or group (aristocrat, autocrat). A few can also have adjectives in -cratical (aristocratical, democratical), but these are much rarer than the corresponding forms in -cratic. The form is active, used to create words for influential groups with characteristics in common: punditocracy, media commentators; adhocracy, a loose group of influential advisers; meritocracy, government or the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their educational ability. Many terms in -cracy have been coined, though only a small number are at all well known; most can mean either a system of influence or rule or a society so ruled, as with democracy, rule through elected representatives; a few can also refer to the rulers as a group, as with aristocracy (Greek aristos, best), rule by members of the highest social class.
