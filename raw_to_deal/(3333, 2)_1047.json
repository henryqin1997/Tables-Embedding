The Counselor is that, a film that will bear fruit on repeat viewings and one that really is sort of a rarity. It\u2019s going to get hammered on its release and the flyover states are going to hate it. It\u2019ll age well, and on your point about it being the most vicious film, I\u2019m with you for the most part. Often a film falls in love with a character and there\u2019s that golden light shining on them. There\u2019s none of that here, which is quintessential McCarthy. If this were released in February it\u2019d be one people banded behind. As a fall prestige release it\u2019s truly a mutt with fleas.
