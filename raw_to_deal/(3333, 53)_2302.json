The referred resource MAY also support other resource management and access specifications (e.g. HTTP, WS-ResourceFramework). For any message defined by this specification, any OPTIONAL elements or attributes in the message MAY be used by senders of the message; however receivers of those messages MUST support those OPTIONAL elements and attributes, unless other behavior is explicitly defined by this specification.

The collection of units is represented by a Metadata element, and units within the collection are represented by MetadataSection elements. To facilitate processing, MetadataSections are tagged with a @Dialect and @Identifier of the metadata unit. To ensure scalability, a unit of metadata MAY be embedded within its MetadataSection or MAY be included by reference, either an endpoint reference [WS-Addressing] (MetadataReference) or a URL (MetadataLocation). The outline for the Metadata element is: <mex:Metadata ...> <mex:MetadataSection Dialect='xs:QName' Identifier='xs:anyURI' ...> ( <mex:MetadataReference ...> endpoint-reference-type </mex:MetadataReference> | <mex:MetadataLocation ...> xs:anyURI </mex:MetadataLocation> | DialectSpecificElement ) </mex:MetadataSection> * xs:any* </mex:Metadata>", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
