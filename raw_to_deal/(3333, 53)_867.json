Assignments with higher scores are of a better quality. Details for the methodology be found on the dcGO website. Information Content (IC) is an information theoretic score measured in bits of how informative it is to assign a given ontological term to a domain archtecture. The higher the score the more informative it is to talk about the term given the domain architecture.
