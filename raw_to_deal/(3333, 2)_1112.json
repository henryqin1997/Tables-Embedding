These are the images frequently associated with each of the canonical hours, whose precise moment of celebration varied with the seasons: The Hours of the Virgin itself consists of eight separate devotional texts, one to be recited at each of the eight canonical hours of the day. These texts are a vastly simplified version of the complicated round of prayers and verses recited eight times a day by those in holy orders, thereby allowing the lay users of a Book of Hours a share in the pious rituals observed in a monastery. From an early date, image sequences began to accompany the Hours of the Virgin. The set of devotional texts that gives its name to the Book of Hours is called the Hours of the Virgin. It generally appears about a third of the way into a Book of Hours, and it is almost always written in Latin, a language understood by few laymen in the late Middle Ages.
