Some beta2-agonists may be available in multiple forms. Your doctor will help you decide which form is best for you. There are two types of beta2-agonists: short-acting and long-acting. The short-acting type relieves symptoms and the long-acting type helps prevent breathing problems. Short-acting beta2-agonists are used for treating stable COPD in a person whose symptoms come and go (intermittent symptoms). Long-acting beta2-agonists are effective and convenient for preventing and treating COPD in a person whose symptoms do not go away (persistent symptoms). How It Works Beta2-agonists are bronchodilators. This means that they relax and enlarge (dilate) the airways in the lungs, making breathing easier. Why It Is Used Beta2-agonists are considered first-line therapy for the treatment of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with symptoms that come", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
