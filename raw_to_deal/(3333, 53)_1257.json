The only explanation I can think of for its number is that originally it did connect with US 120. But it's a north/south route, so an east/west number really wasn't appropriate (it's one of a surprisingly small group of 3dus routes whose numbers belie their direction). \"US x01\" or \"US x11\" would've been good choices, but I think \"US x15\" probably would've been the best. The north end of US 220 has always been in Waverly NY; you can view photos from there on this page. Originally the south end of US 220 was in Cumberland MD. It came into town on Bedford Street, ending at its junction with US 40, which at the time was Mechanic Street (with Centre Street as the westbound counterpart).
