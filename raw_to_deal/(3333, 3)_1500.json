Contacted dealer. See all problems of the 1996 Ford Ranger., 10773=The vehicles engine idles roughly which causes the vehicle to shake. I noticed this problem instantly after picking up the vehicle from the dealership. I had taken it in to dean sellers Ford in troy michigan with 500 miles on it and I was told that it was a new engine for the Ranger, and it was suppose to drive like that. However, after continuing to drive the vehicle and experiencing stall outs I believe there is something wrong with my engine. I started up other Rangers at other dealerships and yes, when first started the idling is rough but then kicks down to a normal running idle. I have had a service tech. Agree with me that the idling seems to be rough on my vehicle but nothing has been found to correct the issue. Nor has anything been found on the stall outs. I have also experienced \"jolting\" or \"surges\" of power while driving. Attempting to speed up 5 or 10 mph produces a jolt forward as though you have gunned the engine, at times it feels as though the vehicle is speeding up on it's own. I truly believe Ford is manufacturing faulty engines with this particular vehicle and I am completely 100% unsatisfied with my purchase of this vehicle. I have owned a 1995 Ranger and had never experienced a problem with that year line. Someone of authority needs to investigate this vehicle and consumers should be compensated for the many issues Ford has with Ranger engines. Your assistance and power is much appreciated., 23377=Tl-the contact owns a 2003 Ford Ranger. The contact stated that while driving 60 mph, the vehicle stalled and the contact was able to maneuver vehicle to side of road and it restarted. The warning indicator were illuminated. The vehicle was not taken to a dealer nor independent mechanic and there was no diagnostic test performed. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified about the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 244,000. Lb. See all problems of the 2003 Ford Ranger., 14107=Vehicle has stalled out while driving on three (3) occasions and was prevented from stalling on one other. First occurrence was on 06/14/02 with approximately 2800 miles, vehicle was traveling approx. 15-20 miles an hour and turning into a parking lot. Second failure was on 07/09/02 with approx. 3650 miles, vehicle again was making a turn at approx. 15 mph. This failure occurred the evening of picking up the vehicle from jerome duncan Ford for service. However, jerome duncan refused to itemize this problem on their repair list because the vehicle was currently running and did not stall out in their possession. Third failure occured 08/11/02 with approx. 5700 miles, vehicle was traveling at approx. 25-30 mph attempting to turn or curve to the left. Each time this \"stall out\" has occurred the engine has been warm and the gas tank had 1/4 or more of gas in it. I prevented the fourth occurrence from happening when stopped at a traffic light and giving the engine some gas while keeping one foot on the brake. I have taken this vehicle in for servicing for this problem 3 times, however, 2 of the times jerome duncan Ford has refused to document it, saying the vehicle is running and appears to be in working order. Only once has this vehicle been documented with a Ford dealer for issues, russ milne Ford 24777 hall rd. Macomb mi 48042 (810) 948-7700. The technicians there have not been able to determine the cause for the stall outs. I will once again take my vehicle in and have this problem documented to ensure my case under the michigan lemon law. Because the vehicle \"stalls out\" all power is lost, enabling me to steer properly and possibly endangering myself and others. On the second occurrence I narrowly missed a head on collision. I would like this matter investigated and would appreciate your assistance. Thank you., 19691=The contact owns a 2003 Ford Ranger. While driving vehicle stalled. The dealership had the vehicle 6 times, but could not find anything wrong with it. The contact stated the vehicle started jerking then it died, and after waiting approximately 1 hour the vehicle started back up. The dealership wanted to trade the vehicle with the contact. But the manufacturer wanted the dealership to find the cause of the problem before they would authorize the transaction. The consumer contacted the manufacturer., 21068=At 56,000 miles, this is the third time my truck has developed engine spontaneous racing even while in gear. This is a hazardous condition with potential injury/fatality. Occurred at 22 k mi, 45 k mi, and now at 56 k mi. When it occurs vehicle wants to race ahead and crash unless taken out of gear when the engines races and sometimes won't stop unless I intentionally stall or turn off the engine while in traffic. It is not an incident, it is ongoing. I have used the dealer repair shop exclusively. They replaced the throttle position connector at 22k mi. They referred to technical service bulletin 00-3-5. I, of course, would like this fixed permanently as it gradually recurs more and more often to the point of several times a day.
