Photo GQ magazine Mar 2012, 44967=September 10th, 2013 at 8:57 am, 81068=Now, which Nats may play for the 2013 teams? \u00a0First off, looking at the Nationals 40-man roster, we have become an amazingly heavy USA-born team (we\u2019ll get to non-40man roster players in a moment). Thanks to the Nats big board resource (originated by Brian Oliver and now maintained by \u201cSpringfieldFan\u201d), which has the country of origin for players, here\u2019s a breakdown of the home-country of our current 36 active (as of November 15th, 2012) roster players:, 31563=October 24th, 2014 at 8:57 am, 67120=1.\u00a0Felix Hernandez, Seattle Mariners. \u00a0Signed through 2019 for just absolutely ridiculous money (he\u2019ll make $27M in the year 2019). \u00a0Of course, he\u2019s just 27 now so he\u2019ll still have some career left by then. \u00a0Will he stay in Seattle? \u00a0A good bet. \u00a0Will he continue to look like a hall-of-famer? \u00a0Also a good bet, despite his velocity loss. \u00a0 But like any other guy who\u2019s only 27, its hard to project 10-15 years down the road, especially for pitchers., 24795=In June of 2013, in the midst of the Mariano Rivera retirement tour, I posted about one-team Hall of Famers and whether they were a dying breed in modern baseball.\u00a0 I figured that they were, that free agency had ruined the iconic \u201cone team\u201d home-town legend that we grew up knowing (especially in DC, with Cal Ripken Jr. just up the road)., 119282=December 9th, 2010 at 1:40 pm, 77255=Lets take a quick look at the Nationals representatives on WBC teams from the past, talk about whether its really in the best interests of the team to even let these guys play, and then\u00a0talk about who may be candidates for the 2013 WBC regardless., 5845=Here\u2019s the 2014 Fielding Bible Awards, which (if you\u2019re not aware) is a Bill James-driven website that uses a committee of national writers to select the winners (the site is here and you can read about their methodology).\u00a0 Bolded are also GG winners:, 29581=I used to think Zimmerman was on track, especially after his monster 2009 season.\u00a0 Now I think he\u2019s destined to be just a middle of the order solid hitter on teams with better hitters surrounding him.\u00a0 Think\u00a0Scott Rolen.\u00a0 Braun may be one of the best players in the NL, but getting caught with PEDs not once but twice will prevent him from ever being enshrined no matter what kind of career he puts together.\u00a0 The fall-off of the San Francisco duo of pitchers speaks for itself; what the heck happened to Lincecum?\u00a0 Similarly, Weaver now looks like a guy who peaked during his expected peak years and now is settling into being a slightly better-than-average pitcher.\u00a0 Fair?\u00a0 Maybe not, but his ERA+ for 2014 is 104; not exactly Kershaw-territory., 20479=November 11th, 2014 at 9:44 am, 72458=July 15th, 2013 at 10:45 am, 1346=Last year, I created a little spreadsheet upon the announcement of the Gold Glove winners, to see how they compared to various defensive metric leaders (2013 xls link here).\u00a0 And I threw in the \u201cFielding Bible\u201d award winners, since that has now taken over as the \u201caccepted\u201d list of the year\u2019s best defensive players, thanks to the Gold Gloves continuing to pick inexplicable players (this\u00a0 year\u2019s repeat \u201cI cannot believe he won\u201d player again being Adam Jones).\u00a0 But, as we\u2019ve seen, the Gold Gloves are getting better, and the days of picking someone like a statue-esque Derek Jeter and/or a nearly permanent DH in Rafael Palmeiro seem to now be over., 82945=Who from the Nationals franchise may make a 2013 WBC roster? \u00a0First off, thanks to James Wagner\u2018s 11/15/12 NatsJournal post we already know of three WBC participants; Solano\u00a0is on the Columbian team, minor leaguer Jimmy Van Ostrand is on the Canadian team, and A-ball catcher Adrian Nieto is on the Spanish team. \u00a0Curacao qualifies to play with the Netherlands, and I\u2019d guess that Bernadina would make a great choice considering the lack of Dutch players in baseball (Baseball Continuum\u2019s projections agree. \u00a0And as of 12/4/12 he\u2019s officially been listed as a Netherlands participant).. Venezuela is already qualified for the main draw and has a relatively strong possible team. \u00a0The Baseball Continuum blog posted an early projection of the Venezuelan team and listed Flores as a likely participant (specifically mentioning that Ramos wasn\u2019t considered due to injury recovery; I\u2019d suspect these two players to switch based on Ramos\u2019 recovery and Flores\u2019 awful 2012). \u00a0 If Henry Rodriguez was healthy i\u2019d guess he would be on that list too, but his season-ending surgery probably precludes his participation. \u00a0The Dominican Republic has perhaps the strongest depth and has no need for the recently called up Perez among its outfield depth. \u00a0Maya\u2019s defection eliminates him from discussion for the Cuban team. \u00a0(12/4/12 update): Chien-Ming Wang has been announced as a member of Chinese Taipei\u2019s team (for the purposes of this article I investigated all 2012 Nats)., 78323=The tournament was marred for the team by a blown UCL ligament to Ayala, who had undergone elbow surgery earlier in the off-season but pitched for his home country anyway. \u00a0The team did not want Ayala to participate in the inaugural event, did not want him used by the Mexican team, and team officials were \u201clivid\u201d by the injury, which cost Ayala the season and cost the team its 8th inning setup guy. \u00a0Ayala recovered to pitch again in 2008 but was never as effective, and was shipped out in 2009 for a PTBNL. \u00a0Coincidentally, I suspect the team still harbors some ill-will towards Ayala to this day. \u00a0Meanwhile the other two relievers who participated both experienced regressions in form; Cordero\u2019s ERA nearly doubled (from 1.82 to 3.19) from his breakout 2005 season while Majewski\u2019s numbers dipped slightly before he was traded in the big Cincinnati deal of 2006., 70333=6.\u00a0Joey Votto, Cincinnati Reds. \u00a0Here\u2019s a fun fact: Votto trails our own\u00a0Ryan Zimmerman in career war despite being a year older. \u00a0 He\u2019s signed with Cincinnati with options through 2024, at which point he\u2019ll be 41, so he\u2019s almost guaranteed to be a one-team guy. \u00a0Will he accumulate enough accomplishments to be a Hall of Famer? \u00a0So far so good. \u00a0He\u2019s one of the most feared hitters in the league and seems to be getting better., 2779=First, your 2014 Gold Glove winners: bold are also Fielding Bible winners, and red are the most egregiously bad selections., 43188=Q:\u00a0Do the Nationals tweak for 2014, or do they need to make big changes in the roster. What do you think of these predictions: LaRoche becomes an expensive bench player, Span and Gio traded., 56543=August 12th, 2013 at 7:17 am, 66271=4.\u00a0Jimmy Rollins, Philadelphia Phillies. \u00a0Rollins is the subject of a long, long running joke amongst my close friends. \u00a0One die-hard Philly fan made his argument that Rollins was a sure-fire Hall of Famer, and the rest of us mocked him for being such a homer. \u00a0 In reality, his Hall of Fame case likely ends up being really debatable. \u00a0 He has a smattering of career accomplishments but not nearly as many as (say\u00a0Barry Larkin, the most recent elected SS). \u00a0 Now, does Rollines remain in Philadelphia? \u00a0Probably; he\u2019s signed through 2015, at which point he\u2019ll be 37. \u00a0I can see Philadelphia keeping him on board with a 2 year deal at that point., 1189=Alex Gordon was one of the best defensive players in baseball, by any measure in 2014. photo 365rundown.com, 85968=(Note: I\u2019m still considering our Free Agents as \u201cNats players\u201d for the purposes of this analysis, since this really goes position by position from our 2012 team to find candidates)., 115284=The Red Sox\u2019s signing of Carl Crawford to a 7yr, $142M contract (a contract undoubtedly pushed skyward by the Nats Jayson Werth deal a few days earlier)\u00a0 makes for a rather imposing possible Red Sox Lineup in 2011.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a probable opening day lineup:, 79472=In 2009, the team had 5 participants:, 117251=Ellsbury is exactly what the Nats need; leadoff center fielder who shows more promise and more self control than our current leadoff/CF Nyjer Morgan.\u00a0 He lost most of 2010 to injury but in 2009 lead the league in stolen bases and would give us good defense in center per his uzr/150 rankings.\u00a0 He\u2019s cost contained (not yet arbitration eligible) and we\u2019d control him for at least 3 more years., 2348=So, now that we\u2019ve announced the 2014 Gold Glove winners, lets also look at the league leaders in various defensive metrics., 2584=This data is in the following spreadsheet for 2014 on Google Docs., 64352=1.\u00a0Todd Helton, Colorado Rockies. \u00a0 He turns 40 in August, has played his entire career with Colorado and is in the final year of a two-year deal. \u00a0His production has vastly tailed off the last two years and I can\u2019t see him playing again after this season. \u00a0But, we haven\u2019t heard any retirement news either, so I wonder if he\u2019s going to be one of these one-teamers that tries to play one season too long.\u00a0\u00a0Chances of Hall-of-Fame: \u00a033%. \u00a0 I think he\u2019s going to have the same issues that\u00a0Larry Walker is having; despite a career 134 OPS+ his home OPS is nearly 200 points higher than his road OPS, and I think writers will believe him to be an offensive juggernaut borne of Denver., 52710=Over in the American league, the playoff situation may be murky, but the MVP race is pretty straight-forward.\u00a0 There is a lot to shake out in terms of the playoff positions and the candidates from those teams don\u2019t seem to stand out as much.\u00a0 But as with 2012, there are two leading MVP candidates and we seem set to have the same arguments this year as last.\u00a0 But lets go team by team:, 68919=4.\u00a0Evan Longoria, Tampa Bay Rays. \u00a0 He\u2019s signed with options through 2023. \u00a0He\u2019s always on the short list of the best third basemen (offensively and defensively) in the majors. \u00a0 He\u2019s already had a series of all-time highlight moments in his career. \u00a0But from a cumulative accolades stand point, he\u2019s very much lacking. \u00a0While he won the 2008 Rookie of the Year award, the closest he\u2019s come to an MVP is 6th, and his 2013 All-Star snub means he\u2019s only appeared in the game 3 times. \u00a0I think he\u2019s going to need a run of healthy, strong seasons to really put his name in the HoF mix., 16544=Adam Jones scored a -8.1 FRAA; ranking him 1187th out of 1212 players for 2014.\u00a0 I\u2019m not kidding.\u00a0 That\u2019s how bad a selection for the Gold Glove Jones was., 112734=November 3rd, 2011 at 11:57 am, 62682=5.\u00a0Robinson Cano, New York Yankees. \u00a0He\u2019s about half way through his career, but his numbers and accolades keep piling up. \u00a0Pretty soon we\u2019re going to look up and he\u2019s going to have 400 homers and a career BA above .300 as a 2nd baseman with a slew of top 5 MVP finishes, and we\u2019ll be asking ourselves where Cano ranks in the pantheon of baseball 2nd basemen. \u00a0Here\u2019s the canonical list of 2nd basemen elected to the hall of fame in the last 50 years:\u00a0Roberto Alomar,\u00a0Ryne Sandberg, Rod Carew and\u00a0Joe Morgan. \u00a0Do you think Cano belongs there? \u00a0Now, will Cano stay a Yankee? \u00a0We\u2019ll soon find out: he\u2019s just played out his two option years and has not been extended. \u00a0Are the Yankees preparing to let him walk?, 79890=The WBC seemed to energize particularly Dunn, who enjoyed playing in a post-season atmosphere for the first (and only) time in his career. \u00a0Nobody suffered any injuries, but Hanrahan in particular may have been affected by his lack of a proper spring training; he posted a 7.71 ERA for the team while losing the closer spot and was shipped to Pittsburgh. \u00a0Ironically, Rivera also experienced a huge regression of form, going from a 3.96 ERA in 2008 to a 6.10 ERA in 2009 and was eventually released., 28755=These are all perennial all-stars, kings of the game, but none of them really screams out \u201cHall of Famer\u201d right now.\u00a0 I may be slightly down on these guys (especially Hamels, who might be more than borderline right now).\u00a0 I\u2019ve thrown Zimmermann in there thanks to his second stellar season in a row and his no-hitter; he\u2019s likely to have another top 5 Cy Young finish in 2014 and with a few more such seasons he may put himself into the conversation.\u00a0 Of course, the odds are that he departs the Nats after 2015, so he may be off the list anyway., 93727=November 21st, 2012 at 10:59 am, 62205=4.\u00a0Joe Mauer, Minnesota Twins. \u00a0Its hard to envision someone being more of a franchise player than Mauer; born in Minnesota, High School in Minnesota, 1st overall draft pick by the Minnesota Franchise. \u00a0Massive contract with full no-trade through 2018. \u00a0I think Mauer will be a Twin for life. \u00a0 Hall of Fame chances? \u00a0Looking pretty good; already has an MVP and has a career .323 BA for a catcher, pretty impressive., 65646=3.\u00a0David Wright, New York Mets. \u00a0He\u2019s in his 10th season with the Mets and is signed through 2020, so his chances of being a career one-teamer seem high. \u00a0Not 100% though; He\u2019ll be 37 at the end of this deal and may want a couple more seasons; will he be productive enough and stay healthy enough to earn another short-term deal that late in his career? \u00a0Is he trending towards the Hall of Fame? \u00a0Probably not; he\u2019s got plenty of All Star appearances, Gold Gloves and Silver Sluggers but relatively little MVP love. \u00a0In this respect he needs his team to be better., 72791=Tagged with albert pujols, alex rodriguez, chase utley, chipper jones, clayton kershaw, cole hamels, david wright, derek jeter, dustin pedroia, evan longoria, felix hernandez, jered weaver, jimmy rollins, joe mauer, joe morgan, joey votto, justin morneau, justin verlander, mariano rivera, matt cain, paul pierce, payton manning, roberto alomar, robinson cano, rod carew, ryan braun, ryan zimmerman, ryne sandberg, stephen strasburg, todd helton, troy tulowitzki, yasiel puig, 67641=2.\u00a0Dustin Pedroia, Boston Red Sox. \u00a0Pedroia doesn\u2019t seem like a guy who is mentioned in the same breath as hall-of-famers, especially when compared to\u00a0Cano above. \u00a0But here\u2019s what Pedroia has that Cano doesn\u2019t: A Rookie of the Year award AND an MVP award. \u00a0Pedroia has bounced back in 2013 from a couple of injury-plagued years and has put him self back in position to gain MVP votes if Boston makes the post-season. \u00a0Will he stay in Boston? \u00a0Seems like hit; he seems like a classic career Red Sox Captain-in-the-making., 80561=This begs the question; do we even WANT our pitchers playing on this team? \u00a0The first two WBCs have shown pretty distinctly that our pitchers have regressed greatly after playing. \u00a0This only makes sense: the spring training routines are greatly impacted to play in this event. \u00a0We may see a ton of front-office resistance to specific guys (especially those coming off injury) playing in the 2013 event. \u00a0Which could affect the eligibility of some specific players for 2013., 26093=I\u2019m not sure Helton will make the Hall; if Larry Walker can\u2019t get in because people think his numbers were inflated by Colorado\u2019s home park, then Helton will be in the same boat.\u00a0 His embarrassing, ridiculous DUI arrest in mid 2013 while driving to get lottery tickets (despite the fact that he has more than $160M in career earnings just in salary alone) certainly won\u2019t help his case.}", "textBeforeTable": "Last stat: Baseball Reference\u2019s Total Zone Fielding Adam Jones scored a -8.1 FRAA; ranking him 1187th out of 1212 players for 2014.\u00a0 I\u2019m not kidding.\u00a0 That\u2019s how bad a selection for the Gold Glove Jones was. Interestingly, Jean Segura shines highly here (the supposed \u201cbest defensive player in the league\u201d Andrelton Simmons only scored a 10.0 in FRAA).\u00a0\u00a0 And this stat really favors the play of some random players: I had no idea who Kevin Kiermaier or Ender Inciarte were before doing this post, nor did I know what position they played.

As mentioned above, both our GG finalists (LaRoche and Span) seem to have been nominated on reputation only; neither of them appeared near the top on any of these statistical measures (unlike last year, when Span at least was a leader in Total Zone) Did I miss any good defensive metrics?\u00a0 Do you have one you like more or less than these?\u00a0 I know there\u2019s other stats out there; I can update this analysis with more of them. So, how did the Gold Gloves do this year in selecting the most deserving winners?\u00a0 Pretty good.\u00a0 Alex Gordon was the AL leader for left fielders in every stat.\u00a0 I think they picked the two correct short stops.\u00a0 Catchers are difficult to measure.\u00a0 They absolutely screwed up the AL Center fielder (though to be fair; there were four statistical measures presented and four different AL center field leaders.\u00a0 Excellent defensive players who jump around (Lorenzo Cain, Ben Zobrist) make the awards somewhat challenging in some cases.
