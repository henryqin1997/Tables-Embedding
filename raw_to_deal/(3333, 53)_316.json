Protein determination has been carried out by a BCA protein assay. The enzyme loading of all immobilized lipase onto the PES membranes, a physical interaction between the lipase and the solid support was formed. On the other hand, lipase immobilization onto the PES\u2013NH2 membranes gave rise to both physical interactions and chemical bonding between the lipase and its solid support. Mucor miehei lipase).

Immobilization of <italic>Mucor miehei</italic> Lipase ]. 42 Based on the analysis of the SEM images, the membranes obtained form two layers (top layer and sub layer). The top layer has a smaller and denser pore-size than the sub layer, therefore indicating that the top layer plays an important role in membrane selectivity. Meanwhile, macro-voids that are present in the sub layer have a function as support and affect its mechanical strength of the membranes. Such membranes are known as asymmetric membrane, first developed by Loeb-Sourirajan [", "textAfterTable": "11. PESNH-10/D4/P5 850.89 \u00b1 0.57 12. PESNH-10/D8/P5 873.62 \u00b1 0.57 * Standard deviation values were calculated from three replicated experiments. Based on these results, the enzyme loading is affected by the type and concentration of additives, and the functional groups along the polymer chain. The enzyme loading represents the amount of Mucor miehei lipase that is physically adsorbed or chemically attached to the polymer. In principle, the higher membrane porosity will increase the surface area for enzyme attachment leading to an increase in attached lipases. In this case, addition of DBP will increase the enzyme loading because of its properties as plasticizer. Looking at its structure, DBP has ester moieties that could form physical interactions with the enzyme [ 43 ]. Therefore, the addition of DBP during the membrane preparation will increase the enzyme loading. On the other hand, the addition of PEG may increase the performance of immobilized enzymes. However, if the concentration of PEG is too high, homogeneity of the membrane porosity will increase, and the lipase will leach out from the solid support. Different functional groups on the polymer backbone would also give rise to a difference in enzyme loading. In this study, the presence of amine moieties increased the enzyme loading value.
