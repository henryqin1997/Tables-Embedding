PROPOSED REVISIONS TO HCM CHAPTER 9 PROCEDURES 4.1 Overview of Recommended Procedure for Determining fLpb and fpb This section summarizes the recommended procedure for calculating the value of an adjustment factor that describes the effect of pedestrians and bicycles on lane group saturation flow. For left turns, the adjustment is termed fLpb; for right turns, the adjustment is termed fRpb. The procedure consists of four basic parts that correspond to the four phases of the data reduction methodology described earlier. They are: Part 1: Determine average pedestrian occupancy, OCCpedg, during the entire pedestrian green; Part 2: Find relevant conflict zone occupancy, OCCr , by adjusting OCCpedgas needed for opposing traffic (left turns) or conflicting bicycles (right turns); Part 3: Compute permitted phase saturation flow adjustment just for turning vehicles due to pedestrian and bicycle interference, ApbT; and Part 4: Determine saturation flow adjustment factor for the lane group fLpb for left turns and fRpbt. for right turns. Table 2 contains two groups of parameters that comprise all of the input requirements needed to determine fLpb and fRpb. The first group lists several qualitative intersection parameters, while a second group contains quantitative parameters needed to complete the procedure. Within each group, the table lists the parameters in the order the procedure first needs them.
