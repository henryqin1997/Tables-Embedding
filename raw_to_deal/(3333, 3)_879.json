Or you can buy a different thickness cheek pad to adjust the fit as all the cheek pads are interchangeable. Changing cheek pads to change the helmet fit: To get MORE room in your helmet, you need to buy a THINNER cheek pad. To get a TIGHTER fit, you need to buy a THICKER cheek pad. Example: If you have a size Large CL-Jet helmet, you have cheek pads that are 30mm thick. If the helmet is a little loose around your cheeks, a 35mm pad would give you a tighter fit.
