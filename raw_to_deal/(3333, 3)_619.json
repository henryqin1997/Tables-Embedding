As described above, the final goal was to construct fusion proteins with the ability to reassemble into two-dimensional arrays while presenting the introduced functional sequence or domain on the outermost surface of the protein lattice for binding molecules (see Table 1). It must be noted that the C-terminally truncated form rSbpA31\u20131068, which is 1038 amino acids long, is most often used as a basic molecular building block for making various S-layer fusion proteins., 128684=Part of this work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) project FA9550-12-1-0274 (to DP) and FA-9550-10-1-0223 (to UBS), and CTQ2007-66541 National Plan-Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology (to JLTH).
