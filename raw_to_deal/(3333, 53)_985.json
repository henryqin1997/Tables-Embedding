This change in production philosophy can be described as a move from a top-down management approach towards a participative management approach (Rauner, Rasmussen & Corbett, 1988; Deitmer & Attwell, 2000) which requires a commitment to innovation at all level of the workforce, not just at the management level. Information and communication technologies \u2013 including both technologies for learning and for knowledge management \u2013 are required to allow more decentralised control to support just-in-time and flexible production and services. A key to flexibility and high productivity lies in the qualification profiles of the workforce and in the development of worker-oriented production technologies, which allow more flexible control in the production process. Leaner business organisations have less hierarchical layers and develop \u2018close to production intelligence\u2019 in order to be more flexible to change and to customer demands. The qualifications required of workers within such production or service environment are broader than in traditional workplaces reflecting a shift from functional skills towards multiskilling. Skilled workers require practical and theoretical knowledge in order to act competently in the planning, preparation, production and control of work and to coordinate with other departments in or outside the company. Many industries are undergoing a period of rapid change with the introduction of new technologies, new production concepts, work processes and materials. This is resulting in new quality requirements for products and processes which", "textAfterTable": "Table 1 Innovation management and the skilling of workers (Deitmer 2011) 3.

Organisational learning around new patterns of activities is based on capturing the learning and work experiences of individual workers and teams of workers Flat management hierarchies provide more responsibility for individual workers and work teams in problem solving and in organising work processes High Performance Work Systems require a commitment", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
