At passage 15, BG01V cells were cryopreserved in the same medium and placed in liquid nitrogen storage. Photos show attachment and growth of BG01V when cryopreserved cells were recovered in feeder-free KnockOut\u2122 SR XenoFree Medium, from day 1 (A) through day 3 (B) post thaw. Figure 3. Morphology of hESCs in a feeder-free culture. Immunostaining of iPSCs\u00a0 for the expression of pluripotent marker OCT4 cultured on KSR medium with KnockOut\u2122 SR GF Cocktail. Green color indicates Oct4 expression;\u00a0 blue color represents DAPI nuclear staining of the same field. Figure 2. Pluripotent marker expression of iPSCs. (A) iPSCs were grown in KSR complete medium with KnockOut\u2122 SR Growth Factor Cocktail on Geltrex\u2122-coated dishes; cells exhibited morphology similar to hESCs, characterized by large nuclei and scant cytoplasm. (B) iPSCs were grown in KSR XF complete medium with KnockOut\u2122 SR Growth Factor Cocktail on Geltrex\u2122-coated dishes; cells exhibited morphology similar to hESCs, characterized by large nuclei and scant cytoplasm.
