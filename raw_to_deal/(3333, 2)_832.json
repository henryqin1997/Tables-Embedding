Sump return is handled by a Supreme Mag12 pump which feeds a \u00be inch Sea-Swirl (Aquarium Currents Inc.) Rotating Return Device and the skimmer (Precision Marine Bullet 2) is fed by a Supreme Mag18. Additional water movement is provided by four Aquarium Systems Maxi-Jet 1200 power heads attached to a Red-Sea Fish Pharm Ltd. Wavemaster Pro wave maker, and a GenX Mak4 water pump which is part of a closed loop system. A 300 watt (w) Otto Computherm heater keeps the tank at 82\u00baF (~28\u00b0C)., 3516=Lighting consists of two 400w 6500k Iwasaki halides powered by a PFO dual ballast, and two 110w VHO (very high output) actinics powered by an Icecap 660 ballast.

This way if a circuit breaker should trip, there will be at least some light and water movement available to the tank. The following chart shows the readings taken as indicated. With so much electrical equipment on the tank, most people use power strips and I'm no exception. At this point we can measure the power draw (amperage) of each individual piece or the entire power strip worth of equipment. Once the patch-cord is placed between the power strip (or equipment plug) and the wall outlet, simply place the ampmeter around either the white or black lead of the patch-cord. Many digital ampmeters will display to the second or even third decimal place. For our purposes we can round off to the nearest tenth of an amp. I recommend measuring the lighting system separately from the rest of the tank so we can take photoperiod into account, thus giving a more accurate view of total costs involved. Electric company rates in my area (New York) are determined in two ways. Either a regular rate of $0.1237/kilowatt hour (kwh) (24 hours per day every day), or a day/night rate which runs $0.1391/kwh (Day-time Period 7 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. EST or 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. EDT) and $0.0571/kwh (Night-time Period 11:30 p.m. to 7 a.m. EST or 12:30", "textAfterTable": "In order to convert amperage (a) to wattage (w) and ultimately kilowatts (kw), multiply amps and volts (v). As an average of line voltage (110-120v) we will use 115v for our purposes. This gives the following equations: All Lights 9.8a x 115v = 1127w or 1.1kw Other Equipment 4.7a x 115v = 540.5w or 0.5kw Cost can be determined using these figures. For 10 hours a day total equipment draw is 1.6kw per hour. For the remaining 14 hours (all equipment without lights) the draw is 0.5kw per hour. Now we simply multiply kw by run time hours for kilowatt hours, then multiply by the previously mentioned regular rates. 1.6kw x 10 hrs = 16kwh x $0.1237 = $1.98/day 0.5kw x 14 hrs = 7kwh x $0.1237 = $0.87/day Sub Total: $2.85/day $2.85 x 30days = $85.50/month Total Cost If light timers run 10am to 8pm EST, we can determine if the day/night rates will provide any savings. 1.6kw x 10 hrs = 16kwh x $0.1391 = $2.23/day (lights on, day rate) 0.5kw x 6.5 hrs = 3.3kwh x $0.1391 = $0.46/day (lights off, day rate) 0.5kw x 7.5 hrs = 3.8kwh x $0.0571 = $0.22/day (lights off, night rate) Sub Total: $2.91/day $2.91 x 30days = $87.30/month Total Cost Based on current timer settings, no savings is realized by taking advantage of the day/night rates offered by the electric company. However, substantial savings would be evident should the lights be run during the discounted nighttime period. Hopefully this", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
