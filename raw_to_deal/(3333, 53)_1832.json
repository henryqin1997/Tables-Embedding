Van de Vegte [1], who first studied in situ dynamic balance regulators for motors in 1964, proposed that a balance block, whose radial position relative to the centre of rotation was under continuous adjustment by a worm gear mechanism, could be used to achieve in situ rotor balancing. In 1978, Van de Vegte modified the dynamic balance regulator to use a mass block driven by a motor to change the angular displacement relative to the attached rotating spindle. The electrical power for the driving motor was supplied by external brush contacts [2,3]. Bishop [4] presented a similar design in 1982. Lee et al. [5] used a wireless remote-control technique to control a dynamic balance regulator in 1987. However, there were other problems with the balancing motor in addition to the difficulty in power transmission. For example, due to the significant size and inertia of the balancing motor, the dynamic balance system, which rotated with the spindle, could limit the maximum rotating speed and cause imbalance. To solve these problems, in 1998, Zeng et al. [6,7] presented a new electromagnetic dynamic balance regulator with a small axial dimension and no moving parts in the dynamic balance system. The approach of rotating a balance mass relative to the spindle was similar to the principle of a stepping motor. Up to this day, two basic types of dynamic balance devices have been used/applied in industrial fields. One type is similar to the electromagnetic dynamic balance devices described; such devices are produced by Dittel in Germany and Lord in the United States. The other typeis the sprayed-fluids dynamic balance device used primarily in grinding machines. This type of device was developed by a German company, Hofmann, in the 1960s and is still produced by some companies.}", "lastModified": "Thu, 14 May 2015 13:21:35 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Structural dimensions of the FEM model.
