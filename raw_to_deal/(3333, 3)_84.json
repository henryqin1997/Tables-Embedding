That's why the Obama administration has proposed instituting disability hiring goals for federal contractors, much like St. Paul did in 2006. The Associated General Contractors of America opposes the proposed rule. It argues expanding affirmative action to include people with disabilities will be costly for the construction industry -- a sector of the economy that is already suffering. \"The industry went from a trillion-dollar industry five years ago to $800 billion-a-year that lost over 2 million jobs in five years,\" spokesman Brian Turmail said. \"No one's discriminating against these folks.
