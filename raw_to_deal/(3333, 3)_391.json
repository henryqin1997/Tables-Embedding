Such converted systems have produced linewidths of ~20\u00a0nm since at least 1990, while current dedicated systems have produced linewidths on the order of 10\u00a0nm or smaller.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{8963=With today's electron optics, electron beam widths can routinely go down to a few nm. This is limited mainly by aberrations and space charge. However, the feature resolution limit is determined not by the beam size but by forward scattering (or effective beam broadening) in the resist while the pitch resolution limit is determined by secondary electron travel in the resist.[13][14] This point is driven home by the 2007 demonstration of double patterning using electron beam lithography in the fabrication of 15\u00a0nm half-pitch zone plates.[15] Although a 15\u00a0nm feature was resolved, a 30\u00a0nm pitch was still difficult to do, due to secondary electrons scattering from the adjacent feature. The use of double patterning allowed the spacing between features to be wide enough for the secondary electron scattering to be significantly reduced. The forward scattering can be decreased by using higher energy electrons or thinner resist, but the generation of secondary electrons is inevitable. It is now recognized that for insulating materials like PMMA, low energy electrons can travel quite a far distance (several nm is possible). This is due to the fact that below the ionization potential the only energy loss mechanism is mainly through phonons and polarons, although the latter is basically an ionic lattice effect.[16] Polaron hopping could extend as far as 20\u00a0nm.[17] The travel distance of secondary electrons is not a fundamentally derived physical value, but a statistical parameter often determined from many experiments or Monte Carlo simulations down to < 1\u00a0eV. This is necessary since the energy distribution of secondary electrons peaks well below 10\u00a0eV.[18] Hence, the resolution limit is not usually cited as a well-fixed number as with an optical diffraction-limited system.[13] Repeatability and control at the practical resolution limit often require considerations not related to image formation, e.g., resist development and intermolecular forces., 12364=A study by the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) presented at the 2013 EUVL Workshop indicated that, as a measure of electron blur, 50-100 eV electrons easily penetrated beyond 10\u00a0nm of resist thickness (PMMA or commercial resist); furthermore dielectric breakdown discharge is possible.[19]}", "lastModified": "Sat, 25 Jul 2015 10:24:18 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "As features sizes shrink, the number of incident electrons at fixed dose also shrinks. As soon as the number reaches ~10000, shot noise effects become predominant, leading to substantial natural dose variation within a large feature population. With each successive process node, as the feature area is halved, the minimum dose must double to maintain the same noise level. Consequently, the tool throughput would be halved with each successive process node. Shot noise[edit] Currently an optical maskless lithography tool[3] is much faster than an electron beam tool used at the same resolution for photomask patterning. E-beam lithography is not suitable for high-volume manufacturing because of its limited throughput. The smaller field of electron beam writing makes for very slow pattern generation compared with photolithography (the current standard) because more exposure fields must be scanned to form the final pattern area (\u2264mm2 for electron beam vs. \u226540\u00a0mm2 for an optical mask projection scanner). The stage moves in between field scans. The electron beam field is small enough that a rastering or serpentine stage motion is needed to pattern a 26\u00a0mm X 33\u00a0mm area for example, whereas in a photolithography scanner only a one-dimensional motion of a 26\u00a0mm X 2\u00a0mm slit field would be required. For example, assuming an exposure area of 1\u00a0cm2, a dose of 10\u22123 coulombs/cm2, and a beam current of 10\u22129 amperes, the resulting minimum write time would be 106", "textAfterTable": "Note: 1 ppm of population is about 5 standard deviations away from the mean dose. Ref.: SPIE Proc. 8683-36 (2013) Shot noise is a significant consideration even for mask fabrication. For example, a commercial mask e-beam resist like FEP-171 would use doses less than 10 \u03bcC/cm2,[4][5] whereas this leads to noticeable shot noise for a target CD even on the order of ~200\u00a0nm on the mask.[6][7] Defects in electron-beam lithography[edit] Despite the high resolution of electron-beam lithography, the generation of defects during electron-beam lithography is often not considered by users. Defects may be classified into two categories: data-related defects, and physical defects. Data-related defects may be classified further into two sub-categories. Blanking or deflection errors occur when the electron beam is not deflected properly when it is supposed to, while shaping errors occur in variable-shaped beam systems when the wrong shape is projected onto the sample. These errors can originate either from the electron optical control hardware or the input data that was taped out. As might be expected, larger data files are more susceptible to data-related defects. Physical defects are more varied, and can include sample charging (either negative or positive), backscattering calculation errors, dose errors, fogging (long-range reflection of backscattered electrons), outgassing, contamination, beam drift and particles.
