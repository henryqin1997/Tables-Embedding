The tradition of bride price reinforced the status of women as the property first of their fathers, and then their husbands. Even the right to education, enshrined in national law, meant little to rural women., 3093=Campaigns launched by women's rights activists in the 1980s to reform the Civil Code came to nothing in the face of indifference from the political establishment. It was not until the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing that Turkey committed to withdrawing its reservations to CEDAW. It did so in September 1999, but without having amended its Civil Code. From this point on, the EU became an additional influence on the process, with the regular pre-accession progress reports noting the need to bring the Civil Code in line with CEDAW's requirements., 20401=On 27 April 2007, the Turkish military fired a warning shot across the bows of Turkish democracy in the form of a late-night posting on its website. The general staff declared its opposition to the nomination of current foreign minister Abdullah Gul as presidential candidate. It reminded the Turkish government of the military's role as \"staunch defender of secularism.\" It warned that it would display its \"position and attitudes when it becomes necessary\"., 3541=In political terms, CEDAW accomplished a radical shift of perspective. The yardstick for measuring Turkey's law was no longer the Ottoman past or the Sharia, but contemporary international standards. By highlighting the shortcomings of the 1926 Civil Code, Turkey's reservations to CEDAW set a clear reform agenda for the Turkish women's movement \u2013 although it would take another 17 years for their efforts to bear fruit., 13371=This threat appeared acute following election victories by the Islamist Welfare Party in the 1990s. When current prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was elected mayor of Istanbul in 1994 as representative of the Welfare Party, it prompted an immediate backlash from Kemalist circles. Rumours began to circulate that Welfare Party activists were harassing people in public. The daily newspaper Cumhuriyet wrote that \"gangs in favour of Islamic order have been continuing their attacks against young girls and women.\" Yael Navaro-Yashin wrote about Istanbul in 1994:, 6799=Research of this kind began to expose the reality that the reforms of the 1920s had barely penetrated Turkish society beyond a small, urban elite. In 1975, more than half of Turkish women were illiterate. Most were married before the age of 17. Although women served as unpaid labour in the agricultural sector, they made up less than 10 percent of the urban labour force., 15257=The young Turkish Republic took great pride in promoting a select group of pioneer women through the education system and into public life. The first female doctor (1926), lawyer (1927), judge (1930) and pilot (1932) were held up as symbols of a progressive secularism. Kemalism came to serve as feminism for these proud \"daughters of the Republic\", even if its benefits never extended beyond a narrow, urban elite. The state made much of granting women the right to vote in 1934, although Turkey was not a democracy at the time. Independent women's organisations were disbanded 'voluntarily', on the basis that they were no longer needed. Their place was taken by Kemalist women's organisations that, according to Sirin Tekeli, one of Turkey's leading feminists, were, 26535=In 1911, an Ottoman feminist, Fatma Nesibe, gave a series of lectures to an audience of 300 women from Istanbul's social elite. Quoting John Stuart Mill's The Subjection of Women, she talked about the new concept of women's rights and their advocates emerging in Western countries. Describing Ottoman women as oppressed, she noted that \"law, tradition, pleasure, indulgence, property, power, appreciation, arbitration\u2026 are all favourable to men.\" She boldly predicted that the Ottoman Empire, like the rest of Europe, was on the eve of a \"feminine revolution\"., 19391=The generals' ultimatum was followed by a series of demonstrations, with one of the largest on 29 April on Istanbul's Caglayan Square to \"protect secularism\". The speakers at Caglayan, and the members of the organising committee, were almost all women. Nur Serter, vice-president of the Ataturk Thought Association, a nationalist NGO, offered her encouragement to the generals, telling the crowd \"we line up in front of the glorious Turkish army.\" Necla Arat, founder of Turkey's first women's research centre at Istanbul University, announced: \"we are here to defend Turkey's secular structure, to stop those who want to change it step by step.\" Turkan Saylan, president of the Association in Support of Contemporary Living, warned that the AKP government \"is now working on the transformation of Cankaya [the presidential palace] into the palace of a religious order.\" The headline in the Turkish daily Radikal was \"Women Power\". Nilufer Gole wondered whether 2007 would be remembered as the year of the \"feminine coup\", marked by an alliance between \"secular women and generals\"., 23867=The legal situation reflected social reality: at a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Istanbul in November 2006, a table measuring the \"gender gap\" (inequality between men and women) put Turkey 105th of 115 countries, behind Tunisia, Ethiopia and Algeria. Today, Turkey continues to lag behind every other European country in almost every measure of gender equality. It has the lowest number of women in parliament, the lowest share of women in the workforce and the highest rates of female illiteracy. The perception that, in this highly sensitive area, Turkey is out of step with other European societies has become central to European debates on Turkey's EU accession. In both France and Germany, opponents of Turkish accession have made this a key plank of their campaign. The issue also plays to anxiety within European countries about the integration of their own Muslim communities., 30294=Fatma Nesibe, feminist lecturer, in Istanbul 1911, 16211=This view became enshrined in Turkish history books, under the guidance of the Society for the Study of Turkish History, established by Ataturk himself. Afet Inan, Ataturk's adopted daughter, wrote The Emancipation of the Turkish Woman. It traced Turkish history back to 5000 BC, making the conversion to Islam in the 8th century appear relatively recent. According to Inan, the Kemalist revolution restored Turkey's true national traditions, liberating women from the constraints of Islamic norms and values. As Nermin Abadan-Unat, for many years head of the Turkish Social Science Association, pointed out, \"almost all major progressive measures benefiting Turkish women were granted rather than fought for\" and had been granted by \"a small male revolutionary elite\". It took many more years for a new generation of Turkish women historians to challenge this view of early Republican history., 27455=Turkey has a long road ahead of it in narrowing its gender gap. In a recent international study, Turkey ranked an embarrassing 105th of 115 countries \u2013 far behind the worst-ranking EU member. Improving gender equality will involve tackling a series of deeply entrenched problems, from improving access to education in rural regions to removing the institutional and social barriers to women's participation in the workforce. Elections in July this year will test the commitment of Turkey's political parties to increasing the number of women in parliament., 2515=Women's organisations continued to advocate on the issue through the 1990s, using increasingly sophisticated campaigning techniques. A special mailing list (Kadin Kurultayi) for activists was set up, and 126 women's NGOs from all over Turkey joined forces for a national campaign. Women's groups lobbied intensively in parliament. Finally Turkey's new Civil Code was adopted on 22 November 2001., 7266=\"Eastern regions remain in a state of underdevelopment\u2026 Village girls in general have almost no access to either technical training or education of any substantial significance. Although elementary education is compulsory for both sexes, availability of education in the region is a relatively new phenomenon. In Yoncali and Senyurt, schools were opened for the first time in 1958 and 1962 respectively.\", 25919=It was an optimistic call from the heart of an Empire on the verge of collapse. What one US writer has called \"the longest revolution\" \u2013 the legal and social emancipation of women \u2013 at that time had hardly begun anywhere in the world. At the beginning of the 20th century, most societies were patriarchal. Women lived under the legal and moral authority of their father until marriage, when the husband took his place. The German civil code in force in 1900 stipulated that \"to the husband belong the decisions in all affairs of the married life in common.\" In France, the Napoleonic tradition had bequeathed a civil code requiring a wife's 'obedience' to her husband. Even in Sweden, forerunner of the global movement for gender equality, the first Marriage Act embodying an explicitly egalitarian conception of marriage came into force only in 1915. The Ottoman family laws at the time were based on traditional Islamic law (Sharia)., 789=There are two demographic trends that have had a profound impact on the lives of Turkish women: urbanisation and declining population growth. In 1945, only a quarter of Turks lived in cities; by 2000, the proportion was 65 percent. More Turkish women found themselves living in cities, with greater access to education and other modernising influences. Female literacy leapt from 13 percent in 1945 to 81 percent in 2000. Moreover, with fewer children to look after as the number of children born per mother decreased, they began to take an increasing interest in the world outside their homes., 11925=In early 1998, the Welfare Party was shut down and its leaders temporarily exiled from politics, following a decision by the Constitutional Court and pressure from the military-controlled National Security Council. The headscarf ban at universities was tightened. In 1999 Merve Kavakci, who had studied computer engineering in the US, was elected to parliament on the ticket of the Virtue Party, the Islamist successor to the Welfare Party. When she attended parliament with her head covered, the outcry was tremendous: \"terrorist\", \"agent\", \"provocateur\", \"liar\" and \"bad mother\" were some of the accusations against her. As one commentator in Cumhuriyet wrote:, 21498=These reforms also reflect profound changes in Turkish democracy. The 2004 reforms to the Penal Code were passed by a parliament in which the conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) held an overwhelming majority, following an effective and professional campaign by women's organisations. To the surprise of many of the activists themselves, the AKP parliamentarians proved willing to engage with civil society and debate the issues on their merits. Turkish women's organisations have emerged as influential political players., 22389=If this report had been written in 1999, the year Turkey gained the status of candidate for EU membership, its conclusions would have been deeply pessimistic. Writing in 2007, however, the perspective shifts dramatically. Recent amendments (2004) to the Turkish Constitution assert that \"women and men have equal rights\" and \"the state is responsible for taking all necessary measures to realize equality between women and men\" (Article 10). A new civil code (2001), reforms to the employment law (2003), the establishment of family courts (2003) and a completely reformed penal code (2004) have brought about comprehensive changes to the legal status of women. These are the most radical reforms since the abolition of polygamy in the 1920s. As a result, for the first time in its history Turkey has the legal framework of a post-patriarchal society., 17985=In the official discourse of the Turkish state, the emancipation of women was accomplished single-handedly by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk between 1924 and 1934, liberating Turkey at a stroke from the influence of Islamic law. Ataturk's reforms granted Turkish women full equality with men well in advance of other European nations, without the need for a protracted struggle. For later generations of Kemalist women, raised on these precepts as articles of faith, the imperative has been to defend this legacy against the dangers of a resurgent Islam by any means necessary \u2013 even at the expense of Turkish democracy., 40573=\"The European Stability Initiative prepared a report on Turkey entitled 'Sex and Power: Feminism, Islam and the Maturing of Turkish Democracy.' The argument is that from 2001 onwards legislative changes, initiatives to combat domestic violence and efforts to increase the schooling of girls triggered a 'female revolution.' We did not miss the opportunity to discuss this claim on 8 March Women's Day\"., 9463=The official story of women's liberation in Turkey \u2013 that equality was granted at a stroke of the pen by Ataturk, \"for which Turkish women should remain eternally grateful\" \u2013 proved remarkably tenacious, obscuring a reality that was in fact very different. A prominent Turkish scholar, Meltem Muftuler-Bac, noted in 1999 that, 5998=It was only in the 1980s that Turkish feminists began to ask more radical questions. Sirin Tekeli, an academic who had resigned in protest against the purges and political controls imposed on Turkish universities after the 1980 coup, became the voice of a new wave of liberal feminists who, as she put it, had \"finally decided to look at their own condition more closely.\" Tekeli's writing drew attention to the paradox between the stereotypes of women's liberation in Turkey, and the reality of women's absence from the political arena. No woman served as government minister until 1987, or as governor of a province until 1991. Tekeli and her colleagues found that the problem was not just with the backwardness of rural society, but with the law itself. Legal emancipation proved to be very limited \u2013 a reality that had long been hidden by official ideology., 19902=In Turkey, such threats are taken seriously. The 1960 coup ended with the execution of the country's first elected prime minister, together with his foreign and finance ministers. The 1970 coup \"marked the beginning of the mass imprisonment of the rebellious young.\" The 1980 coup saw 180,000 people detained, 42,000 convicted and 25 hanged. Most recently, the so-called 'soft coup' of 1997 saw political parties banned and elected politicians sent to prison on trumped-up charges., 4242=It was the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which entered into force in 1979 and was ratified by Turkey in 1985, that most clearly brought the deficiencies in Turkish law into public view. The Convention requires signatory states to reflect the equality of the sexes throughout their legislation, and to prohibit all forms of discrimination. Discovering that much of its Civil Code was in violation of these principles, Turkey was compelled to issue embarrassing reservations to the provisions of the Convention. It was unable to grant men and women equal rights and responsibilities in marriage, divorce, property ownership and employment., 17347=This \"nationalist feminism\" was consciously constructed during the early decades of the Republic. One of its central myths is the existence of a golden age of gender equality in pre-Islamic Turkish Central Asia. The intellectual Ziya Gokalp (1876-1924), a key figure in early Turkish nationalism, wrote:, 14076=For some Turkish Kemalists, the rise of political Islam has continued to be the most potent threat facing Turkish women. In the late 1980s, organisations like the Association in Support of Contemporary Living (CYDD), which was instrumental in the 2007 demonstrations, were created to defend the achievements of Kemalism against the new prominence of religion in public life. According to Turkan Saylan, president of CYDD, the Islamist threat had never disappeared: after the madrasa (Islamic schools) were closed, Islamists had simply gone underground. When multiparty democracy was introduced after the Second World War, they resurfaced and began openly attacking the system., 38578=\u00a0Radikal, 8 March 2008, 29712=The second major reform era has been the period since 2001. Reforms to the Turkish Civil Code have granted women and men equal rights in marriage, divorce and property ownership. A new Penal Code treats female sexuality for the first time as a matter of individual rights, rather than family honour. Amendments to the Turkish Constitution oblige the Turkish state to take all necessary measures to promote gender equality. Family courts have been established, employment laws amended and there are new programmes to tackle domestic violence and improve access to education for girls. These are the most radical changes to the legal status of Turkish women in 80 years. As a result, for the first time in its history, Turkey has the legal framework of a post-patriarchal society.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{85884=The AKP has 800,000 members in its women's section, and provides training to many of its female members. Yet according to one female deputy, Fatma Sahin (AKP), the local party structure is heavily male dominated. \"When it comes to primary elections, the men gang up against the women. After the primary elections, women no longer have the confidence to continue. Women can't rise within the existing structure.\" The AKP began with an informal 20 percent quota for women in its party structure, and increased this to 30 percent in 2006 on the orders of prime minister Erdogan. At least in Istanbul province this goal is reached with 35.7 percent women in the executive board and 27 percent in the administrative board. In much of Anatolia, however, the party falls far short \u2013 ostensibly because of the difficult of finding qualified candidates., 51351=There are few applications from women in rural areas, according to local prosecutors, because transport and communications are so poor. Prosecutors are often reluctant to use their power to intervene, fearing that they may trigger an escalation of violence. The informal power of tribes remains strong. There are also doubts as to whether the Family Protection law applies to the couples (estimates go up to 20 percent) married only through religious ceremonies (imam nikahi), which are not recognised by the courts. WWHR found that in 1996 11 percent of women lived in polygamous relationships \u2013 officially banned since 1926. For many of these women, even the best law is simply out of their reach., 85461=It is in the area of female participation in politics that rapid progress seems most achievable in the short term. In the 2002 general elections, only 4.4 percent of the 550 parliamentary seats went to women, producing 24 MPs (13 AKP; 11 CHP). This places Turkey 114th of 119 countries, and by far the lowest in Europe. Turkey is also last in Europe in terms of women as government ministers., 39451=In the course of this research, ESI came across police statistics for 2005 listing the number of cases of \"men depriving a woman of her virginity on the false pretext of promising to marry\", a crime that no longer exists. In South East Anatolia, ESI found that judges can still take months to rule on requests for urgent assistance from women under threat of family violence. Across the country, there are still a number of judges and prosecutors unaware of the content of the new laws., 76537=In Turkey, balancing work and motherhood remains very difficult \u2013 as evidenced by the fact that 63 percent of women who work do not have a child under six years of age. Childcare facilities are extremely limited, or absent altogether. In theory, each private kindergarten is obliged to give free attendance to a minimum of two poor children designated by Social Services and Child Protection Institution (SHCEK), or 5 percent of its school population if the establishment is larger. In practice, however, only a total of 448 children in need are currently enrolled in private kindergarten under this rule in the entire country. Where private childcare services are available, their cost is prohibitive for most families. Care for the elderly is equally difficult to obtain. As of August 2006, the total capacity in care facilities for the elderly across the country was only 18,849 places., 45180=Songul's dramatic story is not an isolated incident. Across Turkey, police figures for honour killings number 1,091 in total between 2000 and 2005. This reflects only the killings that take place in urban settings, under the jurisdiction of the police. A parliamentary report on honor killings admits in 2005 that \"comprehensive and systematic research about violence against women has not been carried out\" so far., 57310=Bespinar's own life is a reflection of improvements in the position of women in Istanbul in the past generation. The eldest daughter of an old Istanbul family she went to study economics in Ankara, encouraged by her father. Kicked out of university for participating in protests she returned to Istanbul. In 1973 and 1975 she gave birth to her two daughters. At first her mother-in-law looked after them, but when she died in 1976 Bespinar had to stay at home. She was offered a job in 1977, which she could not take up. The first municipal pre-school only opened up in 1989., 87539=As EU Parliamentarian Emine Bozkurt noted at the end of May 2007:, 14842=The year 2001 saw the Virtue Party (successor to the Islamist Welfare Party) split apart, to create two new parties. One of them, the Felicity Party, continued to present a strongly traditional view of women. In the view of the Felicity Party, stated clearly in its official party programme, the biggest threat to Turkish society comes from abroad., 34798=After nine months of work, the draft was almost entirely rewritten, beginning with a new Article\u00a01 which stated that the purpose of the law was to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals. The draft was returned to the Justice Committee on 30 June 2004, which deliberated on the text until 14 July and then presented it largely unchanged to parliament, where it was finally passed on 26 September 2004., 75437=As it happens, Turkey has had rapid economic growth since 2001, averaging more than 7 percent per annum (6 percent in 2006). Foreign direct investment (FDI) reached a record \u20ac15.4 billion (US$19.2 billion) in 2006. This is unprecedented, and more in one year than the total between 1980 and 2000. In the first three months of 2007 alone, FDI reached \u20ac6.4 billion. It is therefore possible that, if the Turkish economy retains its dynamism, labour demand will begin to draw more women into the workforce., 37638=The image of the new Penal Code was tarnished by a last minute attempt by prime minister Erdogan to introduce amendments criminalising adultery. This was presented in some foreign media as a return to the principles of Islamic family law: in fact, it would have been a return to the legal situation that existed from 1926 to 1996 (for men; for women adultery was decriminalised only in 1998). Nor was it an 'Islamist plot': women organisations were shocked to find that the impromptu proposal by the prime minister initially also found support among the opposition CHP. The initiative was, however, a break with the consultative style that had produced the reform and had been praised by the minister of justice. It also failed. Reactions from within Turkey and across Europe were extremely hostile, forcing the prime minister to withdraw the proposal. Not surprisingly, the episode left a sour taste., 84898=Levels of education are increasing and every generation of Turkish women is better educated than their mothers. In the 20-24 years age group, some 34 percent of women have completed secondary or third-level education, compared with 16 percent of women aged 40-44 years and just 3 percent of females aged over 60 years. Education spending has also increased steadily from 2.3 percent of GDP in 1995 to 3.8 percent in 2005. The challenge is again immense: there is a need to provide for more than a million additional pupils every year., 35231=The outcome was no less than a legal and philosophical revolution for Turkish society. According to Yakin Erturk, an academic and Turkish feminist, \"The whole mentality of the Penal Code has changed.\" One commentator described it as \"the widest discussion of issues related to sexuality in Turkey since the foundation of the Turkish republic in 1923.\" The minister of justice told parliamentarians:, 58393=In a quiet area of the municipality one finds the result of another initiative of Kadikoy's activist deputy mayor. In 2001, a woman approached Inci Bespinar, asking for protection. The next day, she was killed by her husband with an axe. After two sleepless nights, Bespinar took the initiative to mobilize the resources needed to set up Kadikoy's first shelter for women at risk. Her initial funding came from the World Bank and the Turkish state. The district governorship contributed salaries for the resident nurse, psychologists, administrators and part-time doctors. The municipality pays for the premises and provides in-kind support. Starting with 15 beds, the shelter has expanded to fill two buildings. In the past three years, it provided shelter to 437 women and 269 children in need., 48175=Yet even in Van, there are cautious signs of change, as we can see from Songul's story. The influence of an activist like Zozan Ozgokce is one new factor. On 9 April 2004, Ozgokce and six other women formally established VAKAD (Van Kadin Dernegi) [Van Women's Association] to offer support to victims of family violence. With ten staff and a network of 30 volunteers, they provide advice and training courses. One of their goals is to help Kurdish women overcome their reluctance to deal with state institutions (many Kurdish women in the region do not speak Turkish). One study by WWHR found that 57 percent of women in Eastern Turkey had experienced physical violence, but only 1.2 percent had notified the police and 0.2 percent had filed a complaint., 9779=In Umraniye, nearly half of the 50,000 registered party members were women. Political activism on behalf of the Welfare Party offered women new opportunities \u2013 the chance to be trained, work outside the home and exercise a voice on public affairs. In 1999, Yesim Arat talked to 25 women volunteers for the Welfare Party. She was \"taken aback by the unmitigated fulfilment these political activists derived from their political work. Without exception, all women interviewed recalled their political activism with pleasure.\" One activist told Arat: \"we all proved something; we gained status.\", 56228=Yet the rise of the middle-class woman is only part of the story of Kadikoy. Like Van, its population has grown rapidly in recent decades, from 241,000 in 1970 to over 660,000 in 2000. Growth has been driven almost entirely by urbanisation, with 60 percent of the population born outside of Istanbul. The poorer immigrants live in shanty towns stretching south along the E5 motorway, making up around 10 percent of Kadikoy's population. Largely illiterate, with poor employment prospects and dependent on social assistance, the women in these communities face many social problems. So how effectively does a wealthy Turkish municipality deal with these kinds of problems?, 16688=The newly created AKP took a different position. AKP deputy Mehmet Ali Sahin spoke in favour of the new Civil Code. His main objection was on an issue that the women's associations had raised concerning the lack of retrospective application of rules on the equal division of assets after divorce. Sahin proposed that if couples married before 2002 do not explicitly object, the newly introduced property regime should also apply to them. Women's activists told ESI that they were surprised by this support at the time., 82831=There is also a persistence of cultural values encouraging women to stay at home. However, cultural factors appear less significant than the structural and institutional barriers. In Western Europe, prejudices against female workers broke down at a time when industrialisation and rapid economic growth made it imperative to expand the workforce. A similar pragmatism inspired the Ottoman authorities in 1915. At the height of the First World War, when most men were drafted into the army, they issued a law that \"instituted a form of mandatory employment which rapidly swelled the number of women workers.\" Patriarchal prejudices were shelved for the greater benefit of the country. It is likely that economic success and employment growth would propel Turkish women into the workforce, as it has done for women across the rest of Europe. A recent survey also found that more than three quarters of respondents found it appropriate for women to hold professional and managerial positions in the private sector., 2952=1960, 84284=Since 2003, there has been a series of new initiatives to boost enrolment, including a national campaign, Haydi Kizlar Okula (Girls let's go to school) to achieve 100 percent primary school enrolment. Of the 273,000 girls approached by 2006, 223,000 were enrolled. Teachers work with the village muhtar (headman) and imam to convince parents to send their daughters to school. A monthly cash incentive was offered for each child, and the funds distributed directly to mothers, through accounts opened in their name. For poor families, it amounts to a significant sum., 21705=In another court in 1996, a young man who murdered his cousin, Sevda Gok, in the province of Sanliurfa was given a light sentence, following arguments from the prosecution that \"the incident was caused by the socio-economic structure of Sanliurfa.\" The 16-year old girl had been murdered as a result of gossip in the community that she had acted \"shamefully\". The trial brought the tolerance of the judiciary for these \"honour killings\" to the top of the national agenda. However, the outcry did not prevent other such judgements. As late as June 2003, a court in the southeast Anatolian province of Mardin acquitted 27 perpetrators, including military officers, accused of raping a young girl. The court found that there was insufficient evidence as to whether the 13-year-old had consented to the acts., 6528=These demographic changes introduced new social strata into Turkish society. Turkey's urban population more than doubled in size between 1985 and 2000, resulting in an increase of 24.4 million people in absolute terms. New and rapidly growing suburbs emerged on the outskirts of Istanbul, Ankara and other large cities. They were filled with people who had arrived from their villages with few skills, bringing with them a distinctly conservative and religious outlook. But they also aspired to education, and enjoyed greater opportunities for social mobility than those who remained in the villages. It was this new urban class that created the core constituency for the rise of political Islam, and the electoral success of the Islamist Welfare Party. Women played a key part in this major shift in Turkish politics., 55278=Both the municipal authorities (run since 1994 by a CHP mayor) and the private sector have responded to the rising expectations (and spending power) of middle-class families. The first pre-school opened in 1989/90. There are now five cr\u00e8ches and 38 private pre-schools. The social stigma attached to putting the elderly into professional care is also fading slowly, although some see this as an unwelcome intrusion of Western values. There are now 17 homes for the elderly (5 state and 12 private). Another controversial social trend is the rising divorce rate, albeit from very low levels. There are five family courts operating in Kadikoy, all opened since January 2003 as a result of EU-inspired judicial reforms. The new courts are well equipped by any standards, with psychologists, social workers and public-education specialists. Few of the 157 family courts elsewhere in Turkey have managed to fill these positions., 52462=These actions are in part a response to central government initiatives, following a directive issued by the prime minister in 2006 on \"Precautions to be taken against violence towards children and women, and customs and honour killings\". It was based on the findings of a 12-member special parliamentary commission set up in May 2005 under the leadership of AKP deputy Fatma Sahin. It calls for a broad national strategy to enhance the status of women in Turkey and combat violence, and includes a reference to the need for positive discrimination measures until equality between men and women is achieved. Ensuring that these initiatives are effective in a place like Van will require a great deal more effort., 18245=The Turkish Penal Code, in force from 1926 until 2004, was the most striking example of the divergence between rhetoric and reality in the Republic of Turkey. Like many of the laws adopted at the time of Ataturk, it was based on a Western European model \u2013 in this case, the Italian Penal Code of 1889. This was then adapted to reflect Turkish values and traditions., 5442=2000, 37126=Remarkably, this acutely sensitive set of reforms was achieved through cross-party consensus between AKP and CHP. As the minister of justice informed the parliament in September 2004: \"In half a century of multiparty life this may be the first time that the Parliament has produced its own draft.\" He celebrated this as a shift in the traditional confrontational culture of parliamentary politics, marking it as \"perhaps the most important achievement of this parliament.\", 29007=By the time the subcommittee on penal code reform started its work, at the end of October 2003, the women's organizations had succeeded in reshaping the debate. As Koksal Toptan acknowledged on national television:, 25651=It was the Donmezer draft that the AKP justice minister first submitted to the 24-member Parliamentary Justice Commission in April/May 2003., 83872=Closing the gender gap in education is also a major challenge. In theory, primary school attendance is compulsory and free of charge. Across the country, however, it was estimated in 2002 that 873,000 girls and 562,000 boys between the ages of 6 and 14 are not enrolled in education. In rural eastern Turkey, many girls are not registered at birth, placing them beyond the reach of the state., 4197=1980, 22885=The association Women for Women's Human Rights (WWHR) responded by forming a working group in early 2002 representing academics, NGOs and bar associations to prepare recommendations for the new Penal Code: \"to each article pertaining to us we formulated a word-by-word amendment, including a justification to explain our point of view.\" The association began the process of raising awareness on the issues, through publications, media campaigns and networking across civil society., 1708=1945, 25811=For the WWHR and the women's working group this was the moment to launch a broad-based public campaign by creating a broader coalition of over 30 NGOs: the Platform for the Turkish Penal Code. WWHR circulated a booklet with concrete recommendations to the new set of parliamentarians, and called a meeting with the head of the parliamentary Justice Committee, Koksal Toptan (AKP). Toptan listened in silence to the arguments made by the members of the Platform, leaving some of them despondent. Nonetheless, by June 2003, Toptan announced that the women's objections would be sent to a subcommittee for consideration. He announced his own agreement with the women's call for the criminalisation of marital rape. Toptan also noted the importance of the EU integration process as a motivation:, 38559=Nonetheless, the Penal Code of 2004 represents a profound achievement for the women's movement, the government and the opposition. Unlike the reforms of the 1920s, it was achieved not by authoritarian dictate, but through intense dialogue and the engagement of civil society and the media in the parliamentary process. It was not just a victory for Turkish women, but also for Turkish democracy. With the new Penal Code, Turkey's legislation entered the post-patriarchal era., 29818=The subcommittee extended its deliberations for nine months, until June 2004. Its members included three AKP MPs, two from the Republican People's Party (CHP) and three academics. The academics were known as critics of the Donmezer draft and suggested that it be rewritten from first principles. The atmosphere created by the EU integration process played an important role in helping the subcommittee members reach agreement that a fundamental revision was necessary. The press were also given a daily account of the discussions \u2013 a very unusual degree of transparency in Turkey., 24839=The 1996 CEDAW report on Turkey had concluded that 29 articles in the Penal Code did not conform to the requirements of the Convention. Remarkably, the draft prepared by Donmezer for the government in power from 1999 to 2002 had left all of these provisions intact, except for cosmetic changes. And when the incoming AKP justice minister Cemil Cicek was photographed kissing the hand of Donmezer in 2003, a columnist in Yeni Safak, a daily known to be close to AKP, commented sarcastically:, 18637=In its treatment of sexual crimes, the 1926 Penal Code reflected the belief that women's bodies were the property of men, and that sexual crimes against women were in fact crimes against the honour of the family. It was full of traditional concepts adapted from Arabic: irz (honor or purity), haya (shame), ar (things to be ashamed of). It treated women's sexuality as a threat that needed to be controlled by society., 50571=The reaction of public institutions to Songul's case is also an indication of change. It illustrates how long it takes for legal and institutional reforms to filter down to the local level. Law 4320 on domestic violence, introduced in 1998, enables prosecutors to seek protection orders for women from abusive or violent husbands, including the provision of shelter for those who cannot remain in their homes. However, as Songul's lawyer told ESI:, 20839=The persistence of these norms past the end of the 20th century was no mere legal anachronism, but reflected values that were embedded in Turkish society, including among its judges and prosecutors. At the same time, as the 20th century came to an end, these values began to be increasingly contested, as demonstrated most dramatically by the public reactions to a number of highly controversial court decisions. In 1987, a judge in the Central Anatolian province of Corum refused to grant divorce to a pregnant woman who had been abused by her husband, citing a Turkish proverb: \"Women should never be free of a child in the womb and a whip on the back!\" The decision triggered the first public demonstration since the 1980 coup: more than a thousand women took to the streets in the Istanbul district of Kadikoy., 57905=Bespinar has been instrumental in setting up Family Consultation Centres since 1994, targeting families who recently arrived from rural areas. These centres provide women from poorer families with health checks and the skills they need to adapt to urban life. Today there are ten such centres in Kadikoy, plus two vocational training centres. They act as the municipality's eyes and ears, helping to identify vulnerable women and children in need of social assistance., 90937=There are those in Europe who see the low status of Turkish women as a reflection of an alien culture that has no place within the European Union. Yet patriarchy was also an integral part of European culture, not so long ago. If the low proportion of women in Turkey's parliament seems shocking today, remember that the proportion of women in the UK's House of Commons passed 5 percent only in 1987. In Ireland, married women were banned from working in the public service until 1973. In Spain, until 1975 a woman needed her husband's permission (permiso marital) to work, buy property or even travel any distance. Yet none of these values were set in stone., 52086=Poor coordination between state institutions and the absence of a suitable shelter were additional problems. Now a shelter is being established. The governorate has also established an inter-agency Monitoring Committee to coordinate action among institutions for protecting women subject to violence. The first Family Court opened in Van in September 2005., 46207=The high rate of violence against women in Van has a distinct cultural, socio-economic and political context. Lying on the Iranian border in the far east of Anatolia, Van is one of Turkey's poorest provinces. It has experienced dramatic social and economic change. Over the past decades, it has received major migration from people displaced by the armed conflict between the Turkish military and the terrorist PKK in Turkey's southeast, swelling its population by nearly a quarter. As a result, even in the urban areas, village lifestyles are prevalent. Cut off from their land, many of the immigrants depend on casual or seasonal work. Van's industrial zone, set up in 1998, has only 27 active businesses; the remaining 73 plots are empty or under construction. Employment in industry in this province inhabited by more than 1 million people is less than 7,000. Per capita income is only 55\u20ac per month. By any measure of socio-economic development in Turkey, Van ranks near the bottom of the list., 27025=Over the summer of 2003, it became clear that, for the first time, a real public debate on gender equality was underway. Columnists in Yeni Safak reminded the government of its commitment to work with NGOs. On 23 July, columnist Ali Bayramoglu encouraged the government to meet with the women's groups and take their concerns seriously. The next day the columnist published a letter from an academic at Istanbul University, arguing that consultations on the new draft had been too brief, and that feedback had not been taken into consideration. Ali Bayramoglu concluded:, 23396=Yet to many of these activists, the campaign appeared to grind to halt before it got started, with the landslide victory of the AKP in the elections of November 2002. Many women's organisations saw the AKP, as successor of the Islamist Welfare Party, as fundamentally opposed to their agenda., 93084=Is there any reason why Turkey should not follow in the footsteps of Spain, Ireland and the rest of Europe, towards a truly post-patriarchal society? It is clear that the vast socio-economic changes underway in Turkey have created some of the conditions for a radical change in the status of women. Already, one finds evidence of profound changes in values. In 1997, a nationwide survey suggested that 69 percent of marriages in Turkey had been arranged. By 2004, that had fallen to 54 percent. Among young, unmarried Turks, only 10 percent endorse the idea of arranged marriage today., 10418=Yet the political platform of the Welfare Party continued to emphasise that a woman's place was with her home and family. When the party first made it into the national parliament in 1991, it had not a single woman among its 62 MPs. By 1995, it was the largest party in the parliament with 158 deputies, but still with no women represented. Its discourse on women continued to be highly conservative. In 1997, there was a debate among senior party leaders as to whether it was proper to shake hands with a woman. Many of its leaders held to the view that women's issues were best solved by a return to the asri saadet, or age of felicity \u2013 namely, by the rules and mores from the time of the Prophet and his immediate successors. Jenny B. White comments on the differences in outlook between men and women Welfare activists., 93689=There is another interesting paradox, highlighted in a recent survey by TESEV. On the one hand Turks are becoming more religious in private \u2013 the number of people who say that they are 'very' or 'quite' religious increased from 31 to 61 percent between 1999 and 2006. On the other hand, support for the secular state has grown stronger. The proportion of people supporting Islamic law (Sharia) has fallen since 1999 from 21 to 9 percent. Although from current political debates one has the impression that the headscarf is becoming ever more prevalent, in fact the number of women appearing uncovered in public increased from 27 percent in 1999 to 37 percent in 2006., 91624=Of all European countries, Spain has made some of the most dramatic progress in living memory in closing its gender gap. Under Franco's rule, which lasted until 1975, the Catholic Church was able to impose a moral vision on Spanish society that severely limited the place of women: \"Women could aspire to marriage and motherhood but little more.\" Divorce and contraception were both outlawed. Discrimination was institutionalised in marriage, property ownership and the workplace. A woman was legally obliged to obey her husband. Violence within the family was endemic, but hidden by a culture that resisted any external interference in family affairs. For centuries, Spanish women, 16228=When the new Civil Code was brought before parliament in 2001, the Felicity Party opposed it strongly. In a speech before the parliamentary assembly, one of its deputies stated:, 24105=As it happened, the AKP government took up the matter exactly where its predecessors had left off \u2013 with a draft prepared for the previous government by an expert group of academics. Senior academics had exercised effective control over the legislative drafting process for many years, irrespective of who was in power. Chief among them was Sulhi Donmezer, a highly respected figure in the legal establishment known as the 'professor of professors'. He had been involved in most criminal law reform initiatives since the 1950s, including the preparation of new criminal procedures after the 1980 coup. It was Donmezer who had been put in charge again in the late 1990s with preparing a new draft Penal Code., 86765=In 2007, the women's NGO KADER ran a national media campaign featuring photos of prominent women wearing fake moustaches, posing the question: \"Is it necessary to be a man to enter parliament?\" The case for some form of a quota to increase women's representation in parliament does seem overwhelming. Parliamentarian Gaye Erbatur (CHP) admits that women find it hard to make their voices heard., 74378=Demographic trends make changing this a huge challenge. While the rate of population growth has been falling rapidly, halving between 2000 and 2006, the absolute growth in these years still amounted to 6.1 million people \u2013 an increase of a million people per year. Every year, far more workers enter the labour force than leave it. As a result in the next decade \"a net increase of upwards of five million jobs will be required to maintain the percentage of adults in employment at its current low level.\" Closing Turkey's huge gender gap would therefore require even more rapid job growth:, 40616=On 30 October 2006, Songul A., a 22-year-old woman living in the small, Kurdish village of Hacikislak in the Ozalp district of Van, not far from the Iranian border, went with her brother to visit a lawyer. Like hundreds of thousands of other girls across rural Turkey, Songul had not been registered by her family at birth. As far as the Turkish state was concerned, she did not exist. She had never been to school and did not know how to read., 32752=The public debate on the reform was particularly heated in autumn 2003. In October Dogan Soyaslan, an academic adviser to the Justice Ministry who joined the meetings from time to time, defended an article in the earlier Donmezer draft that allowed rapists to go unpunished if they married their victims. Soyaslan asserted that, in Turkish society, no one else would agree to marry a woman who is not a virgin, and that for the victim to marry her rapist protects her from honour killing. He pointed out,, 87994=Some women face an additional obstacle if they wear the headscarf. They are not permitted to become electoral candidates because the headscarf is banned for those working in all state institutions, including parliament. The headscarf is also a barrier for covered women wishing to go on to university. One of the first women to be excluded from university for covering her head was Hatice Babacan, a student at the Ankara University Theology Faculty, in 1967, and the aunt of Turkey's current minister of economics and chief EU negotiator, Ali Babacan. At that time, there were relatively few women with headscarf seeking to enter university. Since the 1980s, however, the problem has escalated. The Law on Higher Education used to contain an article, Addendum 16, permitting girls to wear headscarves for religious reasons. This article was abolished by the Constitutional Court in 1989, on the basis that the Turkish constitution does not permit any reference to religion in the law. Since then the headscarf has become a highly charged symbol and following the so-called 'soft coup' in 1997 there has been little rational debate on the subject. Ayse Bohurler (AKP) juggles a successful career as a television broadcaster with raising three children and an active engagement in politics. But despite her qualifications, she cannot hope to enter parliament., 17226=The AKP clearly set out to distance itself from the traditional Islamists. It had 71 founding members in 2001, of whom 12 were women (half with headscarves, and half without). Its official party programme avoided direct reference to Islam, proclaiming adherence to Turkey's secular traditions defined as \"the state's impartiality toward every form of religious belief and philosophical conviction.\"}", "textBeforeTable": "Table 4: Economic Status of women and men in Turkey In Turkey, balancing work and motherhood remains very difficult \u2013 as evidenced by the fact that 63 percent of women who work do not have a child under six years of age. Childcare facilities are extremely limited, or absent altogether. In theory, each private kindergarten is obliged to give free attendance to a minimum of two poor children designated by Social Services and Child Protection Institution (SHCEK), or 5 percent of its school population if the establishment is larger. In practice, however, only a total of 448 children in need are currently enrolled in private kindergarten under this rule in the entire country. Where private childcare services are available, their cost is prohibitive for most families. Care for the elderly is equally difficult to obtain. As of August 2006, the total capacity in care facilities for the elderly across the country was only 18,849 places. However, employment growth is only part of the story. An additional problem in Turkey is the absence of institutions to take care of children and the elderly. In a country like Sweden, which ranks first on the global index, 70 percent of women were housewives in the 1960s. By the early 1980s, 80 percent were in the workforce. In addition to strong job growth, these years also saw the introduction of a range of measures, such as extended parental leave and subsidised childcare, to make it easier for women to", "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 There is also a persistence of cultural values encouraging women to stay at home. However, cultural factors appear less significant than the structural and institutional barriers. In Western Europe, prejudices against female workers broke down at a time when industrialisation and rapid economic growth made it imperative to expand the workforce. A similar pragmatism inspired the Ottoman authorities in 1915. At the height of the First World War, when most men were drafted into the army, they issued a law that \"instituted a form of mandatory employment which rapidly swelled the number of women workers.\" Patriarchal prejudices were shelved for the greater benefit of the country. It is likely that economic success and employment growth would propel Turkish women into the workforce, as it has done for women across the rest of Europe. A recent survey also found that more than three quarters of respondents found it appropriate for women to hold professional and managerial positions in the private sector. Closing the gender gap in education is also a major challenge. In theory, primary school attendance is compulsory and free of charge. Across the country, however, it was estimated in 2002 that 873,000 girls and 562,000 boys between the ages of 6 and 14 are not enrolled in education. In rural eastern Turkey, many girls are not registered at birth, placing them beyond the reach of the state. Since 2003, there has been a series of new initiatives to boost enrolment, including a national campaign, Haydi Kizlar", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
