This morning I did not want to force too much because I wanted to stay dehydrated and keep my energy for qualifying. Even so, I finished qualifying out of breath, so because of that I am quite happy with the final position. Tomorrow I think we can be in the front group. Now have to work with the team to see if we improve on a couple of points, but we have a good pace and we can have a good race.\u201d Efren Vazquez, JHK t-Shirt Laglisse: 7th \u2013 2m 15.366s \u201cIt was a very difficult day for us, even though we have improved my lap times by more than one second since yesterday. The team has done a good job and I did my fastest lap all alone, which is very important in this category. In qualifying I had a little trouble finding the right feeling, but I think we can still improve several aspects of the bike during morning warm-up.\u201d Miguel Oliveira, Estrella Galicia 0,0: 6th \u2013 2m 15.316s \u201cToday has been quite a good day for us.
