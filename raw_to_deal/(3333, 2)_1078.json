The former limit product shelf-life but the latter cause illness. Almost all foodpoisoning bacteria are mesophiles so refrigeration below 10\u00b0C offers good protection. Many mesophiles cause spoilage, but since meat is refrigerated most spoilage is due to psychrophiles. Storing meat at temperatures close to 0\u00b0C will inhibit the growth of pyschrotrophs. Shelf-life will be extended by avoiding contamination through good hygiene practices. Aerobic bacteria have an absolute requirement for oxygen which limits their growth to the meat surface. Anaerobic bacteria grow within the meat as they need the absence of oxygen. Facultative anaerobes can grow slowly within oxygen but grow better in its presence. Food-poisoning bacteria are anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. The most important spoilage bacteria (Pseudomonas spp.) are aerobic. 9. Different types of bacteria can grow within different temperature ranges Water is required by micro-organisms so reducing the water available below the optimum level will prolong shelf-life. If meat is stored at a relative humidity (RH) below 95 percent, moisture will be lost from the surface. Since most spoilage bacteria, being aerobic, can grow only on the surface, this surface drying will extend the shelf-life. Moulds (fungi) are able to grow in drier conditions than bacteria so that desiccation has a selective effect on microbial growth. Meat pH is the level of acidity in meat. Stored sugars are broken down to lactic acid.", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
