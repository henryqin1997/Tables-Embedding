Making it possible to manage policies in a central directory service makes Fedora more suitable for larger, centrally managed installations. Benefit to Fedora The current plan is to land the new PolicyKit early in F12 (as soon as it opens up, basically), and have most of the patches ready to port applications. The old PolicyKit 0.9 packages can remain for a while to ease the transition period and will be removed a few months into F12, when all users have been ported. More details can be found in Davids announcement of the PolicyKit 0.90 release and in his plans for the local authority. The initial Releases/FeaturePolicyKit as introduced in Fedora 8 has some shortcomings. E.g. it is based on a library with suid helpers. The shortcoming that motivated the rewrite is that it is not possible to integrate it with directory services such as FreeIPA.", "textAfterTable": "How To Test Make sure you have polkit and polkit-gnome 0.91 or newer installed. Make sure /usr/libexec/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1 is automatically started when you log in Choose a operation that require authorization and are using PolicyKit, e.g. setting the system timezone in the clock applet Try the operation and verify that you get a PolicyKit password dialog according to the policy Test that entering the wrong password does not let you execute the operation Test that entering the correct password lets you execute the operation Verify that the authorization is remembered according to the policy for this operation, and that a statusicon informs you about currently remembered authorizations Verify that you can drop the authorizations from the status icon Try changing the policy for the operation using the policy configuration utility Check that the policy changes are effective immediately Verify that logging out and back in removes all remembered authorizations Repeat these tests with other operations that require authorization, such as storing system connections in nm-applet or changing the default desktop background. User Experience The authentication dialogs that are shown by PolicyKit will change in some aspects. The 'retain authorization' checkboxes will likely go away and be replaced with a status icon in the style of consolehelper-gtk, that lets you inspect and drop your retained authorizations.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
