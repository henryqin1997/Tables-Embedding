The Enforcer does also not accept more transactions than the configured number of the new internal parameter max_allowed_trans is reached. The internal parameter number_jobs_to_abort was removed since it is no longer relevant.

This includes the 1600 platform, the 3600 platform, and VCMP guests. In addition, platforms with less than 6.5 GB memory cannot be upgraded to v.11.3.0 if three or more modules are provisioned. Note that upgrades from 10.0.x display only an \"upgrade failed\" message as a software status. All other versions show a clear error message, guiding the users to SOL13988. Before upgrading a BIG-IP system with less than 6.5 GB of memory, make sure you have only one or two modules provisioned.}", "textBeforeTable": "This release includes the following fixes.

By default, the system does not ignore the RAM cache. To ignore RAM cache, set the value of this parameter to 1. ID 381283 Due to a change made by MacAfee, we changed the default value for the virus_header_name internal parameter from X-Virus-Name to X-Infection-Found. You can now use a number of strings for the value of the Advanced Configuration System Variable (internal parameter) virus_header_name by using the comma character (,) as a delimiter.
