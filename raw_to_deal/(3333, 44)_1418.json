On June 4, 2015, the company notified The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC that it was not in compliance with the board committee composition requirements as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605 due to the director resignations announced on June 5, 2015. As a result, the company has one vacant position on its audit committee and two vacant positions on its compensation committee, which vacancies are not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605. On June 15, 2015, in response to the company\u2019s notification, the company received a notice from NASDAQ confirming that the company is not in compliance with the independent director requirement as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605. The Notice Letter indicates that consistent with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(c)(4) and 5605(d)(4), NASDAQ will provide the company with a cure period to regain compliance as follows: (i) until the earlier of the company's next annual shareholders' meeting or June 4, 2016 or (ii) if the company's next annual shareholders' meeting is held before December 8, 2015, then the company must evidence compliance no later than December 8, 2015.

For the quarter, the company reported revenues of $26,116,000, loss from operations of $7,340,000, loss before provision for income tax of $10,312,000 and net loss of $10,630,000 or $0.84 per basic and diluted share compared to revenue of $30,272,000, loss from operations of $6,373,000, loss before provision for income tax of $9,763,000 and net loss of $10,071,000 or $0.81 per basic and diluted share a year ago. Adjusted LBITDA was $3,416,000 compared to $6,704,000 a year ago. The increase in Adjusted LBITDA is primarily attributable to lower expenditures on content investments, which declined during the current period because the company is not currently producing any new content within its IP-Licensing segment. The decrease in revenue is primarily driven by the company's wholesale and direct-to-consumer segments., 13629=RLJ Entertainment Inc. announced that it received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\"NASDAQ\") stating that the bid price of the Company's common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued listing under Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The NASDAQ notification letter does not result in any immediate delisting of the Company's common stock, and the stock will continue to trade uninterrupted on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \"RLJE.\" RLJ Entertainment has been provided an automatic grace period of 180-calendar days, or until December 2, 2015, to regain compliance.
