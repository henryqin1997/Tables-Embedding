For ease of understanding, WGU has assigned competency units to each of its courses as indicated below. A competency unit is equivalent to a semester credit hour of learning. WGU terms are six months in length. During a typical term, students will be expected to complete at least 12 to 13 competency units. Grades are assigned on a Pass/Not Pass basis; a \u201cPass\u201d at WGU is equivalent to a letter grade of \u201cB\" or better. WGU offers degrees, not classes. As a competency-based online university, progress through your degree program is determined by demonstrating your competence through carefully designed assessments and completion of a professional portfolio, capstone, or both. As a student in this program, you will complete the courses listed below in order to graduate. These courses are required, though you may be able to clear some of these requirements through a course-by-course transcript analysis. (Learn more about transferring credits.)
