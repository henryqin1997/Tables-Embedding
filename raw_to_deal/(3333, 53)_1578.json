There are ways that the United Nations could become less dependent on dues.\u00a0 Before we look at these we should realize that many of the big issues of today were not thought about when the United Nations was founded 50 years ago, for example: environmental pollution, depletion of natural resources, over-population, over-crowded cities, mass migration, drug trafficking, global finance, global manufacturing, and global marketing.\u00a0 Individual nations alone cannot regulate these activities that cross national borders.\u00a0 Increasingly, issues are thrown into the lap of the United Nations which it was never designed to handle.\u00a0 The United Nations can debate these forever, but it will not be able to do all that the world wants done unless the United Nations can raise more money.\u00a0 Let\u2019s look now at different ways the United Nations could be funded without depending so much on dues from sovereign nations.
