Sound and Vision, June 2013, 1341=Since its introduction in 2001 the budget Gram Amp 2 continues to communicate what's in the groove - few, if any, contenders can compare at the price!, 6089=One of the most astonishing-sounding albums I pulled out was the 1976 duet between jazz/world fusion group Oregon and jazz drummer Elvin Jones, Together. All acoustic, this album really showed Jones\u2019 abilities, both as a swinging player and as an octopus-like polyrhythmic God. The record really shows the Gram Amp 2\u2019s precise timing, its effortless handling of fulsome bass, its sheer musicality, and that fabulous soundstage for which it is already justly famous. Gary Steel, Witchdoctor New Zealand, September 2011, 5233=The GramAmp 2 was something else... What I didn't expect was for it to soundstage like a four-figure pre. This is the hardest thing for a phono stage to do. For it to come off the stage it must faithfully preserve the information on the disc, including keeping a firm grip on phase. The Gram 2 was fully a match for the Audion in this respect. Swapping to the Korato pre, which I strongly suspect is even better than the Audion, the Korato held on to a small lead in width and gave a slightly deeper soundstage. But though the difference was noticeable in an A/B I'm not sure I could have identified which was playing if I just walked into the room. And the Gram 2 gave nothing away in detail. It just lacked a little of the power and glory of the 'hi-end' stages, but at a tiny fraction of the cost this was a stonking performance. Geoff Husband, TNT Audio, February 2001, 4078=After now 2 weeks of running in, the phono stage is getting better and better. It does control my speaker with a real strong hand, that my previous valve chinese was truly unable to do. I am so happy with it, really delighted. Best Value for Money! For once it gives the warming feeling that I could actually stop swapping boxes frantically every 6 months, and sit down and enjoy the MUSIC!
