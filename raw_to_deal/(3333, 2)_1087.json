We only use the bottom /64 of this /60 so automatic address configuration works right; the other 15/16s of the address space are intentionally wasted. r00ter hands out IPv6 router advertisements for this subnet directly. They're directly routable, but unsolicited incoming traffic is blocked by the firewall to protect the users. This means you can't run an IPv6 server on our IPv6 subnet, but you can connect to other machines on the IPv6 Internet just fine. If you really need to run an IPv6 server for some reason, consider using Teredo. 2001:5a8:4:5630::/60 Note that using IPv6 in some situations can result in people knowing what model of computer you have and the network card's serial number, because of the way IPv6 stateless address configuration works. If this is a concern, tell your computer not to use IPv6. Ask around Noisebridge if you need help or want more details. We have IPv6 support on the DSL circuit via a tunnel provided by sonic.net. Some details on how to get the OpenBSD-based flashrd distribution on the routers to tunnel correctly can be found on the Flashrd page. IPv6 ChaosVPN Wiki Has yet to be setup.

To change the state of the power ports, you'll need to telnet in and run \"setpower=11000000\". Each index represents a port, \"1\" is on and \"0\" is off. Port 1 sometimes doesn't turn on unless you use the web interface, and it might take a couple requests. Just keep clicking the apply button until it looks like power has been applied. Changing some settings on the IP 9258 in the web interface may result in the power being cycled on some of the ports.
