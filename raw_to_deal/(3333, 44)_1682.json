Acrylic is shatter resistant, weighs less than glass, and reflects a clear, bright image. The mirror comes with mounting hardware that makes the mirror angle adjustable after installation. It has an ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) plastic backing for resistance to impact and wear, with a vinyl-coated aluminum edge for weather resistance in outdoor applications.

Mirrors installed with dual brackets can be adjusted to a wide range of angles along one axis. Safety mirrors are used to help increase visibility in a variety of locations; for example, in hallway intersections and sharp turns, and in driveways and loading docks where drivers have to back up or enter traffic. Safety mirrors are sometimes called security mirrors, and they can be used to extend the view of security personnel, or to help monitor factory workers and automated processes to improve quality control and productivity. For convex mirrors, objects will appear to be further away than they are, and will be easier to see in a larger mirror. Depending on visibility conditions and the viewer's eyesight, objects will usually be recognizable within about 1 ft. of distance (including distance from eye to mirror, and from mirror to object) for each inch in mirror diameter.
