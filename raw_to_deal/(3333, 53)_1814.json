Preparing to Define the BEA MessageQ Environment Additional Configuration Tasks Starting and Stopping BEA MessageQ Groups Creating a Message Queuing Group Preparing to Define the BEA MessageQ Environment This chapter discusses the following topics: This chapter describes the initial configuration steps you must take to make BEA MessageQ operational at a minimum level. As you use BEA MessageQ and add new applications, you must upgrade the BEA MessageQ message queuing environment to satisfy new requirements. This chapter describes additional configuration and system management that are described in more detail in following sections. To use BEA MessageQ, begin by configuring a message queuing group on your local system. For BEA MessageQ to exchange messages between networked systems, you must configure cross-group connections. \u00a0 Defining the Message Queuing Environment", "textAfterTable": "Assigning Bus and Group IDs A message queuing group can consist of many message queues. A message queuing bus can have many message queuing groups. A networked system of computers may contain several message queuing buses which provide separate messaging domains. The assignment of BEA MessageQ bus and group IDs should be done as part of the application system design. A well-planned design for bus and group IDs for the message queuing environment is similar to planning the topology of a network. If planned well, the network can handle changes as applications are added and changed. If planned poorly, it can be difficult to accomplish even minor changes and those changes can cause interruptions to network users. In some situations, you may need to run more than one BEA MessageQ message queuing bus. A common situation for running multiple buses is when a test and production environment exist in the same network. BEA MessageQ allows multiple, concurrent BEA MessageQ buses to exist while ensuring that messages from different buses do not get mixed. To create a bus, you create groups using the DMQ$CREATE_GROUP.COM command procedure and specify a new bus ID. The new bus will start running as soon as the groups within that message queuing bus are started. If more than one bus is required, the assignment of bus IDs should be designed using valid bus IDs in the range from 0001 to 9998.
