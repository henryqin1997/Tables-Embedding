That was years ago, ancient really, in 2003. Arguably, this engine built by Katech at the behest of then-Chevrolet Special Projects engineer Mark McPhail, was the largest of its type (4.160x4.160) at the time, 452.3 ci to be exact. Today, LS engine technology is a quantum leap from 2003. Through the use of deck spacers and/or tall-deck aftermarket blocks, 500 ci or more is stone reality at a considerably cheaper rate., 36338=As it turned out, not enough to justify the time and expense but happily better than the flywheel claims we\u2019d read about.
