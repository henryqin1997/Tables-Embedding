For \"any\", either of the left or right modifier matches. Examples with modifiers: Shift+A, LAlt+MouseButtonLeft. Keyboard keys A keyboard key can be classified as a \"normal\" or \"special\" key. Normal keys are basically those that result in a character to be entered, such as 'A', '1', '.' etc. The input string is a UTF-8 encoded string, and non-ASCII characters are accepted as keys as well (e.g. '\u00c4' which could be found on a German keyboard). Case does not matter, 'A' and 'a' is the same. Since '+' and '-' could be confused with the characters used for modifier specification these two \"normal\" keys can also be specified with the strings \"Plus\" and \"Minus\". Special keys are the other keys. They include keys such as the cursor keys, num pad keys, etc. Available special key strings (in some cases, multiple strings are accepted for the same key): Esc Enter Return Tab Back, BackSpace Space Up (cursor key) Down (cursor key) Left (cursor key) Right (cursor key) PgUp, PageUp PgDn, PageDown Home End Ins, Insert Del, Delete F1 F2 F3 F4", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
