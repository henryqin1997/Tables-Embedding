Crash data for 2007 were not available at the time of this study., 5739=Form DOT F 1700.7 (8-72) Reproduction of completed pages authorized, 58357=Crash data were requested from HSIS for the study period starting in 1993 and ending in 2007. Crash data for 1997 and 1998 were not provided to HSIS by WSDOT; therefore, it was not available for analysis in this effort., 57751=AADT data were obtained from HSIS for the treatment and reference sites. AADT data were not available from 1999 to 2001. To fill in the missing data, an algorithm developed by Lord was utilized.(19) Upon a cursory review of the AADT, there were several curves where AADT changed dramatically from year to year (for example, one site had an AADT of 138 in 2005 and 7,325 in 2006). The project team only included curves where the difference between the AADT of 2 consecutive years was less than 20 percent to exclude any sites with unreliable AADT., 27357=In 2006, FHWA released Low-Cost Treatments for Horizontal Curve Safety, a resource providing practical information on low-cost treatments that can address identified or potential safety problems at horizontal curves.(10) Although it is a useful resource for horizontal curve improvements, it does not contain conclusive quantitative estimates of the safety effectiveness of enhancing delineation treatments along curves., 55258=WSDOT provided the research team with information about locations where chevrons were installed in the last 15 years. The milepost information for the chevrons was from a different milepost system than the roadway inventory. WSDOT provided information on converting between the two systems. The project team used these converted mileposts to tie the location of the chevrons with the beginning and ending mileposts of horizontal curves in the HSIS system. The project team identified 139 curves on rural two-lane roads where chevrons were installed sometime between 1994 and 2006., 110681=The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety effectiveness of improved delineation on horizontal curves through signing improvements. The results of the aggregate analysis using data from Connecticut and Washington indicated a statistically significant reduction in injury and fatal crashes (18-percent reduction), crashes during dark conditions (27.5-percent reduction), and lane departure crashes during dark conditions (25.4-percent reduction). Table 12 presents the recommended crash reduction factors and SEs. Based on the limited data from Connecticut, the reductions in crashes were more prominent on sharper curves (curve radius less than 492 ft) and in locations with more hazardous roadsides (RHR of 5 or higher) compared to locations with less hazardous roadsides (RHR of 4 or lower). In addition, curves where more within-curve signs were either added or replaced (with a more retroreflective material) experienced larger reductions in crashes. In both States, the reductions appeared to be more prominent at locations with higher traffic volumes. An economic analysis revealed that improving curve delineation with signing improvements is a very cost-effective treatment with the benefit-cost ratio exceeding 8:1., 16902=Geometric, traffic, and crash data were obtained at 89 treated curves in Connecticut and 139 treated curves in Washington to determine the safety effectiveness of improved curve delineation through signing improvements and post-mounted delineators. Treatments varied by site and included new chevrons, horizontal arrows, advance warning signs, post-mounted delineators, and improvements of existing signs using fluorescent yellow sheeting. All curves were on two-lane rural roads. To account for potential selection bias and regression-to-the-mean, an Empirical Bayes (EB) before-after analysis was conducted, utilizing a reference group of untreated curves in each State with similar characteristics to the treated sites. The aggregate results revealed an 18-percent reduction in injury and fatal crashes, a 27.5-percent reduction in crashes during dark conditions, and a 25-percent reduction in lane departure crashes during dark conditions. The reductions were more prominent at locations with higher traffic volumes and sharper curves (curve radius less than 492 ft) and in locations with more hazardous roadsides (roadside hazard rating (RHR) of 5 or higher) compared to locations with less hazardous roadsides (RHR of 4 or lower). In addition, curves where more signs were either added or replaced with a more retroreflective material within the curve experienced larger reductions in crashes. An economic analysis revealed that improving curve delineation with signing improvements is a very cost-effective treatment with the benefit-cost ratio exceeding 8:1., 134976=This exercise seemed to indicate that the treatment curves were unique for some unknown factors that were not reflected in the reference group data. To proceed with an analysis that would recognize this uniqueness and be defendable, the SPFs developed using the revised statewide reference group were calibrated to be more representative of the treatment group. The total number of crashes in the treatment group in the first year before treatment through the sixth year before treatment were plotted to identify if there was any evidence of randomly high crashes during any of these periods. Only those sites that had data for 6 consecutive years before the treatment were included in this plot. In Washington, crash data were not available in 1997 and 1998, and hence, only sites where the treatment was implemented in 2006 or 2005 provided 6 consecutive years before the implementation of the treatment. Data from 25 sites (out of 139 sites) were included in the plot in figure 3., 28586=A 2007 study by Charlton tested two groups of curve treatments using a driving simulator.(12) One group consisted of treatments to warn drivers before driving through the curve, and the other group focused on treatments to reduce driver speed while driving through the curve. The results indicated that advance warning signs by themselves were not as effective at reducing driver speeds as when they were used in conjunction with chevron sight boards and/or repeater arrows. However, this study focused on attention, perceptual, and lane placement factors. It did not include effects on crashes., 110212=Even with the conservative assumptions made, a very modest reduction in crashes is required to justify this strategy economically. The benefit-cost ratios reported in table 11 far exceed a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio. While the cost of the strategy may vary by State, it is likely that the annualized costs will not exceed the annual crash savings. Therefore, this strategy is justified economically., 1162=9. Performing Organization Name and Address Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. (VHB) 8300 Boone Blvd., Ste. 700 Vienna, VA 22182-2626, 27805=A 2006 study by Opiela et al. evaluated the effectiveness of roadway delineation at a variety of curves.(11) Sixteen research participants drove an instrumented FHWA test vehicle for a consecutive 8-night period. Each night, various curves were treated with different combinations of pavement markings, pavement markers, and horizontal signage. The research participants rated the effectiveness of the roadway delineation on each curve. The study recorded positive results for increasing retroreflectivity of pavement markings and horizontal signage. Wider edge lines along with the installation of horizontal curve warning signage also achieved desirable results. While this investigation yielded valuable results, it did not investigate the impacts on crashes., 55890=HSIS data were used to identify curves on rural two-lane roads that could serve as reference sites. The initial set of reference sites included about 4,000 curves that experienced approximately 8,000 crashes between 1993 and 2007. Several alternative reference groups were examined to obtain the reference group most similar to the treatment group in its characteristics. Further detail about the different reference groups is available in the appendix., 3291=Geometric, traffic, and crash data were obtained at 89 treated curves in Connecticut and 139 treated curves in Washington to determine the safety effectiveness of improved curve delineation. Treatments varied by site and included new chevrons, horizontal arrows, and advance warning signs as well as the improvement of existing signs using fluorescent yellow sheeting. All sites were on two-lane rural roads. To account for potential selection bias and regression-to-the-mean, an Empirical Bayes (EB) before-after analysis was conducted. The aggregate results revealed an 18-percent reduction in injury and fatal crashes, a 27.5-percent reduction in crashes during dark conditions, and a 25-percent reduction in lane departure crashes during dark conditions. The reductions were more prominent at locations with higher traffic volumes and sharper curves (curve radius less than 492 ft) and in locations with more hazardous roadsides (roadside hazard rating (RHR) of 5 or higher) compared to locations with less hazardous roadsides (RHR of 4 or lower). In addition, curves where more signs were either added or replaced (with a more retroreflective material) within the curve experienced larger reductions in crashes. An economic analysis revealed that improving curve delineation with signing improvements is a very cost-effective treatment with the benefit-cost ratio exceeding 8:1., 105196=The most recent FHWA mean comprehensive crash costs were used to estimate the cost for a lane departure crash based on 2001 dollar values.(18) The FHWA crash cost document does not directly report the cost for a lane departure crash, so the cost was estimated based on the cost of lane departure-related crashes and the percentage of these crashes. Lane departure- related crashes include head-on, sideswipe, single-vehicle rollover, and single-vehicle fixed object crashes. Based on Washington crash data, these crashes represent 2.6, 1.6, 25.9, and 69.9 percent, respectively. The mean comprehensive crash costs for these crash types are $60,451, $16,019, $147,629, and $67,353, respectively, assuming a speed limit less than 45 mi/h. A weighted average was computed by combining the crash costs with the percentage of each crash type, resulting in a cost of $87,143 per lane departure crash., 46369=The Connecticut Department of Transportation (ConnDOT) used fluorescent yellow sheeting to improve signing at horizontal curves between 2002 and 2006. These curves were selected through a regular program called the Suggested List of Surveillance Study Sites (SLOSSS). SLOSSS uses crash data, traffic volumes, and roadway characteristics to identify intersections and road segments with higher than expected crash rates. District engineers were asked to indicate which of the SLOSSS were located on horizontal curves, and these curve locations were then treated with improved signing. After these were implemented, the ConnDOT received positive feedback from enforcement officials who then asked to have these installed at additional curves., 29200=A 2009 study by Montello evaluated the safety effectiveness of treatments aimed at improving horizontal curve delineation on 15 curves on the A16 Naples-Canosa motorway in Italy. Montello indicated that all the curves are characterized by low radius and high deflection angle, limited sight distance, and limited super elevation.(13) Treatments involved installation of chevron signs, curve warning signs, and sequential flashing beacons along the road. An EB observational before-after study was performed. There was a statistically significant reduction in total, nighttime, daytime, rainy, non-rainy, run-off-road, and property damage only crashes. Total crashes decreased by 39.4 percent. The treatment was more effective in curves with radii less than or equal to 984 ft and with deflection angles greater than 54 degrees. The results of this study clearly indicate that improving curve delineation can provide significant benefits, although it is not clear if these results can be translated to conditions in the United States. In addition, the focus of Montello's study was on access-controlled four-lane divided roads, unlike the two-lane rural roads that are investigated in this low-cost pooled fund effort.(13), 631=5. Report Date September 2009, 18600=Statistics from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System indicate that 42,642 people were killed in 38,588 fatal crashes on the U.S. highway system in 2006. Approximately 27 percent of these fatal crashes occurred along horizontal curves.(1) These crashes occurred predominantly on two-lane rural highways that were often not part of the State system.(2) Approximately 70 percent of curve-related fatal crashes were single-vehicle crashes in which the vehicle left the roadway and struck a fixed object or overturned, and 11 percent of curve-related fatal crashes were head-on crashes. Thus, run-off-road and head-on crashes accounted for 81 percent of the fatal crashes at horizontal curves.(1) Also, the average accident rate for horizontal curves is about three times the average accident rate for highway tangents.(3) Hence, implementing strategies designed to improve the safety at horizontal curves will help achieve the overall goal of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Strategic Highway Safety Plan., 53647=Traffic volume counts are performed once every 3 years for each Connecticut road. These average daily traffic (ADT) values are recorded on ADT maps. Maps from 1997 to 2005 were made available to the research team in addition to an electronic file of 2006 ADT data. Team members located each treatment site on the map and took the reading of the nearest ADT count point. In the case of a site lying between two ADT count points, the average value was taken. Since reference sites were chosen in close proximity to treatment sites, any particular reference site was assumed to have the same ADT as its treatment site., 23442=In 1997, the AASHTO Standing Committee for Highway Traffic Safety, with the assistance of the FHWA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Committee on Transportation Safety Management, met with safety experts in the field of driver, vehicle, and highway issues from various organizations to develop a strategic plan for highway safety. These participants developed 22 key areas that affect highway safety. One of these areas focuses on crashes on horizontal curves., 104497=Based on information from the Office of Management and Budget, a discount rate of 2.4 percent was used to determine the annual cost of the strategy.(17) Assuming installation costs of $30 per sign, this equates to an annualized cost of $6.44 per sign. Although the number of warning signs per curve may vary, it was assumed that 10 chevron signs were installed per curve, resulting in an annual treatment cost per curve of $64. Assuming installation costs of $160 per sign, the annualized cost is $34.34 per sign and an annual treatment cost of $343 per curve. Consequently, the required annual crash savings ranges from $128 to $686 per curve to achieve a 2:1 benefit-cost ratio., 26469=A 2004 study conducted by Gates et al. analyzed the impacts of various sign conspicuity enhancements on traffic operations and driving behavior.(9) The evaluation was comprised of 14 sites in Texas. Six different fluorescent applications were chosen for this evaluation, which included yellow chevrons, yellow chevron posts, yellow curve signs, yellow ramp advisory speed signs, yellow \"Stop Ahead\" signs, and red stop signs. Two additional applications including flashing red light-emitting diode stop signs and standard red borders on speed limit signs were studied. Fluorescent yellow chevron signs were found to cause a reduction in edge line encroachments as well as curve speed. This investigation yielded valuable results, but the study was limited in that it did not examine the possible beneficial impacts on crashes but focused on safety surrogates., 1862=12.

The sample size estimates provided would be conservative in that stateof-the-art EB methodology proposed for the evaluations would require fewer sites. Table 1 provides estimates of the required number of before and after period mile-years for both the 90-percent and 95-percent confidence levels. Mile-years are the number of miles of roadway on which the strategy was applied multiplied by the number of years the strategy was in place. For example, if a strategy is applied on 9 mi of roadway and has been in place for 3 years on all 9 mi, there are 27 mile-years. The minimum sample indicates the level for which a study seems worthwhile; that is, it is feasible to detect with 90-percent confidence the largest effect that may reasonably be expected based on what is currently known about the strategy. In this case, a 20-percent reduction in crashes was assumed as this upper limit on safety effectiveness. The desirable sample assumes that the reduction could be as low as 10 percent for total crashes, and this is the smallest benefit that one would be interested in detecting with 90-percent confidence. The logic behind this approach is that safety managers may not want to implement a measure that reduces crashes by less than 10 percent, and the sample size required to detect a reduction smaller than 10 percent would likely be prohibitively large.", "textAfterTable": "30 36 25 Note: The bold numbers denote the desirable sample size. METHODOLOGY The EB methodology for observational before-after studies was used for the evaluation.(14) This methodology is rigorous in that it addresses the following: It properly accounts for regression-to-the-mean. It overcomes the difficulties of using crash rates in normalizing for volume differences between the before and after periods. It reduces the level of uncertainty in the estimates of safety effect. It provides a foundation for developing guidelines for estimating the likely safety consequences of contemplated strategy. It properly accounts for differences in crash experience and reporting practices in amalgamating data and results from diverse jurisdictions. In the EB approach, the change in safety for a given crash type at a site is given by the following: (1) \u0394 Safety = \u03bb - p Change in safety. Change in safety equals lambda minus pi. Where: \u03bb = The expected number of crashes that would have occurred in the after period without strategy. p = The number of reported crashes in the after period. In estimating \u03bb, the effects of regression-to-the-mean and changes in traffic volume were explicitly accounted for using safety performance functions (SPFs) relating crashes of different types to traffic flow and other relevant factors for each jurisdiction based on untreated sites (reference sites).
