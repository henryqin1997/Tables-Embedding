FPGA Design Andrei Cozma 15 Sep 2011 15:43 \u00b7 The next sections of this lab present all the steps needed to create a fully functional project that can be used for evaluating the operation of the ADI platform. It is possible to skip these steps and load into the FPGA an image that contains a fully functional system that can be used together with the uC-Probe interface for the ADI platform evalution. The first step of the quick evaluation process is to program the FPGA with the image provided in the lab files. Before the image can be loaded the Quartus II Web Edition tool or the Quartus II Programmer must be installed on your computer. To load the FPGA image run the program_fpga.bat batch file", "textAfterTable": "Load the FPGA Image To load the FPGA image the following steps must be performed: Plug in the BeMicroSDK Stick into a USB port Start Altera Quartus Web edition and start the programmer by selecting the menu option Tools\u2192Programmer Select Add File and select the file ADIEvalBoardLab/FPGA/SDP1_bemicro2.jic Check the Program/Configure box and press Start After finishing, the image is permanently loaded to the configuration Flash and the system will start with a blinking LED after reset or power up. 15 Sep 2011 15:47 \u00b7 Andrei Cozma NIOS II Software Design This section presents the steps for developing a software application that will run on the BeMicroSDK system and will be used for controlling and monitoring the operation of the ADI evaluation board.
