Ordered an XL and fit like a glove. Great product., 107856=September 29, 2013 - I really like this shirt. The material is light-weight and beautifully embroidered. It washes very nicely; does need to be ironed a little on the embroidery. The add says that it is semi-fitted; it is not. It's straight. I prefer the semi-fitted shirts because they just look a little dressier, so I'll tailor it myself., 106190=November 10, 2014 - A great gift for my cat loving friend I house/cat sit 7 cats for. Love the color although I would say more coral than pink. Fancier than just your average T-shirt, with beautiful detail. Love this shirt and very pleased!!, 107302=September 30, 2013 - What a great looking way to spread this message. The embroidery is very good and strong. A little thick but not too much. This is now my FAVORITE t-shirt., 108576=May 27, 2013 - I had been wanting one of these for a long time, and finally bought the pink one is size L. Why did I wait so long? This shirt is light weight, very comfortable, and fits great. Fit is always a problem for me because as I have aged, all my weight goes to my middle. Not a problem with this shirt! The color is just as pictured, a very pretty coral, not pink. The material is kind of silky and cool. And the length is good, not too short, not too long. I will be buying one in purple too, and definitely recommend this shirt., 163833=\u00a9 2000-2015 GreaterGood stores. All rights reserved. Trademarked, owned and operated by CharityUSA.com, LLC.
