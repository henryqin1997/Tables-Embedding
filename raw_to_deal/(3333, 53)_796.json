Experiments were fulfilled on the material of Spanish verb-noun collocations like formar un grupo, form a group, dar una conferencia, give a lecture, destacar la importancia, emphasize the importance, presentar informaci\u00f3n, present information. 900 verb-noun collocations were extracted from the Spanish Web Corpus automatically using the Sketch Engine, software for automatic text processing (Kilgarriff, Rychly, Smrz & Tugwell, 2004). The Spanish Web Corpus2 contains 116 900 060 tokens3 and is compiled of texts found in the Internet. The texts are not limited to a particular topic but touch on any theme which can be discussed on the World Wide Web. We extracted collocations which are most frequently met in the Spanish Web Corpus; therefore, these are most common collocations in contemporary Spanish Internet communication., 27425=iniciar la sesi\u00f3n tomar la palabra asumir el papel adoptar una actitud, 29856=Several attempts to conceptualize and formalize semantic similarity of collocations have been made. As far back as in 1934, the German linguist Porzig (1934) claimed that on the syntagmatic level, the choice of words is governed not only by grammatical rules, but by lexical compatibility, and observed semantic similarity between such word pairs as dog \u2013 bark, hand \u2013 grasp, food \u2013 eat, cloths \u2013 wear. The common semantic content in these pairs is \u2018typical action of an object\u2019. Research of Firth (1957) drew linguists\u2019 attention to the issue of collocation and since then collocational relation has been studied systematically. In the article of Flavell and Flavell (1959) and in the paper by Weinreich (1969), there were identified the following meanings underlying collocational isomorphism: an object and its typical attribute (lemon \u2013 sour), an action and its performer (dog \u2013 bark), an action and its object (floor \u2013 clean), an action and its instrument (axe \u2013 chop), an action and its location (sit \u2013 chair, lie \u2013 bed), an action and its causation (have \u2013 give, see \u2013 show), etc. Examples from the above mentioned writings of Porzig (1934), Flavell and Flavell (1959), Weinreich (1969) are borrowed from (Apresjan, 1995)., 51724=adoptar una actitud tomar posici\u00f3n, 95430=Firth, J.

Oxford: Oxford University Press., 15031=In this article, we present computational experiments made on the material of Spanish verb- noun collocations like seguir el ejemplo, follow the example, satisfacer la demanda, meet the demand, tomar una decisi\u00f3n, make a decision. The purpose of the experiments is to test a linguistic statement concerning collocational semantics. In Section 1, we present this linguistic statement in detail, in Section 2, describe the experiments as to the language data and methods used, discuss the experimental results in the light of the linguistic statement made before in Section 3, and in Section 4, derive another important inference on the nature of collocation., 16702=Before formulating the linguistic point we are going to test via computer experiments, we will first localize it within the vast realm of linguistics. Our statement is concerned with the concept of collocation, one of contemporary controversial issues in theoretical and applied linguistics. Knowledge of collocation is very important in lexicology (Herbst & Mittmann, 2008), translation (Boonyasaquan, 2006), language acquisition (Handl, 2008), and in various tasks of automated processing of natural language (e.g., in automatic word sense disambiguation: Jin, Sun, Wu & Yu, 2007; in machine translation: Wehrli, Seretan, Nerima & Russo, 2009; in text classification: Williams, 2002, etc.)., 10570=Revista Signos ISSN 0718-0934 \u00a9 2012 PUCV, Chile DOI:10.4067/S0718-09342012000100003 45(78) 44-59, 97623=Halliday, M.

We say that two or more collocations are similar semantically if they possess a common semantic content. In Table 1, we present collocations with the same syntactic structure, namely, \u2018verb + noun\u2019. For these collocations, the meaning is given for us to see what semantic element can be found that is common to all of them. The above examples are borrowed from the dictionary of Spanish collocations entitled Diccionario de colocaciones del Espa\u00f1ol (Alonso Ramos, 2003), a collection of collocations in which the bases are nouns belonging to the semantic field of emotions. So collocations have structural similarity when they share a common syntactic structure. verb + noun: sentir alegr\u00eda, to feel joy adjective + noun: gran alegr\u00eda, great joy preposition + noun: con alegr\u00eda, with joy noun + preposition: la alegr\u00eda de (esa muchacha), the joy of (this girl). \u00a0 What do we mean by semantic and structural similarity between collocations? For convenience of explanation, we will comment on the structural similarity of collocations first. The latter is not a novelty, and a detailed structural classification of collocations (for English) was elaborated and used to store collocational material in the wellknown dictionary of word combinations The BBI Combinatory Dictionary", "textAfterTable": "write a book develop a plan build a society give life intensify a property or attribute aumentar el riesgo elevar el nivel desarrollar la capacidad mejorar la condici\u00f3n increase the risk lift the level develop a capacity improve a condition increase the risk raise the level develop a capacity improve a condition reduce a property or attribute disminuir la probabilidad reducir el consumo bajar el precio limitar los derechosa lessen the probability reduce consumption lower the price limit rights lower chances reduce consumption bring down the price restrict rights begin to realize an action or begin to manifest an attribute iniciar la sesi\u00f3n tomar la palabra asumir el papel adoptar una actitud initiate a session take the word assume a role adopt the", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
