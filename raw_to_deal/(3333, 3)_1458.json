These reports should be transmitted directly to the circuit using Inmarsat. Alternatively, the observation should be passed to the nearest MCTS centre, irrespective of the ship's position. Reports made close to, or even within sight of land, are as important as reports made offshore, due to the greater variability of weather conditions in proximity to a coastline. Such reports contribute to the overall knowledge of Arctic weather from both a real-time operational perspective and from a climate perspective., 88337=During the navigation season meteorological warnings and forecasts for sections of METAREA XVII and XVIII north of 70\u00a0degrees latitude will be broadcast via HF Narrow Band Direct Printing on\u00a08416.5 kHz from the Canadian Coast Guard centre in Iqaluit NU.

For sea ice, ice forecasts are issued for offshore marine areas as well as the Great Lakes. The production schedule is detailed in each regional section of this part. The forecast program includes the following bulletins: Table 3: Marine forecast program Forecast or bulletin name Details Technical marine synopsis Provides the positions and trends of the main weather systems for the forecast period covering Days 1 and 2. Marine forecast (or Regular marine forecast) Provides information on: synoptic warnings, wind, visibility, precipitation, and freezing spray. It may include air temperature, as appropriate. Valid for Days 1 and 2. Recreational boating marine forecast Tailored to the needs of recreational boaters, it is available on a seasonal basis and only in specific regions. Marine weather statement Issued when deemed necessary, it provides additional information on potentially high impact marine conditions. Wave height forecast Provides information on significant wave heights valid for Days 1 and 2. It is not available for the Arctic waters or central and western Hudson Bay.
