The Department acknowledged the importance of formulated feeds when it established the feed section of the Fisheries Research Institute (FRI) in Penang in 1976. Since the establishment of the research branch of the Brackishwater Aquaculture Research Centre (BARC) in Johor in 1979, the feed section has been expanded to cover pond growout feeds for marine fish and shrimp. When the National Prawn Fry Production and Research Centre (NAPFRE) in Kedah was established in 1987, its feed section concentrated on larval and postlarval feeds for shrimp and other crustaceans (Figures 5 and 6). Research on freshwater fish feeds began in 1975 at the Freshwater Fish Research Centre (FFRC) in Malacca. Several universities also carry out aquafeed research, including the Universiti Pertanian Malaysia.

Based on experience in the production of freshwater fish, the apparent feed conversion (AFCR) is estimated at 2.5. Thus 24,300 t of feed would be sufficient to feed all the cultured freshwater fish in the country, assuming that all fish were given formulated feeds alone. Pond experiments have shown that, in the case of black tiger shrimp and seabass, an AFCR of 2.5 can also be obtained with local feeds. Therefore another 12,800 t of feed would be sufficient to produce the 1990 production (5,100 t) of brackishwater/marine finfish and shrimp. The total feed for aquaculture species calculated in this arbitary way would amount to 37,100 t/yr, or 119 t/day (for 312 working day per year)., 109019=Source: FDD Annual Report 1991/92 (unpublished), 28588=Poespodiharno, S. 1985.

Fisheries Development Division Budgeting Norms for 1991/92. 25 p., 106192=Systematic aquaculture began in the late 1950's with the introduction of the exotic common carp. By 1960, fingerlings of common carp were successfully produced and distributed to fish farmers. Chinese carps (silver, bighead, and grass carps) were introduced after 1965, when induced breeding techniques were also adopted for the indigenous fish rohu, mrigal and catla (Pantha 1979). Fish polyculture, using all the seven fish species, started after 1980, with the launching of the First and Second Aquaculture Development Projects (Pantha 1991)., 117971=Based on the total feed and manure used in the private sector (Tables 9 and 10) and the total production (Table 5), feeding costs are only US$ 65/t of fish produced. This is mainly due to the fact that a large proportion of the fish production comes from village ponds. Most of the feeding and manuring is done by farmers who constructed their ponds after 1980. Therefore the national average cost of feeding and manuring is low, compared to that in other countries. In the government sector the feed and manuring cost of fingerling production is US$ 1.42/1,000 fingerlings (US$ 1.27 for feed and US$ 0.15 for fertilizers). In the case of market-sized fish production under the outreach programme, the cost of feed and manuring is US$ 242/t (US$ 180 for feed and US$62 for fertilizers). Since the average farm-gate value of fish in Nepal is US$ 0.825/kg, the value of the national farmed production is nearly US$ 7.7 million. National feed and manure costs are less than 10% of this figure., 141421=Organic manure (1% N, 0.7% P2O5) is applied to broodstock ponds at 2,000 t/ha as a basal dose during pond preparation. Inorganic fertilizers are used at a 1:2 N:P ratio, i.e., 917 kg of urea and about 1,900 kg of TSP. One-sixth of this is applied as a basal dose and the remainder is split into 23 doses at 15-day intervals., 97570=Nepal is predominantly agricultural. Nearly 90% of the population is involved in agriculture, which includes livestock, forestry and fisheries, accounting for about 56% of G.D.P. in 1990/91 (CBS 1992). Per caput animal protein consumption was 7.5 kg/yr in 1990, out of which fisheries contributed 809 g/yr (10.8%). Crops represented 61% of the agricultural GDP, while livestock contributed 27%, forestry 11% and fisheries only about 1%. The GDP per caput is estimated to be about US$ 170 in 1988/89. Agriculture accounts for about 75% of exports and it absorbs more than 90% of the labour force., 98189=The total nutrients available per caput per day, in terms of calories, protein and fat in 1990/91 were 2,288 kcal, 61.5 g and 30.4 g respectively. The contribution of fish and fish products was extremely low (Table 2)., 107110=The fish production statistics of Nepal show that from 1979/80 to 1991/92 the fish culture area increased from 890 ha to 4,664 ha (424%) and aquaculture production rose from 1,150 t to 9,296 t (708%) (Table 5). Average capture fisheries production and the per caput fish consumption increased in the same period by 140% and 136%, respectively., 76355=About 311,000t of trash fish was available in the country in 1990. Trash fish was used for feeding cultured finfish and crustaceans (like mud crab) and for manufacturing fish meal., 70869=Figure 2.

This is supported by intensification, the rate of which is around 10% per year, and by the expansion of the area under shrimp farming. Accordingly, the requirement for feed will also increase. However, the increase in the amount of feed required will not exactly correspond to the scale of intensification, since the latter also includes semi-intensive systems. So far the FCR in intensive pond culture is about 1.6:1, while in semi-intensive pond culture it is 2.0:1. The average production in intensive ponds is about 5 t/ha/yr. In semi-intensive ponds, it is around 1.2 t/ha/yr. The potential for the use of aquafeeds for shrimp culture, as estimated by Hardjolukito in 1989, is shown in Table 16 and Figures 1 and 2., 101147=The demand for fish is very high and is met mainly by domestic production but partly by importing fish from neighbouring countries. Fish exports to India declined from 290 t in 1986/87 (APROSC 1989) to about 11 t in 1990/91 (MSD 1992)., 26987=Djajasewaka, H. and P. Sumpeno. 1986.

Standards for labeling include the trade mark, the nature of the feed, net weight, ingredients and nutritive content., 117028=Even before 1980, fish farming was considered to be a profession only for the fishermen caste or for farmers of low status. The government has given first priority to exploiting the waters of village ponds by adopting low cost fish culture technologies. Fish culture practices started first with the monoculture of common carp, which was followed by polyculture, in which emphasis was given to those species which thrive best on natural plankton food., 65336=UTAMA, C.M. 1993.

This is mainly because the farmers get higher market prices and better keeping quality during marketing for Indian major carps than for Chinese carps. Two groups of carps are cultivated, which have different feeding habits, namely:, 27184=Hardjolukito, S. 1989 a.

Since almost all rivers flow into the Ganga river system in India, this also enriches the fish fauna of Nepalese rivers, although there are some non-migratory fish species. 172 indigenous fish species in the various water systems were reported by Rajbanshi (1982) and 176 by Terashima (1984). These occur from a few hundred metres elevation to 4,000 m above sea level. Besides these, ten warm and coldwater fish and one prawn species have been introduced into Nepal since 1956. Exotic fish species recommended for warm water aquaculture are common carp (Cyprinus carpio), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), along with three high-value indigenous fish species, namely rohu (Labeo rohita), mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala) and catla (Catla catla)., 67380=* ponds constructed in 1990 Source: Department of Fisheries, Malaysia (1991)., 27719=Jangkaru, Z. 1981.

The Animal Feed Production and Development Committee (AFPDC), Hetauda, is operated by the public sector and is responsible for producing fish feeds, as well as cattle and popultry feeds. The total amount of fish feed No.1 (22% protein) and No.3 (16% protein) supplied to government fish farms in 1991/92 was 14 t and 95 t, respectively (Table 13). The AFPDC imported 931 t of nine types of feed ingredients and feed additives in 1991/92 from India (Table 14), out of which only some ingredients were used for the manufacturing of fish feeds., 109076=Seven fish species (all carps) are recommended by the government for polyculture.

At present, feeding regimes in semi-intensive culture are almost the same as those in intensive ones, except for feeding frequency (Table 12). The different characteristics of intensive and semi-intensive culture are shown in Table 13. Farmers operating traditional ponds usually rely on natural food and household waste products. Sometimes the farmers themselves make simple artificial feeds, such as mixtures of fine rice bran and soybean cake. Commercial feeds given in intensive freshwater aquaculture are fed at about 3 % of biomass per day. For common carp and red tilapia, feed is broadcast over the surface of the water. ON-FARM FEEDING STRATEGIES Fish farmers in Indonesia formulate their feeds using raw materials which are readily available and meet the nutrient requirements. Formulated feeds made by researchers are better than those made by farmers, because they use feed additives. For research purposes purified diets are often used. Some freshwater fish farmers, however, still prepare feed for themselves. The feed is made by means of simple equipment, such as manual meat mincers. They use easily available local raw materials, such as rice bran, cassava leaves, soybean cake, etc. These on-farm feeds are usually used for common carp, gourami and red tilapia. Currently the majority of fish farmers applying intensive technology prefer to use commercial feeds rather than to make their own feed.
