They use names which partly also have a unique identity as a brand. Some of the teams share the name with the application or the application suite they work on. These names are important for keeping the identity of the teams, but they are not marketed to end users. It is thus important to distinguish between the name of the teams and the products they produce, and to refer to the latter properly (i.e. the KDE PIM team produces Kontact). Here is a list of sub-communities/teams and their products (when appropriate) for clarification: People The term \"KDE Software Compilation\", which refers to the KDE software components released on a KDE Release Day, is used only internally for engineering purposes and should not be used for external communication. On a 'KDE Release Day', KDE releases different workspaces (Plasma Desktop, Plasma Netbook - in future Plasma Mobile and Plasma Media Center will be added), the KDE Platform, and applications, and these components should be referred to separately. Accordingly, separate official release announcements will be issued for each one of them. The KDE community does regular releases of a core set of KDE software components (technically, the KDE Software Compilation - see below). These releases should be referred to as 'KDE Release Day', thus putting the emphasis on the release event rather than on the specific software released.", "textAfterTable": "Retrieved from \" https://community.kde.org/index.php?title=Promo/Guidance/Branding/Map&oldid=41100\" This page was last modified on 10 January 2015, at 03:19.
