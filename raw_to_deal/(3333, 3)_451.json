Control Engineers find employment in a variety of industries including the automobile industry; the utility, energy and power industries; the aerospace industry; manufacturing; health care, electronics, information technology, management and, more generally, anywhere a system must work efficiently and predictably. Depending on the courses selected, completion of control systems area coursework can provide additional understanding of topics in feedback control, signal processing, differential equations, dynamics, power systems and energy conversion. Control Engineers make systems work predictably and efficiently. Improvements in many aspects of our lives depend on control systems. Examples range from room temperature control, to automobile/airplane control, to refrigerator/dishwasher control to, a large manufacturing plant or urban traffic control.
