A 2006 review by Consumer Reports, though, showed that some canned light tuna can contain mercury levels even higher than that of white tuna, and recommends that pregnant women eat no canned tuna. But the FDA stands by its current recommendations, saying that the levels are safe if tuna consumption is limited.}", "textBeforeTable": "Here are some of the most common nutrients you need and the foods that contain them: Food labels can tell you what kinds of nutrients are in the foods you eat. The letters RDA, which you find on food labeling, stand for recommended daily allowance, or the amount of a nutrient recommended for your daily diet. When you're pregnant, the RDAs for most nutrients are higher. A healthy diet includes proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and plenty of water. The U.S. government publishes dietary guidelines that can help you determine how many servings of each kind of food to eat every day. Eating a variety of foods in the proportions indicated is a good step toward staying healthy.

For example, recent research shows that folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects (including spina bifida) from occurring during the earliest stages of fetal development \u2014 so it's important to consume plenty of it before you become pregnant and during the early weeks of your pregnancy. Even though many foods, particularly breakfast cereals, are fortified with folic acid, doctors now encourage women to take folic acid supplements before and throughout pregnancy (especially for the first 28 days). Be sure to ask your doctor about folic acid if you're considering becoming pregnant. Calcium is another important nutrient. Because your growing baby's calcium demands are high, you should increase your calcium consumption to prevent a loss of calcium from your own bones. Your doctor will also likely prescribe prenatal vitamins for you, which contain some extra calcium. Your best food sources of calcium are milk and other dairy products. However, if you have lactose intolerance or dislike milk and milk products,", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
