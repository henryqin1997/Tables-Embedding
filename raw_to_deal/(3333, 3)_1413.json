Today, YouScript\u00ae makes it possible for physicians to know, before they prescribe, which medications will be most effective based on individual genetic profiles \u2013 and which ones will not. For example, a patient presenting with chronic lower back pain may relate a long history of uncontrolled pain, multiple trials of pain medications, and non-specific drug sensitivities or side effects. The patient could be a candidate for one of several FDA-approved medications, many of which carry pharmacogenetic information on their labeling (see table, below). If the patient is also being treated for one or more co-morbid conditions, or is taking herbal medicines or recreational drugs, the potential for serious drug interactions increases substantially. Prescribing can often be particularly challenging for pain management specialists since chronic pain sufferers are often being treated for other conditions such as depression, addiction or cancer. \u00a0The YouScript\u00ae Personalized Prescribing System can help prescribers \u00a0improve pain management by determining each patient\u2019s unique drug metabolizing capacity and which drugs and doses are likely to be most effective in treating their pain. Pharmacogenetics in Pain \u2013 Personalizing Pain Management Pain Psychiatry Pain Oncology", "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 YouScript Helps You Achieve Optimal Prescribing Many opioid analgesics are metabolized into a much more active metabolite by CYP2D6 or CYP3A4, and many non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are metabolized by CYP2C9. Genetic variations in these cytochromes are extremely common. This genetic variability is often the most important consideration in how an individual patient will respond to a medication. YouScript\u00ae\u00a0tests for all clinically significant genetic variants in the enzymes responsible for metabolizing the majority of medications: CYP2D6,\u00a0CYP2C9 (including VKORC1), CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. \u00a0 Back up \u00a9 1995-2014, Genelex Corporation.
