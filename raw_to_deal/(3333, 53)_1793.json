Most perennials are marked with a hardiness zone to indicate the minimum temperatures it can tolerate. Note the plant's hardiness for the best growing and ability to survive the winter. Use this table to find your area\u2019s hardiness zone: Your Landscaping Hardiness Zone Note any special conditions before purchasing plants \u2014 soil requirements, watering needs, invasiveness, smells, and messiness (especially with berries). Avoid buying plants that are rootbound or have outgrown their pots. Choose plants that are compact, healthy, and (if applicable) just starting to flower. Avoid weak, spindly, or insect-infested plants. Buy plants that, when mature, are the right height, shape, and color for the scale of your landscape. Avoid plants that don\u2019t grow well in your zone. Choose plants suited to the amount of sun, partial shade, or shade in your garden. Establish a budget before you arrive at the nursery. Plan your landscape on paper before you set out to purchase plants \u2014 you\u2019ll know exactly how much to buy. Landscape plants can be expensive \u2014 they're an investment for your home. So, when you buy plants for your yard, seek healthy plants that fit your landscaping needs, beautify your property, and grow well in your area\u2019s climate.
