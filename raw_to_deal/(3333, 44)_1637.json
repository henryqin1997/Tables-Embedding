In some cases, they represent about half your grade in the course; in others, much of the course work is yet to be completed and graded. If you have questions, be sure to check with your instructor. While midterm grades are not part of your permanent record and do not \"count\" in your semester grade point average (GPA), they are important indicators. The worst thing to do about midterms is to ignore them. Midterm grades are meant to encourage you to get in touch with others. Keeping on the same path may result in the same grades; spending more time on classes may not be enough. Your midterm grades will be available to you on-line via your\u00a0KnowHope Plus\u00a0account. You'll be able to see your midterm grades as soon as your professors enter them. Read", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 2, "headerRowIndex": 0}
