Practice Interactive Practice The graph shown above is a pie chart. The slices of the pie represents homework, music, meals, sleep, school, and work, respectively. In other words, the data that the slices of the pie stand for are not numbers. Therefore, the pie chart represents categorical, or quantitative, data. d. The graph shown above is a histogram. The horizontal axis of the histogram represents the heights of students in inches. This means that the data being counted by the histogram are numbers, so the histogram represents numerical, or quantitative, data. c. The graph shown above is a broken-line graph. As you can see from the graph, there is no break in the line. In other words, you can choose any time between 8:45 am and 12:15 pm, even one involving a fraction of a second, and there will be a corresponding distance in km.
