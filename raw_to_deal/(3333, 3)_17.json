The fundamental problem with GNIS is that it is a database of \"names\" and not \"features\" - if you want to answer the question \"where is/was Foobar School\" then GNIS will have a coordinate for that name and know that it is/was a school. Unfortunately GNIS records were imported into OSM without regard as to whether or not those features still exist, so there are tens of thousands of churches, schools, etc., that have long since disappeared - pre-dating the Interstate system in many (obvious) cases., 4014=As of 2013, roughly 5% of the features in the GNIS database are designated as historical, typically meaning those features no longer exist.

Feature Class Multiple GNIS features can be represented by a single feature in OSM. The semi-colon is most commonly used to list multiple IDs. In some cases these might be actual duplicates in the GNIS database (perhaps because the feature appears at slightly different coordinates on different maps). Sometimes these Feature IDs have leading zeroes. The online GNIS interface handles leading zeroes just fine. The Feature ID uniquely identifies a feature in the GNIS database and is thus the most important thing to tag when relating an OSM feature to a GNIS feature. The tag gnis:feature_id is by far the most commonly used for this purpose. Other tags for GNIS Feature IDs include gnis:id and tiger:PLACENS. Feature ID Tagging (In the past, you could email the GNIS administrator with improvements or to get feedback; but due to budget cuts, they no longer accept contributions to the GNIS database in this way.) The method to submit changes to GNIS data is through the National Maps Corps, via their Web-based editor.

Beware that GNIS tags often specify only one county/state per feature; if the feature crosses or forms a boundary, as many do, the GNIS tags may be insufficient to create proper is_in/addr tags.
