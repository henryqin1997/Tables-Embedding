As a result, performance dashboards resonate with users, especially executives and managers who have been searching for an intuitive way to measure, monitor and manage their organizations and groups. In the end, it doesn't matter whether you use the term dashboard or scorecard as long as the tool helps organizations get the information they need. Both dashboards and scorecards must display critical performance information on a single screen so users can monitor them at a glance and then drill down to view more information as needed. For this reason, I use the term performance dashboards to describe any application that uses a dashboard or scorecard interface. Dashboards and scorecards are visual display mechanisms within a performance management system. Many people use the terms interchangeably, but the primary difference is that dashboards are used to monitor the performance of operational processes while scorecards are used to chart the progress of tactical and strategic goals.

Performance dashboards deliver the following three layers of information that let users navigate from summary-level views of critical data to detailed views in a structured manner: Summary view: The top layer provides a customized view of a few critical metrics -- or key performance indicators -- tailored to each user's role in the organization and the processes they manage. This layer charts individual or group performance against targets and thresholds defined by managers in annual planning sessions or annual trends. Color-coding and symbols alert workers when performance is above or below targets and needs attention. In essence, this layer is where users monitor information. The dashboard, scorecard or portal interface essentially becomes a graphical exception report. Multidimensional view: Often, the first step in responding to an alert is to gather additional information. To do this, a user simply clicks on the metric or chart to drill into the next layer in the dashboard or scorecard, which lets users explore issues and trends in a free-form manner. This layer provides multidimensional analysis tools that enable users to navigate through the data by dimensions (e.g., customer, geography and time) and hierarchies (e.g., country, region, city), usually in a prescribed manner defined upfront by IT administrators. More colloquially, these point-and-click tools let users \"slice and dice,\" \"drill down or up,\" or \"pivot\" the data to view exceptions and", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
