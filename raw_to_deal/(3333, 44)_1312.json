Thus, Proto-Austronesian has the most elaborate sound system, while Proto-Polynesian has the fewest phonemes. For instance, the Hawaiian language is famous for having only 8 consonants, while Maori has only 10 consonants. This is a sharp reduction from the 25 consonants of the Proto-Austronesian language that was originally spoken in Taiwan or possibly southern China. Formosan languages \u00a7 Sound changes See also: Sound changes[edit] Ross also reconstructs the coronals somewhat differently. He believes that C S l d3 were all retroflex (respectively, /t\u0282/; /\u0282/ or /\u0283/; /\u026d/ or /\u027d/; /\u0256/), and s and L (Blust's N) were dental /s/ and /l/, as opposed to Blust's reconstruction as dental and palatal, respectively.
