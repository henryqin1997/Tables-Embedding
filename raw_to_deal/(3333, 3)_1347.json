A non-breakable Thermometer at \"chick level\" in the brooder along with this temperature guide will allow you to monitor the temperature:\u00a0 Important: The bulb / heat source should be far enough away from the edge of the box that it won't start a fire. Suspend the lamp off the ground right in the middle of the brooder. The height of the light will depend on what it takes to achieve your target temperature. It's important to position the lamp to maintain the proper temperature and yet high enough to not ignite the litter or burning the chicks. Red bulbs are preferable for a couple of reasons. Bright white light will make it harder for them to sleep. The red light is darker and provides a calmer environment. Also, it has been noted that chicks tend to peck each other when they are exposed to white light - a problem that is far less frequently seen when red bulbs are used. Also -- as a general rule, young chicks tend to do better in dark brooders. Some sort of heat source is needed to keep the chicks warm. In some instances, a heating pad underneath a fish tank or storage bin may work fine. Most, however, opt for a 250-watt infrared heat lamp / bulb to keep the chicks warm. Please ignore anyone who tells you that", "textAfterTable": "*1 If you have several chicks, the temperature can usually be a little lower as the chicks keep each other warm. Single chicks have fewer options to self-regulate. *2 - In many cases the lamp can be removed once the temperature was regulated down to 70 degrees Fahrenheit -- however, if outside temperatures are much cooler, then the lamp needs to stay on and temperatures have to be slowly reduced to be close to that of the temperature they are going to be maintained in. However, don't consider the above temperature guidelines as your only guideline. Pay close attention to how the chicks behave. Cold chicks may be huddled together underneath a heat source and may cheep loudly and insistently. In this case, you need to increase the heat in the brooder. Either lower the lamp or move the heat source closer to the chicks (not close enough to burn them though) or add another lamp. This could also mean that the box is too big and the heat gets dispersed too much. If the chicks stand apart from each other and away from the heat source, they may be too hot and could possibly suffocate. You may also observe them panting (with their beaks open). In this case, either raise the heat lamp, reduce the bulb wattage or get a bigger box. Ideally your chicks should be making contented \"peep\" noises and pursue their normal activities of", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
