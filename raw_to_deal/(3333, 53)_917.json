ALS Deputy Division Director Ben Feinberg was one of the five Berkeley Lab scientists selected for this honor. AAAS fellows, a tradition that began in 1874, are chosen by their peers for their distinguished contributions to science research, teaching, technology, or administration. Ben was elected \"for outstanding contributions to user facilities, especially the Advanced Light Source.\" Ben and the other new fellows will be recognized for their contributions at the Fellows Forum on February 16, 2008, during the AAAS Annual Meeting in Boston. See the November 16, 2007, issue of The View for a complete list of Berkeley Lab honorees., 26549=Call for general user proposals: Due January 15, 2008, 8807=Diamondoids are nanometer-sized molecules that feature diamond-crystal cage structures. Adamantane, the smallest member in the family, consists of one cage structure, diamantane two, triamantane three, tetramantane four, and so on. On all of these, the dangling bonds on the outer surfaces are terminated by hydrogen atoms. Because of their potential to possess novel properties of both diamond and nanomaterial, intensive efforts have been made to synthesize the larger diamondoid molecules, but to no avail. This situation was finally changed in 2003 when significant quantities of higher diamondoids were found in petroleum by researchers in MolecularDiamond Technologies. Now, scientists from Berkeley Lab, Stanford University, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Germany have used photoelectron spectroscopy at the ALS to reveal an intriguing feature: monochromatized electron emission from a self-assembled monolayer of diamondoids. This discovery has immediately attracted the attention of people who are searching for materials for next-generation electron emitters. Read more..., 10364=Publication about this research: W.L.

You need JavaScript enabled to view it I would like to thank the ALS users community for voting in this year's ALS Users' Executive Committee (UEC) election. Voting started slowly but ended on a strong note after a number of encouraging get-out-the-vote emails from the UEC and ALS staff. At this time, the election results are in and we will welcome four new members next year: Yves Acremann (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center); Phil Heimann (Berkeley Lab); Wayne Stolte (University of Nevada, Las Vegas); and the new student representative, Anne Sakdinawat (UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco). The newly elected members will take office for a three-year term beginning January 1, 2008. UEC vice chair Hendrik Ohldag (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) will take over as chair, and I will serve as an ex-officio UEC member in 2008.
