Continually functioning items are practically always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the character's possession (meaning on her person). However, some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation. The description of an item states whether a command word is needed in such a case.Extradimensi onal Spaces A number of spells and magic items utilize extradimensional spaces, such as rope trick, bags of holding, handy haversacks, and portable holes. These spells and magic items create a tiny pocket space that does not exist in any dimension. Such items do not function, however, inside another extradimensional space. If placed inside such a space, they cease to function until removed from the extradimensional space. For example, if a bag of holding is brought into a rope trick, the contents of the bag of holding become inaccessible until the bag of holding is taken outside the rope trick. The only exception to this is when a bag of holding and a portable hole interact, forming a rift to the Astral Plane, as noted in their descriptions. Use-Activated: This type of item merely has to be used in order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to deflect a blow, look", "textAfterTable": "17\u201328 Beneficial bandolier 1,000 gp 29\u201340 Meridian belt 1,000 gp 41\u201354 Bladed belt 2,000 gp 55\u201370 Heavyload belt 2,000 gp 71\u201384 Aquatic cummerbund 2,600 gp 85\u2013100 Equestrian belt 3,200 gp Back to Top Greater Minor Belt d% Item Price 01\u201318 Belt of giant strength +2 4,000 gp 19\u201336 Belt of incredible dexterity +2 4,000 gp 37\u201354 Belt of mighty constitution +2 4,000 gp 55\u201362 Belt of teeth 4,000 gp 63\u201374 Blinkback belt 5,000 gp 75\u201384 Plague rat belt 5,200 gp 85\u2013100 Belt of foraging 6,000 gp Back to Top Lesser Medium Belt d% Item Price 01\u201304 Serpent belt 9,000 gp 05\u201308 Monkey belt 9,400 gp 09\u201316 Belt", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
