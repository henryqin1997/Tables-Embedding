You can easily walk to this area from the campsite. Find the bridge over the stream in the campsite, cross it and walk left for about 40m until you see a small cairn next to the dirt road. Follow this path up the hill for about 100m until you get to the Teapot boulder. This boulder only looks like a teapot when standing south of it and looking towards the campsite.", "Ceder Rouge Area This large boulder can be seen near the top of the hill to the left when looking up from the Roadside Boulders. There are a few classic routes here as well as a few awesome boulder problems such as \u2018Black Eagle\u2019 and \u2018Leopard Cave\u2019. The hardest problem in SA and possibly in the world is the sitstart to Black Eagle opened by Fred Nicole! There is a path leading up from the left of the Roadside Boulders up the hill to the Cedar Rouge boulder. The bouldering is mostly behind this boulder and on the Black Eagle boulder which you pass just before you get to the Cedar Rouge boulder.", "Champside Boulders Walk along the road that crosses the stream in the campsite in a westerly direction towards Clanwilliam and back onto the main dirt road. After 100-200m look out for a big steep prow to your left with a prominent open-book on its western side.

Shortly after these areas you will see a cairn marking a path off to the right. Follow this path for about 5 minutes to another cairn positioned on the left of the path. Turn left off the path and take the easy ground up the right hand valley for about 10 minutes following cairns. Before heading left again towards the large buttress being The Fortress. A large cairn is located below 2 obvious large boulders. From here follow the smaller cairns to the top. The buldering area is behind The Fortress and off to the right slighlty.", "Roadside Boulders This area includes several good bolted routes as well as most of the best bouldering developed so far. To access the area drive from the campsite for 3km up hill towards Calvinia, this road is tarred. At the top of the hill you will see a small dirt road/track on your right. With the construction it may look like the parking but there is a little road leading off left running parallel along the main road and then off to the right. This track is about 100m long. You will see a small parking area for 3-4 cars and a gate preventing further access along the road. Follow the road by foot for about 20 minutes until you see the obvious boulders on your right at the base of the hill. There are more sport climbing areas higher up the hill in the Cedar Rouge area.", "Upper Campground Boulders This is the bouldering area above and to the left of the campsite to the south-east on a slighlty higher level. You can easily walk to this area from the campsite. Find the bridge over the stream in the campsite, cross it and walk along the dirt road, leftward (east) until you get to three small houses where the caretaker stays.
