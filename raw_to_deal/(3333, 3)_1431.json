White Hall The University of Wisconsin-Madison 600 North Park Street Madison, 37344=My experiences as an undergraduate and graduate writing tutor were among my most personally and professionally valuable. For this reason, I've always been interested not only in what writers gain when they visit the writing center but also in what student-tutors gain over time. Most studies of tutor learning\u2014such as Brad Hughes, Paula Gillespie, and Harvey Kail\u2019s work with the Peer Writing Alumni Research Project and Sue Dinitz and Jean Kiedaisch\u2019s look at \u201cTutoring Writing as Career Development\u201d\u2014utilize data from longitudinal surveys and interviews with former writing tutors. In the wake of this work, I grew curious about when the kinds of gains these longitudinal studies report might be detected. I began to collect survey data following each tutoring session, asking tutors simply to report what they learned or what was reinforced to them during their session. I\u2019ll share my own research journey as my project continues to unfold, including my experiences at the 2013 Dartmouth Summer Seminar for Composition Research, as I narrowed my research focus, coded data, and began my analysis. In its current stages, I hope my research will contribute to greater understanding of differences in the learning of veteran and newbie student-tutors and how we might use that knowledge to best train tutors and guide them in formally and informally mentoring one another., 11336=Tuesday, April 17, 2012, 5:30-7:00 PM, at the UW-Madison Writing Center\u2014the Writing Center at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, with Crystal Mueller, 33036=Thursday, October 10, 2013, 5:30-7:00 PM Room 6176 Helen C.

White Hall The Writing Center The University of Wisconsin-Madison In this colloquium, I will discuss contemporary writing instruction in Germany within the larger context of German higher education. This context is currently shaped by the so-called \u201cBologna Process,\u201d an ongoing political negotiation process that has set in motion the restructuring of almost all aspects of higher education in Europe. Partly influenced by the \u201cBologna Process,\u201d but even more built on the enthusiasm that individual faculty in Germany have for ideas of collaborative learning in writing brought from the USA, writing centers are still a relatively new phenomenon in Europe. Nevertheless, the developments in recent years are exciting. For example, at European University Viadrina in Germany the writing center opened in 2007 and quickly grew to become a vital place with a wide variety of programs. It started out of autonomous, creative writing groups for students. Sharing some findings of my PhD thesis, I will show how valuable the experience of teacherless writing groups among peers is for German students who do not have composition classes or any other explicit writing support. During the colloquium, we will have the chance to discuss the differences, advantages and disadvantages of our contexts for literacy work at colleges and universities: what can we learn from each other? What is transferable across cultures? And how can we build sustainable international collaborations among writing centers?, 17143=Listen to Crystal Mueller's experience preserving, remodeling, and rebuilding at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh Writing Center, where she became director in 2007.

White Hall The Writing Center University of Wisconsin-Madison 600 North Park Street Madison In 1997, the Writing Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison initiated a community writing assistance (CWA) program that provides free writing, vocational, and computer assistance to members of the greater Madison community. Taking UW-Madison's CWA program as an example, this colloquium will address some unique challenges that can arise when university/college writing center practices are adapted to meet local writers' needs. Our discussion will focus on work with (a) community partners, (b) writers on writing, and (c) writers beyond writing. Ultimately, we hope to interrogate the ways in which writing center best practices are--and are not--exportable to work with the community., 352=Sarah Johnson and Colleagues Director, Writing Center Madison Area Technical College Monday, April 26, 2010 6:00 - 7:30 pm Madison Area Technical College, Truax Campus 3550 Anderson Street Madison, WI, 15555=Monday, February 20, 2012, 5:30-7:00 PM Room 6176 Helen C.

During 2011-2012, I conducted 14 in-depth expert interviews with experienced writing center directors at large and small colleges and universities around the United States. Participant observations in most of these writing centers also helped me to gain a deeper understanding for the context. I transcribed the interviews and coded them combining a Grounded Theory approach (Strauss & Corbin 1996) with expert interview analysis (Meuser & Nagel 2009). To handle the extensive data that results from these methods, I have used software for qualitative data analysis (MaxQDA). This analysis will allow me, during the colloquium, to offer some initial answers to these questions: \"What contributes to the success of writing centers? What is needed to implement writing centers sustainably at a college or university? How can leaders handle the typical challenges writing centers face, like budget problems, marginalization, misconceptions, etc.?\u201d, 42581=Monday, September 22, 2014, 5:30\u20137:00 PM The Writing Center Commons 6171 Helen C.

This generation of writers\u2014multilingual, interdisciplinary, technological\u2014presents a different series of challenges to us than those upon which our known writing center practices were originally built. Whether a multilingual, interdisciplinary, technological profile describes your writing center or not, it is the world within which our students will communicate: how might our writing centers work with and prepare students who need to be flexible, creative writers\u2014and what will \u201cwriting\u201d look like for them? These questions will be addressed by looking at Writing centers have always seemed on the edge of educational change: initiating student-centered learning; meeting the writer at the point of need; using writing center knowledge for teacher development; finding early on that one-sized writing instruction doesn\u2019t fit all disciplines and contexts; discovering that non-native speakers challenge non-directive approaches; understanding that new knowledge is built on what the learner knows. Within writing centers at school, college and university levels, this knowledge was hammered and shaped into practices that first often served writing centers only, gradually crept into the larger institution, and for some, moved across the globe to affect teaching and learning practices. As a result of moving the writing center out, however, it has had to open itself to new ways of thinking about \u201cwriting\u201d and \u201ccenter.\u201d Tuesday, April 9, 2013, 5:30-7:30 PM Room 6191 in the Writing Center Helen C.
