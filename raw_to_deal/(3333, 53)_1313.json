When you live with diabetes, there\u2019s a lot to do. \u00a0Checking blood sugars. \u00a0Counting carbs. \u00a0Exercising. \u00a0Not to mention all those fun-filled doctors\u2019 appointments. \u00a0So the last time your physician or diabetes educator suggested ketone testing, it\u2019s completely understandable that your head", "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Ketones should be checked any time you experience an unexplained high blood sugar or feel ill. \u00a0In many instances, you will not be ketotic. \u00a0But sometimes you will. \u00a0Just remember that detecting ketones at the earliest possible stage allows you to fix the problem and avoid prolonged periods of high blood sugar, extreme discomfort, and possible progression to the next, more dangerous stage. \u00a0 In most cases, ketones can be eliminated by taking extra insulin (via pen or syringe) and plenty of fluids. \u00a0You should notify your doctor when ketones are present, and exercise should not be performed until the ketones clear up completely. \u00a0 Ways to Check Everyone with diabetes who uses insulin (type 1 or type 2) should have a way to test for ketones. \u00a0Ketone testing can be done by way of a urine dipstick or a fingerstick blood sample. \u00a0The urine test involves peeing on a test strip (or dipping the strip in a cup of urine) and observing the color change on the strip. \u00a0 The blood test can be performed with special ketone test strips using the Precision Xtra meter from Abbott or the NovaMax Plus meter from Nova Diabetes Care. \u00a0It is much like performing a blood sugar test, except that a ketone measurement is given. \u00a0The blood test is a better way to check for ketones because it provides a specific numerical measurement and detects ketones hours before they appear in the urine. \u00a0 \u201cPositive\u201d ketones are indicated by either", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
