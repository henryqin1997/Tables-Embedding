[5]. Table 1 lists these effects in each category as laid out by the Mayo Clinic staff. \u00a0Anxiety [4] \u00a0Short temper \u00a0Irritability \u00a0Jitters \u00a0Memory problems or forgetfulness \u00a0Lack of concentration or focus \u00a0Increased frequency of colds \u00a0Loss of appetite or overeating \u201ecomfort foods\u201f \u00a0Fatigue \u00a0Difficulty falling or staying asleep \u00a0Chest pains, rapid heart beat \u00a0Dry mouth \u00a0Upset stomach \u00a0Headaches, muscle tension, neck or back pain \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStress is a normal physical response to events that make you feel threatened or upset your balance in some way\u201d [22] When you sense danger, Dr. Palmer says the body's defences kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the \u201efight or flight\u201f reaction, or the \u201estress response\u201f. \u201cThe stress response is the body\u201fs way of protecting you. When working properly, it helps you stay focused, energetic, and alert. The stress response also helps you rise to meet challenges\u201d [22]. \u201cStress switches on brain circuits and hormones that prepare the body to protect itself in dangerous situations.\u201d [28] p. 5 \u00a0\u00a0 As people grow older they lose the emotional flexibility, to release and let go,", "textAfterTable": "\u00a0Gunas \u00a0\u00a0 The Sanskrit word guna means \u201cquality or attribute - one of three qualities of Nature (Prakruti): sattva, rajas, tamas\u201d [9] p. 10.6. Dr. David Frawley describes the relationship between Primal Nature or Prakruti and the three gunas, \u201cPrimal Nature, Prakruti, is not a homogenous substance but the seed ground of multiplicity....Prakruti holds in herself all the forms of creation which manifest through her three main qualities, the gunas of sattva, rajas, and tamas.\u201d [8] p. 27. All forms of creation include the human being and all its levels of existence. When Prakriti manifests creation \u201cthe three qualities differentiate, with sattva giving rise to the mind, rajas generating the life-force, and tamas creating form and substance through which the physical body comes into being.\u201d [8] p. 28. Before manifestation, Prakruti, the seed potential for creation, \u201cholds these three qualities in equilibrium, in which rajas and tamas are merged into sattva,\u201d [8] p. 28 because, \u201csattva is the balance of rajas and tamas, combining the energy of rajas with the stability of tamas.\u201d [7] p. 34. Dr Frawley says that all objects in the universe consist of various combinations of the three gunas and that they are the most subtle qualities of Nature that underlie matter, life and mind and help us to understand our mental and spiritual nature and how it functions.
