Supplementing with calcium may correct a deficiency. Caution: Calcium supplements should be avoided by prostate cancer patients. The malabsorption that occurs in celiac disease can lead to multiple nutritional deficiencies. The most common nutritional problems in people with celiac disease include deficiencies of essential fatty acids, iron, vitamin D, vitamin K, calcium, magnesium, and folic acid.17 Zinc malabsorption also occurs frequently in celiac disease18 and may result in zinc deficiency, even in people who are otherwise in remission.19 People with newly diagnosed celiac disease should be assessed for nutritional deficiencies by a doctor. Celiac patients who have not yet completely recovered should supplement with a high-potency multivitamin-mineral. Some patients may require even higher amounts of some of these vitamins and minerals\u2014an issue that should be discussed with their healthcare practitioner. Evidence of a nutrient deficiency in a celiac patient is a clear indication for supplementation with that nutrient. After commencement of a gluten-free diet, overall nutritional status gradually improves. However, deficiencies of some nutrients may persist, even in people who are strictly avoiding gluten. For example, magnesium deficiency was found in 8 of 23 adults with celiac disease who had been following a gluten-free diet and were symptom-free. When these adults were supplemented with magnesium for two years, their bone mineral density increased significantly.20", "Some evidence suggests that enzyme supplements may be useful at the beginning of dietary treatment for this disease. People with celiac disease often do not produce adequate digestive secretions from the pancreas, including lipase enzymes21 In a double-blind trial, children with celiac disease who received a pancreatic enzyme supplement along with a gluten-free diet gained significantly more weight in the first month than those treated with only a gluten-free diet.22 However, this benefit disappeared in the second month, suggesting enzyme supplements may only be useful at the beginning of dietary treatment.", "The malabsorption that occurs in celiac disease can lead to multiple nutritional deficiencies.

It is possible that subtle deficiencies of other nutrients may exist in people with celiac disease who are on a gluten-free diet and are in remission. People who are not strictly avoiding gluten are likely to have more severe deficiencies. Because of the complexity of this condition and the multiple nutritional factors involved, people with celiac disease should be under the care of a doctor. Some doctors may recommend use of nutritional supplements, including a high-potency multivitamin-mineral supplement, to reduce the risk of future deficiencies. No controlled trials have investigated the value of supplements in the minority of celiac disease patients who do not go into remission in response to a gluten-free diet.38", "Vitamin A deficiency may occur as a result of celiac disease, in which case vitamin A supplements or injections can be beneficial. In one study, six people with diet-treated celiac disease had abnormal dark-adaptation tests (indicative of \u201cnight blindness\u201d), even though some were taking a multivitamin that contained vitamin A. Some of these people showed an improvement in dark adaptation after receiving larger amounts of vitamin A, either orally or by injection.39 People with celiac disease should discuss the possibility of vitamin A deficiency with a healthcare practitioner before taking vitamin A supplements.", "Daily supplementation with a combination of vitamin B6 (3 mg), folic acid (0.8 mg), and vitamin B12 (0.5 mg) have been shown to help relieve depression in people with celiac disease.

However, after supplementation with vitamin B6 (80 mg per day) for six months, the depression disappeared.40 Daily supplementation with a combination of vitamin B6 (3 mg), folic acid (0.8 mg), and vitamin B12 (0.5 mg) for 6 months also improved psychological well-being in people with long-standing celiac disease who had poor psychological well-being despite being on a strict gluten-free diet.41", "Malabsorption-induced vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone weakening in people with celiac disease.

For this condition, scientific research has found benefit in the following healthy eating tips. Eating Right In one study, children who were breast-fed for less than 30 days were four times more likely to develop celiac disease, compared with children who were breast-fed for more than 30 days.1 Although this study does not prove that breast-feeding prevents the development of celiac disease, it is consistent with other research showing that breast-feeding promotes a healthier gastrointestinal tract than does formula-feeding.2 Healthy Lifestyle Tips Celiac disease may not cause symptoms in some people. However, others may have a history of frequent diarrhea; pale, foul-smelling, bulky stools; abdominal pain, gas, and bloating; weight loss; fatigue; canker sores; muscle cramps; delayed growth or short stature; bone and joint pain; seizures; painful skin rash; or infertility. Microscopic examination of the small-intestinal lining reveals severe damage, especially in the jejunum (the central portion of the small intestines). People with untreated celiac disease may eventually experience malaise and weight loss and have an increased risk of developing anemia, osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and certain types of cancer.
