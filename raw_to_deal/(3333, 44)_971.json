Cellular had a run factor of 1.05 versus the Ballpark\u2019s 1.08 in 2006. Cellular depresses singles, doubles and triples but allows more homers and walks. Translating McCarthy\u2019s statistics to Arlington increases his ERA only by about 0.05., 222744=It also refills a gigantic hole in a rotation that temporarily featured Robinson Tejeda as its #2 starter. In 2006, he rebounded from two injury-plagued seasons and career highs in strikeouts, strikeout rate, batters faced, and wins. Statistically, he doesn\u2019t do anything exceptionally well but also does nothing badly. While he\u2019s had issues both on and off the field, Ranger management presumably is satisfied with his demeanor and long-term outlook., 160020=Posted by Lucas at 12:10 PM, 250065=Posted by Lucas at 01:33 AM, 189394=Posted by Lucas at 10:26 PM, 15603=Texas DHes leapt from the worst OPS+ in the American League in 2005 to third-worst last season. Are you not suitably impressed? This next bit of information won\u2019t help. Erase Michael Young\u2019s softball line (.529/.543/.853 in seven games) and the remainder drops to \u2013 yikes -- .220/.290/.383. Remember, these are \u201cdesignated hitters.\u201d, 887=May your 2007 be safe and fulfilling., 40352=Once a well-regarded prospect, Quiroz has toiled for eight years with only 98 MLB plate appearances to his credit. He peaked statistically in 2003, batting .282/.372/.518 for AA New Haven (Toronto system), and has bounced between AAA and the Majors ever since. He did hit .304/.359/.428 for AAA Tacoma last year, and as a 25-year-old, may yet mature into a decent MLB backup. Anything that might improve upon Miguel Ojeda would be most welcome. With his signing, Texas has filled its 40-man roster., 159877=Worst: Cleveland scored 80 more runs than in 2005 in spite of Aaron Boone (.248/.311/.369) and Andy Marte (.226/.287/.421)., 196784=Through the season\u2019s first 84 games, Mark Teixeira had eight homers and a .432 slugging percentage. Afterwards, 25 and .607. Despite his posting the worst rate stats since his rookie season, Texas 1Bs finished among the top half in OBP and slugging and fourth or better in runs, homers and RBI. Which is to say, a slightly down year from Teixeira is still pretty special. He turns 27 next April and may produce the titanic season I expected in 2006. Teixeira drew twelve intentional walks last year, eighth-most in the AL. I cursorily attributed most of them to opponents wanting a desirable matchup against Hank Blalock, who followed Teixeira in the order in 71 games and batted .216/.281/.315 against lefthanders. In fact, only once did a team intentionally walk Teixeira to have a lefty face Blalock:, 950=Posted by Lucas at 08:32 PM, 160573=Posted by Lucas at 12:46 PM, 40863=The Rangers also signed pitcher Mike Wood to a minor deal after waiving him a few weeks ago. They also signed former Twin reliever Willie Eyre, who should spend most or all of 2007 regaling the Redhawk faithful with his presence., 50874=The Rangers did not keep up. They ranked next-to-last in the league in on-base percentage, last in slugging, last in runs scored, and last in walk rate. Mark DeRosa batted .295/.347/.436, mostly later in the season after he\u2019d cooled off. Now, that line compares quite favorably to DeRosa\u2019s previous output from 1998 to 2005, but as an American League right fielder in 2006, not so much. Kevin Mench basically held his ground, and Nelson Cruz had a tough rookie season., 219005=Posted by Lucas at 11:15 PM, 41105=Posted by Lucas at 09:49 PM, 807=A clock that belonged to my grandmother, who passed away last March., 219353=After a splendiferous rookie campaign in 2003, Byrd has since hit .238/.306/.345 in 850 plate appearances. He\u2019s hit well in AAA (.300/.372/.496) during the same span, but at age 29 seems an unlikely candidate for resurgence. Then again, he might be the boffo sequel to From Waiver Bait To Multi-Millionaire: The Gary Matthews Jr. Story by Rudy Jaramillo. Also, I might discover gold in the creek in my backyard., 249986=Abby the Black Lab, Fredericksburg, Texas, 24 Nov 2006, 15949=As I\u2019d mentioned in May, Nevin\u2019s everyday presence in the middle of the order was a gloomily foregone conclusion despite mounting evidence that he wouldn\u2019t perform. Texas relieved him of his duties just past the season\u2019s one-quarter mark, after which time, for the most part, the situation worsened., 162476=Opponents have batted .169/.229/.254 against him during the past five years. He had a WARP of over ten in 2003, an absolutely outrageous number for a relief pitcher. If he returns most of the way to his prior form, he could be worth five to seven wins. Gagne\u2019s presence also makes a trade of Aki Otsuka (packaged for starting pitching, presumably) more likely., 138107=Posted by Lucas at 08:39 PM, 66365=Posted by Lucas at 02:04 AM, 90060=Posted by Lucas at 11:30 PM, 138043=Fredericksburg, Texas, 25 November 2006, 89379=Posted by Lucas at 02:01 AM, 114690=Posted by Lucas at 09:33 AM, 219787=Byrd is probably 2007\u2019s version of Adrian Brown, but I wouldn\u2019t describe his signing as low-risk high-reward. There\u2019s a chance he could attain 200 plate appearances and suck, which would make him the 2007 version of Doug Glanville., 32075=Age and Level As mentioned by Adam yesterday, McCarthy isn\u2019t two years older than Danks, only seventeen months. Because ages as applied to seasons are determined by a player\u2019s age as of July 1, McCarthy is listed as two years older. Here is how McCarthy and Danks have advanced through minors in terms of age:, 188301=Posted by Lucas at 11:24 PM, 31720=Posted by Lucas at 05:39 PM, 66066=Posted by Lucas at 01:37 PM, 38706=Luck McCarthy has permitted an uncommonly low hit rate on balls in play of .252 in the Majors. The White Sox as a whole allowed a .290 average on balls in play during 2005-2006. Perhaps McCarthy has a genuine ability to depress hits, but the probability of him continuing to allow an average 48 points below his teammates is very remote. Giving him a team-average hit rate in 2006 results in ten more hits allowed and a full run added to his ERA., 39536=McCarthy has allowed zero unearned runs in 152 innings. He has a career ERA+ of 104, but his RA+ is 112. In 2006, he had a Component ERA (a Bill James creation that estimates what the pitcher\u2019s ERA \u201cshould be\u201d based on peripheral stats) of just 4.10 compared to his actual ERA of 4.68. (Note that the Component ERA does not compensate for his abnormally low hit rate on balls in play. Again, giving him a typical hit rate increases his ERA and RA by a run.), 249722=Posted by Lucas at 11:02 PM, 233720=Gerald Laird certainly outhit Barajas, but a late-season decline left him with a very ordinary OBP (even for a catcher), leaving the team among the worst in the AL in that respect. He\u2019d shown an adequate walk rate in the minors, so he has some room to improve. In essence, his thumb injury in May 2004 cost him over two years of regular play in the Majors. Remember who collided with him at home plate? Ken Harvey., 161277=Hitters Against Gagne by Plate Appearance, 2002-2006:, 73725=I\u2019d guess Gary Matthews has no more than a 10% chance of justifying his contract. That\u2019s not to diminish his outstanding final season in Texas. Center field has plagued the Rangers since the team logo was a cowboy hat perched on a baseball (see upper left). For one season, Matthews eradicated that plague with solid defense and an astonishing bat. New center fielder Kenny Lofton may outhit Matthews next year, but he won\u2019t surpass Matthews\u2019s 2006., 248909=Posted by Lucas at 12:30 PM, 233315=I\u2019m inclined to believe that if a catcher is coming off a .298 OBP (overall) and a team offers him two years and $5+ million, maybe, just maybe, he should accept it. But I\u2019m just an observer. Barajas hit 47 homers as a Ranger, about 45 more than I expected when Texas signed him to a minor-league deal in 2004. I called him \u201cTodd Greene Lite\u201d at the time and he ended up being\u2026 Todd Greene., 222070=Posted by Lucas at 12:40 PM, 40006=Posted by Lucas at 10:25 AM, 162857=Posted by Lucas at 06:14 PM, 223380=Posted by Lucas at 11:45 PM, 33917=Danks is only about a year ahead of McCarthy. McCarthy debuted in the Majors at the age of 22 years, 10 months. Danks will turn 22 next April. Minor Performance McCarthy clearly has pitched better than Danks in the minors. In addition an ERA nearly a full run lower than Danks, all the peripheral stats favor McCarthy., 223618=The Second Annual Review Of Ranger Hitters returns with positional analyses. In case you\u2019re new to the game: You probably know OPS and OPS+. If not, OPS is the sum of a player\u2019s on-base percentage and slugging percentage, and OPS+ converts that number to an index based on the league average and player\u2019s home park. 100 is always average, higher is better. I also like to display OBP+ and SLG+, which are calculated just like OPS+. OBP+ tends to vary less than SLG+. For Texas\u2019s catchers, the meaningful comparison is not how they performed relative to the league as a whole but rather the AL\u2019s other catchers. The AL batted .275/.337/.439 in 2006, while #1 hitters posted a line of .270/.330/.416. Also, The Ballpark favored hitters with a factor of 1.005 for on-base percentage and 1.020 for slugging. Thus, players hitting first for Texas need an on-base percentage of .332 and a slugging percentage of .435 to be of average quality. Regarding the \u201cAL average\u201d row in the table below, the rate stats are park-adjusted while the counting stats are simple averages. Instead of OPS+, I use P-OPS+, the \u201cP\u201d standing for \u201cposition.\u201d, 360=\u00ab November 2006 | Main | January 2007 \u00bb, 137738=Posted by Lucas at 06:31 PM, 189281=For these services, Lofton receives his biggest paycheck since 2001.

Many pitchers with good minor-league stats in aggregate have a shaky combination of outstanding stats in the low minors and mediocre performances in AA and AAA. To place more importance on higher levels, I created a weighted average, giving a lower level in the minors only two-thirds the weight of the one above it. So, AA counts two-thirds as much as AAA, high-A counts two-thirds as much as AA, etc. By the time we hit bottom, the Rookie League gets only about one-seventh the credit of AAA. Why two-thirds?
