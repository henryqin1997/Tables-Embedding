The company operates in three segments: Civil Aviation Training Solutions, Defence and Security, and Healthcare. The Civil Aviation Training Solutions segment provides training solutions for flight, cabin, maintenance, and ground personnel in commercial, business, and helicopter aviation; and a range of ab initio pilot training and crew sourcing services, as well as curriculum development, courseware solutions, and consulting services. It also develops civil flight simulation equipment, including full-flight simulators, integrated procedures trainers, flight training devices, and training tools, such as software, courses, and training aids. This segment serves aircraft manufacturers, commercial airlines, regional airlines, business aircraft operators, civil helicopter operators, third-party training centers, flight training organizations, maintenance repair and overhaul organizations, and aircraft finance leasing companies. The Defence and Security segment offers integrated virtual flight training solutions; simulation products and training systems; training support services comprising contractor logistics support, maintenance services, classroom instruction, and simulator training; and modeling and simulation-based professional services consisting of systems engineering and lifecycle management. This segment serves defense forces, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), land and naval forces, and government and civil security organizations. The Healthcare segment provides simulators, simulation center management solutions, and courseware for hospital and university simulation centers, medical and nursing schools, paramedic organizations, defense forces, medical societies, and OEMs. The company was formerly known as CAE Industries Ltd. and changed its name to CAE Inc. in June 1993. CAE Inc. was founded in 1947 and is headquartered in Saint-Laurent, Canada., 14751=CAE Inc. has won a contract from The Boeing Company to develop simulator hardware for four additional P-8A Poseidon operational flight trainers, or OFTs, for the US Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force, or RAAF. Two of the P-8A OFTs are for the US Navy, which will bring the Navy's total to 18 P-8A OFTs. The other two P-8A OFTs are part of a US Cooperative Program via the P-8 Production, Sustainment, and Follow-On Development Memorandum of Understanding (PSDF MOU) with the US Navy to provide the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) with a comprehensive P-8A training system. The contract for the two RAAF P-8A OFTs was signed in CAE's fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 and included in the value of contracts announced on April 8, 2015. The contract for the two US Navy P-8A OFTs was signed in CAE's first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The P-8A OFTs for the RAAF will be similar to the P-8A OFTs that CAE is already developing for Boeing for delivery to the US Navy. CAE designs and manufactures the P-8A OFT hardware to Level D standards, the high qualification for flight simulators. CAE also provides the 737-800 OFT software baseline and simulation-based software lab environment that is used for P-8A OFT development and integration tasks. CAE then delivers the simulators to Boeing, who installs and integrates software specific to the P-8A aircraft. The Navy has significantly increased the amount of synthetic training it does as part of the P-8A training program, and the high-fidelity P-8A operational flight trainers developed by CAE and Boeing play a key role in the overall P-8A training curriculum. The two P-8A OFTs for the RAAF are scheduled for delivery to RAAF Base Edinburgh in late 2017. The two additional P-8A OFTs for the US Navy are scheduled for delivery to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in 2017. The P-8A Poseidon is a new long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft currently being developed for the US Navy by prime contractor Boeing. The P-8A is a derivative of Boeing's next-generation 737-800 aircraft and is used for maritime and littoral operations. The US Navy's warfighting requirement is 117 P-8A aircraft, and these aircraft are replacing the US Navy's current fleet of P-3C Orion aircraft.}", "textBeforeTable": "Industry Average CAE Industry Analysis \u00a0 // ]]> } document.write(BW_adsys('Right3')); if (window.BW_adsys) { // <script type=\"text/javascript\"> <div class=\"\" style=\"width:300px; margin: auto; \"> <div class=\"ad\"> </div> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td class=\"noDataRR\" style=\"border:none;\" colspan=\"3\"><a class=\"link_xs\" href=\"../../sectorandindustry/industries/industrydetail.asp?code=201010\">View Industry Companies</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"posData\">+0.01</span></td> <td align=\"right\">$5.43 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">USD</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=KTOS:US\">Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Inc</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"negData\">-0.268</span></td> <td align=\"right\">\u20ac9.81 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">EUR</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=IDR:SM\">Indra Sistemas SA</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"negData\">-0.07</span></td> <td align=\"right\">$36.54 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">USD</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=ICFI:US\">ICF International Inc</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"negData\">-0.02</span></td> <td align=\"right\">$53.87 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">USD</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=HEI:US\">HEICO Corp</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"posData\">+0.32</span></td> <td align=\"right\">$21.48 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">USD</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=EGL:US\">Engility Holdings Inc</a></td> <tr> <tbody> </thead> </tr> <td width=\"50\" align=\"right\">Change</td> <td width=\"75\" align=\"right\">Last</td> <td>Company</td> <tr> <thead> <table class=\"colRight\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"> <div class=\"clear\"></div> </div> <p class=\"note fLeft\" style=\"width:64%; text-align: right; padding: 5px 0; border-top: 3px solid #6B7B84; margin-top: 20px;\">Market data is delayed at least 15 minutes.</p> <h2 class=\"sectionTitle fLeft\" style=\"width: 35%; border-bottom: 0;\">CAE Competitors</h2> <div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; overflow: hidden;\"> <div class=\"\"> </div> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td width=\"75\" align=\"right\" class=\"noBorder\"><img src=\"/cgi-bin/upload.dll/file.png?z06ae100azaf61c2a35750460c92e0068671b7150a\" width=\"60\" height=\"15\" galleryimg=\"no\" symbol=\"CA;CAE\" /></td> <td align=\"right\" width=\"45\" class=\"noBorder\"><span class=\"posData\">+0.17</span></td> <td align=\"right\"", "textAfterTable": "View Detailed CAE Financials \u00a0|\u00a0 View Sector Analysis Sponsored Financial Commentaries Sponsored Links Browse Companies A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z \u00a0|\u00a0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Report Data Issue To contact CAE INC, please visit www.cae.com.
