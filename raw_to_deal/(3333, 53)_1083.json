The GetFields method does not return fields in a particular order, such as alphabetical or declaration order. Your code must not depend on the order in which fields are returned, because that order varies. Remarks _Type.GetFields() Implements An array of FieldInfo objects representing all the public fields defined for the current Type. -or- An empty array of type FieldInfo, if no public fields are defined for the current Type.

This is a binary comparison. For reflection, properties and events are hide-by-name-and-signature. If you have a property with both a get and a set accessor in the base class, but the derived class has only a get accessor, the derived class property hides the base class property, and you will not be able to access the setter on the base class. Custom attributes are not part of the common type system. If the current Type represents a constructed generic type, this method returns the FieldInfo objects with the type parameters replaced by the appropriate type arguments. If the current Type represents a type parameter in the definition of a generic type or generic method, this method searches the public fields of the class constraint.
