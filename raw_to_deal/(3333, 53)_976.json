Lenovo memory specifications are integrated into the light path diagnostics for immediate system performance feedback and optimum system uptime. From a service and support standpoint, Lenovo memory automatically assumes the system warranty, and Lenovo provides service and support worldwide. The x3950 X6 supports DDR3 memory operating at speeds up to 1600 MHz. The server supports up to 192 DIMMs when all eight processors are installed, 24 DIMMs per processor. Each processor has four memory channels that are implemented using Scalable Memory Interface generation 2 (SMI2) chips, and the server implements three DIMMs per channel. The processor and the corresponding memory DIMM slots are on the Compute Book. The following table lists the memory options that are available for x3950 X6. Table 5. Memory options, 159111=External disk storage expansion The server supports attachment to external storage expansion enclosures, such as the EXP2500 series, by using the ServeRAID M5120 SAS/SATA Controller. The server can also be attached to supported external storage systems, such as the IBM DS3500 series, by using a supported HBA (see the earlier \"Storage HBA\" section).
