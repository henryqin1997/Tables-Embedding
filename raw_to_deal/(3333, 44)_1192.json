The independently adjudicated data from the CE Mark study were presented. Among the outcomes reported from the study, transfemoral SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was associated with a disabling stroke rate of 1.1%. In addition, only 2% of patients had moderate paravalvular leaks and there were no reports of severe leaks. There were also no observations of structural valve deterioration. \"The one-year survival rate in the transfemoral cohort is the high reported in a multicenter, fully adjudicated TAVR study to date. These results set a new standard of care for patients at high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. The results of the SAPIEN 3 trial via the transfemoral approach also raise the question of whether transcatheter valve replacement should be considered for approval for all elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis\u2019. The SAPIEN 3 Trial is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study. The one-year analysis documented outcomes of the first 150 patients treated with the SAPIEN 3 valve between Jan. 2013 and Nov. 2013 at 16 centers in Europe and Canada. Access approaches included transfemoral (n=96) and transapical/transaortic (n=54), as determined by the Heart Team. At baseline, the patients in the alternative access group were significantly sicker than the transfemoral group. All-cause mortality in the alternative access group was reported as 24.3% in the as-treated population. The SAPIEN 3 Trial is designed to evaluate patients annually for five years. The SAPIEN 3 valve can be delivered through a low-profile 14 French expandable sheath (eSheath). It also has an outer skirt - a cuff of fabric that provides a seal at the bottom of the frame that is designed to reduce paravalvular aortic regurgitation., 16259=Edwards Lifesciences Corp.
