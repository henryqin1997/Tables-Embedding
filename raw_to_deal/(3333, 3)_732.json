It is based on the migration steps described in the previous section. Deciding on Automatic or Manual Migration To avoid unforeseen problems with the migration, these steps should be performed in the order listed above. In certain cases, you can automate some or all of these steps, using the dsmig command. The following section indicates what can be automated and what must be done manually, depending on your existing deployment.
