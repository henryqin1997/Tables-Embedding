This provides a way to describe the language used for the content of the element. The DCMES provides a Language element which is used to describe the language of the resource. 2.5. Language and character encoding </rdf:Description> <dc:description>A painting by ...</dc:description> <dc:title>The Mona Lisa</dc:title> <rdf:Description>  It may be that there is no identifier for the resource, in which case neither of the above methods should be used and both the about attribute and Identifier element left out. This is used something like this: </rdf:Description> <dc:identifier>ISBN 0333776267</dc:identifier> <dc:format>Book</dc:format> <dc:creator>Duncan Langford</dc:creator> <dc:title>Internet Ethics</dc:title> <rdf:Description>  There may be more than one Identifier element for the resource containing URIs or other identifiers. If a URI identifier is available and appropriate to use, it should be made the value of the about attribute of the rdf:Description element as described above. The other Identifier element values should be encoded in the same manner as the other elements as described below. Here is a fragment of a description of a book which has a non-URI identifier: </rdf:Description> <dc:source rdf:resource=\"http://.../\"/> <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://..../\">  If the value of the Dublin Core element is a resource", "textAfterTable": "Note that the &apos; and &quot; only need to be used for those character inside attribute values, which are only needed for the rdf:resource attribute (see Section 2.4) and the xml:lang attribute (see Section 2.5).

Numeric entities for the characters should be used which are written as &#ddd; in decimal or &#xABC; in hexadecimal. Alternatively they can be encoded as Unicode in one of the formats such as UTF-8 which is widely supported. 2.6.
