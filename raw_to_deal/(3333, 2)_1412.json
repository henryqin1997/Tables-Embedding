You can view and search log files using Fusion Middleware Control or you can download a log file to your local client and view the log files using another tool. You can also list, view, and search log files using the WLST command-line tool. This section covers the following topics: Viewing Log Files and Their Messages Searching Log Files Downloading Log Files Note the following about using the WLST commands to view the log files: To use the custom WLST logging commands, you must invoke the WLST script from the Oracle Common home. See Section 3.5.1.1 for more information. The log viewing commands work whether you are connected or not connected to a WebLogic server. If you are not connected, you must specify the path in the oracleInstance parameter. You specify either the WebLogic domain home, or the Oracle instance. Most of the WLST logging commands require that you are running in the domainRuntime tree. For example, to connect and to run in the domainRuntime tree, use the following commands:  ./wlst.sh connect('username', 'password', 'localhost:port_number') domainRuntime() See Also: \"Logging", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
