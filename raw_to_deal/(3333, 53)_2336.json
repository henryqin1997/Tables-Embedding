The difference in cost between the buy and sell price is the spread cost. When you trade through a broker in the market FOREX, we will always see a difference in the buy and sell prices of a currency.\u00a0 Brokers are compensated through their trading through this spread cost. For example, the quotation for EUR is 1.2700/1.2705.\u00a0 This means that the broker is currently willing to buy the euro against the U.S. dollar for 1.2700, and sell it back for 1.2705, for a difference of 5 points (0.0005). This spread of 5 pips is what the broker is paid., 319867=\u00a9 1997\u20132015, Forex Club, 89427=\u2022 Leverage in general - is related directly with the amount of volume that a traders wishes to expose to the markets. \u2022 Maximum leverage - All traders should be aware of what is at stake when employing the maximum leverage provided.

To mitigate this effect, the transaction balance will be decreased by this value, with the difference in contract prices debited from the buyer\u2019s account ($0.37 per barrel)., 123960=Order is the command to the dealer to carry out this operation for sale of foreign currency. There are two types of orders; stop-loss and take-profit.\u00a0 It's easy to distinguish between the two orders.\u00a0 Both orders are defined in relation to the price at the time they are placed.\u00a0 Stop-loss positions are placed above current price levels when a trader shorts a position and below current levels when a trader longs a position. In addition, depending on the purpose of order, it can be classified as simple, one cancels other or if done. - Simple order This order is used to enter or exit a position at a specified price.\u00a0 This specified price must be no closer than 10 pips away from the current price. Because we always sell at the price bid, and buy for the price ask, then, respectively, a order to purchase shall be placed no closer than 10 points from the price ask, as a order for the sale of the price bid. One Cancels Other order OCO orders incorporate a combination of take-profit and stop-loss orders. Once market price hits a certain level, the other order will automatically be canceled. If Done order Much like its name suggests, orders will be initiated only if price has hit a certain level.\u00a0 If Done orders are used when a trader opens two or more positions on the same currency pair.\u00a0 Unlike OCO, which cancels all pending orders the moment one is hit, If Done orders remain on the market. - Duration of orders There is no time limit to how long an order will remain active. The order will remain in the market until market prices have moved to a point that will merit its execution, or to until its canceled. Therefore, do not forget to cancel any orders immediately after the closing position, and always wait for confirmation from the dealer or platform. Order going to be served at a time when the market reaches the price in the order. It is important not to forget that a order of sale is executed at the price bid, and a warrant to purchase at a price ask. This must be taken into account by checking the correct execution of the warrant in Rumus, which displays only the price bid. That is, if you have a warrant Stop / Loss for purchase at a price of 1.2050, it will be executed when the schedule reaches the price 1.2045. Please Note: Graphs are always the price bid, and the price ask = bid + spread price. In a quiet market, the time of execution of the order as a rule, should be no more than 15 seconds. The maximum delay in the execution of orders is possible in the time of important economic data, when the market flies high number of points for one - two quotes, and is subject to the execution of an avalanche of orders. However, the most automated, and the time delay does not exceed 1-2 minutes.
