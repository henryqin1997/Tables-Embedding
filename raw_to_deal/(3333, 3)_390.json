An important document developed for this purpose was a \"Preliminary List of German Cloaks in Switzerland.\" This report included a list of five important Swiss banking firms which actively helped Germany be concealing its assets, assisting in then expansion of its holding companies, and disguising its foreign accounts. (Note 26) The covering memorandum to the report, dated January 1, 1945, stated that \"these lists contain only partial information, although they are based on a careful study of intercepts, they do not cover all the activities of those banks. Yet they indicate the tremendous amount of such assistance given by the Swiss to the enemy. This assistance which served to finance the enemy's purchases of critical war material has become less important at the present stage of the war. However, it should serve at this time to demonstrate to the Swiss the extent of the damage they have done to the Allied war effort in the past.\" \"In addition,\" the memorandum continues, \" it should be pointed out that their aid to the enemy in the banking field was clearly beyond the obligations under which a neutral must continue trade with a belligerent and dictated solely by the profit motive of the Swiss banks.\" The memorandum concludes by stating \"The Swiss should make up for this undue amount of aid given to the enemy, which we have not interfered with up to the present time, by full compliance with our Safe haven objectives and other remaining financial warfare objectives.\" (Note 27), 32162=Historical File on the Office of Economic Warfare and Predecessor Agencies 1941-1943 (Entry 150), 4883=Classified Subject File July 1940-June 1942 (Entry 97), 36160=Boxes 930-930C Budget Materials 1941-1946 (Entry 155), 72806=Intelligence Memoranda of the Italian Division 1944-1945 (Entry 179) Boxes 1-3, 7287=By an Executive order of July 15, 943, the Office of Economic Warfare, headed by a Director, Leo T.

The Division had its origins in pre-war 1941, when it was discovered that it would be necessary to gather information on the economic resources of Japan for the administration of export control. After December 7, 1941, the Board of Economic Warfare established Analysis Sections and Intelligence Sections on geographical lines, the purpose being to procure economic data for the armed forces and for other United States and Allied Governmental agencies., 97867=The Enemy Branch was responsible for planning the economic program to be put into effect when the enemy countries should be occupied. It prepared studies and reports for the industrial disarmament of the enemy to prevent future wars, including analyses of the entire economic structure of the Axis countries. The Enemy Branch was established on December 30, 1944, with the name the German and Austrian Branch; a name change was shortly forthcoming. It had a leading role in the Safehaven Program. When it was established and responsibility placed in it for Safehaven activities, the External Security, Intelligence Service, and other staff which hitherto had been independent divisions, were made part of it. In addition, the Branch included personnel from the old independent divisions which had been involved in Safehaven operations. Thus in the beginning of 1945 the Enemy Branch, under the direction of Henry H.

In its Blockade Enforcement Manual, June 1943, the Division stated \"the Axis can finance smuggling in Latin America in two specific ways. In the first place it can use funds already in existence in Latin America, and in the second place it can transmit new or additional funds for that purpose. There are still a considerable number of German and other Axis corporations, German and Italian Banks, Axis nationals and their sympathizers in Latin America with large funds built up before the war, which can be put to use to finance smuggling and other activities beneficial to the Axis. In addition Axis corporations in Latin America which are producing profits can make new funds continuously available so that the investments do not need to be liquidated. Because many Axis funds are cloaked so that they cannot readily be discovered, no estimate of their size is possible. A number of Axis banks are still operating in Buenos Aires such as the Banco de Napoli and the Banco Aleman Transatlantica, but their activities seem to be rather limited. New or additional funds can be transferred from the Axis to South American agents. The axis can remit funds directly to the Argentine, or can use European neutral countries which in turn remit funds to all countries in Latin America. These remittances are not met simply through the exchange of marks for local currency, because these countries rarely wish to invest in marks. Therefore new funds have to be remitted by the Axis to Latin America in the form of goods, coins, stamps, dollar notes, and securities.\" (Note 30), 27449=File of William Lonsdale Taylor, Chief 1943-1946 (Entry 143), 3076=On December 17, 1941, the Economic Defense Board became, by a change of name, the Board of Economic Warfare. For about four months thereafter there were no major changes in the functions and no significant changes in administrative organization. By an Executive order of April 13, 1942, however, the Board's powers. which hitherto had been limited chiefly to the control of exports, were significantly increased by giving to the Board a large measure of control over imports. It was also directed to \"represent the United States Government in dealing with the economic warfare agencies of the United Nations for the purpose of relating the Government's economic warfare program and facilities regarding the importation of strategic and critical materials., 102634=The Division was also involved in efforts to stop Germany's smuggling efforts. As the blockade became increasingly successful during the course of the war, and as Germany's supplies grew thinner, it had recourse to smuggling. Smuggling to Germany of easily concealed strategic items and materials increased during 1942 and 1943, alerting both the United States and Great Britain and causing them to take steps to destroy illicit trade between the enemy and the neutrals. In the summer of 1943 the United States Government became so concerned over the problem that through the Department of State the Blockade Committee in London was urged to recommend to the British that through searches of vessels bound from Argentina to neutral European ports be instituted. The United States Navy concurred in this recommendation., 21443=Geographic File of the Administrator January 1942-October 1945 (Entry 129), 74817=In 1944 through V. Frank Coe and L.
