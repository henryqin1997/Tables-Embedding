For an example of a custom Logger, see http://git.eclipse.org/c/jetty/org.eclipse.jetty.project.git/tree/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/log/JavaUtilLog.java If no logger implementation specified, then default to org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.StdErrLog If the class org.slf4j.Logger exists in server classpath, then the jetty implementation becomes org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.Slf4jLog If property org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.class is defined, load the class it defines as the Logger implementation from the server classpath Determine the Log implementation. Then from the System.getProperties() First from a Classpath Resource called jetty-logging.properties (if found) Load Properties The Jetty logging layer is configured via the org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.Log class and follows these rules.
