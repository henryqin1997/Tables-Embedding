Class. Upper Level Writing Requirement In view of the fact that lawyers and other members of the legal profession are commonly called upon to communicate their expertise in writing, the faculty of the Michigan State University College of Law has instituted an upper level writing requirement (the ULWR) in order to assure that every student who graduates from this law school will have had the experience of researching, analyzing and writing about legal issues on a more sophisticated and in-depth level than is generally possible during the first year of law school. The benefits of the ULWR are twofold. Each College student will not only acquire enhanced research, analytical and writing skills, but also will produce a paper that may be used as a writing sample for job interviews and/or that may improve the student's credentials if the paper is published in a law review or bar journal. Detailed information regarding the ULWR can be found in the MSU Law Student Handbook.
