RS232 was introduced in 1962. The standard evolved over the years and had the third revision in 1969 (RS-232C). The fourth revision was in 1987(RS-232D also known as EIA-232D).

The most important difference between these types of devices is that the DCE device supplies the clock signal that paces the communications on the bus. All DTE-DCE cables are straight through, the pins are connected one to one. DTE-DTE and DCE-DCE cables are cross cables. DTE - DCE is called a 'Straight Cable' DTE - DTE is called a 'Null-Modem Cable' DCE - DCE is called a 'Tail Circuit Cable' DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) devices are: computers, terminals, printers, CSU/DSU, Multiplexers. DCE (Data Communications Equipment) devices are: modems and other equipment. Hubs and Routers could be either DTE or DCE. The Data Terminal Equipment -DTE- (e.g. regular computer) is normally equipped with a male D-Sub connector, Data Communications Equipment -DCE- equipment with a female connector. This difference determines, which signal a device expects on which pin. Any device is configured as either a DTE or a DCE device. Cables between DTE and DCE are different from cables between DCE and DCE devices. The connector is a 25-pin D-Sub connector (for possible synchronous communications), or a 9-pin D-Sub connector (the subset for asynchronous communications).
