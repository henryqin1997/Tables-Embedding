Proponents of this view, who include some members of the panel that drafted a now-superseded 1997 report on vitamin D from the IOM, contend the IOM's warning about serum concentrations above 50\u00a0ng/ml lacks biological plausibility. They suggest, for some people, reducing the risk of preventable disease requires a higher level of vitamin D than that recommended by the IOM.[143][144], 43170=The effects of vitamin D supplementation on health are uncertain.[6][61] A 2013 review did not find any effect from supplementation on the rates of disease, other than a tentative decrease in mortality in the elderly.[62] Low vitamin D levels may result from disease rather than cause disease.[62], 52664=A 2014 review found that supplements had no significant effect on cancer risk.[9] Another review suggested that vitamin D3 may slightly decrease the risk of death from cancer (one fewer death in 150 people over 5 years), but concerns with the quality of the data were noted.[80], 118384=By visual assessment or using a chromometer, no significant discoloration of irradiated mushrooms, as measured by the degree of \"whiteness\", was observed.[162] Claims have been made that a normal serving (approx. 3 oz or 1/2 cup, or 60 grams) of fresh mushrooms treated with ultraviolet light have increased vitamin D content to levels up to 80 micrograms or 2700 IU if exposed to just 5 minutes of UV light after being harvested.[158], 90780=In 1925,[4] it was established that when 7-dehydrocholesterol is irradiated with light, a form of a fat-soluble vitamin is produced (now known as D3). Alfred Fabian Hess stated, \"light equals vitamin D.\"[124] Adolf Windaus, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928 for his work on the constitution of sterols and their connection with vitamins.[125] In 1929, a group at NIMR in Hampstead, London, were working on the structure of vitamin D, which was still unknown, as well as the structure of steroids. A meeting took place with J.B.S. Haldane, J.D. Bernal and Dorothy Crowfoot to discuss possible structures, which contributed to bringing a team together. X-ray crystallography demonstrated the sterol molecules were flat, not as proposed by the German team led by Windaus. In 1932, Otto Rosenheim and Harold King published a paper putting forward structures for sterols and bile acids which found immediate acceptance.[126] The informal academic collaboration between the team members Robert Benedict Bourdillon, Otto Rosenheim, Harold King, and Kenneth Callow was very productive and led to the isolation and characterization of vitamin D.[127] At this time, the policy of the Medical Research Council was not to patent discoveries, believing the results of medical research should be open to everybody. In the 1930s, Windaus clarified further the chemical structure of vitamin D.[128], 100741=The recommended daily amount for vitamin D in the European Union is 5\u00a0\u00b5g.[139] In 2012, the German Society for Nutrition, a private organisation, increased the recommended daily amount to 20\u00a0\u00b5g.[140], 24878=Rickets, a childhood disease, is characterized by impeded growth and soft, weak, deformed long bones that bend and bow under their weight as children start to walk. This condition is characterized by bow legs,[23] which can be caused by calcium or phosphorus deficiency, as well as a lack of vitamin D; today, it is largely found in low-income countries in Africa, Asia, or the Middle East[24] and in those with genetic disorders such as pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets.[25] Rickets was first described in 1650 by Francis Glisson, who said it had first appeared about 30 years previously in the counties of Dorset and Somerset.[26] In 1857, John Snow suggested rickets, then widespread in Britain, was being caused by the adulteration of bakers' bread with alum.[27] The role of diet in the development of rickets[28][29] was determined by Edward Mellanby between 1918\u20131920.[30] Nutritional rickets exists in countries with intense year-round sunlight such as Nigeria and can occur without vitamin D deficiency.[31][32] Although rickets and osteomalacia are now rare in Britain, outbreaks have happened in some immigrant communities in which osteomalacia sufferers included women with seemingly adequate daylight outdoor exposure wearing Western clothing.[33] Having darker skin and reduced exposure to sunshine did not produce rickets unless the diet deviated from a Western omnivore pattern characterized by high intakes of meat, fish, and eggs, and low intakes of high-extraction cereals.[34][35][36] The dietary risk factors for rickets include abstaining from animal foods.[33][37] Vitamin D deficiency remains the main cause of rickets among young infants in most countries, because breast milk is low in vitamin D and social customs and climatic conditions can prevent adequate sun exposure. In sunny countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Bangladesh, where the disease occurs among older toddlers and children, it has been attributed to low dietary calcium intakes, which are characteristic of cereal-based diets with limited access to dairy products.[36] Rickets was formerly a major public health problem among the US population; in Denver, where ultraviolet rays are about 20% stronger than at sea level on the same latitude,[38] almost two-thirds of 500 children had mild rickets in the late 1920s.[39] An increase in the proportion of animal protein[37][40] in the 20th century American diet coupled with increased consumption of milk[41][42] fortified with relatively small quantities of vitamin D coincided with a dramatic decline in the number of rickets cases.[43] Also, in the United States and Canada, vitamin D-fortified milk, infant vitamin supplements, and vitamin supplements have helped to eradicate the majority of cases of rickets for children with fat malabsorption conditions.[23], 105853=The dietary reference intake for vitamin D issued by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 2010 superseded a previous recommendation which had adequate intake status. The recommendations were formed assuming the individual has no skin synthesis of vitamin D because of inadequate sun exposure. The reference intake for vitamin D refers to total intake from food, beverages and supplements, is intended for the North American population, and assumes that calcium requirements are being met.[7]:5, 89202=American researchers Elmer McCollum and Marguerite Davis in 1914[4] discovered a substance in cod liver oil which later was called \"vitamin A\". British doctor Edward Mellanby noticed dogs that were fed cod liver oil did not develop rickets and concluded vitamin A, or a closely associated factor, could prevent the disease. In 1922, Elmer McCollum tested modified cod liver oil in which the vitamin A had been destroyed.[4] The modified oil cured the sick dogs, so McCollum concluded the factor in cod liver oil which cured rickets was distinct from vitamin A. He called it vitamin D because it was the fourth vitamin to be named.[121][122][123] It was not initially realized that, unlike other vitamins, vitamin D can be synthesised by humans through exposure to UV light., 37832=Hypercalcemia is a strong indication of vitamin D toxicity, noted with an increase in urination and thirst. If hypercalcemia is not treated, it results in excess deposits of calcium in soft tissues and organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart, resulting in pain and organ damage.[20][23][44] Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult a doctor before taking a vitamin D supplement. The FDA advised manufacturers of liquid vitamin D supplements that droppers accompanying these products should be clearly and accurately marked for 400 international units (IU). In addition, for products intended for infants, the FDA recommends the dropper hold no more than 400 IU.[59] For infants (birth to 12 months), the tolerable upper limit (maximum amount that can be tolerated without harm) is set at 25\u00a0\u03bcg/day (1,000\u00a0IU). One thousand micrograms per day in infants has produced toxicity within one month.[56] After being commissioned by the Canadian and American governments, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) as of 30 November 2010[update], has increased the tolerable upper limit (UL) to 2,500\u00a0IU per day for ages 1\u20133 years, 3,000\u00a0IU per day for ages 4\u20138 years and 4,000\u00a0IU per day for ages 9\u201371+ years (including pregnant or lactating women).[7], 93780=In 1923, American biochemist Harry Steenbock at the University of Wisconsin demonstrated that irradiation by ultraviolet light increased the vitamin D content of foods and other organic materials.[129] After irradiating rodent food, Steenbock discovered the rodents were cured of rickets. A vitamin D deficiency is a known cause of rickets. Using $300 of his own money, Steenbock patented his invention. His irradiation technique was used for foodstuffs, most memorably for milk. By the expiration of his patent in 1945, rickets had been all but eliminated in the US.[130], 21140=Several forms (vitamers) of vitamin D exist. The two major forms are vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol, and vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol; vitamin D without a subscript refers to either D2 or D3 or both. These are known collectively as calciferol.[15] Vitamin D2 was chemically characterized in 1931. In 1935, the chemical structure of vitamin D3 was established and proven to result from the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol.[16]}", "lastModified": "Tue, 04 Aug 2015 21:06:12 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Types[edit] 10 External links 9 Further reading 8 References 7.4 Effects of cooking 7.3 Industrial production 7.2 Vitamin D3 7.1 Vitamin D2 7 Dietary sources 6.3 Allowable health claims 6.2.1 Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 6.2 Upper intake levels 6.1.4 United States 6.1.3 European Union 6.1.2 Canada 6.1.1 Australia and New Zealand 6.1 Dietary reference intakes 6 Guidelines 5 History 4.3 Biological activity 4.2.3.1 Sunscreen 4.2.3 Synthesis in the skin 4.2.2 Evolution 4.2.1 Photochemistry 4.2 Biosynthesis 4.1 Metabolic activation 4 Mechanism of action", "textAfterTable": "Several forms (vitamers) of vitamin D exist.

In 1935, the chemical structure of vitamin D3 was established and proven to result from the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol.[16] Chemically, the various forms of vitamin D are secosteroids, i.e., steroids in which one of the bonds in the steroid rings is broken.[16] The structural difference between vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 is the side chain of D2 contains a double bond between carbons 22 and 23, and a methyl group on carbon 24. Deficiency[edit] Main article: Hypovitaminosis D A diet deficient in vitamin D in conjunction with inadequate sun exposure causes osteomalacia (or rickets when it occurs in children), which is a softening of the bones. In the developed world, this is a rare disease.[17][18] However, vitamin D deficiency has become a worldwide issue in the elderly and remains common in children and adults.[19][20] Low blood calcidiol (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) can result from avoiding the sun.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
