Thanks and Regards, Jayakumar, 319066=Dear Suresh, I am one of regular readers of your blog. Today when I was reading your article about the Joins (http://www.aspdotnet-suresh.com/2011/12/different-types-of-joins-in-sql-server.html) I noticed that in the explanation of Full Outer Join you have given correct syntax but in the example there is mistake . Your syntax is: SELECT Column_List FROM table_name1 t1 FULL OUTER JOIN table_name2 t2 ON t1.column_name=t2.column_name and Example is: SELECT u.UserID,u.UserName,o.OrderNo FROM UserDetails u RIGHT OUTER JOIN OrderDetails o ON u.UserID=o.UserID so instead of using Full Outer Join you have specified Right Outer Join. Please correct the above mentioned mistake. Thanks & Regards: Manish Kumar}", "lastModified": "Tue, 04 Aug 2015 18:50:18 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Create one table with primary key and give name as \u201cUserDetails\u201d Before enter into Joins concept first design two tables in database and enter data like as shown below In SQL joins are used to get data from two or more tables based on relationship between some of the columns in tables.
