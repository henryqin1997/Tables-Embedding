Depending on the browser, if the same access key is assigned to two or more go components on a page, the browser may activate the first component instead of cycling through the components that are accessed by the same key. The same access key can be bound to several components. If the same access key appears in multiple locations in the same page, the rendering agent will cycle among the components accessed by the same key.

When simultaneously setting the text, label, or value and mnemonic character, use the ampersand (&) character in front of the mnemonic character in the relevant attribute field. Use one of four attributes to specify a keyboard character for an ADF Faces input or command and go component: accessKey: Use to set the mnemonic character used to gain quick access to the component. For command and go components, the character specified by this attribute must exist in the text attribute of the instance component; otherwise, ADF Faces does not display the visual indication that the component has an access key. Example 22-1 shows the code that sets the access key to the letter h for the af:goLink component. When the user presses the keys ALT+H, the text value of the component will be brought into focus. Example 22-1 AccessKey Attribute Defined  <af:goLink text=\"Home\" accessKey=\"h\"> textAndAccessKey: Use to simultaneously set the text and the mnemonic character for a component using the ampersand (&) character.
