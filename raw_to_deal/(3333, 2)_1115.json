The PITCHf/x-based numbers are more dispersed: when one considers catcher-seasons with at least 1500 pitches caught, the standard deviation is close to 13 runs for the PITCHf/x numbers and about 7.5 for the Retrosheet ones.

Teams with analytically minded front offices are already making seven-figure decisions based on numbers like these. The PITCHf/x-based method is more precise and less likely to be pulling in other aspects of a catcher\u2019s defensive performance, so for seasons where both methods are available, I would tend to trust its output over the Retrosheet estimate. If you\u2019re skeptical that the big numbers associated with the PITCHf/x approach could be accurate, Mitchel Lichtman\u2019s testing from last year might lay some of your concerns to rest. \u00a0 According to either method, a good framing catcher can be expected to bring his team a handful of extra wins in a single season. \u00a0 There are two metrics that strongly agree: no catcher over the past five years is rated above average by one and below average by the other. \u00a0 I know such discrepancies can be enough for some people to turn away altogether from this article and others on framing, as they often do when two play-by-play-based fielding metrics disagree on an evaluation of any position player. However, what I make of these numbers is this: Here a note is due.

In a subsequent section, I\u2019ll take a look at aging curves for the framing skill. In case you\u2019re wondering, the worst season belongs to framing whipping-boy Ryan Doumit (2008) by a mile, with Jason Kendall (2000) and Jorge Posada (2005) just a bit better. Career framers Ausmus also gets the career laurel as the cumulative king of framing for the past quarter century. In an 18-year career behind the plate, he added roughly one win per season through his ability to earn extra strike calls. Once more, the purported divide between scouting and statistical analysis is revealed to be a false one: way before numbers-based discussions on framing were made, teams were willing to give playing time to weak-hitting catchers like Ausmus because of their defensive ability.
