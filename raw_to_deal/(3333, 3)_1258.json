This enables both the processor and software footprint to meet the area budget of the smallest FPGA devices, while retaining compatibility with Thumb code for any ARM processor from the ARM7TDMI \u00ae processor upwards. Despite being the smallest processor in the Cortex processor family, the Cortex-M1 processor can deliver 0.8 DMIPS/MHz. Feature Set Streamlined three stage 32 bit RISC processor High frequency, low area design Configurable instruction and data tightly coupled memories (0K - 1024K) Integrated interrupt controller 1 to 32 interrupts supported 4 priority levels per interrupt Highly configurable debug logic Removable debug, breakpoint and watchpoint Big or Little endian configurability Fast or small multiplier configuration options supported AMBA\u00ae AHB-Lite 32-bit bus interface Compatibility Implementation of the Cortex-M1 processor may be on any FPGA device using either proprietary or vendor independent synthesis flows.
