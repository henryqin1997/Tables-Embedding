Occasionally, insufficient enrollment may preclude offering a culminating course in a less commonly taught language. In such cases, the Center for Language Studies will offer FLANG 202R and FLANG 330R as an Independent Study course, if a qualified teacher can be found. The Independent Study course can be arranged through a special enrollment process. For information on the availability of language courses and Independent Study courses, please contact the Center for Language Studies, (801) 422-1201., 112996=First-Year Mentoring is a unique gift from the University to all admitted New Freshmen. Participating in First-Year Mentoring provides students with active peer mentor support and priority registration access to high demand University Core courses, including those that fulfill the First-Year Writing and American Heritage requirements. These courses have seats reserved for first-year students and are available through the University registration system in envelopes. Registration for these mentored-courses is done during your priority registration. A brief description of First-Year Mentoring is found in the Undergraduate Education section of the catalog. Additional information may be obtained from the First-Year Mentoring website or by contacting First-Year Mentoring, 2014 JKB, (801) 422-8176 or 1 (877) 890-5451, or emailing fym@byu.edu . It is recommended that students who need to satisfy the Quantitative Reasoning requirement because of an ACT subscore below 22, do so in their first year. It is also recommended that all new students begin work in the mathematics or foreign language options under Languages of Learning. Students planning to satisfy the Biological Science or Physical Science requirements with the two-course options (e.g., PDBIO 120 + MMBIO 240; chemistry, physics, and geology combination options) should also complete these requirements during their first two years, making some progress on them in their first year. Civilization courses are designed as sophomore-level courses, although some programs include them during the freshman year. Visit college advisement centers or department offices for advice on when to complete the other GE requirements.}", "lastModified": "Mon, 03 Aug 2015 06:53:43 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Complete the following two courses: Book of Mormon Current Students Enrolled PRIOR TO Fall 2015 Doctrinal Foundations }); }); $(this).next(\".toggle\").slideToggle(\"slow\"); $(\".togglelink\").click(function () { $(document).ready(function () { }); }); } $('#tab_explain').hide(); show: function (event, ui) { navigation: true, collapsible: true, $('#tabs').tabs({ }); $('.accordion').accordion(\"activate\", \".false\"); active: false autoHeight: false, collapsible: true, $('.accordion').accordion({ $(function () { } cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold; .togglelink { } margin-left: 8px; display: none; .toggle { } display: none; #header-wrapper { } display: none; #navigation-wrapper { } font-size: 20px; h3 { } font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; h2 { } font-weight: bold; font-size: 34px; h1 { } margin-bottom: 1px; height: 100%; html {", "textAfterTable": "SUBSTITUTION OPTION: REL A 250 Jesus Christ and the Everlasting Gospel Doctrine & Covenants Complete one of the following courses: Class Title REL C 324 The Doctrine and Covenants 1 OR REL C 325 The Doctrine and Covenants 2 SUBSTITUTION OPTION: REL 225 Foundations of the Restoration Religion Electives 3-4 courses (6 elective religion hours are required, making 14 religion credits total) Note: Because regular gospel study should be a continuous part of a student's university experience, it would be ideal to take one religion class each semester of enrollment.
