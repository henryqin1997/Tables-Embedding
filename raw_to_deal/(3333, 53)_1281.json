The traffic, which is carried by the EFPs, is load balanced across member links. Ingress traffic for a single EVC can arrive on any member of the bundle. All the egress traffic pertaining to an EFP uses only one of the member links. Load balancing is achieved by grouping EFPs and assigning them to a member link. The Cisco ASR 1000 Layer 2 port-channel interface supports flow-based load balancing by default. In default load balancing, you have no control over how the EFPs are grouped together, and sometimes, the EFP grouping may not be ideal. To avoid this, use VLAN-based manual load balancing to control the EFP grouping.}", "textBeforeTable": "DETAILED STEPS 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 encapsulation {default | untagged | dot1q vlan-id [second-dot1q vlan-id] } 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [no] service instance id Ethernet [service-name] 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 encapsulation {default | untagged | dot1q vlan-id [second-dot1q vlan-id] } 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [no] service instance id Ethernet [service-name] 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no negotiation auto 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [no] ip address 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 interface port-channel number 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 configure terminal 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 enable SUMMARY STEPS To configure a port-channel interface with Ethernet service instances, perform the following steps. Configuring a Port Channel Interface with Ethernet Service Instances To configure a basic EVC port channel, perform the steps in the following sections.
