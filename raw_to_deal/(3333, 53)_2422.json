FSC certified panels contribute to the LEED MR 7.0 credit. Please contact your Columbia or distributor sales representative for FSC options including FSC mixed credit. PureBond Classic Core and PureBond Classic Lam are now offered as a standard from our facility in Klamath Falls, Oregon. No special lead times are required. These panels are produced with no added urea formaldehyde (NAUF) MDF crossbands combined with PureBond formaldehyde-free technology. PureBond Classic Core contributes to LEED credit IEQ 4.4 calling for composite panel products with no added urea formaldehyde. PureBond Classic Core and LEED\u00ae PureBond Classic Core is a standard construction at our Klamath Falls, OR mill, but available at our other mills upon request. PureBond Classic Core panels can be specified as FSC\u00ae certified upon request. Standard thicknesses for our PureBond Classic Core include 1/2\u2033, 5/8\u2033, 3/4\u2033, 1\u2033 and 1-1/4\u2033. PureBond Classic Lam thickness offerings include 1/2\u2033, 11/16\u2033, 3/4\u2033, 15/16\u2033 and 1\u2033. Ask us about our other thickness options.

PureBond Classic Core panels have a thin MDF crossbands next to the face and back for projects that require a smoother face than typical veneer core panels.", "textAfterTable": "*Test samples were constructed with rotary maple face and back. Test results for hardness can differ depending on density of decorative veneer. Wood is natural, thus physical properties including weight can vary. Test data is for informational purposes and does not represent a claim by Columbia that identical panel assemblies meet these properties in the field. The PureBond Classic Core Line PureBond Classic Core\u00ae PureBond Classic Core offers a construction of veneer core inner plies and NAUF MDF cross-bands. The panel thickness dictates the actual thickness of the MDF used in the construction. Although PureBond Classic Core still falls within the HPVA thickness tolerance of +0 / -3/64\u2033, the engineered MDF cross bands provide more consistent thickness tolerances compared with single-step, all-veneer core construction. PureBond J Classic Core\u00ae PureBond J Classic Core core is constructed with a thin MDF crossband, thus this panel has an overall increased volume of veneer inner ply, weighing less than PureBond Classic Core. The thin composite lines in the profile of this panel, are barely noticeable, which is important in applications with an exposed edge. The J designation means this platform is pre-sanded before we apply the face and back veneers. PureBond J Classic Core offers superior features in terms of strength, stability, weight, surface quality and thickness consistency.
