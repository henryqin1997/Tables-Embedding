The major share ($616.5 million or 59%) went to member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The United Kingdom, the largest single destination of Canadian military exports each year, received $261 million in military exports, accounting for 42% of NATO\u2019s share and 25% of all Canadian military exports. Four other NATO countries were also in the top ten destinations for the same period: Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany. Two of the top ten destinations were not NATO members but were included on the Automatic Firearms Country Control List (AFCCL); Saudi Arabia and Australia received a combined $137.1 million in military exports, or 13% of the total. Malaysia, South Africa and Singapore, the seventh, ninth and tenth-largest destinations for military exports respectively, were the only non-NATO and non-AFCCL countries. Military exports to Participating States of the Wassenaar Arrangement accounted for $815.7 million, or 78% of the total military exports., 7714=Canada continues to actively promote greater transparency in the trade of conventional weapons. In 1991, Canada was a founding contributor to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, to which governments voluntarily supply data on their imports and exports of seven major categories of conventional weapons systemsFootnote 7. The annually updated Register makes a significant contribution to transparency, confidence-building and enhanced global security. Each year since the inception of the Register, more than 90 governments on average have made submissions to it; of these, about 70 have done so consistently, including Canada. Currently, there is reasonable representation from most geographic regions, capturing over 95 percent of the international trade in major conventional weapons.
