Unless you know that you need high pulse rates, you can safely ignore this section. On the Mini Maestro 12, 18, and 24, pulse rates of 200\u2013333 Hz put restrictions on the servo pulse lengths. These restrictions apply to all servo channels, even if some are set to a lower pulse rate using the Period multiplier feature. The following tables show allowed minimum and maximum pulse lengths, in microseconds, for a variety of combinations of pulse rates and servo numbers. All enabled servos must always satisfy the restrictions on some table row, so the easiest way to follow the restrictions is to pick a row, then configure minimums and maximums for specific channels according to the restrictions given in that row. However, you do not need to specify the ranges of your servos in advance: you can switch some channels off or adjust their positions to access a wider range on other channels. If your settings happen to violate these restrictions, the servo period might increase and the units of speed and acceleration limits will change accordingly, but the operation of the Maestro will not be affected in any other way. For example, with a Mini Maestro 24 running at 250\u00a0Hz (a 4\u00a0ms period), you may use 12 servos with a range of 576\u20132880\u00a0\u03bcs and 6 servos with a range of 64\u20132880\u00a0\u03bcs.
