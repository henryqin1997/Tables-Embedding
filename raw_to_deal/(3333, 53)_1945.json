During the period of independent Lithuania (1918-1940), Rasein remained a district administrative center, but because of its distance from the railway line (about 17 km.) and the lack of a paved road (which was not constructed until 1939), it suffered economically and its population decreased.

On the eve of Pesakh 1886, fire broke out and more then 200 Jewish families were left roofless and destitute. Help was received from former Rasein citizens in South Africa. In 1888, 50 Jewish houses burned down. Muraviov, the Gubernator (head of the Gubernia) transfered 800 rubles from the government to help victims of the fire. During World War I, Rasein Jews stayed in town and traded with the German occupation army. At this time many wholesale businesses opened, supplying goods all over Lithuania., 2070=Until 1795, Rasein was a part of the Polish-Lithuanian Kingdom. That same year, when Poland was divided up for the third time by the three superpowers of those times (Russia, Prussia and Austria), Lithuania was split between Russia and Prussia.

At the end of the nineteenth century Rasein Jews acquired 130 shares in the bank of the Zionist organization (Otsar Hityashvuth HaYehudim), and several hundred Rubles were collected for the settlement of Eretz-Yisrael. At this time, courses for studying Hebrew and the Bible were opened in town, with about forty girls participating.

A local youngster named Avraham Mogilevsky, later an officer in the Lithuanian army, excelled in the temporary auxiliary police force, which numbered sixty men. In the printing press of a local Jew named Kadushin, postage stamps of the town Rasein were printed, long before the government post office began to issue stamps.

The Tomkhei Aniyim (Supporters of the Poor) society also donated 500 rubles, a large sum, to the Central Help Committee in Memel., 13608=During World War I, in May 1915, when the Russian rulers published an order exiling all Jews from the Kovno Gubernia, Rasein's Jews remained in the town.

In Rasein, a community committee was elected at the end of 1919, which functioned until about the beginning of 1926, when the autonomy was annulled by a new Lithuanian government. In 1921 the committee consisted of fifteen members: four from Tseirei Zion, one from Akhduth (Agudath Yisrael), one from the General Zionists, one non-party and eight independent.

One reason was the blatant propaganda of the Association of Lithuanian Merchants (Verslas), which campaigned against buying from Jewish shops. The Lithuanians established consumer cooperatives competing with Jewish trade. Jewish exporters of eggs, flax, grains and timber lost their living. The livelihood of Jewish artisans also declined, because Lithuanian artisans moved away from villages and settled in town. In 1934 Jews were attacked physically. During these years many Jews emigrated to America, South Africa and Mexico, with some youths emigrating to Eretz-Yisrael., 2519=In 1812 Napoleon's army passed through the town, and almost totally destroyed it.

And in the same year a Society of Hebrew Speakers, whose members were obliged to speak only Hebrew during their meetings, came into being.

The elections of 1931 brought five Jews to the council of twelve: Max Levy, Noakh Yisrael, Mosheh Ziv, Gedalyah Halperin and Meir Zusmanovitz.
