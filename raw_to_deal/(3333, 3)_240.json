The laboratory focuses on unraveling the molecular mechanisms that regulate cellular energy metabolism especially in the adipose tissue. Using white and brown adipose tissue depots and adipocytes isolated from healthy and diet induced obese mice, alterations in cellular pathways are determined. The goal is to identify novel proteins which can be targeted in metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. In this regard, inositol hexakisphosphate kinase-1 (IP6K1), an enzyme in the inositol pyrophosphate biosynthetic pathway, was discovered as a key player in energy homeostasis. Studies in whole body (Chakraborty et al. Cell, 2010) and adipose tissue-specific IP6K1 knockout (unpublished work in the laboratory) mice reveal that targeting IP6K1 in the adipose tissue decelerates weight gain and improves metabolic parameters in high fat-fed mice. Current research is focused to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which IP6K1 promotes obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, impacts of pharmacologic inhibition of this class of enzymes on metabolic parameters of obese and diabetic mice are also being explored. These studies are expected to have immediate application in ameliorating metabolic diseases.", "Interested candidates with a recently earned Ph.D. are encouraged to apply. A track record of excellent first author publication during PhD training is essential. Strong background in biochemistry and cell/molecular biology is required. Extensive experience in the area of adipose tissue metabolism and survival is desirable.

We are looking for an energetic colleague with keen interest in science and solid background in the areas of physiology, molecular and cell biology. The laboratory is interested in delineating mechanisms by which GPCR pathways control reward behavior, vision and provide neural control of the cardiac function. It is expected that the project will contribute to our understanding of the neuropsychiatric diseases, drug addiction and vision loss while focusing on the discovery of the fundamental neurobiological principles. Multidisciplinary approach integrating behavioral characterization of genetic mouse models with live cell imaging, biochemical analysis of signaling reactions and discovery of novel interactions by mass-spectrometry assisted proteomics is envisioned.

Annu Rev Biochem. 78:399-434). The position available is to elucidate the mechanism of action of the Listerin E3 in a novel pathway of ribosome-associated protein quality control, and/or how defects in Listerin function cause neurodegeneration. We had previously reported on a new mouse model of ALS/motor neuron disease caused by mutation of Listerin/Ltn1, whose function was unknown at the time (Chu et al. 2009. PNAS 106:2097-103). Listerin is conserved in eukaryotes, so we utilized S. cerevisiae to elucidate its function and mechanism of action, and found that Listerin is associated with ribosomes and mediates quality control of aberrant nascent proteins (Bengtson & Joazeiro 2010. Nature 467:470-3). Our lab is now undertaking different approaches to continue studying Listerin, including biochemistry, yeast genetics, structural biology, mammalian tissue culture, and gene-disease association studies using ALS patient samples. We are also well positioned to uncover novel molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration by applying the discoveries we make with these approaches to studies on the Listerin mutant mouse model. There are opportunities for studies along any of the above research lines, depending on the background and interests of the applicant.
