AP/Wide World, 20168=United States leadership in natural hazard detection is fostering regional collaboration in tsunami mitigation, building relationships among countries through science partnerships and contributing to the productivity and sustainable development of coastal nations. Since the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, the Department of State has coordinated U.S. engagement to build capacity for natural hazard warning systems, building political momentum on a regional basis while addressing the unique needs of individual countries. As a result, countries in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean are collaborating to create an enabling environment for long-term investment in regional warning infrastructure and community preparedness. While protecting people from disaster, these activities nurture goodwill toward the U.S. in the predominantly Muslim Indian Ocean region, and enhance government resilience and control in the wake of natural disasters., 10433=Key Initiatives And Programs. In FY 2006, the Department and USAID continued to demonstrate leadership and commitment to the U.S. Government's social and environmental goals. For example, $1.58 billion was programmed for child survival and health initiatives, $2.5 billion was set aside for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs, $365 million was allocated for basic education activities, and $200 million was made available for drinking water supply projects, including $50 million for programs in Africa.}", "textBeforeTable": "The table below summarizes the performance ratings for Department of State and USAID results for the Social and Environmental Issues strategic\u00a0goal. II. Performance Summary \u00a0 By supporting over ten Presidential Initiatives and numerous programs that integrate economic growth with social development and environmental stewardship, the Department and USAID are extending the basic values American citizens hold dear: prosperity, sustainable management of natural resources, good health, and knowledge-based society. U.S. investments have expanded access to skilled childbirth care, immunizations and effective prevention and treatment for diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, polio and more recently Avian influenza. Through regional dialogues and protection and assistance to vulnerable migrants, the Department and USAID promote effective and humane international migration policies and systems. Investments in basic education are critical to promote a stable, skilled work force, economic growth, and an informed society that demands and participates constructively in democratic institutions. Finally, sound governance and conservation of biodiverse ecosystems provide income, sustainable livelihoods and a healthy foundation for human well-being. U.S. and foreign government agencies, international organizations and the private sector are building broad partnerships to ensure that all of these initiatives reduce the strains on society that lead to conflict and even terrorism, while inculcating democratic values of participatory decision-making, rule of law, and transparency.
