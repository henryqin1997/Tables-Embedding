Pressure cook potato chunks and peas for about 6 minutes. 2. Dice onions, chop ginger, green chili and garlic. 3. Heat a little oil, add onions and saute till golden. Add chopped ginger, chopped garlic and chopped green chili now and saute'. 4. Add turmeric powder, cayenne pepper powder and garam masala powder. Stir continuously until thoroughly mixed. 5.

Simmer on low heat until gravy thickens slightly. 7. Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro, squeeze a few drops of lemon juice and serve hot. NOTES: 1. This is a very simple thing, easy to make. 2. Total time required is under 30 minutes. I like this when it is accompanied by some cool cucumber-yogurt raita, or with a salad of fresh sliced onions, tomatoes and cucumber slices.
