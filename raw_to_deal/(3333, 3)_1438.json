Connection Codes in Log Files The options description, options=persistent, indicates that a persistent search is being performed. Persistent searches can be used as a form of monitoring and can be configured to return changes to given configurations. The access log distinguishes between persistent and regular searches. Options Description For SASL binds, the DN value displayed in the BIND request line is not used by the server and is, therefore, not relevant. However, for SASL binds, the authenticated DN must be used for audit purposes. Therefore, the authenticated DN must be clearly logged. Having the authenticated DN logged in the BIND result line avoids any confusion as to which DN is which. conn=14 op=1 RESULT err=0 tag=97 nentries=0 etime=0 dn=\"uid=myname,dc=example,dc=com\" The DN used for access control decisions is logged in the BIND result line and not in the bind request line.
