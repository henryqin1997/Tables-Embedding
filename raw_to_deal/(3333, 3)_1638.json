Coriolis was able to determine the following simple rules for the direction of moving objects on the surface of a rotating sphere, now known as the Coriolis effect:, 11507=Due to Earth's rotation, a person at the equator is moving about 110 miles per hour faster than a person standing at the poles.\u00a0False. Earth's circumference (distance around the Earth) at the Equator is 24902 mi/40076 km. Due to rotation motion; a person at the Equator moves this distance during 1 day (24 hours). So a person at the equator has a speed of 24902/24 = 1037 mph (or 40076/24 = 1670 km/hr)., 25236=Edmond Halley (1656-1742), pictured on the left, correctly understood the role of the Sun in atmospheric circulation. He reasoned that intense solar radiation heated the air near the Equator and caused it to expand and rise up. This rising air is replaced by cooler air converging on the Equator from the northern and southern hemispheres. Circulation of the air is driven by a pressure-gradient force, which causes high-pressure (cooler, more dense) air to move into regions of low-pressure (warmer, less dense) air. Under static conditions, fluids reach equilibrium when pressure is the same at each depth. His theory predicted a flow of air from the poles to the Equator where the air masses converge. But the explanation does not account for the steady westward flow., 26391=George Hadley (1685-1768), was an English lawyer and amateur meteorologist, who first recognized the reason the trade winds, preferentially blow westward. His explanation depended on the fact that Earth is a rotating sphere and that sites on the surface of rotating sphere travel with different speeds (travel different distances in equal times)., 43779=The Aqua MODIS instrument took the image on September 4, 2003.}", "lastModified": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:44:55 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "font-family:Verdana\">http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/BlueMarble/BlueMarble_2002.html Take a Spin With The Coriolis Model Sizing-up Inertial Circles color:red\"> font-family:Verdana;color:black\">Traveling on a Rotating SphereWhere Do The Trade Winds Blow?

Powered by the Sun and a rotating Earth, their interactions play a critical role in shaping weather and climate. Natural variations in winds, currents, and ocean temperatures can temporarily affect weather patterns. For example, an El Ni\u00f1o event may develop when the trade winds diminish. The trade winds affect ocean travel both today and in the past by aiding early explorers and merchants traveling from Europe to the Americas. The trade winds are a pattern of wind found in bands around Earth's equatorial region. They are the prevailing winds in the tropics, blowing from the high-pressure area in the horse latitudes towards the low-pressure area around the Equator. The constancy of the trade winds makes them important phenomena to study. What causes these winds near the Equator and who developed the concepts that explain them? \u00a0 \u00a0Dr. Pamela Gore, Georgia Perimeter College Lesson 2 will guide", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
