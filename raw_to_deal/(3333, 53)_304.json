It\u2019s because the rate of reaction is determined by the ratio of enzyme to substrate. Diluting substrates will dramatically impact the overall generation of light. Then, you will have to repeat the experiment, and you end up using more substrate anyway! Okay, I know, research budget money is tight and you want to make your reagents stretch as far as possible, but it really not a good idea to dilute your chemiluminescent Western blotting substrate. licor-admin causes, causes of weak western blot signals, chemiluminescent western blot troubleshooting, not using enough chemiluminescent substrate, substrate dilution and western blot signals, troubleshooting weak signals, troubleshooting western blots, western blot troubleshooting, western blotting C-DiGit System, Odyssey Imaging Systems, Western Blotting March 26, 2014 Possible Cause 10 for Weak Chemiluminescent Western Blot Signals: Diluting Substrates", "textAfterTable": "1Comparable to WesternSure\u00ae PREMIUM Chemiluminescent Substrate So don\u2019t skimp \u2013 use the substrate full strength the first time to ensure that you are seeing all of your protein bands.
