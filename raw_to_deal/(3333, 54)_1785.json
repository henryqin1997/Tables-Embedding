(Strict maintenance of rang rules and personnel safety.) Warning! Precaution for Applying HOP UP \u00a0 HOP UP applies a principle in which an elastic abrasion rubber is posted on the upper part of bore directly contacting with the BB bullet. When fired, the produces a swivel movement along the trajectory course. This design requires more energy and decreases the initial firing velocity but not so significant .Nevertheless, the change of the trajectory profile is largely dependent on the abrasion and BE bullet (weight and shape). The key problem of the gas-powered gun lies on the gas pressure. The most optimal temperature to operate the BB Gun is 20C - 30C in which even under condition that the cold would lead to poor evaporation of LG, it can be warmed up by hands to increase the", "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Storage. Carrying. Assignment and Scrapping \u00a0 At the end of operation , clean it and check to make sure that there is no bullet left in the barrel. Pull off the magazine and empty the bullet from the magazine. Drain the residual LG. Store the gun, the magazine and BB bullet in separate location in the packing box. Store it in a safe place and keep out of reach of children. The user has the sole responsibility to prevent the children or any person who are not familiar with the BB gun from using it. If the user is willing to lend to other people, he shall teach the borrower the safe rules of operation. Good custody of the BB gun is a unique obligation the holder has to take. The holder is liable for legal action in the event any hazard and criminal has derived from the poor custody. We have declared this criticalness in our operation manual. If it is intended to use the BB gun after long storage, please clean and lubricate properly and check the working condition of each parts. Adequate lubrication is the way to keep its long life span and smooth operation. When carrying BB gun along, please pack it in the packing box or in the carrying bag.
