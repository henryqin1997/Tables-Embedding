Operation collections and operation enumerations support authorization in Reporting Services. The operations collection is one of the prime components of any access control entry (AceStruct object). The operations collection contains the list of operations permitted on an item in the report server database for a given principal name. As demonstrated in previous examples, evaluating the operation collections for an item is a key part of any Reporting Services authorization extension. There exists an operation collection for each of the securable item types in Reporting Services, including the catalog (general system operations), folders, reports, and resources. Thread Safety Any public static ( Shared in Visual Basic) members of this type are thread safe. Any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread safe.
