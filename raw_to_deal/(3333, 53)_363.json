Protein Synthesis Inhibition Confluent cells were serum-starved for two h, washed two times with methionine-free media (Invitrogen) and incubated in methionine-free media for 45 min prior to treatment with toxin. Approximately 8 \u03bcCi [35S] methionine (MP Biomedicals) were added to each sample during the last 30 min of toxin treatment. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and scraped into cold 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Samples were collected on glass microfiber filters (Whatman) using a vacuum manifold, washed three times with ice-cold 5% TCA and washed two times with cold 95% ethanol. ScintiVerse cocktail (Fisher) was added to each sample and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Beckman Coulter). 2.7.

RTA Inhibits XBP1 Splicing in Mammalian Cells XBP1 splicing subsequent to IRE1 phosphorylation is a primary component of the UPR response. Therefore we first examined whether RTA would affect this arm of UPR in the non-transformed mammary epithelial cell line MAC-T. We have previously shown that these cells are sensitive to RTA in terms of depurination, protein synthesis inhibition, and apoptosis within 4 h of treatment [ 26 ]. As shown in Figure 1 A, only the unspliced form of XBP1 was present in cells treated with RTA (0.1 or 1.0 \u00b5g/mL), indicating", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
