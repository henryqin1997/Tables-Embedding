An in-situ study on the distribution, biotransformation and flux of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in an aquatic food chain (seston-Mytilus edulis L.-Somateria mollissima) from the Baltic: an ecotoxicological perspective. Environ Toxicol Chem 9:429\u2013442., 170634=Based on the information presented in this screening assessment, the critical effect for the initial categorization of risk to human health was carcinogenicity. However, because the estimates of exposure indicate that the potential exposure of the general population to industry-restricted HFOs from ambient air is expected to be very low, resulting in an extraordinarily large MOE (approximately 420\u00a0000), the likelihood of inhalation exposure of Canadians is considered to be very low. Exposure of the general population to industry-restricted HFOs via the dermal and oral routes is not expected. Therefore, based on the adequacy of the margins between estimated exposure to industry-restricted HFO substances and critical effect levels, it is concluded that the five industry-restricted HFOs (CAS RNs 64741-75-9, 68783-08-4, 70592-76-6, 70592-77-7 and 70592-78-8) do not meet the criteria under paragraph 64(c) of CEPA 1999, as they are not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in Canada to human life or health., 102407=Experimental BAFs and BCFs suggest that PAHs, as a whole, have low bioaccumulation potential in fish. This is due in part to the metabolism of PAHs by fish, resulting in low or nondetectable concentrations of the parent PAHs in fish tissues (Varanasi et al. 1989). Regarding BAF, none of the measured or modelled values were shown to meet the bioaccumulation criterion (BAF greater than or equal to 5000) as defined in the Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations (Canada 2000) with the exception of modelled BAF values for isoheptylfluorene and 2-isohexylphenanthrene (see Table A5.8 in Appendix 5). Lampi et al. (2010) found that isopropyl functional groups increased the bioaccumulation potential of naphthalene although isopropyl groups are considered atypical in petroleum. Thus highly alkylated PAHs, especially those with iso- groups, likely have a greater potential to bioaccumulate simply from increased partitioning to lipophillic tissues in biota and possibly some hindrance of biotransformation. Lack of experimental or field data for alkyl-PAHs larger than naphthalene prevents drawing a concrete conclusion for these substances, albeit Neff et al. (1976) found that as naphthalene becomes increasingly alkylated, there is an increase in bioaccumulation potential. With regards to the modelled BAF values for isoheptylfluorene and 2-isohexylphenanthrene, the only similar analogues (fluorene and phenanthrene) have experimental BCFs of 1030 L/kg ww and 2944 L/kg ww, respectively, which are both slightly higher than the predicted BCFs using the mass-balance kinetic model (Table A5.8 in Appendix 5). However, there is some uncertainty surrounding the kinetic rate constants used to model BCF and BAF for isoheptylfluorene and 2-isohexylphenanthrene (e.g., the metabolic rate constants were either estimated from QSARs or based on analogue data), as well as the degree of trophic magnification within the foodweb used by the model), suggesting that the BAFs may be overestimated. However, given that the log Kow of these compounds is between 7.0 and 7.5, the optimal range for high bioaccumulation from the diet and water coupled with a possible slow rate of metabolism and that a TMF for fluorene is approximately 1 (Table A5.10 in Appendix 5), a high bioaccumulation potential may still be likely., 207018=[NEB] National Energy Board. 2008.

The fish were capable of depurating pyrene completely within 160 hours of cessation of exposure. However, anthracene was only 70% and fluorene only 20% depurated within 200 hours. The BCF results for anthracene and pyrene by De Voogt et al. (1991) were not considered reliable in determining the bioconcentration potential of these substances due the lack of evidence that a steady-state had been reached within the 48-hour exposure. Likewise, there was poor recovery of pyrene at the end of the static bioconcentration experiment (62%) which had the BCF of 11 300 L/kg ww., 25248=Screening assessments focus on information critical to determining whether a substance meets the criteria set out in section 64 of CEPA1999. Screening assessments examine scientific information and develop conclusions by incorporating a weight-of-evidence approach and precaution[1] ., 155426=In vitro assays evaluating the genotoxicity of HFOs also exhibited mixed results. Positive results were obtained in the Ames test battery and mouse lymphoma assays, as well as for cell transformation and unscheduled DNA synthesis (Brecher and Goode 1983, 1984; Blackburn et al. 1984, 1986; API 1985c,d, 1986a; Mobil 1985; Feuston et al. 1994).

Additional negative results were observed only for one cytogenetic assay and one forward mutation assay for CAS RNs 64741-57-7 and 64741-62-4, respectively (API 1985e; Mobil 1987b).

For each endpoint organism, an estimate of the potential to cause adverse effects and predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) was determined. Also, a PEC was determined from the aquatic exposure scenario. The PNEC is the lowest critical toxicity value (CTV) for the organism of interest divided by an appropriate assessment factor. A risk quotient (RQ = PEC/PNEC) was calculated for each endpoint organism and is an important line of evidence in evaluating the potential risk to the environment., 172800=[API] American Petroleum Institute. 1983.

Four modes of transportation--ships, pipelines, trucks and trains--were identified as being involved in moving industry-restricted HFOs to other industrial facilities. The total transport quantity of the five HFOs considered in this assessment is about 3 million tonnes (2.9 \u00d7 109 L) (year 2006). Two types of potential releases occur during transportation and are considered in this screening assessment. These are evaporative emissions and unintentional releases (e.g., spills or leaks) during the handling and transit processes., 178356=Arnot JA, Mackay D, Parkerton TF, Bonnell M. 2008b.

Slight to severe skin irritation was observed in several studies; the lowest dose reported for skin irritation was 8 mg/kg-bw per day (Mobil 1994a, b). Selected systemic effects observed in these studies included decreased body weight gain and body weight, decreased thymus weights, increased liver weights and changes in hematological parameters (e.g., platelets, hemoglobin, red blood cells) and serum chemistry (i.e., liver enzymes and other indicators of liver toxicity) (API 1983; Mobil 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994a, b; UBTL 1990, 1994; Feuston et al. 1994, 1997). A lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of 1 mg/kg-bw per day was reported for maternal toxicity following dermal exposure of pregnant CD rats to CAS RN 64741-62-4 at doses of 0.05, 1, 10, 50 or 250 mg/kg-bw per day from gestation days 0\u201319. Effects observed at the LOAEL included significantly decreased body weight gain, body weight and feed consumption, as well as decreased gravid uterine weight and the occurrence of red vaginal exudates (Hoberman et al. 1995). For subchronic exposure, a LOAEL of 8\u00a0mg/kg-bw per day was established following dermal exposure of male and female rats to CAS RN 64741-62-4 or 64741-81-7 at doses of 8, 30, 125, 500 or 2000 mg/kg-bw per day for 13 weeks. Effects noted at the LOAEL included decreased platelet counts and increased liver weights, as well as dose-related skin irritation (Mobil 1988, 1992, 1994b; Feuston et al. 1994, 1997).

From the historical Canadian data from the Spill Line database for Bunker C (Environment Canada 2011), only 13 spills of HFOs from pipelines were reported over 10 years (2000\u20132009).

According to information submitted under section 71 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999), and other sources of information, these HFOs are transported in large volumes from refinery or upgrader facilities to other industrial facilities by pipelines, ships, trains and trucks; therefore, exposure of the environment is expected., 213095=Strobel CJ, Brenowitz AH. 1981.

Release frequency and volumes from trains are less certain due to a lack of definitive data. The Spill Line database reports small numbers of Bunker C spills via train (11 spills) and truck (32 spills) from 2000\u20132009. Considering the cause and reason of spill, it was determined that for each scenario of loading, transport and unloading of trains, less than 1 spill per year is expected. By the same analysis, less than or equal to 1 spill per year each for loading, transport and unloading by truck is expected. Thus, terrestrial impacts from train and truck transport of HFOs are unlikely to cause harm due to their low frequency (less than 1 spill per year for loading/unloading and transport). Likewise, the estimated spills from truck loading and unloading were not considered to be of high importance, as they would likely occur on a hard surface and not on soil., 182026=Brost EJ, DeVaull GE. 2000.

For these particular components, the metabolic rate constants range from 0.01\u20130.08 (day-1), suggesting a slow rate of metabolism. In the case of C14 and C22 polycycloalkanes, C15 one-ring aromatic and C20 cycloalkane monoaromatic, only experimental BMFs for comparative analogues were available. The BMFs were all less than 1, suggesting that these components will not biomagnify. In the case of the C15 cycloalkane monoaromatic, only an experimental BCF (3418 L/kg ww) for a similar component (octahydro-phenanthrene) was found. However, considering the slow metabolic rate of 0.197 (day-1) for octahydrophenanthrene, there is the potential that predicted BCFs and BAFs for the C15 cycloalkane monoaromatic could exceed the Canadian criteria, although this cannot be determined due to the lack of details from the relevant study. Lastly, the only analogue similar to the C20 cycloalkane diaromatic (isoheptylfluorene) is fluorene, which has an experimental BCF of 1030 L/kg ww. However, the presence of an isoheptyl group may affect the bioaccumulation potential of fluorine, and the low kM value suggests a slow rate of metabolism. Overall, the available evidence suggests that these components are likely to bioaccumulate based on available modelled and experimental results., 214577=[TOPKAT] Toxicity Prediction by Komputer Assisted Technology [Internet]. 2004.

In this case, 83 barrels of fuel oil is expected to be in contact with 6250 \u00d7 109 litres of water (Table A5.13 in Appendix 5). This volume is estimated from the open ocean of Placentia Bay. The resulting concentration in water would be 0.002 mg/L (1.38 \u00d7 1010 mg/6250 \u00d7 109 litres), which is considered the marine PEC for ship transport., 66733=Using an extrapolation ratio of 1:1:4 for a water : soil : sediment biodegradation half-life (Boethling et al. 1995), the representative structures that are persistent in water are also persistent in soil (half-life greater than or equal to 182 days) and in sediments (half-life greater than or equal to 365 days)., 27268=This screening assessment addresses five industry-restricted HFO substances described under Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CAS RNs) 64741-75-9, 68783-08-4, 70592-76-6, 70592-77-7 and 70592-78-8.

A predictive approach using a bioconcentration/bioaccumulation factor (BCF/BAF) model was also applied (Arnot and Gobas 2003, 2004). According to the Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations (Canada 2000) a substance is bioaccumulative if its BCF or BAF is greater than or equal to 5000; however, measures of BAF are the preferred metric for assessing the bioaccumulation potential of substances. This is because BCF may not adequately account for the bioaccumulation potential of substances via the diet, which predominates for substances with log Kow greater than ~4.5 (Arnot and Gobas 2003)., 212142=Simpson BJ. 2005. Analysis of petroleum hydrocarbon streams on the Health Canada CEPA/DSL Draft Maximal List. Report to the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute., 50404=Potential releases associated with the transport of these HFOs to marine, freshwater and soil environments were assessed through analysis of historical spill data (2000\u20132009) from the Environment Canada Spill Line database (Environment Canada 2011). There was no spills category for HFOs; spills of Bunker C fuel oil were therefore used. The releases labelled as Bunker C fuel oil (Fuel Oil No. 6) would also include these industry-restricted HFOs. There were also a small number of releases that were generically labelled as just \u201cBunker,\u201d and there was no indication as to what specific type of Bunker was released. Thus, all releases labelled as \u201cBunker\u201d were considered to be Bunker C fuel oil. Bunker C is considered a heavy fuel oil but is not industry-restricted and has a wider distribution. Thus, it is expected that the actual number and volume of industry-restricted HFO spills are considerably lower than those of Bunker C fuel oil spills, but this could not be reliably determined. Of note was the large-volume spill of 734\u00a0000 L in 2005, which is known to be a Bunker C fuel oil spill into Lake Wabamun, Alberta; it was not included in the release estimate, as it was known not to be an industry-restricted HFO spill. As well, extremely large spills with no known origin were not included, as these were likely from environmental emergencies training exercises, which are not differentiated from actual events in the Environment Canada Spill Line database (Environment Canada 2011). Spills where collisions, poor road conditions and/or adverse weather-related events were listed as a source, reason or cause of spill were not included in the release estimate., 183930=Canada. 2010.

At an average density of 1.04\u00a0kg/L (API 2004) this is equivalent to 92 barrels of fuel oil and is therefore expected to be in contact with 6250 \u00d7 109 litres of water (Table A5.13 in Appendix 5). This volume is estimated from the open ocean of Placentia Bay. The resulting concentration in water would be 0.002 mg/L (1.53 \u00d7 1010 mg/6250 \u00d7 109 litres), which is considered the freshwater PEC for ship transport., 187217=De Voogt P, van Hattum B, Leonards P, Klamer JC, Govers H. 1991. Bioconcentration of polycyclic heteroaromatic hydrocarbons in the guppy (Poecilia reticula). Aquat Toxicol 20:169\u2013194., 157133=A number of skin-painting studies were conducted in laboratory animals to investigate the dermal carcinogenicity of HFOs using both chronic and initiation/promotion methodologies. Skin tumours, including both malignant carcinomas and benign papillomas, were frequently observed in mice, rabbits and monkeys (Smith et al. 1951; Shubik and Saffiotti 1955; Shapiro and Getmanets 1962; Saffiotti and Shubik 1963; Getmanets 1967; Weil and Condra 1977; Bingham and Barkley 1979; Sun Petroleum Products Co. 1979; Bingham et al. 1980; Lewis 1983; Blackburn et al. 1984, 1986; API 1989a, b; McKee et al. 1990). Exposure durations for the chronic studies ranged from 25 weeks to lifetime, with reported tumour latency periods ranging from 8 to 113\u00a0weeks. In several studies, however, the durations of exposures and latencies were not specified. In a chronic study, male mice were dermally treated with CAS RN 64741-62-4 at doses of 8.4, 16.8, 42.0, 83.8 or 167.6 mg/kg-bw, 3 times per week for a lifetime. Significant skin tumour formation was observed at all doses in a dose-response fashion (McKee et al. 1990). In the one initiation study that was identified, male mice were dermally treated with CAS RN 64741-62-4 at a dose of 16.8 mg/kg-bw once per day for 5 consecutive days. Significant skin tumour formation was observed at this dose. In the corresponding promotion study, no increase in histologically confirmed tumour incidence was observed. A statistically significant increase in the number of mice with gross masses (and shortened latency periods) was observed, however, indicating possible weak promoting activity (API 1989a)., 196522=Gobas F, Clark K, Shiu W, Mackay D. 1989.

Available from: www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/104557877/home [restricted access]., 136933=Based on the information presented in this screening assessment on the frequency and magnitude of spills, there is low risk of harm to organisms or the broader integrity of the environment from these substances. It is concluded that these industry-restricted HFOs (CAS RNs 64741-75-9, 68783-08-4, 70592-76-6, 70592-77-7 and 70592-78-8) do not meet the criteria under paragraph 64(a) or 64(b) of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) as they are not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that may have an immediate or long-term harmful effect on the environment or its biological diversity., 152653=One short-term inhalation study was conducted for CAS RN 64742-90-1. A lowest-observed-adverse-effect concentration (LOAEC) of 540 mg/m3 was observed for decreased body weight (concentration-related) and increased liver weight in Fischer 344 rats following administration of 540 or 2000 mg/m3, 6 hours/day for 9 days (Gordon 1983)., 198598=Hollister TA, Ward GS, Parrish PR. 1980. Acute toxicity of a #6 fuel oil to marine organisms. Bull Environ Contam Toxicol 24:656\u2013661., 104756=None of the modelled BCF values for representative PAHs were shown to meet the bioconcentration criterion (BCF greater than or equal to 5000) as defined in the Persistence and Bioaccumulation Regulations (Canada 2000) (see Table A5.8 in Appendix 5). This is largely due to the lower contribution of chemical uptake from water from highly hydrophobic substances, but also because PAHs such as naphthalene, phenanthrene and B[a]P are metabolized by fish resulting in very low or nondetectable concentrations of the parent PAHs in fish tissues (Varanasi et al. 1989). However, measured BCFs in fish for some of the PAHs exceed the bioaccumulation criterion, including fluoranthene, anthracene and pyrene (Table A5.8 in Appendix 5). For fluoranthene, Weinstein and Oris (1999) reported a BCF of 9054 L/kg ww in fathead minnows, Burkhard and Lukasewycz (2000) determined a BAF of 1550 L/kg ww in trout, and De Maagd (1996) determined a BCF of 3388 L/kg ww in fathead minnows. As previously mentioned, the Weinstein and Oris (1999) and De Voogt et al. (1991) studies, as well as Peterson and Kristensen (1998), reported high BCF values and contain sufficient levels of uncertainty, or the early life stage results cannot easily be interpreted versus other studies or regulatory criteria for bioaccumulation. The findings of these studies were thus considered equivocal and received a lower weighting for determining bioaccumulation potential according to criteria. The high laboratory BCFs are also not consistent with field measured BAFs in fish for fluoranthene. Consequently there is greater evidence weight and consistency from kinetic data, modelled BCF and BAF values, and laboratory and field evidence for vertebrates (i.e., fish) to suggest that vertebrates possess sufficient metabolic capacities and other elimination processes to mitigate body burdens of PAHs below levels considered by criteria to be high levels of bioaccumulation., 28588=Included in this Stream 2 screening assessment is the consideration of information on chemical properties, uses, exposure and effects, including the additional information submitted under section 71 of CEPA 1999. Data relevant to the screening assessment of these substances were identified in original literature, review and assessment documents, and stakeholder research reports and from recent literature searches, up to March 2010 for the human exposure and environmental sections of the document and up to September\u00a02011 for the health effects section of the document.

BCF and BAF model predictions are considered \u201cin domain\u201d for this hydrocarbon assessment because it is based on first principles. As long as the mechanistic domain (passive diffusion), global parameter domain (range of empirical log Kow and molecular weight), as well as metabolism domain (corrected metabolic rate [kM]) are satisfied, predictions are considered valid (Arnot and Gobas 2003, 2006). The kinetic mass-balance model developed by Arnot and Gobas (2003, 2004) was employed using metabolic rate constants normalized to both conditions of the study and a representative middle trophic level fish as outlined in Arnot et al. (2008a, b) when the BCF or growth-corrected elimination rate constant is known.

The final fuel product usually consists of a blend of HFOs and high-quality hydrocarbons that have been produced in the refinery or upgrader facilities. The HFOs considered in this assessment are complex mixtures composed of aromatic, aliphatic and cycloalkane hydrocarbons with carbon ranges spanning C7\u2013C50 and boiling point ranges of 121\u2013600\u00b0C (Table A2.1 and A2.2 in Appendix 2; API 2004; CONCAWE 1998). The ratio of aliphatic to aromatic hydrocarbons is important for estimating environmental behaviour; however, very few data exist for these five CAS RNs, so a ratio of 50:50 has been assumed. This ratio will not bias results and is within the range of other types of HFOs (50\u201379% aromatics) (ATSDR 1999; API 2004)., 180317=[BIOWIN] Biodegradation Estimation Program for Windows [Estimation Model].

None of the reported spills from 2000\u20132009 were greater than these threshold volumes during ship transport and therefore, the expected number of spills per year above this volume is zero. As well, the whole dataset from the Environment Canada Spill Line database for Bunker C was used as a surrogate for these HFOs. The amount of HFOs released is unknown, but is certainly less than the total volume of Bunker C. Thus, spills to fresh water and salt water during transport are not considered harmful to aquatic organisms., 175726=[API] American Petroleum Institute. 1986b.

[b] DSL, Domestic Substances List. These substances were identified as high priorities for action during the categorization of substances on the Domestic Substances List (DSL), as they were determined to present greatest potential or intermediate potential for exposure of individuals in Canada, and were considered to present a high hazard to human health. These substances met the ecological categorization criteria for persistence or bioaccumulation potential and inherent toxicity to aquatic organisms. These substances were included in the Petroleum Sector Stream Approach (PSSA) because they are related to the petroleum sector and are considered to be of Unknown or Variable composition, Complex reaction products or Biological materials (UVCBs). These HFOs are a group of complex combinations of petroleum hydrocarbons that serve as blending stocks in final fuel products or as intermediate products of distillation or residue derived from refinery distillation or cracking units. The final fuel products usually consist of a blend of HFOs, as well as higher-quality hydrocarbons as diluents. The HFOs considered in this assessment are complex combinations composed of aromatic, aliphatic and cycloalkane hydrocarbons with carbon ranges spanning C7\u2013C50 and a", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
