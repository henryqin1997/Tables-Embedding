With the Innovating Innovation Challenge, we\u2019re looking for examples and ideas that will help us how build innovation into the woof and warp of our organizations.\u00a0 While there aren\u2019t many businesses that have yet made innovation a true core competence, we can, with your help, build a composite picture of how every element of a company\u2019s management model can be retooled to make it innovation-friendly.\u00a0\u00a0 While no one organization has put all the pieces of the innovation puzzle together, we should be able to assemble all of the pieces in one place\u2014via this M-Prize challenge.\u00a0 In doing so, we\u2019ll give managers around the world the chance to identify the missing pieces in their own innovation programs, and to learn from companies that may have found a piece they\u2019re still looking for. As human beings, we are born with a creative impulse\u2014with an innate desire to use our imagination to better the world around us.\u00a0 Yet too often, our organizations end up being less innovative than the people within them.\u00a0 Working together, we can change this. We all get it: innovation is the lifeblood of every organization. Yet more often than not, when innovation occurs, it\u2019s a \u201chappy accident\u201d rather than the product of a deep-rooted innovation competence.\u00a0 Fact is, most companies aren\u2019t very good at game-changing innovation.\u00a0 That\u2019s why it\u2019s usually the newcomers, rather than the incumbents, who upend industry", "textAfterTable": "And if there\u2019s something\u00a0else\u00a0your company is doing to strengthen its innovation DNA, we\u2019d like to hear about that, too!
