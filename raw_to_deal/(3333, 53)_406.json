It runs very cool even at low fan speeds with only 41C in idle and 52C under 100% load. The next best cooler, Noctua NH-C12P, we\u2019ve reviewed does match the 41C, but is only able to cool at 54C at default speeds. The V8 is able to even outperform that by reaching a record low 38C on Idle and only 50C under load. It\u2019s interesting to have a cooler that supports both the PWM function and have a VR controller, giving the V8 the best of both worlds. Conclusion The Cooler Master V8 is by far the best performing cooler we\u2019ve reviewed on this test system. It offers such a unique design and provides a whole ton of features. The PWM and VR Controller combined help give the V8 its powerful cooling performance. Powerful enough for overclocking capabilities this is by far the best product I\u2019ve seen on the market for cooling any CPU, whether it\u2019s an i7, LGA 775, or AMD based socket the Cooler Master V8 has them all. With a price range between $60 and $70 it certainly isn\u2019t the cheapest out there, but then again it isn\u2019t the most expensive. If you\u2019re looking for an excellent air cooler the V8 is definitely your best choice. On the other hand you could be a car junkie and just like the idea of having a product named", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
