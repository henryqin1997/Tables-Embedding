Though Gale developed the original concept for the Posse, credit is often incorrectly given to Henry L. Beach, of Portland, Oregon. Beach was a retired mechanic who repaired and sold dry cleaning equipment who popularized the Posse in the mid\u00ad late 1970s. \" Posse Comitatus\" is Latin for \" power of the county\" and refers to the belief that the county sheriff is the highest law enforcement officer in America. The Posse has been most popular in rural and agricultural areas, particularly the Midwest, Great Plains and Pacific Northwest, although Posse groups are active throughout the United States. Among other things, Posse members believe that: America is not a democracy and the nation was originally established as a \"White Christian Republic \" The Constitution is solely derived from a divinely inspired Bible and most laws passed by Congress and state legislatures are unconstitutional; The income tax and the federal reserve banking system are products of a so\u00ad called \" International Jewish Conspiracy;\" Christian Common Law supersedes all other laws., 270331=HOWARD Prosecutor\u00a0 Room 12, Courthouse 117 N.

Some people on the picket line, and their supporters, regularly engaged in anti\u00ad Semitic rhetoric. On December 8, 1995, Roland Smith, one of the protesters, entered the store with a gun and lighter fluid. He doused the store and set it on fire. Eight people \u00ad including Smith died.

These range far beyond the view that Jews were \" Christ\u00ad killers\" and include conspiracy theories involving \" international bankers,\" the State of Israel, and groups ranging from communists to freemasons. Such views are spread by groups on the political right as well as on the left who find little basis for agreement except for their anti\u00ad Semitism. As in the past, these extremists have tried to exploit the hardships of Americans from unemployed industrial workers to hard pressed farmers. Similarly, extremists associated with some black nationalist groups have promoted anti\u00ad Semitic conspiracy theories within the black community, exploiting the pain of poverty and discrimination and exacerbating tensions between African\u00ad Americans and Jews.

In 1994, Congress added disability as a class in the HCSA for data collection purposes. The HCSA requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation to collect hate crimes data as part of its permanent uniform crime \u00ad reporting network based on voluntary reporting of hate crimes by state and local law enforcement agencies.

The group was originally established by Willis Carto, anti\u00ad Semitic founder of Liberty Lobby, as the \" Youth for Wallace\" campaign in support of the 1968 Presidential bid of Alabama Governor George Wallace. After Wallace lost the Presidential race, Carto renamed his organization the National Youth Alliance and attempted to recruit activists to his increasingly radical anti\u00ad democratic cause. In 1970, William Pierce, a former American Nazi Party (ANP) officer and editor of the National Socialist World, left the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP), the successor to the ANP, to join the National Youth Alliance. According to the Washington Post at the time, the National Youth Alliance attracted several former ANP activists. These extremists ultimately led the organization away from Carto's influence. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding. Carto accused Pierce of stealing the Liberty Lobby mailing list and sending the individuals listed on it \" poison pen\" letters that vilified Carto's group. The hostilities between the two men have not abated.
