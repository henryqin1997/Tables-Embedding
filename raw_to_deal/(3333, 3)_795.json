Objects include menu items, modules, categories, and component items (articles, contacts, and so on). Each object in the site is assigned to one access level. User groups are also assigned to each access level. If a user is a member of a group that in turn has permission for an access level, then that user can view all objects assigned to that access level. It is important to understand that user groups can be arranged in a parent-child hierarchy. If so, then a child group has access to all access levels that the parent group has access to. So you don't need to assign a child group access to levels that its parent group already has access to.", "The Debug Permissions report maps out the exact permissions for any given user group across all assets on your Joomla installation.", "The Debug Permissions report allows you to map out the exact permissions for any given user across all extensions on your Joomla installation.", "User Groups control what actions a user may take on the site and which objects a user can view.
