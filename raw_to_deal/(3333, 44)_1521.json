The following table lists iTunes-style metadata tags and the encoding/tagging software of a few podcasts: Used Tags Helpful tools to analyze MP4 audio are mp4v2 (including the tools mp4chaps, mp4art, mp4file, mp4info, mp4track) and faad, the Free Advanced Audio Decoder, can list AAC codec details and metadata tags. So far so good, but iTunes-style metadata isn't defined in any publicly available document. Its format is determined by the types of files that iTunes and the iTunes Music Store produce and provide (see AtomicParsley, MPEG4 Files, bottom). Some open source projects assembled a list of currently known iTunes tags: iTunes Metadata (mp4v2) and Known iTunes Metadata Atoms (AtomicParsley) Unfortunately no official metadata or tagging standard exists for MP4. The MPEG-4 specification just defines a standard place to put metadata, but there is no standard on any fields, except cprt for copyright :). Therefore different metadata styles are possible: iTunes-style metadata, 3gp-style metadata, MP4 ID3v2 tags and more. Most podcasts and audio files use iTunes-style metadata. The MPEG-4 container format is based on Apple's QuickTime container and each MPEG-4 file must have a major file brand. For example, an AAC audio file typically lists M4A as its major file brand. See AtomicParsley for a description of the MPEG-4 container and MP4 Registration Authority for a list of official file brand", "textAfterTable": "AAC Details, Chapter Marks and Images It's also interesting to analyze which AAC flavours (LC or HE AAC, for a short description see AAC Details) and bitrates are used. Furthermore we compared mostly Enhanced Podcasts, which contain chapter marks. And there are of course multiple ways to embed chapter marks in an MP4 audio stream (e.g. QuickTime chapters, Nero chapters), but basically all podcasts use QuickTime chapters.
