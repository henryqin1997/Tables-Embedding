Apocrine Adenoma References Complex & Mixed Apocrine Carcinoma Apocrine Ductal Carcinoma Apocrine Carcinoma Complex & Mixed Apocrine Adenoma Apocrine Ductal Adenoma Apocrine Adenoma Apocrine glands have both a secretory and a ductal component. The secretion empties into the infundibulum of the hair follicle (epitrichial). The cells that make the secretion are columnar with copious granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and the nuclei are located in the base of the cell. The secretion is produced when the apical portion (top) of the cell is cleaved into the glandular lumen. The secretory cells are surrounded by myoepithelial cells which are surrounded by the basal lamina zone. The apocrine duct is lined by cuboidal epithelial cells that form a double layer.
