First Nickel Inc. was incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in Toronto, Canada., 11154=First Nickel Inc. announced that it has received notice from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) that the TSX is reviewing the eligibility of the Corporation's common shares for continued listing on the TSX. Specifically, the TSX has advised that it is reviewing whether FNI meets the TSX's continued listing criteria in the following areas: the Corporation's financial condition and operating results; whether the Corporation has adequate working capital and an appropriate capital structure; and whether the share price of FNI's common shares has been so reduced as to not warrant continued listing. First Nickel is being reviewed under the TSX's remedial review process and has been granted 120 days to comply with all requirements for continued listing. If the Corporation cannot demonstrate that it meets all TSX requirements set out in Part VII of The Toronto Stock Exchange Company Manual on or before October 28, 2015, FNI's common shares will be delisted 30 days from such date. First Nickel intends to cooperate fully with the TSX review process, including with respect to the consideration of listing alternatives for its common shares. Any continued listing or alternate listing of the Corporation's common shares will be dependent on a number of factors. In light of the status of First Nickel's operations under the current nickel price environment, there can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to maintain a listing of its common shares on the TSX, or obtain an alternate listing on another exchange.}", "textBeforeTable": "Industry Average FNI Industry Analysis \u00a0 // ]]> } document.write(BW_adsys('Right3')); if (window.BW_adsys) { // <script type=\"text/javascript\"> <div class=\"\" style=\"width:300px; margin: auto; \"> <div class=\"ad\"> </div> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td class=\"noDataRR\" style=\"border:none;\" colspan=\"3\"><a class=\"link_xs\" href=\"../../sectorandindustry/industries/industrydetail.asp?code=151040\">View Industry Companies</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\">No competitor information is available for FNI.</td> <tr> <tbody> </thead> </tr> <td width=\"50\" align=\"right\">Change</td> <td width=\"75\" align=\"right\">Last</td> <td>Company</td> <tr> <thead> <table class=\"colRight\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"> <div class=\"clear\"></div> </div> <p class=\"note fLeft\" style=\"width:64%; text-align: right; padding: 5px 0; border-top: 3px solid #6B7B84; margin-top: 20px;\">Market data is delayed at least 15 minutes.</p> <h2 class=\"sectionTitle fLeft\" style=\"width: 35%; border-bottom: 0;\">FNI Competitors</h2> <div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; overflow: hidden;\"> <div class=\"\"> </div> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td width=\"75\" align=\"right\" class=\"noBorder\"><img src=\"/cgi-bin/upload.dll/file.png?z03ae0f0az0f8770c6547d4f128d68890ae1251309\" width=\"60\" height=\"15\" galleryimg=\"no\" symbol=\"CA;FNI\" /></td> <td align=\"right\" width=\"45\" class=\"noBorder\"><span class=\"unchanged\">0.00</span></td> <td align=\"right\" class=\"noBorder\">C$0.01 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">CAD</span></td> <td scope=\"row\"> <a class=\"link_xsb\" style=\"text-align:left\" target=\"_top\" href=\"../../stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=FNI:CN\"> FNI:CN </a> </td> <tr class=\"lastRow\"> <tbody> </thead> </tr> <td colspan=\"4\">Recently Viewed</td> <tr> <thead> <table class=\"miniTable\" summary=\"Recently viewed\"> </form> </fieldset> <a style=\"font-size:11px;\" target=\"_top\" href=\"../../common/symbollookup/symbollookup.asp\">Company Lookup</a> <input type=\"image\" name=\"submit\" src=\"http://images.businessweek.com/gen/buttons/stock_go_btn.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" /> <input type=\"text\" id=\"lookupSymbol\" class=\"symbol\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"symbol\" value=\"Stock, Fund, or ETF\" onfocus=\"if(this.value == 'Stock, Fund, or ETF') this.value = '';\" onblur=\"if(this.value ==", "textAfterTable": "View Detailed FNI Financials \u00a0|\u00a0 View Sector Analysis Sponsored Financial Commentaries Sponsored Links Browse Companies A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z \u00a0|\u00a0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Report Data Issue To contact FIRST NICKEL INC, please visit www.firstnickel.com.
