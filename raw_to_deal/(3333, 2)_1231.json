A majority of my field testing was done with the SX65 set to Auto for white balance, scene selection, and focus, and it performed satisfactorily. There are more scene options if you choose to get specific, and the same goes for white balance. Also, should you want to be more hands-on with focus and exposure, you can control both by touching the spot onscreen you'd like the camcorder to draw its information from. For its low-end status, the SX65 performs reasonably well. It has an instant-on option that gets the camcorder powered up, with lens cover open, and ready to record very fast, triggered simply by opening the LCD (not an uncommon feature, but nice nonetheless). The autofocus is responsive, but when zoomed out it does hunt, trying to focus, particularly in low-light conditions. The rated battery life for the included pack is 105 minutes of continuous shooting; expect less if you're frequently turning it on and off and reviewing clips. Extended-life batteries are available, one of which Sony claims has a life of up to 13 hours of continuous", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
