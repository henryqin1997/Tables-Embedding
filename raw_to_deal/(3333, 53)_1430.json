The measurement of insulation resistance is a common routine test performed on all types of electrical wires and cables. As a production test, this test is often used as a customer acceptance test, with minimum insulation resistance per unit length often specified by the customer. The results obtained from IR Test are not intended to be useful in finding localized defects in the insulation as in a true HIPOT test, but rather give information on the quality of the bulk material used as the insulation.

Test the megger before use, whether it gives INFINITY value when not connected, and ZERO when the two terminals are connected together and the handle is rotated. During Meggering: Make sure when testing for earth, that the far end of the conductor is not touching, otherwise the test will show faulty insulation when such is not actually the case. Make sure that the earth used when testing for earth and open circuits is a good one otherwise the test will give wrong information Spare conductors should not be meggered when other working conductors of the same cable are connected to the respective circuits. After completion of cable Meggering: Ensure that all conductors have been reconnected properly. Test the functions of Points, Tracks", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
