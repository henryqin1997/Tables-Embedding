Emphatically recommended to use Virtual Box with a desktop of 4:3 ratio, Host name: Demo System, Username: PC-BSD_User, which would allow for consistency, universality, and genericness. Use a white desktop background to easily capture individual windows or icons. Expand the Virtualbox window to be larger than the enclosed desktop (desktop will be surrounded with a white frame). The excess white background of cropped images is easily selectable by contiguous shape or color. Next, either invert the selection to cut/copy then paste into a new canvas, or delete the selection so it will be replaced with the alpha transparency. When cropping selections, use the zoom tool to enlarge the work area to prevent loss of details or enable addition of transparency for rounded corners. Where possible, resize windows so that their entire content can be shown without scrollbars.
