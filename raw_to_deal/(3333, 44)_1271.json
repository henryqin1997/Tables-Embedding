I need to test how it performs under load, verifying the voltages and airflow. With that being said, we can finally start testing this beast. To put this power supply through its paces, I will run a series of tests to load it as heavily as I can with the system I have. The testing procedure will include running Stressprime 2004 Orthos Edition to stress the CPU and memory, HDtune to load the Hard drives, and 3DMark06 Professional to stress both video cards. The test system includes 5 high cfm Silverstone fans to add additional load to the 12 volt line. Additionally, I will check the airflow at both idle and load conditions to verify any increase in airflow through the rear of the power supply. Voltage measurements will be taken with my trusty voltmeter, while airflow will be tested using my Kestral 4100 pocket airflow tracker., 795=Power - it's what we need to run this addiction of ours. The more the better, is the current thinking. With the newest video cards using up to 300 watts of power, it's no wonder that power supplies are beefing up to meet that demand. Many people, however, are still following the same routine with regards to the power supply; it's usually the last thing on the list when planning your dream system. You have just a few of those precious dollars you work so hard for left to purchase one, so you end up with a cheap 400-600 watt power supply, trying to feed that power hungry set of video cards. So you ask yourself, \"Why do they not perform as they should? Why can I not overclock the card at all?\" It may be your lack of power! One possible solution for your problem could be the Ultra X3 1000 watt modular power supply. Boasting such features as Active PFC, Flex Force cabling, modular design, 70 amp 12v rail, and a 135mm cooling fan, it has all the makings of a beast of a power supply.}", "textBeforeTable": "Here is the list of included cables. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 All of the cables are flat, and the connections are labeled to make hooking them up a simple process. One thing that I had not seen before was a pin missing on the ATX 24-pin power connector. The missing pin is a +5v connection on all of the other power supplies I have used. A quick call to Ultra assured me this was how it was designed and is not an issue. So far, none have been noticed. \u00a0 \u00a0 The cables that Ultra includes feature \"Force Flex\" technology. Huh? What this means is that the cabling is more manageable (aka. more flexible), allowing for better airflow through your case, and the ability to hide the cables better due to their design. The cables are coated in a color that is quoted as \"titanium,\" but is closer to black than anything else. The cables range from 7.5 inches to 29.5 inches in length. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ultra provides a pretty robust cable set with this", "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 Installation: Whether you are installing a power supply as a replacement or on a new build, the process is pretty much the same. In this case, I will be using this power supply as a replacement for my existing one. The first thing you will need to do on a replacement is to power down your computer and disconnect the main power cord that comes from the wall. Remove the case side panels to get access into your case and disconnect all of your current power connections. Once that is accomplished, you can safely remove the current power supply by removing the four mounting screws and pulling out the power supply and the bundle of snakes (wires) that will follow it out of the case. Now we can install this new beast of a power supply. With this being a modular power supply you mount the power supply into your case with the four provided screws and start attaching only the cables you need for your system. Tidy up your wiring, reassemble your case, plug it in the wall, and you are ready to go. \u00a0 \u00a0 To install the connectors into the power supply, you push in until you hear the connector lock into place. No fuss, no muss. One issue that I ran into was that the top exhaust fan in my case now interfered with the connections", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
