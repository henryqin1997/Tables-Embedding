You must attach the 25-pin loopback plug to the serial port on the Serial Asynchronous Interface Patch Panel that is being tested. This test cannot be run concurrently with the Echo-TTY option enabled.\u00a0 Echo-TTY\u00a0 Checks the proper operation of the serial port selected in the Serial Port selection of the option menu by echoing characters typed on a TTY terminal keyboard to the TTY terminal screen. The characters you type on your TTY keyboard display on the TTY screen.\u00a0 NOTE: A TTY connection to the Serial Asynchronous Interface serial port requires corresponding character size se up.
