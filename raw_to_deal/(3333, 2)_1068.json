Another way to look at this is that over the last five years, the A\u2019s have had 20 players who had a .275 TAv in 400 or more plate appearances. Five of them were in 2006, four in 2007, two in 2008, five in 2009, and three last year. Four of them were Jack Cust. Only three were corner infielders. One was Matt Holliday, who was a carpetbagger. Only two remain with the A\u2019s\u2014Mark Ellis and Ryan Sweeney. Most recent A\u2019s have been slow, didn\u2019t hit for great power, and haven\u2019t been notably selective, formerly a hallmark of the club (Barton is the exception). \u00a0This year, they are underperforming according to their limited lights. Granted, it\u2019s the manager\u2019s job to cajole them out of their doldrums, but that\u2019s easier said than done, and it\u2019s not certain that many of these A\u2019s have another gear besides \u201cdoldrums\u201d\u2014perhaps \u201creverse doldrums,\u201d but that\u2019s about the most you can ask for. It\u2019s like the Orioles and the eight managers they\u2019ve had going back to 1996. Maybe each and every one of them failed to make the most of what they had, but what if they had made the most of it? They would have constructed the world\u2019s most impressive anthill. If you\u2019re a bald orangutan in a fading ten-year relationship, \u201creverse doldrums\u201d probably describes your daily existence, but like the manager of the A\u2019s, any manager of the A\u2019s, you can\u2019t shift your outlook without the proper tools, tools which are likely impossible to come by. Even novelty is a transient substitute for youth, vitality, and potential. *** The first boy-girl dance party I ever attended was my friend Jeff\u2019s Bar Mitzvah. I was, appropriately, 13 at the time. I was incredibly insecure around the opposite sex, which was torturous because at that point I\u2019d already been longing for female company for a couple of years, though I probably wouldn\u2019t have known what to do with a girl if I had caught one\u2014my emotions hit puberty before my body did. What I quickly learned is that a precocious desire for romance paired with a crippling fear of rejection is a recipe for almost constant pain. Compounding my discomfort was a weird tendency I have to withdraw into myself at parties. I\u2019m there but not there, an observer, not a participant. I was in a double-bind. There was boy-girl stuff going on I desperately wanted to participate in, but I didn\u2019t know how to even begin, so I was depressed, and having already slipped into that state of mind where one watches and privately critiques instead of participating, it was like being two levels removed from the action., watching other kids having the fun that you want to have through a window, even as you want to be there. My best bet seemed to be to will myself to turn invisible, so I concentrated my efforts on that. Unfortunately, there was an impediment to my disappearing. One of the girls was determined to notice me. Because the universe is cruel, she was not one of the females present that I was attracted to, but rather a naggy, high-pitched Neverland fairy of a female who I had known since the second grade and had set a Steve record by being found annoying for over 1900 consecutive days. Perhaps even worse, Tinkertwit wasn\u2019t even interested in me; she just wanted someone to critique. Between every song, she would buzz around me, saying, \u201cYou should ask someone to dance! You should ask someone to dance!\u201d Lacking empathy, she failed to perceive that what I should have done and was capable doing were two very different things, and that given that limitation, the last thing I wanted was to have a constant, highly vocal presence drawing attention to my pathetic paralysis. It was slow torture: a song started, the couples paired up, I stood alone. The song ended, the couples parted, someone loudly pointed out my ongoing status as cadaver at the rodeo. An hour into the ordeal, she came back to me, as I knew she would. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you asked anyone to dance yet? You should ask someone to dance!\u201d Before I could think about what I was saying, the words were out: \u201cIf you really feel that way,\u201d I said to her, \u201chow about you and I dance?\u201d She stared back at me, wide-eyed. \u201cNo!\u201d she snapped, and went off to dance with another. The preceding has been the story of the San Francisco Giants and their 2.4 runs of support per game for Madison Bumgarner. \u00a0, 15183=2001, 16394=2008, 24704=2007, 8085=June 10, 2011, 16914=2011, 23042=2006, 16221=2007, 16741=2010, 16568=2009, 15356=2002, 15529=2003, 19596=As with cross-bay colleague Brian Sabean, in recent years Beane\u2019s team has done well drafting and developing pitchers, but has floundered badly when trying to build an offense.

As the offense has devolved over the course of the last ten years, the managers haven\u2019t had a lot to work with.

He was a good-natured fellow, always affable, but neither terribly bright nor good looking if I am any judge of my fellow males. He had a tendency to gain weight and his hairline was just beginning to recede. What I am trying to communicate here is that he had the look and bearing of an affectionate but aging orangutan suffering from mange and a bad case of geek taste. The store went out of business, as such stores are wont to do, and without it there was really no reason for us to socialize. We still live in the same town, though, and I pass him here and there, most often in the local bookstore, which is one of the few places I actually go (knowing that every trip is one of the last as bookstores go the way of the dodo and politically effective progressivism). At some point he began to have a young woman with him. Over time, at sightings spaced at roughly quarterly intervals, I became aware that it was always the same young woman. I saw them again last night in a local bar. They didn\u2019t look very happy. They ordered, then she picked up her phone and began texting while he sank his face into his open hands in what seemed to be a gesture of resignation or defeat. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re married or even romantic partners, but it seemed to me to be a portrait of a certain stage, not necessarily terminal, in a marriage in which romance has faded and one coasts on due to momentum. Still, seeing them there, I had to smile: it has probably been ten years since I started seeing them together. Who would have thought he would have gotten that far or lasted that long? It\u2019s good to know that there is someone for everyone\u2014if only for a little while. Having said that, I\u2019m not sure that there is a manager for Billy Beane and the Oakland A\u2019s. In yesterday\u2019s first reaction, our Rob McQwown was quoted as saying, \u201cFor a GM who claims the manager doesn't matter, Beane sure goes through a lot of them.\u201d That\u2019s not really true, though; since Tony LaRussa departed following the 1995 season, the A\u2019s have had just three managers, Art Howe, Ken Macha, and Bob Geren. In fairness to Howe and Macha, who have long since been written off as mediocrities, the A\u2019s won 91 or more games six times in seven seasons (2000-2006) under those two gentlemen and went to the playoffs five times, advancing to the ALCS in Macha\u2019s final year. The A\u2019s have had a very stable setup. Bob Melvin is their fourth manager since 1996, making the A\u2019s one of the least trigger-happy clubs in the business. Discounting short-term interim managers, the average for that period is five. The Marlins have had 10 managers. Four others have had eight. Just one team, the Cardinals, have had one manager for that entire time, having snapped up LaRussa after the A\u2019s let him go and never looked back, at least not publically. The issue for the A\u2019s is not rapid turnover but what the team is looking for in a manager beyond a babysitter given Beane\u2019s complete inability to field an offense since the beginning of the century. Back in 2001, the A\u2019s had a .275 True Average, good for third in the league. They haven\u2019t been that good since: \u00a0, 52727=Copyright \u00a9 1996-2015 Baseball Prospectus, LLC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Surprise Me!, 22204=2010}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 05:13:09 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "I used to know this rather dumpy fellow casually\u2014we both spent Friday afternoons hanging out at the same comic book store during college.
