Reference for settings Note that the templates found in the templates/ directory of the TracEnvironment have precedence over those found in [inherit] templates_dir. In turn, the latter have precedence over the installed templates, so be careful about what you put there, notably if you override a default template be sure to refresh your modifications when you upgrade to a new version of Trac (the preferred way to perform TracInterfaceCustomization being still to write a custom plugin doing an appropriate ITemplateStreamFilter transformation). There are two more entries in the [inherit] section, templates_dir for sharing global templates and plugins_dir, for sharing plugins. Those entries can themselves be specified in the shared configuration file, and in fact, configuration files can even be chained if you specify another [inherit] file there. Note that you can also specify a global option file when creating a new project, by adding the option --inherit=/path/to/global/trac.ini to trac-admin's initenv command.
