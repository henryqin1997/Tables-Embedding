A JSP page may also include JSP pages using the inheritance mechanism. For example, the index.jsp page associated with the Book resource class includes a footer.jsp page whose location is specified by the super class, Item. If a resource class inherits from another resource class, it will automatically inherit the JSP pages from the super class. The JSP variable it is automatically set to the instance of Bookstore so that the index.jsp, or count.jsp, has access to the Bookstore instance as a Java bean. JSP pages are associated with resource classes. These JSP pages are resolved by converting the fully-qualified class name of the resource class into a path and appending the last path segment of the request URI path to that path. For example, when a GET is performed on the URI path \"/\", the path to the JSP page is /com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/. For this example, since the last path segment is empty, index.jsp is appended to the path. The request then gets forwarded to the JSP page at that path. Similarly, when a GET is performed on the URI path count, the path to the JSP page is /com/sun/jersey/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/count.jsp.
