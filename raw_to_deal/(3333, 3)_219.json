To characterize some of the cell-cell connections that may be important for MO differentiation we cocultured human MO with lymphocytes and/or with platelets. We found that intact platelets strongly promoted MO maturation under serum-free conditions as evident from the expression of differentiation-dependent antigens and morphology. To further characterize the differentiation-inducing component(s) we prepared membrane and cytosol fractions of platelets. Both fractions could induce MO maturation, comparable to intact platelets. Further centrifugation of the cytosolic fraction revealed that only the pellet of ultracentrifugation, e.g., membrane fragments, could induce MO differentiation. Digestion with either trypsin or neuraminidase could only partially inhibit this effect.
