Very happy with purchase MARY on 1/12/15 My husband is an average size man \u2013 he is 5 ft 11 inches and weighs around 190 lbs. This tub was actually a great size for him. He loves the whirlpool and air jets. He is finally able to enjoy the bath knowing that he is able to get in and out of it easily. The tub is quite roomy. The seat width is fine and the area is very comfortable for his legs. The fast drain is a great option that we purchased. He can get out of the tub sooner than he could since the water exited quicker. Write a Review Only registered users can write reviews.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
