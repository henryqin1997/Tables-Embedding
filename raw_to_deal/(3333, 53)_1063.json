So if you\u2019re going to do a lot of random dungeons then you might as well slap on a tabard and get your reputation and Ambassador achievements early on. It only takes about 10 dungeons in your level range to get from Neutral to Exalted with each race. That led me on a quest to find out which dungeons had changed their level requirements on us, and I happened to stumble onto such a list this morning. A lot of them stayed the same, or at least close enough that it doesn\u2019t really make that much of a difference, while others took on pretty big changes. There have been a lot of changes with the 4.x patches, and with so many changes it\u2019s often easy to overlook some them. Recently my wife has decided to level a Hunter and in our quest to get her some good one-handed weapons from dungeons we found out that the level requirements for one of them in particular (RFK) had changed. 01 Dec New Level Ranges: Dungeons and\u00a0Battlegrounds Tags: 4.0.3a, Alliance, Class Quests, Dual Spec, Dual Specialization,", "textAfterTable": "Most of the low level dungeons didn\u2019t change a whole lot, though we did see a small drop in Gnomeregan\u2019s level. The most surprising one to me was Razorfen Kraul which jumped up to a level 30-40 instance which pushed it\u2019s companion instance, Razorfen Downs, up to a level 40-50 instance. I\u2019m not sure what the reasoning was for those changes unless they just felt there weren\u2019t enough options in those brackets. As we push on into the mid-level range of vanilla instances we also see a drop in Marauden\u2019s level as well as Dire Maul. One of the most surprising changes of all for me was seeing Scholomance as 38-48 when that was always one of the top instances in vanilla to me. Moving on to the later levels we see much of the same, though several off them got slight modifications to level ranges. Stratholme dropped a few levels which makes me really happy as I actually have a chance of getting it in my random queues while leveling now. Blackrock Depths jumps up a bit as does Sunken Temple, and Upper and Lower Blackrock Spire cap us off as the highest level dungeons. Most of these changes don\u2019t mean a whole lot for leveling your toons except that you\u2019ll see a few new faces while leveling if you\u2019re a fan of LFG (like me).
