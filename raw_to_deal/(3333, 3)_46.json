ICSC and/or Material Safety Data Sheets The IPCS intends to generate approximately 2000 Cards in the next six years. Efficient support from IPCS PIs specialized in chemical safety and through international cooperation with European Union could lead to a production rate of about 350 Cards per annum, i.e. approximately 25 Cards per PI and per year with a group of 15 PIs. Magnitude of the task: Who prepares the cards? The ICSC are prepared by various IPCS Participating Institutions (PIs) and go through several steps of consultation and editing: comments are requested from Industry and Poison Control Centres as outlined in the attached process flow-chart. Eventually the ICSC are peer reviewed by a group of international experts and the importance of this last step is paramount. It is believed that it represents a significant asset of the ICSC versus other packages of information prepared at national, local or professional levels. Manufacturers of chemicals and representatives of employees and workers' associations are invited as observers to the peer-review meetings. The addition of national regulatory measures/standards can be made to the ICSC; the format contains free space to accommodate such information as well as other national viewpoints if required. Are ICSC authoritative?", "textAfterTable": "However, MSDSs and the ICSC are not the same. The MSDS, in many instances, may be technically very complex and too extensive for shop floor use, and secondly it is a management document. The ICSC, on the other hand, set out peer-reviewed information about substances in a more concise and simple manner. While not a legal document, the ICSC is an authoritative document emanating from WHO/ILO/UNEP. This is not to say that the ICSC should be a substitute for an MSDS nothing can replace management's responsibility to communicate with workers on the exact chemicals, the nature of those chemicals used on the shop floor and the risk posed in any given work place. Indeed, the ICSC and the MSDS can even be thought of as complementary. If the two methods for hazard communication can be combined, then the amount of knowledge available to the safety representative or shop floor workers will be more than doubled. The ICSC could serve as a model for disseminating chemical safety information to workers. Dissemination of the cards The ICSC are available from the European Commission and the translated versions are being made available through national authorities (i.e. Ministry of Labour, Ministry of Health, and Health and Safety National Authorities). The posting of these cards on the Internet may alleviate the practical constraints implied by all the aspects of the distribution of the ICSC. More importantly, national authorities have the opportunity to add to the Cards brief explanations", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
