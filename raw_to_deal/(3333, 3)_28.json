This is the world\u2019s largest meeting of the radiological professions. Meetings of AAPM Chapters vary from single lecture evening presentations to whole day meetings in a local or regional setting and provide an opportunity to build local collegiality. AAPM Group meetings are committees, task groups, working groups and others who meet as necessary throughout the year. The AAPM supports virtual meetings of its committees using a variety of web-related tools. AAPM Specialty Meetings are opportunities to study a more focused medical physics topic in a regional setting as well as virtual meetings or Webinars. The very popular annual AAPM Summer School provides an opportunity for the intensive study of a broad medical physics topic in an informal setting that provides an opportunity to build national collegiality.", "textAfterTable": "2012 March 17 - 20 Dallas, TX Meeting Home Pictures 2011 April 30 - May 3 Chattanooga, TN Meeting Program 2010 May 22 - 25 San Antonio, TX Meeting Program 2009 May 2 - 5 Virginia Beach, VA Meeting Program 2008 May 3 - 6 Seattle, WA Meeting Program Future Summer Schools Year Dates Location Links Medical Physics Leadership Academy 2016 June 12 - 16 Westfields Marriott Conference Center Chantilly, VA Meeting Home Summer School Archive Year Dates Location Links Proton Therapy: Physical Principles and Practice 2015 June 14 - 18 Colorado College Colorado Springs, CO Meeting Home Pictures", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
