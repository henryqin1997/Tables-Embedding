He spends most of the rest of the Proslogion trying to work out God\u2019s properties (hint: they turn out to be remarkably similar to those of the Christian God). God exists. Since existing is greater than nonexisting and necessarily existing is greater than contingently existing, \u201cthat, than which nothing greater can be conceived\u201d must have the property of necessary existence. Things can exist in the mind, they can contingently exist in reality, or they can necessarily exist in reality. We define THE supreme being as \u201cthat than which nothing greater can be conceived\u201d. So for property n if you can conceive of some property m greater than n, the thing possessing property n is not God. Keep going up the chain until you can\u2019t conceive of anything greater. That thing is a property of God. When we talk about God, we are imagining a supreme being, in fact THE supreme being.
