Observe when the problem occurs. While right-clicking a particular file type? While right-clicking Folders? While right-clicking all file types? As said earlier, context menu handlers can load from any of these areas: Method 1 Method 1 is for advanced users. If you are not confident about dealing with registry, proceed to Method 2. This article describes the two methods to identify the problematic shell extension. Method 1 involves direct registry editing, which is for advanced users. Method 2 is user-friendly and suits most users (recommended method) Resolution These problems are caused by a bad context menu handler. A context menu handler is a shell extension handler that adds commands to an existing context menu (Example: cut, copy, paste, print, Scan with Norton etc). A poorly coded context menu handler may be causing any of the above symptoms. As context menu handlers can be added in different areas (file class, folder, allfilesystemobjects, HKCR\\* registry keys), it's a difficult task for an end-user to pinpoint which shell extension is causing the problem. Cause When you click \"Set up backup\" or click \"Change settings\" in Windows 7 Backup and Restore, nothing happens or the System32 folder opens. Device Manager link in the tasks pane does not work in Windows Vista Unable to launch applications (mainly Windows Installer shortcuts) from the recent programs list in the Windows Vista Start menu. Nothing happens when you click Slideshow or Print in", "textAfterTable": "If any of the symptoms occur when you deal with a folder, then you may need to inspect the context menu handlers loaded in these areas (AllFileSystemObjects, Folder, Directory). If it's only for a .txt file, inspect the file class of .txt file (HKCR\\txtfile). Open Registry Editor and backup the selected branch, delete the context menu handlers one-by-one. Related article Manage the context-menu entries for folders, drives and Namespace objects Method 2 - Using ShellExView to determine the Context-menu causing the problem ShellExView (by Nir Sofer) is an excellent tool\u00a0 to view and manage all installed shell extensions. If available, it displays the description, as well as version details, company information, location, file name and more. You can optionally disable/enable any item, which can be very useful to disable an extension, that you don t need or that has been left behind in your right click menu from a previous software install. Effective usage of ShellExView to resolve right-click problems Download ShellExView (from nirsoft.net) and run it. It will scan the registry for all the shell extensions.
