Without launching a batch of fake identical projects, it is impossible to determine whether lower priced rewards cannibalize demand for higher priced ones. That said, we\u2019ve always been confident that sub-$25 rewards offer an affordable way to get more people involved in a project, and this data does not change our mind. Remember, additional backers don\u2019t only offer additional money, they also spread the word. The lower priced levels are also significant. Reward tiers under $25 constitute a combined 38% of pledges and 10% of dollars raised on Kickstarter. $10 rewards are the third-most popular (ninth in dollar contributions to the site), and $5 rewards are the sixth-most popular (17th in dollar contributions). But pledges aren\u2019t just about dollars raised. Take the $25 level. Though it only represents 8.14% of aggregate dollars pledged, it\u2019s actually the most popular reward tier, representing 18.41% of all rewards chosen (the tallest blue bar above). $50 reward pledges make up 13.57% of all backings. Looking at the totality of successful projects, $50 rewards make up 11.44% of aggregate dollars pledged versus Craig\u2019s hypothesized 25% \u2014 though it is the second largest tier. $100 rewards are the highest-grossing level, representing 16.36% of collected pledge dollars despite ranking fourth in reward popularity.", "textAfterTable": "The Trough When Craig examined his project, he noticed that it dragged during the middle of the campaign. Craig called this period the \u201cDead Zone\u201d; we call it the trough. When a project first launches, there\u2019s an immediate spike of activity as the creator starts spreading the word. And as a project nears its deadline, there\u2019s another spike as two things happen: 1. the creator and backers promote the project to make sure it\u2019s funded or that their friends get in before the end, and 2. people who\u2019ve been sitting on the sidelines (but meaning to pledge) finally jump in before the bell rings. In the above graph, I\u2019ve plotted five different duration-classes of successful projects as distinguished by their duration. (Projects tend to pick durations around common milestones \u2014 30 days, 45 days, and so on. To be more inclusive I used a rounding function to group different projects within 2.5 days of the milestones.) What\u2019s most significant about this graph is how uniform the shape of the curve is for all project durations. Most projects will get that burst of interest in the beginning and end \u2014 the middle is up to the creator to maintain momentum, typically through press, events, and other promotions. That\u2019s the shape that successful projects take. But how big a factor is a project\u2019s duration?
