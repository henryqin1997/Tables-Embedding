The first few times I wore them I sweated a little and got some black dye on my hands but nothing major and it hasn't happened since those first few times. You will need something thicker when it gets cold though. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u26055 by kajonshef When I recieved these gloves I was a little worried that they might not be as good as I hoped. Now that they are getting broke in,they are great. Glad I got them.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
