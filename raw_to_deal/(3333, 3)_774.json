The Growth Model will be calculated for Performance Indicators (i.e., the all student group and up to nine subgroups). Projected scores are calculated for all students - including students who are proficient. If a projected score cannot be calculated for a particular student, the student\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual score is used. The Growth Model will be applied to an AYP Performance Indicator only if the indicator cohort has not met AYP performance by any of the existing goals or targets. Actual, not projected, PASA scores, PSSA-M scores, 3rd grade scores, and 11th grade scores are always used, as well as the scores for any students with insufficient data points to make a projection.

Top Did this district/LEA meet any AYP measures through the appeals process? When initial AYP results are announced each year, schools and districts/LEAs have the opportunity to review the data that is utilized to determine AYP and request changes through the Bureau of Assessment and Accountability to correct any errors. Also, schools and districts/LEAs have the opportunity to appeal the AYP rulings through the Pennsylvania Department of Education if they believe their AYP identification was in error for statistical or other substantive reasons. Since all test performance targets/goals to meet AYP were met by TWIN VALLEY SD, appeals were not applicable. Top What does this report mean for TWIN VALLEY SD? Well done! This district/LEA has performed well this year, and appears to be on track to meet the goal of all students attaining proficiency in Reading and Math by the year 2014. This district/LEA may wish to review its improvement strategies and create an improvement plan to continue to meet AYP next year.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
