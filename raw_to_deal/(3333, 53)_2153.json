The build contains multi-arch support allowing full use of the 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture and supports both 64-bit and 32-bit applications. Java-only applications will run as 64-bit in the supplied configuration with no modification. The release uses Linaro Stable Kernel version 3.10 and is integrated with ARM Mali drivers for 3D graphics acceleration. The ARMv8-A reference software stack combined with the Juno ARM Development Platform (ADP) provides the ARM ecosystem with a foundation to accelerate Android availability on 64-bit silicon. The availability of this port is the culmination of a broad architecture enablement program carried out by Linaro, ARM and the ARM partnership. ARM partners will now have access to an AOSP file system with support for both 64-bit and 32-bit apps, together with a broad range of supporting material including the ARMv8-A FVP models, open source toolchain from Linaro and supporting documentation. For those with access to Juno, this release can be used to examine the internals of the Android Open Source Project in a running", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
