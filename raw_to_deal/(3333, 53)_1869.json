The percentage of insurance producers and insurance consultants participating in the survey is small relative to investment advisors, registered reps and dual registrants. What is more surprising and makes the data more compelling is that the insurance participants tended to agree with RIA/IARs more often than with registered reps. \u00a0 This is a fascinating result because there is broader participation by registered reps than last year, and because of the insurance consultants and producers.
