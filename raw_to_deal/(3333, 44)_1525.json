Placing any of these materials in the laser will get you perma-banned from the laser! WARNING:\u00a0Many plastics are dangerous to cut, so it's important to know exactly what plastic you have. Make: has a post describing how to identify unknown plastics. NEVER CUT THESE MATERIALS It is not always obvious which materials are dangerous. For example, polycarbonate (Lexan) produces flames, lethal chlorine gas, and hydrochloric acid, which will rapidly corrode both the laser cutter internals and the lungs of anyone who breathes in the fumes. Yet acrylic, which looks exactly like polycarbonate, cuts cleanly and safely, and is a very popular lasering material. So check and double-check your materials! The laser cutter can mark, engrave or cut a large variety of materials. However, some materials simply don't work well (e.g. most metals), and some are extremely dangerous to the machine and to any humans nearby. You must check this list before placing any item in the laser cutter.

Oily or resinous woods can catch fire Plywood/composite wood 1/4\" Glues in plywood sometimes don't cut well, charring rather than vaporizing. Interior finish grades generally perform better. MDF/engineered wood 1/4\" May experience charring when cut. Paper, card stock thin Cuts well and quickly. Use low power and high speed to prevent burnination. Don't stack multiple sheets, as this increases the chance of fire. Cardboard thicker Cuts well. Watch carefully, as it may catch fire. Watch for fire! Cork 1/4\" Quality of the cut depends on the quality of the cork. Engineered cork contains a lot of glue, and may not cut well. Avoid thicker pieces Acrylic (Lucite, Plexiglas, PMMA) 1/2\" Cuts well, leaves a smooth cut edge. Higher powers may leave smoke/scorch marks along the cut edges.
