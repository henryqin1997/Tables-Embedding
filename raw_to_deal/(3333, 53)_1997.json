It is a set of prefabricated plug-ins for OfficeFloor that enables OfficeFloor to work as a high performance Web Application Server. As you become more familiar with OfficeFloor, you will realise OfficeFloor is a very light weight and versatile plug-in application framework that provides open integration of software. The following tutorials cover developing OfficeFloor (WoOF) web applications. WoOF The tutorials are ordered so that each builds on the knowledge of the previous tutorials. It is therefore best to work though them in order. Once you have installed the OfficeFloor Eclipse plug-ins (by dragging the bottom left install icon to your Eclipse IDE) you have the tools ready for the below tutorials.

Governance Managing transactions with Governance. Thread Injection Thread injection to performance tune the application. Extend OfficeFloor OfficeFloor is a plug-in application framework that is highly extensible. For example, the WoOF functionality is provided by plug-ins (extensions) to OfficeFloor.
