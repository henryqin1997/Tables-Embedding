The orientation from this region to Borl\u00e4nge and Falun is also quite low. The Leksand-Gagnef-R\u00e4ttvik region, which meets the TTWA constraints, is a special case as their relatively small employment centers do not function as cores for a commuting field. This region, situated east of Lake Siljan, contains a number of interrelated settlements that do not differ much in size. Potential accessibility is low. Avesta and Hedemora-S\u00e4ter form one Intramax region and also a LLMA. However, the Intramax region stretches further to the west. The same applies to the Malung-Vansbro Intramax region, which occupies the most western part of the Ludvika LLMA.

As a result, the number of employed residents in the county is much larger than the number of jobs. Internal commuting in the hexagons is 25.6% of employed residents. This is much lower than for municipalities, where it is 71.3%. The origin\u2013destination matrix created for this study only contains flows within hexagons and between hexagons in the county. However, employed resident numbers include external out-commuters, Table 1 , flows from and to other counties can be calculated, too. On a county level, there is substantially more out-commuting than in-commuting (see i.e. A critical step in the data processing is the allocation of all individual origins and destinations to hexagons. Individual trips are then bundled into flows. The result is an aggregation from squares to hexagons. Next, commuting flows can be determined by interlinking the hexagon centroids of origins and destinations. External commuting, ]. One aspect related to this problem is the aggregation of point-based spatial objects into areal units of variable size, such as municipalities. Another aspect is that self-containment, the main criterion in labor market delineation, is difficult to use with very small base spatial units, as will be explained later. In this way, much commuting information is lost, especially in the larger municipalities.

Methods In this paper, the method of hierarchical clustering, using Intramax analysis, is being followed to delineate commuting regions, but avoiding the problem caused by the variable size of base spatial units and using residence-based self-containment and number of employed residents as indicators for the selection of configurations. The constraints used here as a benchmark are the minima of 66.67% self-containment and 3,500 employed residents set for travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) in Great Britain [ 8 ]. In TTWAs [ 9 ], size and self-containment criteria have been applied together with an interaction function, but a trade-off is used between self-containment and resident employed population. A TTWA has a large resident employed population and a high self-containment value. The size constraint used in this analysis is very low. In the TTWA delineation for Great Britain, a range between 3,500 and 25,000 employed residents is used now [ 10 ], whereas for Germany a constraint of 50,000 is seen as acceptable [ 11 ].
