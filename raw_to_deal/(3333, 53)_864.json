Some of the ingredients may have a different name than the one I listed. a. brown bean sauce: \u68d5\u8272\u8c46\u91ac never heard of this term in Chinese. Are you sure this is Chinese? \u539f\u78e8\u8c49 is ground yellow beans sauce, this ideograms is Cantonese. b.\u9ec4\u8c46\u9171 or \u9ec3\u91ac or \u539f\u78e8\u8c49 all are yellow bean sauce. \u9ec4\u8c46\u9171 literally means yellow bean sauce, \u9ec3\u91ac means yellow sauce common term used in Northern China (not Cantonese), \u539f\u78e8\u8c49 means ground beans (Cantonese) Recipes on my blog http://sunflower-recipes.blogspot.com/2009/03/mee-rebus.html All recipes on my blog using sweet yellow bean sauce can be sub with yellow bean sauce. Sweet yellow beans sauce \u751c\u9eb5\u91ac is made with fermented wheat flour (maybe some yellow beans and sugar. c.\u8fa3\u6912\u9171 This is chilli sauce not chilli paste. I did miss this out on the list will add this later. I don't normally add chilli sauce to cooking, preferred fresh chopped chilli or chilli bean paste \u8c46\u74e3\u91ac There are also chilli oil \u8fa3\u6912\u6cb9 d.plum sauce: \u9178\u6885\u91ac and \u51b0\u82b1\u6885\u91ac are the same. e. \u9ed1\u918b literally means black vinegar normally made with rice. \u9999\u918b means fragrant vinegar. There are various Chinese black rice vinegars, Chinkiang is a type of black vinegar normally called \u93ae\u6c5f\u9999\u918b directly translated as 'Chinkiang fragrant vinegar' f.\u767d\u918b literally means white vinegar can be made with rice or just acetic acid made with chemical. If it is stated \u7c73\u918b or \u767d\u7c73\u918b then it must be rice vinegar or white rice vinegar. I normally use white rice vinegar for pickling vegetables g.sesame paste: \u829d\u9ebb\u9171, this is correct. Very similar to tahini unless it is made with black sesame then the sauce is dark brown like peanut butter. Recipe on the blog. http://sunflower-recipes.blogspot.com/2009/07/bang-bang-chicken.html 2.other flavourings a.alcohol Fenjiu or Fen Chieu: \u6c7e \u9152, never use before. I don't think this is a cooking wine is a light and fragrant drinking wine. b.chinese cinnamon or bark of cassia: \u6842\u76ae or \u7389\u6842 both the same. Recipes http://sunflower-recipes.blogspot.com/search?q=cinnamon+bark c.\u7d39\u8208\u9152 literally means Shaoshing wine which is a brownish rice wine, mostly used for cooking unless it is of a good qualty or reserved quality. Shaoshing wine is best made in Shaoshing region in China. There are also Shaoshing wine made in Taiwan which I don't like at all. \u7d39\u8208\u82b1\u96d5\u9152 is 'hua tiao' wine also commonly referred to as Shaoshing wine because it is made in Shaoshing too. This should be better qulaity vookinh wine than any cheap Shaoshing wine or the one made in Taiwan. Confused??
