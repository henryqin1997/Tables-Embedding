Kitchen was adequate but there was no space in the fridge if I wanted to use it - a larger one for all guests would be preferable and why could we not use the main dining room to eat in please? Also why are there no evening meals provided at the hostel? There is a huge catering kitchen going to waste. As a long distance walker, and I was not the only one, why is the hostel only open at 5.30pm. Could users of the hostel not have a secure part to rest out of the heat and get water. 70% Tony, Mon 06 Jul 2015 H\u00fcbsche Herberge, \"wirklich freies\" Internet, sch\u00f6n gelegen in der Altstadt 93% Frieder, Sun 07 Jun 2015", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
