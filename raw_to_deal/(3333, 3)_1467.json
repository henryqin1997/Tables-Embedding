The CAPS field identifies the type of each network and the capabilities of the stations operating there: The interface must be up before it can scan.

Once familiar with these concepts, it is strongly recommend to use WPA to set up the wireless network. There are three basic steps to configure a wireless network: select an access point, authenticate the station, and configure an IP address. The following sections discuss each step. 31.3.4.1.2.1.\u00a0Selecting an Access Point Most of the time, it is sufficient to let the system choose an access point using the builtin heuristics. This is the default behaviour when an interface is marked as up or it is listed in /etc/rc.conf: wlans_ath0=\"wlan0\" ifconfig_wlan0=\"DHCP\" If there are multiple access points, a specific one can be selected by its SSID: wlans_ath0=\"wlan0\" ifconfig_wlan0=\"ssid your_ssid_here DHCP\" In an environment where there are multiple access points with the same SSID, which is often done to simplify roaming, it may", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
