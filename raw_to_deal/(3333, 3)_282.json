When the foam subsides, drop in the sliced plantains and cook, turning frequently, until the slices are golden brown or both sides. Transfer the plantains to a double thickness of paper towels to drain. In a small bowl, mix the grated cheese, sugar and cinnamon and set aside. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with a whisk or a rotary or electric beater until they are stiff enough to form unwavering peaks on the beater. In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks until they are thick and lemon colored, then with a spatula fold the whites into the yolks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees (F). Grease the bottom and sides of a deep 1 quart baking dish or mold, then sprinkle in 1 tablespoon of flour or bread crumbs, tipping the dish to spread the flour or crumbs as evenly as possible. Turn the dish over and rap it sharply to remove any excess. Ladle about a quarter of the egg mixture into the dish, and spread it with the back of a spoon.
