They should NOT be used to determine local water systems compliance with drinking water standards, nor should they be used to make personal judgements about individual health risks. Units: Sample measurements are taken and are regulated in milligrams per Liter (mg/L). 1 mg/L= 1 part per million, or one contaminant p art per one million water parts. Data for chlorite is presented in ppm. Results of Zero: A result of zero may indicate that a sample was analyzed, but that the result was less than the lowest value that the analytical method can reliably report.
