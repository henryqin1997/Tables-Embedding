The mapping from Sioux 1.x and Stronghold 2.x is only partial because of special functionality in these interfaces which mod_ssl doesn't provide. Configuration Directives Comments Custom Log Functions Environment Variables Configuration Directives mod_ssl mostly provides a superset of the functionality of all the other solutions, so it's simple to migrate from one of the older modules to mod_ssl. The configuration directives and environment variable names used by the older SSL solutions vary from those used in mod_ssl; mapping tables are included here to give the equivalents used by mod_ssl. This page covers backwards compatibility between mod_ssl and other SSL solutions. mod_ssl is not the only SSL solution for Apache; four additional products are (or were) also available: Ben Laurie's freely available Apache-SSL (from where mod_ssl were originally derived in 1998), Red Hat's commercial Secure Web Server (which was based on mod_ssl), Covalent's commercial Raven SSL Module (also based on mod_ssl) and finally C2Net's (now Red Hat's) commercial product Stronghold (based on a different evolution branch named Sioux up to Stronghold 2.x and based on mod_ssl since Stronghold 3.x).
