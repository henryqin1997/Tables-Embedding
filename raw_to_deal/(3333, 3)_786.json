So all their warming alarmist crap amounts to is 0.1degrees C in 36 years, or zero really since that would be within the margin of error for readings taken back in 1976 and converted from Fahrenheit., 21879=Speaking of climate alarmists, the ABC over and over on every bulletin, particularly during the Tassie bushfire coverage, made sure everyone knew it was not just the hottest January day ever recorded on the 4th at 40.9C, but in fact the hottest day ever recorded in 120 years of records.
