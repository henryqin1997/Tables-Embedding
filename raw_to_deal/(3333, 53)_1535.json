Engines constructed during World War 1 were given indiscriminate numbers by reusing brass number plates off scrapped locomotives. This commenced a trend that was used on many engines of other classes constructed during the 1920s and early 1930s. In 1920s, superheating was trialled on ten engines. Operation of these superheated engines proved costly despite tests proving savings in coal and water consumption. The principal problem was lubrication of slide valves with the higher temperatures. This caused wear and cutting of the valve and port faces with resultant steam leaks. The original cast iron valves were replaced with bronze ones but produced little improvement. In 1929, it was decided to not to superheat any more slide valve engines and those so fitted reverted to saturated steam as boiler renewals became necessary. Eleven engines were loaned to Commonwealth Railways in 1942. All were later returned when the traffic situation worsened in Queensland., 2360=The prototype, N\u00b0395, was the first engine to be built by the then new Ipswich Railway Workshops. It was the only QR engine with the exception of the Garratt classes to be fitted with a screw reverser. After successful trials, an order for a further 20 was placed in 1906 and construction began in earnest. The first engines had an unusual combined number and builder\u2019s plate mounted on the sides of the cab.
