Increase fiber gradually over a period of a few weeks. How much fiber is recommended? It is better to get fiber from foods rather than fiber supplements as foods are more nutritious. Eat less processed foods and more fresh ones. An increase in fiber should be accompanied by an increase in water. Eat the skin and membranes of cleaned fruits and vegetables. Choose fresh fruit or vegetables rather than juice. Switch to \u201cwhole grain\u201d breads. These breads list whole wheat, whole-wheat flour or another whole grain as the first ingredient on the label. Ideally, look for one with at least 3grams of dietary fiber per serving. Choose high fiber breakfast cereals (those that contain 5 or more grams of fiber per serving). Opt for cereals with bran or fiber in the name. Incorporating Fiber in Your Diet The best sources of fiber are whole grain products, raw or cooked fruits and vegetables and dried beans and peas. Refined or processed foods, such as fruit juice, white bread, pasta and non-whole-grain cereals, are lower in fiber content. This is because the refining process removes the outer coat (bran) from the grain, which lowers the fiber content. Additionally, removing the skin from fruits and vegetables decrease their fiber content.

The pouches, called diverticula, look like small protrusions or tiny balloons poking out of the side of the colon. A diet high in fiber is known to be very beneficial in the prevention and treatment of diverticulosis. \u00a0Dietary fiber increases the movement of food through the digestive track, promoting regular bowel function and the reduction of abdominal pain and gas.\u00a0 Fiber is most prevalent in raw, fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain products, high fiber cereals and bran.\u00a0 The daily recommended intake of dietary fiber is 20-35 grams for adults.\u00a0 Introduce additional fiber into your diet slowly in order to avoid bloating, abdominal gas and diarrhea.
