Classifiers in UML are represented as Java interfaces, implementation classes, and enumerations in the UML2 API. These types are generated using the (customized) EMF code generator, along with associated factory and utility methods. Classifiers The following subsections describe the changes to the classifiers, properties, operations, and constraints in the revised UML specifications which affected the API provided by UML2. It is worth noting that a number of the utilities and unit tests provided by UML2 were also modified in response to changes in the API. The UML2 project provides a Java API that is generated using a (customized version of) the code generation facility in EMF. In the past, this API has been generated from a source model produced by merging models of Infrastructure, Superstructure, and L3 compliance level of UML with custom extensions introduced by the UML2 project. As of UML 2.4, however, a reference model of the merged L3 compliance level of UML, serialized in UML format, has been provided along with the specification by the OMG. As a result, the API is now generated from a source model produced by merging this merged L3 reference model with custom extensions introduced by the UML2 project.
