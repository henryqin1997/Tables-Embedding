Cocoa powder such as Hershey's cocoa contains 108\u00a0mg (or 2.16%) of theobromine per tablespoon (5g) of powder.[14] However, cocoa powder with more concentrated amounts of theobromine up to at least 10% also exists.[15] Chocolate contains 0.5-2.7% theobromine, although white chocolate contains only trace amounts.[16] Theobromine can also be found in small amounts in the kola nut (1.0-2.5%), the guarana berry, and the", "textAfterTable": "Therapeutic usesEdit Following its discovery in the late 19th century, theobromine was put to use by 1916, where it was recommended by the publication Principles of Medical Treatment as a treatment for edema (excessive liquid in parts of the body), syphilitic angina attacks, and degenerative angina.[20] The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition notes that theobromine was once used as a treatment for other circulatory problems including arteriosclerosis, certain vascular diseases, angina pectoris, and hypertension.[21] In modern medicine, theobromine is used as a vasodilator (a blood vessel widener), a diuretic (urination aid), and heart stimulant.[2] In addition, the future use of theobromine in such fields as cancer prevention has been patented.[22] Theobromine has also been used in birth defect experiments involving mice and rabbits. A decreased fetal weight was noted in rabbits following forced feeding, but not after other administration of theobromine. Birth defects were not seen in rats.[23] PharmacologyEdit Even without dietary intake, theobromine may occur in the", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
