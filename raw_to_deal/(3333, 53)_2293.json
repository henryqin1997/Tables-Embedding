(B) RNAs were extracted from the mock and clone 4, and cDNA microarray analysis was performed as described in Materials and Method. Two lines indicate a 1:2 (lower) or 2:1 (upper) ratio between mock vs. VASH1 overexpressing clone 4., 26916=To improve the activity of transcription, we placed the CMV promoter of the pcDNA3.1/Hygro plasmid (Invitrogen) with the chicken \u03b2-actin promoter derived from pCALL2 [19]. This vector, pCALL2-pcDNA3.1/Hygro, was used for the transfection in this study. For the production of the VASH1 expression vector, the human VASH1 gene (5481 bp) containing the complete open reading frame (386 n.t.-1483 n.t.) [5] was cloned into the pCALL2-pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector at multiple cloning sites (Xho-I and Not-I). MS1 cells were transfected with the VASH1 expression vector by using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After the transfection, the cells were selected by hygromycin (500 \u03bcg/mL, Invitrogen). Following the selection, the cells were seeded at 0.3 cells per well in 96 well plates with 100 \u03bcL of culture medium in each well. The cells were later expanded into larger wells., 86685=\u00a9 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Briefly, extracted protein was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 7.5-10% separating gel and transferred to a Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). The membrane was incubated with anti-human VASH1 monoclonal antibody (Ab) [5], anti-VEGFR-1 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA), anti-sVEGFR-1 Ab (Zymed Lab., San Francisco, CA, USA), or anti-\u00df-actin Ab (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) as the primary antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions. The signal was visualized by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Immobilon Western, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with a LAS-1000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).}", "textBeforeTable": "Table 1.
