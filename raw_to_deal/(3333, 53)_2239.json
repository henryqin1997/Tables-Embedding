He confides in you that he doesn't think much of a father, especially since he's vanished 10 years ago onboard the Hugo Gernsback. Recently, however, he's received a distress signal from the Gernsback on Aeia. Jacob thinks he's just chasing ghosts, but would like to have some closure on the matter. He requests that you take him to the site for further investigation. 2175 Aeia is located in the Rosetta Nebula in Alpha Draconis. You're going to need some fuel and probes before you attempt the journey. When you reach the planet, you need to scan the planet surface for the distress beacon. Dispatch the probe once you have and land the shuttle., 164640=Tali sights something in the next corridor that causes her great grief. Now more than ever Tali must strengthen her resolve and she does, knowing that her commander is right behind her. The side room next to the body donates a plethora of items to help your cause, including power cells, Medi-Gel, and credits. March right into the next room to find a geth Prime waiting on the other side. Any more movement into the room catches their attention. Download some credits and snag the sweet model of the flotilla ship from the desk in front of you. Then, prepare to engage the Prime. Circle the transparent wall in order to stay mobile while retaining protection from the Prime's fire.}", "textBeforeTable": "Mass Effect 2 Xbox 360 Achievements Further up, examine the evacuation order and scout out the Platinum nearby as well. The burning rubble in the rock face straight ahead slightly obscures some damaged mech parts that can be salvaged for credits. Climb the rocks up to the signal transmitter in the center of the area and deactivate it. Behind it are some power cells and a security report. After deactivating it, LOKI mechs prepare to attack. At this point, a sandstorm hits and makes everything difficult to see. You now have to rush back to the shuttle in near zero visibility with hordes of mech closing in. To make matters worse, a YMIR mech stands as the final obstacle between you and a safe getaway. Bust out the heavy weapons to dismantle this bipedal monstrosity. Board the Normandy shuttle to complete the mission. A good scavenger, who leaves no rock unturned, no leaf unfurled, will find good booty to plunder: credits and Platinum. Continue ahead and you'll find a system status report. The path forks out, but both lead to the same big area with an evacuation order to examine. On the left trail you will find Platinum and a navigator's log. The team plans to investigate a crash site of a merchant freighter. During the scan, there was detection of some movement. Better pack your guns.
