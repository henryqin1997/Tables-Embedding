When viewing Excel pages in your web browser, clicking the 'Save As' option from the 'File' menu will bring up the 'Save As' dialog box. The default file format is .html, but to save as .xls (an Excel spreadsheet), select this file format from the 'Save as type' drop-down box. Excel will not allow two spreadsheets with the same filename to be open simultaneously, so you will need to close the original version in the browser window before attempting to open the saved version. Excel is not capable of displaying more than 65536 rows x 256 columns. To avoid causing errors, the number of series that can be downloaded in Excel has therefore been restricted to 250.
