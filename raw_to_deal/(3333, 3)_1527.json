The following table shows how the API version is determined based on the loading method: For HTML-based applications, the runtime version specified in the application descriptor alone determines which version of the AIR and Flash Player APIs are available to the application. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript behaviors are always determined by the version of Webkit used in the installed AIR runtime, not by the application descriptor. For SWF-based applications, the AIR runtime version specified in the application descriptor determines the maximum SWF version that can be loaded as the initial content of the application. Applications that specify AIR 1.0 or AIR 1.1 can only use SWF9 (Flash Player 9) files as initial content \u2014 even when run using the AIR 1.5 runtime. Applications that specify AIR 1.5, or higher, can use either SWF9 or SWF10 (Flash Player 10) files as initial content. The SWF version determines which version of the AIR and Flash Player APIs are available. If a SWF9 file is used as the initial content of an AIR 1.5 application, that application will only have access to the AIR 1.1 and Flash Player 9 APIs. Furthermore, behavior changes made to existing APIs in AIR 1.5 or Flash Player 10 will not be effective.
