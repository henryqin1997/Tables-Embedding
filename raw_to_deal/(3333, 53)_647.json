Overall, this has resulted in use of the highway types for arterial roads in the metropolitan areas, with the Primary Street type being available for collector-type roads. Unfortunately, we don't have the same standardized government-published maps to adopt here, but we can consider many of the same principles. This was first looked at in Edmonton, and seems to have been met with great success. With that in mind, we'd like to consider the following criteria for use within metropolitan areas and any city with a population exceeding ~40,000. In the event that the infrastructure of a smaller city has been designed with arterial routes, this may be adopted there, but will typically be less obvious. If the local government has published maps that define arterial and collector routes, please use those to set the street types. Changing of Types As a highway enters a city/town, it often becomes a named street, and sometimes would no longer fit the usual criteria for a \"highway\". Due to a number of reasons, including long-distance routing issues, as well as appearance, the highway should remain as the same type it entered the city/town (except if it's a Freeway -- if it no longer fits the Freeway criteria, it", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
