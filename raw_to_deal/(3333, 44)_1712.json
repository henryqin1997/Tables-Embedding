Status Description Snow/Ice Warning Continuous film of ice and water mixture at or below freezing (32\ufffdF / 0\ufffdC) with insufficient chemical to keep the mixture from freezing. This status can only be reported at Vaisala ESP and SP sites when precipitation occurs. Ice Warning Continuous film of ice and water mixture at or below freezing (32\ufffdF / 0\ufffdC) with insufficient chemical to keep the mixture from freezing. This status can only be reported at NTCIP sites. Snow Warning This status can be reported at NTCIP sites, but will not be reported by Vaisala NTCIP sites. Wet Below Freezing Moisture on pavement sensor with a surface temperature below freezing (32\ufffdF / 0\ufffdC). This status will only be reported at Vaisala SCAN Detector sites.
