Although there is no optional attached garage plan available for this plan, we would be happy to give you a free quote for the garage that you need upon receipt of your on line request, the link for which I have attached below. http://www.drummondhouseplans.com/plan-modification-services/online-estimate-form/plan/1002080.html Unfortunately, this is the largest of the similar designs that are part of the collection but we would be happy to provide an estimate for an enlarged version and you can request this at the same time as the garage addition. In respect of the confidentiality of our clients, you will understand that I am not able to give out their personal information with regards to addresses and/or phone numbers.
