The volunteers applied the anti-age products on the face twice a day, both in the morning and in the evening, for time periods ranging from 4 to 8 weeks.

In particular, a statistically significant difference between the age groups 51\u201360 and 61\u201370 years of age and the younger ones was evidenced ( Table 1 The analysis of the collected basal data ( 3.1. Skin Hydration 3. Results and Discussion \u2264 0.05. p , improvement or worsening in the considered parameters) obtained at the end of the period of application. The basal data and the related variations were divided in clusters corresponding to the different age groups. As regards skin hydration and elasticity, we considered five age groups. The data related to skin roughness were instead divided into four age groups in order to exclude women under 30 years old, who were usually not included in the anti-wrinkle efficacy studies. The instrumental values and their variations were statistically compared by means of One-Way ANOVA (analysis of variance) for parametric and independent groups of data. The groups of data were considered statistically significant for a probability value i.e. ], taken by means of silicone replicas (SILFLO, J&S Davis, Stevenage, UK) and image analysis (Quantilines, Monaderm, Monaco), were instead performed on the crow\u2019s feet wrinkles of the eye contour. In the analysis we included the basal data taken before the cosmetic treatment, and the variations", "textAfterTable": "Figure 1 Skin hydration basal values as a function of the age group.

This result is apparently inexplicable, considering that in literature the water content of the face skin is reported to decrease with ageing [ 8 , 9 ]. A possible explanation could be correlated to the group of volunteers we considered. The high skin hydration values recorded in women over 50 years old may depend on the life style of this age group: mature women living in a big city that take care of their skin and probably apply moisturizing face cream every day, thus improving effectively their basal skin hydration level. A second interesting result is that 61\u201370 years old women, apart from showing high basal skin hydration values, resulted also to be the most susceptible to improvement after a cosmetic treatment ( Figure 2 ). In fact, by comparing the improvements in skin hydration values recorded", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
