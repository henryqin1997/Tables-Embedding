The injectors operate at 11 psi fuel pressure. Unfortunately, the manifold on the Corvette has very small runners (to improve low end torque and mileage) that severely limit potential horsepower increases. The valve covers (R - 14050240, L - 14050239) and air cleaner housing (PN 25041409) are made of magnesium to reduce weight. The water pump (10048919) is aluminum, and the factory equipped this engine with 'shorty' stainless steel headers (R - 1405730, L - 14057029). The block has 2-bolt mains, and a passenger side dipstick. The crank is cast iron.
