Same basic design but optimized for the fixed kingpin. Truck is slightly slimmer than the original version. Shortened front end: For those who want to get aggressive with their short forward mounts can now do so with plenty of room to spare so\u00a0the plate will not hang over the front of your boot. The Avenger is optimized for the short forward set up but a standard mount is still\u00a0possible.\u00a0 Aluminum alloy / Magnesium alloy*: Unique weight saving techniques have allowed us to cut the aluminum Avenger by 12% when\u00a0compared to the standard Invader plate. Magnesium alloy being even lighter we were able to save an additional 15%, this is a total of 27%\u00a0from the standard Invader. Hollow center: Hollowed out center section to save weight. Along with the hollow center we raised the height to increase the rigidity\u00a0length wise. When compared to the Invader plate the weight savings will be greater with the larger sizes but you can expect a significant decrease in weight when compared to the standard Invader plate.\u00a0 Hollow kingpin: Specially designed kingpin for this plate only. 30% lighter than a traditional kingpin using hardened prime grade steel.", "textAfterTable": "Please note- mounting hardware is not supplied.
