The solution will become more basic at the higher temperatures, so you compensate by lowering its pH to begin with. The protocols I've seen call for adjusting the pH down to between 4.5-6.5, either with 1 M citric acid or 1 N HCl, for use at hybridization temperatures between 60\u00b0-70\u00b0 C. I'm still hybridizing at 55\u00b0 C. and don't bother to adjust it. some protocols call for 50 \u00b5g/ml tRNA as additional carrier and competitor (my probe stocks already contain some tRNA) you can use regular autoclaved ddH2O to make up this solution good molecular biology grade formamide doesn't need to be de-ionized or filtered before use 50% formamide (molecular biology grade), e.g. Roche #1 814 320 (500 ml) 5x SSC (20x SSC stock) 100 \u00b5g/ml fragmented salmon testes DNA (10 mg/ml stock), e.g. Sigma #D-1626 50 \u00b5g/ml heparin (10 mg/ml stock), e.g. Sigma #H-3393 0.1% Tween Hybridization solution= find the best final concentration at which to use your stock: various protocols call for a", "textAfterTable": "10x Dinitrophenyl (DNP) RNA labeling mix= you have to make it up yourself, using: DNP-11-UTP (250 nmol, 10 mM), Perkin Elmer #NEL 555 and Ribonucleoside Triphosphate Set (100 mM NTPs), Roche #1 277 057 use the same NTP concentrations as are in the Roche 10x labeling mixes, including the same relative amounts of the normal and modified UTPs. 2x carbonate buffer= 120 mM Na2CO3 80 mM NaHCO3 pH to 10.2, aliquot and store at -20\u00b0 C.
