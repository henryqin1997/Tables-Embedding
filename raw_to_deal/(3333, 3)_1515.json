Your exemption from tampering is valid only if the conversion is installed on the OEM test groups/engine families and/or evaporative emissions/refueling families listed on the certificate. For example, if you have received a clean alternative fuel conversion certificate of conformity in conversion model year 2011 for converting a 2010 model year OEM test group/evaporative/refueling family, your exemption from tampering continues to apply for the conversion of the same 2010 model year OEM test group/evaporative/refueling family as long as the conditions under which the certificate was issued remain unchanged, such as small volume manufacturer status., 178249=(3) Operators of urban buses covered by this subpart which have upgrade kits installed prior to January 1, 1995, may assume that such urban buses are operating at the PM level of the upgraded engine configuration for purposes of meeting the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section., 349012=This section applies for aircraft meeting the definition of motor vehicle in \u00a785.1703., 8407=e-CFR data is current as of July 31, 2015, 293780=(B) SFTP emission standards specified in 40 CFR 86.1811 and 86.1816 for all pollutants., 62526=(12) Your exemption from the prohibition on tampering remains valid for the applicable conversion test group/engine family and/or evaporative/refueling family, as long as the conditions under which you previously complied remain unchanged, such as small volume manufacturer or qualified small volume test group/engine family status.

For example, if you have complied properly with the provisions in this section in calendar year 2011 for converting a model year 2006 OEM test group/evaporative/refueling family, your exemption from tampering continues to apply for the conversion of the same model year 2006 OEM test group/evaporative/refueling family as long as the conditions under which the notification was submitted remain unchanged., 321947=4All 1982 OP year and later light-duty trucks sold to, or owned by, an importer for principal use at a designated high-altitude location shall meet high-altitude emission standards according to the requirements specified in 40 CFR part 86 for current model year light-duty trucks at the time of testing., 261264=(1) If a significant number of vehicles imported by a certificate holder fail to comply, in the judgment of the Administrator, with emission requirements upon inspection or retest, or if the certificate holder fails to comply with any provision of these regulations that pertain to vehicles imported pursuant to \u00a785.1509, the certificate holder may be placed on the EPA list of certificate holders ineligible to import vehicles under this section as specified in paragraph (j) of this section and \u00a785.1513(e);, 199195=(3) Emissions test results shall be measured over the heavy-duty engine Federal test procedure or an approved alternative test procedure prescribed under \u00a785.1414., 520739=(C) The procedures used for part aging for durability demonstration were not in substantial compliance with the durability cycle required by \u00a785.2114., 468721=(j) Certification vehicle emission margin for a certified engine family means the difference between the EPA emission standards and the average FTP emission test results of that engine family's emission-data vehicles at the projected applicable useful life mileage point (i.e., useful life mileage for light-duty vehicles is 50,000 miles and for light-duty trucks is 120,000 miles for 1985 and later model years or 50,000 miles for 1984 and earlier model years)., 249297=(7) Documents providing evidence of compliance with all relevant requirements of the Clean Air Act, the Energy Tax Act of 1978, and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act;, 54345=(4) EPA-established scaled assigned deterioration factors for both exhaust and evaporative emissions may be used for vehicles/engines with over 10,000 miles if the criteria for small volume manufacturer or qualified small volume test groups/engine families are met as defined in 40 CFR 86.1838-01, 40 CFR 86.098-14, or 40 CFR 86.096-24(e)(2), as appropriate. This deterioration factor will be adjusted according to vehicle/engine miles or hours of operation.

This 25 percent reduction requirement is automatically waived if no equipment has been certified for the engine being rebuilt that provides a 25 percent reduction in particulate emissions and has a life cycle cost $2,000 or less (in 1992 dollars). In cases where equipment is not available to either meet a 0.10 g/bhp-hr standard for less than the applicable cost ceiling or achieve a 25 percent reduction for less than the applicable cost ceiling, the urban bus is required to be equipped with an engine rebuilt to the original engine configuration or a configuration certified to have a particulate level lower than that of the original engine configuration., 329855=[39 FR 32611, Sept. 10, 1974, as amended at 45 FR 13733, Mar. 3, 1980; 73 FR 59178, Oct. 8, 2008; 75 FR 22977, Apr. 30, 2010], 456876=(2) Follow the procedures laid out in \u00a785.2117., 150238=(2) For any engine model for which no equipment has been certified by July 1, 1994 as meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section for all affected urban bus operators, (and for any model year 1984 and 1987 engine models) for which equipment has been certified by July 1, 1994 as meeting the emission and cost requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section for all affected urban bus operators, the post-rebuild particulate emission level shall equal the lowest emission level (greater than or equal to 0.10 g/bhp-hr) certified for any such equipment;, 605076=Source: 60 FR 4738, Jan. 24, 1995, unless otherwise noted., 242359=[52 FR 36156, Sept. 25, 1987, as amended at 64 FR 23919, May 4, 1999], 369637=[39 FR 44375, Dec. 23, 1974, as amended at 48 FR 33462, July 21, 1983], 55536=(6) Durability testing is required unless the criteria for small volume manufacturer or qualified small volume test groups/engine families are met as defined in 40 CFR 86.1838-01, 40 CFR 86.098-14, or 40 CFR 86.096-24(e)(2), as applicable.

Program 2 requires affected urban bus operators to meet an annual average fleet particulate emissions level, rather than requiring each individual rebuilt urban bus engine in the operator's fleet to meet a specific particulate emission level.

During each calendar year, the average particulate emissions level from all of the operator's pre-1994 model year urban buses must be at or below the TLF for that calendar year. The TLF for a particular calendar year is calculated based on the Agency's determination of the projected emission level for each engine model in the operator's pre-1994 model year urban bus fleet, as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, and based on a schedule for rebuilding of affected urban bus engines, as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section., 275116=(e) Racing vehicles may be imported by any person provided the vehicles meet one or more of the exclusion criteria specified in \u00a785.1703.

The contract must specify the maximum incremental cost, compared to the cost of diesel fuel on a per mile basis, at which the fuel will be sold. As part of the contract, the fuel supplier must also provide on-site facilities, meeting all applicable safety and fire code requirements, for refueling the urban bus engines being retrofitted, unless the operator already has sufficient refueling", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
