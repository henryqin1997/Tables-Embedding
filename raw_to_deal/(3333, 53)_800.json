Get More for Your Money: Unlike the competition, Performance Series products contain superior key ingredients in clinically dosed amounts that are fully disclosed so you know exactly what you are paying for. Ultra-Clean Protein Formula: A single scoop of NITRO-TECH\u00ae contains 30 grams of protein, primarily from whey protein isolate, ultra-filtered whey protein concentrate and hydrolyzed whey protein isolate, with no more than 1 gram of carbs and 1.5 grams of fat! Most protein powders deliver significantly less protein per scoop, while some protein formulas are loaded with fat and carbs. The whey protein in NITRO-TECH\u00ae has been filtered using Multi-Phase Filtration Technology for less fat, lactose and impurities than cheaper protein sources. Build More Strength Than Regular Whey Protein: Each scoop of NITRO-TECH\u00ae contains a research-proven dose (3 grams) of creatine monohydrate. Combined in NITRO-TECH\u00ae, whey protein and creatine build more strength than regular whey protein.
