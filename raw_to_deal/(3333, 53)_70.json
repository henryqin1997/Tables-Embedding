The following is the description of the place as it was in 1804, written by the chief officer of the Lady Nelson [Jorgen Jorgensen] (and published in Hobart Town, 1835), who assisted to establish both Risdon and Hobart Town:\u2014\"During our absence,\" that is at Port Phillip, to remove the second draft of Collins' people to the Derwent\u2014\" the station at Risdon was found ineligible, and the present scite of Hobart Town was ultimately determined on. We landed at Sullivan's Cove, and having pitched our tents, spades, hoes, saws, and axes were put into the hands of prisoners, and we commenced clearing away as fast as we could. As I walk up and down the streets of this now crowded and large town, I cannot always divest myself of the remembrance of what it was at that time\u201432 years ago. The spot where the Bank of Van Diemen's Land, the Hope and Anchor, and the late Mrs. Kearney's habitation now are was then an impervious grove of the thickest brushwood, surmounted with some of the largest gum trees that this island can \"produce, and all along the rivulet, as far up as where the Old or Upper mill now is, was impassable from the denseness of the shrubs and underwood, and the huge collection of prostrate trees and dead timber which had been washed down by the stream, and were strewed all around. These had in parts blocked up the channel, and many places which are now dry and built upon, or cultivated in fruitful gardens, were covered with rushes and water.\" Jorgenson says the Lady Nelson was a small brig, of 65 tons; and of the Ocean, that \"she sailed so badly that we were obliged to assist her coming up the river,\" Knopwood says nothing about her entry into the harbour in this undignified manner.\u2014[C.]], 234384=H.M.
