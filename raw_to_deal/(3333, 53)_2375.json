The resuscitation of the wave theory is often attributed to the writings of Thomas Young, which did not appear until the early years of the nineteenth century (Fresnel, 1868; Cantor, 1983; Buchwald, 1989; Achinstein, 1991) . Drawing on the writings of contemporaries such as Fresnel, Lloyd, and Herschel, Young noted a number of severe problems with the particle theory (Achinstein, 1991) ., 8331=From this observation, Young concludes: \"The uniformity of the motion of light in the same medium, which is a difficulty in the Newtonian theory, favours the admission of the Huygenian\" (Young, 1855, p. 79) ., 9014=However, the more serious difficulties with the particle theory, and new evidence, including Young's own famous double-slit experiment, eventually convinced the scientific community that the wave theory was the better of the two. Table 1, taken from Reverend B. Powell's Remarks on Mr. Barton's Reply (1833), was produced by a wave theorist though it was intended as \"a synoptic sketch, which I believe to be perfectly impartial; indeed, I have given every advantage to the corpuscular theory\" (Powell, 1833, p. 416) ., 30641=Achinstein takes the concept of independent warrant from Mill and Herschel who claim, in contrast to Whewell, that explanatory power, consilience, simplicity, and coherence are not enough to justify acceptance. In addition to a hypothesis explaining observed phenomena, there should be data providing some independent inductive support for the hypothesis (Achinstein, 1991, p. 134) . Achinstein employs an \"eliminative strategy\" to produce an independent warrant, and claims that such a method is the one employed by wave theorists (Achinstein, 1991, p. 137) . He claims that wave theorists could argue inductively that light was either a wave or a particle, then justify acceptance of the wave hypothesis by elimination of the particle hypothesis., 15170=In his discussion, Achinstein stresses that wave theorists do not simply examine the number of observations explained by a theory and its extensions, but also the probability that those extensions to the basic theory are valid. Furthermore, he claims that this \"probability\" can be contrasted to coherence, in that the latter can exist in the face of improbable extensions, whereas the former, obviously, can not (Achinstein, 1991, p. 79) ., 17811=And that coherentists do not account for the primacy of certain elements in their being empirically supported (Achinstein, 1991, p. 73) :, 15630=Achinstein goes into great detail explaining how a wave theorist would argue for the low probability of the particle theory. He relies on the probability calculus to explicate the process wave theorists supposedly used to prove their rivals improbable (Achinstein, 1991, pp. 85-90) . He concluded that the wave theorists' strategies \"can be analyzed in inductive and probabilistic terms\" but not by relying on the concept of coherence (Achinstein, 1991, p. 111, 133) ., 50552=Chen, X.

East Lansing, Philosophy of Science Association, 103-109., 17398=Nonetheless, Achinstein has noticed important difficulties with the coherentist position. The two which are most central to his dismissal of the coherentist position are that \"coherence\" is a poorly defined concept (Achinstein, 1991, p. 129) :, 41672=The following formulation of the problem as input to ECHO retains its LISP structure. The propositions are taken unchanged from Powell's assessment of the state of the debate in 1833, as found in table 1, which neither Cantor nor Achinstein criticize as unfair., 16125=In criticizing coherentist analyses of the conceptual change which took place, Achinstein discusses the debate between John Stuart Mill and William Whewell concerning the verification of hypotheses in science (Achinstein, 1991, p. 117-148) . Achinstein characterizes the Whewellian, or coherentist, position as insisting that (Achinstein, 1991, p. 118) :, 9552=Of course, neither the wave theory nor the particle theory were, or claimed to be, the perfect theory of light (e.g. neither explained complex coloured fringes of apertures and shadows). As new experimental cases arose, they were used to confirm or challenge the theories (Powell, 1833, p. 414) :, 3873=In 1807, Thomas Young summarized the wave-particle debate as follows (Young, 1807, p. 457) :, 4383=Newton's Opticks, published in its final form in the fourth edition of 1730, fostered this debate by supporting the particle theory of light and denying the wave theory. However, by the 1830s, the corpuscular, or particle, theory of light proposed by Newton was superseded by the wave theory of light: this theoretical shift is often cited as a good example of conceptual change in science (Cantor, 1983; Chen, 1988; Buchwald, 1989; Achinstein, 1991) ., 36230=In a comparison of probabilistic networks to ECHO, Thagard (forthcoming) formulates a method for translating any problem captured by ECHO into a Pearl probabilistic network. However, there is a high price to be paid for such a translation: there is no straightforward method for assigning conditional probabilities in a Pearl network to give the correct results; the size of the Pearl network becomes very large, and the independence assumptions which must be made may be poor approximations (Thagard, forthcoming) . Nevertheless, one can create a Pearl network that greatly reduces the number of probabilities necessary to model a specific situation. For the 31 propositions in the ECHO simulation of the wave-particle debate, the probabilist can get by with 184 conditional probabilities, a massive improvement over 2 billion. However, this reduction is only possible if \"one knows the conditional probability distribution of each propositional variable given its parents\" (Neapolitain, 1990, p. 164) ., 34313=Furthermore, Young talks of hypotheses being \"consistent\" (Young, 1855, p. 141) or \"connecting an immense variety of facts with each other\" (Young, 1855, p. 279) . In fact, he explicitly asserts that the \"conformity to other facts\" is an excellent reason to accept the wave hypotheses (Young, 1855, p. 170) . It is clear that nineteenth-century wave theorists discussed hypotheses in terms of coherence, not in purely probabilistic terms as Achinstein contends. We showed at the end of the last section how coherence captures all of the major considerations of the debate that Achinstein thought important., 38177=Furthermore, there are important restrictions to creating a probabilist model. In creating a probabilist net one can not simply specify a (directed acyclic) network and the conditional probability distributions of every variable given its parents. First, one must show that the specified conditional distributions determine a joint probability distribution. Second, it must be shown that the specified conditional probabilities are indeed the conditional probabilities. Finally, the joint distribution and the graph must be shown to satisfy the conditional independence assumptions of the probabilistic network (Neapolitain, 1990, p. 164) . The only one of these tasks that is necessary for the coherentist corresponds to the creation of the probabilist network, the simplest of all the probabilist tasks. Moreover, the strong independence assumptions necessary to reduce the probabilistic network's complexity tractable are unrealistic. If one examines the particle-wave debate, it is quite clear that a number of hypotheses are dependent on each other, particularly in the case of the particle hypotheses listed in the appendix. We issue the following challenge to proponents of probabilistic accounts of scientific reasoning: develop a historically plausible and tractable computational model of how probabilities can be used to justify the acceptance of the wave theory. Our ECHO simulation shows that the coherence account already satisfies the criterion of computational tractability., 4858=In this section we briefly outline the debate which preceded this important scientific revolution and attempt to characterize both the strengths and weaknesses of the particle and wave positions. Indisputably, the most influential voice on the side of the particle theorists was that of Newton. He proposed the particle theory as a rhetorical question (Newton, 1730, p. 370) :, 14371=Achinstein (1991) presents a probabilistic analysis of the transition from a generally accepted particle theory of light to its rival, the wave theory, in the nineteenth century. Achinstein argues convincingly that the wave theorists used a four part strategy in their attempt to show the superiority of their theory over that of the particle theorists. The strategy was as follows (Achinstein, 1991, p.78) :, 1626=Peter Achinstein (1990, 1991) analyses the scientific debate that took place in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries concerning the nature of light. He offers a probabilistic account of the methods employed by both particle theorists and wave theorists, and rejects any analysis of this debate in terms of coherence. He characterizes coherence through reference to William Whewell's writings concerning how \"consilience of inductions\" establishes an acceptable theory (Whewell, 1847) . Achinstein rejects this analysis because of its vagueness and lack of reference to empirical data, concluding that coherence is insufficient to account for the belief change that took place during the wave-particle debate., 37254=Probabilists know that finding these numbers is a difficult task. Though humans are quite proficient at creating a causal network, and even estimating the probability an event will occur, it is much more difficult for them to determine the values in the conditional distributions of a node given its parents (Neapolitain, 1990, p.181) . For example, one would have to estimate the probability that the theory of fits is correct, given that light exhibits colours of thin plates (see the appendix). The probability can not be assumed to be 1, as there are other theories which may account for this property of light. It is also unclear how a probability estimation will change with the introduction of new evidence, or even which evidence relates to which theories. How then, does one arrive at a reasonable probability value under such uncertain conditions? This question is not resolved by Achinstein's analysis., 6724=One of the most convincing reasons offered to dismiss the particle theory of light was derived from a series of experiments and analyses performed by Fresnel. (2) These are the results Young relies upon when he notes (Young, 1807, p. 458, italics added) :, 16919=This characterization is only partly fair to Whewell's position. Though Whewell does indeed place the restrictions Achinstein has noted (Whewell, 1847, pp. 62, 66-67, 77) , he also places heavy emphasis on the simplicity of a theory (Whewell, 1847, pp. 71-72, 78-79) . In doing so, Whewell has introduced an important element in the assessment of hypotheses which is not address by Achinstein in his dismissal of the Whewellian position (Achinstein, 1991, p. 123-129) ., 33216=Achinstein claims that wave theorists themselves viewed the debate from the perspective of probability rather than coherence (Achinstein, 1991, p. 79) :, 387=\u00a9 Paul Thagard and Chris Eliasmith, 1997, 8559=Nevertheless, the alternative to the particle theory, the undulatory or wave theory, had its own difficulties (Chen, 1988) . One of the most commonly cited criticisms against the wave theory is one that was forwarded by Newton in his Opticks: \"If it [light] consisted in Pression or Motion, propagated either in an instant or in time, it would bend into the Shadow\" (Newton, 1730, p. 362) - there had been no such observed diffraction., 5377=He also explicitly rejected the wave theory of light (Newton, 1730, p. 362) :, 14147=Table 1 - Synoptic sketch of the successes and difficulties of the particle and wave theories (Powell, 1833, p 416-417) ., 33742=On the contrary, Young himself states the following (Young, 1855, p. 140, italics added) :, 7817=Furthermore, Young notes the difficulty that a particle theory of light has in explaining the observed uniform velocity of light (Young, 1855, p. 79) :, 5650=Newton's rejection of the wave theory of light and advocacy of the particle theory convinced many scientists of his day that light was indeed a particle. This belief was held until well after Newton's death in 1737 (Cantor, 1983) . It was not until the middle of the eighteenth century that Newton's theory became seriously challenged by wave theorists such as Euler and Benjamin Franklin (Achinstein, 1991) .}", "lastModified": "Tue, 17 Feb 2004 15:29:01 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Thus, it was not a matter of choosing the right theory, but rather, the best one. Mr. Barton has brought forward a new experimental case, - and the science of theoretical optics is under great obligations to him for doing so, - a case to which neither the undulatory nor any other theory ... has as yet been applied. It remains to be seen how they may apply; and this case will form a further test of the powers of either theory when formulae applying to this case shall have been investigated.

Achinstein argues convincingly that the wave theorists used a four part strategy in their attempt to show the superiority of their theory over that of the particle theorists. The strategy was as follows (Achinstein, 1991, p.78) : 1. Assume that either theory T1 or theory T2 is correct, and give grounds for such an assumption. 2. Show how T1 and T2 explain various observed phenomena. 3. Show that T2 in explaining one or more of these phenomena introduces improbable hypotheses, whereas T1 does not. 4. Conclude that T1 is probably true. In his discussion, Achinstein stresses that wave theorists do not simply examine the number of observations explained by a theory and its extensions, but also the probability that those extensions to the basic theory are valid. Furthermore, he claims that this \"probability\" can be contrasted to coherence, in that the latter can exist in the face of improbable extensions, whereas the former, obviously, can not (Achinstein, 1991, p. 79) .
