You will study the majority of your mathematics material at the advanced level or as part of the Talented Student Program (TSP). You also have the opportunity to complement your study with other advanced science units of study and challenging units from other faculties. You will complete a major in mathematics, statistics, or financial mathematics and statistics. Full-time students enrol in junior units of study with a maximum 48 credit points (cp) during first year, including two junior advanced mathematics or statistics units (12cp). A typical unit of study has a value of 6 credit points. In second year you will normally enrol in intermediate units of study worth 48cp, at least 12cp will be advanced level or TSP units from mathematics or statistics. In third year, you will enrol in senior units of study worth 48cp, building on intermediate study and completing a minimum of 24cp in advanced level or TSP units from mathematics or statistics. To stay in the BSc (Advanced Mathematics) course, you will have to meet minimum progression requirements. Study plan View a sample study plan/course structure table.
