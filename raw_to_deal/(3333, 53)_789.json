Note that some options are only available from the command line. [edit] Managing Jails from the Command Line To create multiple jails simultaneously, use the --bulk <number> and --ip4pool <starting address> options to specify the number of jails and the starting IP address. Alternately, instead of \u2013ip4pool, use the --autoipv4 option as it automatically assigns the next available IP address from the pool, as defined by the IP4POOL option in /usr/local/etc/warden.conf. ssh username@jail1 When you are finished creating the user, you can type exit to exit the jail. Test that ssh works by specifying the username that you created: wheel Login group is username. Invite username into other groups? [] Follow the prompts of the adduser script in order to create a user. When you get to the following prompt, do not press enter. Instead type in wheel so that the user can use the su command to become the superuser within the jail. adduser Started shell session on jail1 .
