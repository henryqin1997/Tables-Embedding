We welcomed more than 90 participants at this Ottawa event, including representatives from 12 of the 13 provincial and territorial privacy offices, and, for the first time, members of the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada. The conference allowed investigators to share experiences and best practices. Open and frank discussions increased awareness of common issues., 60985=In February 2008, we issued a unanimous joint resolution outlining the steps that will need to be taken to ensure the privacy and security of any Canadian\u2019s personal information accessed as part of EDL programs., 106958=Another major audit, described in detail in our 2005-2006 annual report, examined the management practices of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) with regards to trans-border data flows and found similar challenges with regards to training needs of key personnel., 72200=It is impossible to overstate how privacy rights around the world have been rolled back since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Governments everywhere \u2013 Canada included \u2013 have responded with a wide range of national security initiatives, which often focus on gathering more and more information about the routine, day-to-day activities of ordinary people., 93735=Since then, we have consulted with external stakeholders on this issue. For example, we asked the Public Policy Forum to organize two roundtable discussions on reform of the federal privacy regime in June and October 2007. These discussions involved senior government officials who have a stake in privacy promotion and protection., 181952=\u00a9 Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada 2008 Cat.

This conference was an important opportunity to discuss global privacy concerns and solutions. Commissioners resolved to increase cooperation and to help develop universally accepted international privacy standards in the area of information technology., 169830=Our hopes for better privacy protection for Canadians were revived in the spring of 2008, when the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics announced a review of the Privacy Act., 1661=This Social Insurance Number was created in 1964 to serve as a client account number for the Canada Pension Plan and various employment insurance programs.

As this annual report illustrates, the issues we work on each day are varied, complex and challenging. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to attract an exceptionally talented new generation of privacy protection experts to our ranks over the past year., 175147=The potent combination of state interest in personal information and technological advances making it possible to gather and exploit this data on a massive scale is a theme highlighted \u2013 once again \u2013 in this 2007-2008 annual report on Canada\u2019s public sector privacy law. (Our work related to private sector organizations is described in our annual reports on the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA.), 93159=The committee heard from a number of witnesses. Our Office hopes the committee members will return to this work in the fall of 2008., 21616=During the first year in which the guidelines have been in place, we have noticed an increase in the number of reported incidents (57 in 2007-2008 as compared to 43 for 2006-2007). The fact that the number of incidents is relatively low, when one considers the large amount of personal information held by government institutions, is encouraging news., 7678=Other issues our Audit and Review branch worked on over 2007-2008 included the government\u2019s purchase of personal information from data brokers and the widespread use of Social Insurance Numbers., 159511=Some of our key accomplishments in 2007-2008 include:, 78806=Treasury Board Secretariat issued comprehensive privacy reporting guidelines for government institutions in 2005, and updated these in early 2008. The Privacy Act should be amended to integrate these guidelines into legislation in order to provide them with added weight and authority., 93013=Given that there seems to be little appetite in government for a major rewrite of the legislation, the Commissioner proposed a list of 10 \u201cquick fixes\u201d when she appeared before the committee in April 2008.

We urged the Inquiry to consider the need for clear legal remedies, enforceable safeguards, and effective oversight as it assesses the adequacy of air travel security measures., 22136=Treasury Board Secretariat published privacy breach guidelines for institutions subject to the Privacy Act at the end of March 2007.

However, these are not mandatory. (The two current courses will be merged into one new course beginning in early 2009.), 2270=A senior citizen wrote to the Privacy Commissioner in June 2007 to express concern about the inclusion of Social Insurance Numbers on Old Age Security identification cards.

As reported in our 2006-2007 annual report, an OPC audit found that PIAs are not always conducted when they should be and are frequently completed well after program implementation, or not at all., 57621=In January 2008, the Privacy Commissioner wrote to the Minister of Industryand the Minister of Canadian Heritage regarding possible amendments to the Act., 8074=Our Office\u2019s audit work resulted in our first special report to Parliament this year.

(We received three more similar complaints in May 2008.), 45584=Correctional Service Canada and the RCMP have been the top two institutions receiving complaints over the past few years. It is noteworthy that there has been a steady drop in the number of RCMP complaints, but a fairly significant increase in Correctional Service Canada complaints \u2013 from 190 in 2005-2006 to 248 in 2007-2008. The rise in the number of complaints against Correctional Services Canada may be directly proportional to the additional access to personal information requests it received., 108008=In October 2007, our Office published the results of an audit assessing the effectiveness and outcome of Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) conducted by federal government departments and agencies for new or redesigned programs and services., 5405=We examined a sample of records in 2002 and found tips generally related to suspected terrorist affiliations, suspicious persons or suspicious activity.

The sessions are so popular that the PSC turned some of its managers away in 2007 for lack of resources to provide training. The PSC has since expanded the program in an attempt to meet the demand., 4318=In late 2006, the Ottawa Citizen published an article describing how the RCMP had been buying and storing personal information from commercial data brokers for a number of years. This revelation raised questions not only about how the RCMP was using the information, but also about whether other government departments were purchasing data broker information., 148092=Passport Canada processed more than 3.6 million passport applications in 2006-2007.

While we can\u2019t be certain about the precise reason for this decrease, we are aware that Quebec has its own stringent privacy legislation. Most of our complainants living in Quebec who use our services, are located in the National Capital Region., 7529=A year after the request was made, we have yet to receive an over-arching PIA, although our Office was informed in the spring of 2008 that work on a broad assessment had begun., 14495=In a February 2008 decision, Mr. Justice Gibson accepted a fundamental premise set out by the Supreme Court of Canada: In a situation involving personal information about an individual, the right to privacy is paramount over the right of access to information., 19635=As reported in our 2007 PIPEDA Annual Report, the success of the 29th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners \u2013 held in Montreal in September and following through on our initial 2002 engagement \u2013 was beyond our highest expectations., 33267=Our Inquiries Unit received well over 4,000 Privacy Act-related inquiries between April 1, 2007 and March 31, 2008., 23521=A key objective for our Office over 2008-2009 will be to provide leadership on our priority issues.

These are available on our conference website at www.privacyconference2007.gc.ca and are an important legacy of the conference., 18464=In September 2007, the Honourable Mr. Justice Peter Cory was engaged as Privacy Commissioner ad hoc. The Privacy Commissioner delegated to him the majority of her powers, duties and functions as set out in sections 29 through 35 and section 42 of the Act. Justice Cory completed his contract in March 2008. A new Privacy Commissioner ad hoc, Justice Andrew Mackay, has since assumed these duties., 2211=A key branch priority in 2007-2008 was to reduce a PIA review backlog.

The audit at Passport Canada and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) unfortunately found weaknesses in every step of the application process; the way in which personal information is collected and stored; how it can be accessed; and how it is ultimately disposed. For example, passport applications and supporting documents were kept in clear plastic bags on open shelves; documents containing personal information were sometimes tossed into regular garbage and recycling bins without being shredded \u2013 and some documents that had been shredded by a private contractor could easily be put back together. Meanwhile, computer systems allowed too many employees to access certain passport files and controls, such as audit logs and encryption, were missing. These privacy and security shortfalls are particularly worrying given the high sensitivity of the personal information involved in processing passport applications. There is a risk that this information could be used for nefarious purposes if it wound up in the wrong hands.
