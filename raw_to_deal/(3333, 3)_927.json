The Borrelia employed as the antigen was B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (strain B31 ATCC 35210). These bacteria were propagated in Barbour Kelly medium and fixed on spot slides. The fluorescein-labelled conjugates used were rabbit anti-human IgG and IgM (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), diluted 1/128 in PBS. Briefly, two-fold dilutions of each serum sample were added to the antigen spots and incubated in a humidity chamber for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After washing, the conjugate was added to each sample. The slides were then incubated for 30 min, washed, and examined using a BH2 fluorescence microscope (10 \u00d7 40, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Positive and negative control sera were also examined. Sera showing a typical pattern of fluorescence at IgG titres of \u22651:256 and IgM titres of \u22651:32 were deemed positive (Figure 1). All positives sera were tested for infection by Treponema pallidum by the haemagglutination test (TPHA-BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u00b4Etoile, France) to rule out syphilis., 56672=Though Lyme disease is thought to have been present in Spain since 1977, its existence was not serologically confirmed until 1987 [10,21,22]. Since then, B. burgdorferi infections have been frequently recorded, with differences in prevalence from area to area, and its geographical distribution may be increasing as a result of climate change, changes in land uses, and evolving socioeconomic factors [10,23]. The present work is the longest-term (17 years) epidemiological surveillance study of B. burgdorferi ever performed in Spain. The seroprevalence of 13.3% detected in the present work falls within the range previously reported for Spain (0.3\u201314.8%) and other European countries (1.8%\u201319.68%) [24,25,26,27,28,29]., 25777=Arthropod-borne diseases are the most common zoonoses involving wildlife in the northern hemisphere, especially the Old World [1]. Borrelia burgdorferi, the causal agent of Lyme borreliosis (LB), is found worldwide and comprises at least 18 genospecies [2,3]. Discovered in 1982, B. burgdorferi is now considered an emerging (and possibly under-reported) pathogen that could become an important public health problem [4]. Ixodes ricinus is the tick that usually transmits this pathogen to humans in Europe [5]., 34075=All sera with an uncertain or positive IFA result were subjected to a home-made western blotting (WB) test. WB strips were prepared with sonicated B. burgdorferi (strain B31 ATCC 35210) cells [18]. Electrophoresis was performed at 125 V for 90 min and the separated proteins transferred to PDVF membranes. These membranes were then cut into strips, hydrated with methanol, and blocked with 5% gelatin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Human serum, diluted 1:200 in TTBS 1% (Tris-NaCl, 1% gelatin, 0.05% Tween-20), was then added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C/h for 2 h. The positive controls used included at least three different monoclonal antibodies (diluted 1:000) from the following list: 11G1 (OspA), CB312 (P72), CB2 (OspB), CB1 (Flagelina) (kindly provided by Dr. Pedro Anda, Centro Nacional de Microbiolog\u00eda, Majadahonda, Madrid), 181.1 (93 kDa), H9724 (Fla, 41 kDa) and 84C (OspB, 34 kDa). A human serum positive for B. burgdorferi (supplied by Dr. Sofia Nuncio, Centro de Estudos de Vetores e Doen\u00e7as Infecciosas (CEVDI), Instituto Nacional de Sa\u00fade, Aguas de Moura, Portugal), diluted 1:200, was used as a further positive control. A human serum negative for the bacterium, also diluted 1:200, was used as a negative control, and a strip with PBS as white control. After washing with TTBS 0.01% (TBS, 0.1% gelatine, 0.05% Tween-20) alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, anti-human IgM or total IgG anti-mouse (Sigma) antibodies were added and the preparations incubated and washed as described above. Blots were visualized using nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-phosphate (Sigma). Serum specimens were deemed positive if they reacted with at least five of the following IgG diagnostic bands: 18 kDa, 23 kDa (Ospc), 28 kDa, 30 kDa, 39 kDa (BmpA), 41 kDa, 25 kDa, 58 kDa (not GroEL), 66 kDa or 93 kDa, and at least two of the following IgM diagnostic bands: 23 kDa (OspC), 39 kDa (BMPa) or 41 kDA (Fla) (CDC Recommendations, 1995) (Figure 2)., 29225=Serum samples were collected from patients bitten by ticks - and therefore at risk of B. burgdorferi infection\u2014over a 17-year period (May1996\u2013May 2013). A total number of 1,179 serum samples from 623 patients (age range 3 months to 91 years) were available: 601 from the Palencia and 22 from the Burgos study areas. By sex 345 (55.3%) of these samples came from males and 278 from females (44.7%). All sera were collected from patients at primary healthcare centres. Blood was taken once (at first presentation) from 225 patients (36.1%), twice (at first presentation and 30 days later) from 240 patients (38.5%), and three times (at first presentation, 30 days later, and at 90 days) from 158 patients (25.3%). All serum samples were maintained at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis. The following information was collected from all patients: age, sex, occupation, place of residence, symptomatology, contact with cattle, profession, and information regarding their tick bite., 48477=In those patients for whom more than one serum sample was available (n = 498), 8 (1.61%) showed rising IgG titres, five showed rising IgM titres (1.00%), and 4 (0.80%) showed increases in both IgG and IgM. Retro-seroconversion with respect to IgG occurred in six people (1.20%), and with respect to IgM in one person (0.20%). In both cases, seroconversion and retroconversion, occurred during the first years of the study, in particular between 1997 and 2004. Some patients remained completely asymptomatic while others showed influenza-like symptoms (fever, fatigue, headaches and joint pain)., 55653=IgM antibodies expressed against B. burgdorferi were found in four patients who had been bitten by D. marginatus, in two patients bitten by D. reticulatus, in two patients bitten by R. sanguineus, and in one bitten by I. ricinus. A male of D. reticulatus was infected with B. burgdorferi. The tick was removed from the scalp of a 13-year-old woman in May 1997. The patient presented a week after the bite the presence of regional lymph nodes close to the area of the bite without fever. The patient had high titer of IgM and IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi, but not seroconversion., 30244=All the patients gave their informed consent to be included in the study (all adult participants and from the parents or legal guardians of minors), in compliance with the ethical standards of the Human Experimentation Committee of the University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares and the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 (as revised in 2004). All patients that came to a health centre with fever were treated with antibiotics., 19781=Int. J. Environ. Res.
