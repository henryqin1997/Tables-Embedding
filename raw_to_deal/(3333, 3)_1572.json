Continuous variables are presented as mean \u00b1 SD, mean and 95% CI or median and interquartile range. Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentage. An independent group t-test was used to compare all the interval parameters matching the criteria of normality and homogeneity of variance. For interval parameters that fail to match these criteria, the non-paramentric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare variables. Categorical variables and frequencies were compared using Chi2 test and Fisher exact test of independence. SUA frequencies were normally distributed (using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), and data were not positively skewed. Frequencies of CMCs and hs-CRP concentrations were not distributed. The data, however, were not transformed. The potential factors that may be associated with CMCs were identified first with the univariate analysis (ANOVA), and then the independent predictors of a decrease in CMCs were searched with the multivariate one-step backward logistic regression analysis, initially including variables for which a p value < 0.1 was achieved from the univariate analysis. The odds ratio (RR) and confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for factors independently associated with a decrease in circulating CMCs.

Two groups of persons surveyed (healthy volunteers and patients with known CAD) were compared in terms of demographics, smoking, body mass index, CAD family history, mean systolic BP, heart rate, creatinin, fasting glucose and eGFR. Patients with known CAD, however, had hyperlipidaemia (44.4%), arterial hypertension (66.7%), T2DM (36.5%). An increase in HbA1c, serum uric acid, hs-CRP, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as a decrease in HDL cholesterol were found in patients with known CAD when compared with healthy volunteers.
