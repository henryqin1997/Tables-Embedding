I have never felt better. I feel really fit,\" she said. \"I can play a tournament like this, singles, doubles, with tough, tough schedules. For the most part, I felt really good. \"I haven't felt like this in a number of years. I'm excited about the possibilities. I don't know what can happen.

She knows what it takes to get there,\" said the Belarusian. \"I think it's incredible what she's achieving. She's playing definitely her best tennis right now. It is just really exciting for me to be able to compete against that type of player who can be the greatest of all time.\" It is Williams' second major of 2013 after winning the French Open back in June. The 31-year-old now has five Australian Opens, five Wimbledon crowns and two French Opens, in addition to her New York victories. Photo On top ...
