This mostly complete table shows point distributions towards personal glory, and team score (you need 500 team score to win) In sPvP, you earn a currency called glory which is used to purchase equipment. The amount of glory you earn seems to be equal to the amount of rank points you get. Rank is simply a way to gauge the experience of a player, and every rank you will be given random PvP rewards.
