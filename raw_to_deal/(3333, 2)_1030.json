Massively diluted stock Each time insiders sell, or when Facebook issues new shares to pay for all or part of an acquisition (as it did when buying Instagram), the company\u2019s compensation bill goes up. Together these compensation charges and related taxes cost Facebook approximately 20 cents a share in the third quarter, net of a small, related tax benefit. The company reported that operating income fell 9% to $377 million in the quarter, hurt by surging expenses that included $179 million in stock-compensation costs.
