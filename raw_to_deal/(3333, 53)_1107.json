Prefer film mode natural+sharp=+2, frame size 1x1, auto ISO, S priority. Forgot about flash. Almost perfect, first class camera. Nikon and Cannon lost market. X-M1 is not so perfect like Sony Rx1R, but better than any other competitors. If you have no money for Rx1R, buy X-M1 + 27mm, no choice. Do not buy zoom lenses.
