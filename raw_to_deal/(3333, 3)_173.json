Boasting a sleek all-aluminum design and packing 2560x1600 on its 12.2\" screen, the latest ATIV Book 9 is powered by the newest Intel Core M technology with a fanless design for silent computing., 21063=Intel Core i7-4720HQ Quad Core Processor (2.6GHz / 3.6GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M (4GB GDDR5 VRAM), Optimus Technology 16GB System Memory (DDR3L-1600 MHz) Windows 8.1 64-Bit 128GB SSD + 500GB HDD / 256GB SSD + 500GB HDD / 512GB SSD + 1TB HDD 17.3\" Full HD 16:9 Ratio, 1920 x 1080 LED backlit Intel Wireless-AC 7260HMW (802.11a/b/g/n/ac + Bluetooth 4.0) Gigabit Ethernet port 3x USB 3.0 ports HDMI 1.4a audio and video output Dolby Digital Plus Home Theater Edition Built-in stereo speakers 3.5 mm microphone/headphone combo jack Array microphone 7.1 Codec support (via HDMI) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Built-in full-HD webcam (2.0 MP) Compact 150 W Power Adapter Built-in 74 Wh Rechargeable lithium ion polymer battery Razer Switchblade User Interface (SBUI) Razer Anti-Ghosting Keyboard (with adjustable backlight) Razer Synapse Enabled Kensington Lock interface 16.8 in.

The previous model is still on Acer's website for $1400 USD, without RealSense 3D., 24515=Based on the 28nm Maxwell GM204 core and positioned just below the existing GTX 970M, the new GTX 965M has 1024 CUDA cores (compared to the 970M's 1280) and the new 965M has a lower 128-bit memory interface (vs 192-bit with the 970M). The base clock is slightly faster at 944 MHz (plus unspecified Boost headroom)., 30941=PC Perspective's CES 2015 coverage is sponsored by Logitech., 28106=Intel's \u201cPerceptual Computing\u201d initiative, later branded Intel RealSense 3D, is beginning to be integrated with consumer electronics. For a while now, developers could pick up a Creative Labs-produced SDK with a camera, depth sensor, and dual microphones (in an array) for $99 USD. We will probably hear more about it tomorrow during Intel's CES 2015 Keynote at 7:30pm EST. Hopefully, they will also have some compelling software to go along with it., 24926=Compared with the flagship GTX 980M which boasts 1536 CUDA cores and 256-bit GDDR5 this new GTX 965M will be a significantly lower performer, but NVIDIA is marketing it towards 1080p mobile gaming. At a lower cost to OEMs the 965M should help create some less expensive 1080p gaming notebooks as the new GPU is adopted., 35674=The LaVie Z HZ550 and HZ750 will be available in May starting at $1,299 and $1,499 respectively. They are slick looking notebooks and the magnesium-lithium frame is interesting. I'm looking forward to seeing how they stack up and what else Lenovo NEC has in store (the joint venture agreement was recently extended to 2026)., 47180=You may have read Ryan's review of Broadwell-Y performance back in November, and the results for these new chips are impressive when considering the ultra-low power design. The processor in this Book 9 (the Core M 5Y10c) is targeting just 3.5W SDP (4.5W TDP) while providing up to 2.0 GHz with a 4MB cache. The extremely low power requirements from these 14nm parts will allow more fanless designs like this notebook going forward, though it will be interesting to see how performance scales under extended use without a fan., 18671=Razer targets the Blade Pro at both gamers and professionals, placing emphasis on the usefulness of the device beyond gaming. However, being limited to 1920x1080 on a 17.3-inch display will eliminate this from consideration by most creative professionals (though the display does feature an anti-glare matte finish). Aiding the performance/gaming side of the notebook is Razer\u2019s localized heating system which the company claims \u201cfocuses on directing heat away from the main touch surfaces of the notebook, to areas that can dissipate heat quickly and are not commonly touched by the user. This allows the laptop to pack in the highest performance available with NVIDIA\u2019s critically acclaimed GTX graphics\u201d., 22199=The Razer Blade Pro starts at $2299.99 and is available now from the Razer online store., 9949=1920x1080 with this model seems low, especially considering the obscene amount of VRAM (8GB per card on a laptop? Really?). Still, this notebook has excellent external monitor support with dual mini-DisplayPort outputs, though HDMI is limited to version 1.4., 48505=Pricing: $1199.99 4GB RAM/128GB SSD, $1399.99 8GB RAM/256GB SSD.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 17:32:08 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "table.tftable td {font-size:12px;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;border-style: solid;border-color: #729ea5 \u00a0;} table.tftable tr {background-color:#ffffff \u00a0;} table.tftable th {font-size:12px;background-color:#acc8cc \u00a0;border-width: 1px;padding: 8px;border-style: solid;border-color: #729ea5 \u00a0;text-align:left;}", "textAfterTable": "Anchored by an Intel Core i7-4720HQ and a GTX 960M, the Aspire V Nitro isn't trying to reach to the top stack of mobile performance. A 15.6\" display along with 8GB of RAM, and a single 1TB spindle drive are all logical choices for a machine aimed towards gaming on a budget. While it's difficult for us to recommend that you buy any machine without an SSD these days, a 1TB drive is great for game storage on a machine like there. There are also other configurations optiosn which add SATA M.2 SSDs alongside the 1TB drive, and we managed to open up our sample and put an SSD in ourselves with little pain.
