We cheekily referred to it as an almost-500hp engine you could build for a little more than $5,000. Well, we decided to take up our own challenge and assemble that small block Mopar Stroker. With the help of Brian Hafliger of IMM Engines in Indio, California, we killed our horsepower goal, but we also overshot our budget by a similar percentage. Nevertheless, we still think of this as a good build. Chrysler guys, put this in your Duster and drive it. We've often joked in these pages that the words budget built and Mopar Stroker can never be uttered in the same sentence. At least that's what we used to think.
