Act Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 419, 30 Stat. 1014, which established the \u201cCensus Office\u201d on a temporary basis, provided in section 31 thereof (30 Stat. 1021) for a seal for that office. The office was made permanent by act Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, 32 Stat. 51, and section 6 of that act (32 Stat. 52) continued in full force and effect \u201cfor the taking of the Thirteenth and subsequent censuses\u201d all provisions of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, not inconsistent with the provisions of such 1902 act. Therefore, since the 1902 act contained no provisions with respect to a seal, section 31 of the 1899 act, providing for the seal, remained in force as it was not inconsistent. Section 33 of act July 2, 1909, ch. 2, 36 Stat. 10, which act (36 Stat. 1) related to the Thirteenth and subsequent decennial censuses, repealed the said act of Mar. 3, 1899, specifically, and all \u201cother\u201d laws and parts of laws inconsistent with the provisions of the 1909 act. These repealing provisions are somewhat ambiguous, but it was probably the intent of Congress, as it was the intent thereof at the time of enactment of the act of Mar. 6, 1902, referred to above, to continue in effect all provisions of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, that were not inconsistent with the act of July 2, 1909. The 1909 act contained no provisions with respect to the seal, and it accordingly follows that the provisions of section 31 of the act of Mar. 3, 1899, with respect thereto, continued in force.

Section 74 prescribed maximum fine of $1,000 and maximum imprisonment of one year, for refusal to answer or giving a false answer; section 84 prescribed maximum fine of $1,000 for refusal to answer or giving false answer, with no imprisonment; and section 210 prescribed maximum fine of $500 and maximum imprisonment of sixty days for refusal to answer, and maximum fine of $10,000 and maximum imprisonment of one year for giving a false answer. In addition, such section 74 prescribed a minimum fine of $300 for refusal to answer or giving a false answer. This revised section adopts the penalties of such section 210, which was the latest enactment on the subject, and which might have been regarded as having superseded the penal provisions of such sections 74 and 84. According to its own terms, its penal provisions were applicable not only to the censuses of population, agriculture, etc., provided for in chapter 4 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., but also to any schedules prepared under the act of March 6, 1902 (sections 1\u20136, 77, 101, 111, and 112 of such title), or under acts amendatory thereof \u201cor supplemental thereto.\u201d This reference did not cover sections 74 and 84 specifically, but such sections, enacted in 1924 and 1916, respectively, could probably be regarded as having been \u201csupplemental\u201d to the 1902 act.

However, since the particular provisions of such section 203 that have been carried into this revised section apparently related, as supplemented by section 1442(b) of title 42, U.S.C., 1952 ed., to the decennial censuses provided for in sections 201 et seq. of such title, and in such section 1442 of title 42 (see subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title), and apparently could have no relevancy to the quinquennial censuses referred to above, this revised section relates only to such decennial censuses., 195857=Based on title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., \u00a7201 (June 18, 1929, ch. 28, \u00a71, 46 Stat. 21; May 17, 1932, ch. 190, 47 Stat. 158)., 163891=Section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., also authorized the decennial collection of statistics relating to the fishing industry \u201cin cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service\u201d. In the basic statutory provision (see amendment by act June 7, 1906, ch. 3048, 34 Stat. 218, \u201cFish and Wildlife Service\u201d read \u201cBureau of Fisheries\u201d and it was changed, by the codifiers, in such section 111 to the former designation because of 1940 Reorganization Plan No. III, \u00a73, 5 F.R. 2107, 54 Stat. 1232, which consolidated the Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey into one agency to be known as the \u201cFish and Wildlife Service\u201d. However, at the time of the enactment of the 1906 act, referred to above, both the Bureau of the Fisheries, and the Census Bureau (then referred to as the \u201cCensus Office\u201d), were in the Department of Commerce. The Bureau of Fisheries was transferred to the Department of the Interior by 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, \u00a74(e), 4 F.R. 2731, 53 Stat. 1431, and it is within that department that the Fish and Wildlife Service now functions. Therefore, such provision in section 111 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., has been omitted from this revised title as obsolete. In any event section 121 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed.

That plan transferred all functions (with a few exceptions not applicable to the Census Bureau) of all agencies, officers and employees of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and vested power in him to delegate the functions so transferred, or any of his other functions, to such agencies, officers or employees within the Department as he designates., 195402=(Aug. 31, 1954, ch. 1158, 68 Stat. 1019; Pub.
