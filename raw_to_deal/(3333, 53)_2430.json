Each target is named instead of numbered and is intended to serve a specific purpose.

Unfortunately, there's no good way to do the same for the user-defined runlevels like 2 and 4. If you make use of those it is suggested that you make a new named systemd target as /etc/systemd/system/$YOURTARGET that takes one of the existing runlevels as a base (you can look at /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target as an example), make a directory /etc/systemd/system/$YOURTARGET.wants, and then symlink the additional services that you want to enable into that directory.

The only exception is chkconfig --list. Additional commands In SysVinit, services can define arbitrary commands. Examples would be service iptables panic, or service httpd graceful. Native systemd services do not have this ability. Any service that defines an additional command in this way would need to define some other, service-specific, way to accomplish this task when writing a native systemd service definition. Check the package-specific release notes for any services that may have done this.
