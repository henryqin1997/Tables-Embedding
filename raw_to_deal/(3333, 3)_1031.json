Supported Target Configurations ELDK v5.3 supports a number of different target configurations. These include different sets of target tools and target libraries depending on the primary usage mode of the target system. At this point of time the following configurations are available: Image Name Purpose minimal A small image just capable of allowing a device to boot. minimal-mtdutils A \"minimal\" image that also has support for the Minimal MTD Utilities, which let the user interact with the MTD subsystem in the kernel to perform operations on flash devices. minimal-dev A \"minimal\" image suitable for development work. base A console-only image that fully supports the target device hardware. basic A foundational basic image without support for X that can be reasonably used for customization. clutter An image with support for the Open GL-based toolkit Clutter, which enables development of rich and animated graphical user interfaces. lsb A \"basic\" image suitable for implementations that conform to Linux Standard Base", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
