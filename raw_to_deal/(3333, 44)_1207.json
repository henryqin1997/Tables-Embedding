Introduction Infundibular Keratinizing Acanthoma (IKA) References Malignant Pilomatricoma Pilomatricoma Malignant Trichoepithelioma Trichoepithelioma Trichoblastoma Isthmic Tricholemmoma Inferior Tricholemmoma Tricholemmoma Infundibular Keratinizing Acanthoma During embryologic development of the skin and adnexal structures the pilar germ emerges at an angle from the underside of the epidermis. Under the influence of inductive mesenchymal cells, which will form the papillum of the hair, the cells extend into the deep dermis. Here differentiation of the hair germ in to the hair bulb occurs. The hair shaft, the outer root sheath and inner root sheath are formed from the hair bulb. These tumors show differentiation to hair follicular structures. There is a marked variability in the histopathologic appearance of these tumors, and there may be some variability within a single tumor when examined by light microscopy. This variability is due to the complex histology of the normal hair which is mimicked by these tumors showing hair follicular differentiation. Introduction Michael H.
