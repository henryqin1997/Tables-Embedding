A couple of foreign language hits come up for these terms, but there is no discussion of the issue on the referenced pages. A hierarchy is ragged when its members don\u2019t consistently descend to the same level. For example, as Books Online (BOL) puts it so concisely, in a geographic dimension both France and the Vatican would be considered nations, but France has provinces which in turn have cities, while the Vatican is a city with no provinces. This issue is a bit of a mystery to me, since SSAS does support ragged hierarchies through the use of the HideMemeberIf property."]], "pageTitle": "Print preview: An Informal Compendium of SSAS Errors, Part 3: Unresolved Errors", "title": "", "url": "http://www.sqlservercentral.com/blogs/multidimensionalmayhem/2011/10/02/an-informal-compendium-of-ssas-errors_2C00_-part-3_3A00_-unresolved-errors/print/", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042989043.35/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002309-00033-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 737382105, "recordOffset": 737373903, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{391=This is the second in a series of posts on some SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) errors for which there is apparently little, if any, documentation anywhere on the planet.
