The last bit, the 1,000,000,000,000,072nd bit, probably is the highest bit (or the least significant bit) of \u03c0 computed ever in the history. The log files are available here. A single computation was divided into 14,000 jobs and totally 7,000,000 tasks. It took 208 years of CPU-time or 12 days of cluster (with 7600-task-capacity) time. Two computations, at positions n and n+4, were performed. The starting position is 1,000,000,000,000,053, totally 20 bits. The second part of Row 15 (D3611) The result was posted in this YDN blog. The log files are available here. The remaining 70% was finished over a weekend on Hammer, a 30,000-task-capacity cluster, which was also used for the petabyte sort benchmark. The first 30% of the computation was done in idle cycles of some clusters spread over 20 days. The first part of Row 15 (6216B06) The computations in Row 13 and Row 14 were completed on May 20, 2009. It seems that the corresponding bits were never computed before. A single run of Row 14 took 27 hours. They were computed by a 7600-task-capacity cluster. Row 8 to Row 14 A single run of Row 7 took several seconds. They were computed by a single machine.

Command Line Usages The command line format is:  $ hadoop org.apache.hadoop.examples.pi.DistBbp \\ <b> <nThreads> <nJobs> <type> <nPart> <remoteDir> <localDir> And the parameters are: <b> The number of bits to skip, i.e. compute the (b+1)th position. <nThreads> The number of working threads. <nJobs> The number of jobs per sum. <type> 'm' for map side job, 'r' for reduce side job, 'x' for mix type. <nPart> The number of parts per job. <remoteDir> Remote directory for submitting jobs. <localDir> Local directory for storing output files. Note that it may take a long time to finish all the jobs when <b> is large. If the program is killed in the middle of the execution, the same command with a different <remoteDir> can be used to resume the execution. For example, suppose we use the following command to compute the (10^15+57)th bit of \u03c0.  $ hadoop org.apache.hadoop.examples.pi.DistBbp \\ 1,000,000,000,000,056 20 1000 x 500 remote/a local/output It uses 20 threads to summit jobs so that there are at most 20 concurrent jobs.", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
