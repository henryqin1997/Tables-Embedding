SDK Details This is an Evaluation Linux SDK build for Texas Instruments DM365 System on Chip and based on the Professional SDK 2011Q2. Hardware This SDK is designed to run on the DM365 LeopardBoard and DM368 LeopardBoard. 2 2 Since it is possible to use this evaluation version for the LeopardBoard DM368, it will not provide the maximun clock rates for this architecture. In order to get the maximun performance for this board please purchase our Professional SDK. Software This SDK includes: ARM toolchain: gcc 4.2.4. U-Boot 1.3.4 Linux kernel 2.6.32. DM365 support for the following drivers: Sensor MT9T031 for 5MP camera. Video output support: DVI, Component and Composite. UART. MTD (NAND flash). V4L2. Watchdog timer. Real time clock. USB (host and gadget). VPBE Framebuffer. Ethernet. I2C. SPI. MMC/SD. IPIPE. JFFS2 Auto white balance and auto exposure library. Integration with TI's digital video toolkit for DaVinci platforms - DVSDK 4.00.02.06. Please make sure to download and install the DVSDK before building the RidgeRun SDK. Install the DVSDK by running dvsdk_3_10_00_19_Setup.bin. Be sure to use the default installation values. dvsdk_3_10_00_19_Setup.bin can be downloaded from TI's site.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
