The third column is the user name of the engineer who last modified given component. The rightmost column is probably the last time someone worked on it (Please note that the name 'sean' here is not Sean Moss-Pultz\u00a0:) while a086 is an anonymous TI engineer's nick, meaning that the component has not been modified at FIC). [edit] AT%A Print values from an ADC. This command is not listed in AT+CLAC output but it is triggered by any input that starts with AT%A except AT%ALS (Alternative Line Service) and AT%ATR, which are other proprietary AT commands. So for example AT%ABCD,HELLO will also run this commands.
