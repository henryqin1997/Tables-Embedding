Summary of Unified Mobile Agent system configuration tasks Initial setup The service level for Unified Mobile Agent calls might be different than the service level for local agent calls, because it takes longer to connect the call to the agent. For example, a call by call Mobile Agent might have a longer Answer Wait Time Average than a local agent. This is because Packaged CCE does not start to dial the Mobile Agent phone number until after the call information is routed to the agent desktop. In addition, the customer call media stream is not connected to the agent until after the agent answers the phone. Note Unified Mobile Agent-specific call data is contained in the following Cisco Unified Intelligence Center reports: Agent Team Historical, Agent Real Time, and Agent Skill Group Historical. These \u201cAll Field\u201d reports contain information in multiple fields that show what kind of call the agent is on (nonmobile, call by call, nailed connection) and the Unified Mobile Agent phone number.

A remote CTI port, which Unified Mobile Agent uses to initiate a call to the Mobile Agent's phone. Naming Conventions for Local and Network Ports The local port must begin with the string LCP. The remote port must begin with the string RCP. The remaining characters in the device names for the LCP and RCP pair must match. For example an LCP port named LCP0000 has a corresponding RCP port named RCP0000.
