Please note that a repository can only support audit views if its store supports audit views, as well: Property supportingAudits Overriding the default random UUID can be useful if you have scripts that operate on the file system folder that is created on the server for each repository and named after the repository UUID. Specifies a constant UUID for the repository. If omitted the repository will be created with a random UUID. The format of an override UUID is not further specified but should respect the file naming conventions of the used operating system. Property overrideUUID The repository element can contain several property elements (see below) and must contain exactly one store element. The name attribute uniquely identifies a repository in the scope of a repository configurator. Defines an IRepository instance.
