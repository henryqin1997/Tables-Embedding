Generation and identification of variants with improved purification yield of Bowman-Birk protease inhibitors carrying protein binding loops. Collier, et al., 56084=Replacing the chymotrypsin inhibitory loop of soybean Bowman-Birk inhibitor (sBBI) with a VEGF binding peptide (BBI-AV) significantly reduced the overall purification yield. To improve production yields, scientists at Genencor, generated site-saturation libraries at 39 out of 66 amino acid residues of BBI-AV. Libraries were screened to select desired variants. Productive amino acid substitutions were found and combined to select for the variant with the best overall yield after purification. An octuple variant with greater than five- fold increase in final purification yield over the parent, was obtained. Several variants were obtained with higher purification yields than even sBBI.

Designing a Library It is important when designing protein variant libraries to carefully evaluate the number of unique sequences thoretically contained in the library. For most applications the transformation frequency provides a practical upper limit on the number of sequences that can be assessed. The methods used to measure protein function may further reduce this number. Read more: Nature Methods 2011. 8: 623. Protein engineering: navigating between chance and reason. Monya Baker.

Protein Engineering for Improved Functionality Researchers use large libraries, focused libraries and rational design to engineer protein function. Success is largely a matter of trying over and over again. Typically, the process illustrated below is repeated until significant improvements are obtained.

Antibody Libraries: The antigen-binding site of an antibody is composed of six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions\u2014three within the light-chain variable domain (VL) and three within the heavy chain variable domain (VH). Harness the power of synthetic biology to create antibody libraries with diversity in one or more CDRs. Libraries with diversity up to 1010 can be created. Precisely control diversity and choose frameworks with favorable properties. Synthetic antibody libraries are constructed using oligonucleotides to introduce complete or tailored degeneracy into CDRs of one or more V genes. Synthetic diversity bypasses natural biases and redundancies of antibody repertoires created in vivo and allows control over the genetic makeup of V genes and the introduction of diversity. IA.
