Tables 1 and 2 show summaries posted on the NVIDIA and Beckman Institute websites. At the heart of CUDA is the ability for programmers to keep thousands of threads busy. The current generation of NVIDIA GPUs can efficiently support a very large number of threads, and as a result they can deliver one to two orders of magnitude performance increase in application performance. These graphics processors are widely available to anyone at almost any price point. Newer boards will expand CUDA's capabilities by providing greater memory bandwidth, asynchronous data transfer, atomic operations, and double-precision floating point arithmetic among many hardware improvements. Look for the CUDA software environment to expand as the technology evolves and we eventually lose the distinction between GPUs and \"many-core\" processors. As developers, we have to anticipate that applications with many thousands of active threads will become common-place and look for CUDA to run on many platforms, including general-purpose processors. Can CUDA really increase application performance by one to two orders of magnitude -- or is all this hype rather than reality?
