Using geostatistical methods, the scientists constructed a map of arsenic concentrations that divides Bangladesh into regions and estimates trends in arsenic concentration at various depths. Using census data to estimate exposure distributions in the regions, and epidemiological data from West Bengal and Taiwan--countries where the effects of arsenic poisoning from drinking water have been well-documented--they estimated what dose of arsenic makes people sick. The scientists predict that long-term exposure to present arsenic concentrations will result in approximately 1.2 million cases of hyperpigmentation, 600,000 cases of keratosis, 125,000 cases of skin cancer and 3,000 fatalities per year from internal cancers. \"These numbers are highly uncertain,\" said Harvey. \"We put together available databases to see what they imply, but the dose-response models for Bangladesh remain very rough.\" The authors conclude that by replacing a selected 31 percent of the country's most-affected wells with deeper wells, arsenic poisoning and arsenic-induced cancers would be reduced by about 70 percent, assuming that arsenic concentrations in deep wells remain low. \"If the arsenic levels remain low at greater depths, and I think they will, then deeper wells are a good solution. But this should be studied,\" said Harvey, who added that the best immediate solution is to filter the water. Solving the arsenic problem in Bangladesh could also help people in other countries, such as those along the Mekong River delta in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, where high arsenic levels in drinking water and crop irrigation are becoming common (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, November 21, 2002)., 124937=Later Dhaka Community Hospital collected urine samples from 301 more people including children. 118 of them were suffering from skin problems caused by arsenic. The results of the laboratory tests of these samples were more disastrous. Arsenic was found at safe level in the urine of only 8 people (3%) while the presence of arsenic at dangerous level was found in the urine of the rest 293 people(97%). After completion of the study, the report apprehended that most people of the village were affected with arsenic. As a matter of fact, a good number of people of this village have died of arsenic pollution. Dhaka Community Hospital has records of their names, age and other particulars (Dhaka Community Hospital, June 2001)., 32344=A dose-response relationship was found between categories of time-weighted arsenic exposure (mg/L in drinking water) and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001), and the crude overall prevalence ratio amounted to 4.4. Despite the lack of detailed individual exposure data and information on potential confounders other than age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), the association seems strong enough to support a causal relationship, because the adjusted overall prevalence ratio was 5.9 (95% confidence interval 2.9-11.6)., 33783=A third Bangladeshi study (Paper IV) indicated a significantly increased risk of hypertension in connection with exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water (1481 exposed and 114 unexposed subjects). The overall crude prevalence ratio of hypertension amounted to 1.7, and the adjusted (for age, sex, and BMI) ratio was 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.0-3.6). A significant trend in risk (p << 0.001) was observed between an approximate time-weighted mean exposure to arsenic, considered in milligrams per liter or milligram-years per liter, which strengthens the possibility of a causal association.

Water from 56 villages in Karimganj and Dhemaji districts was analysed by a team of researchers headed by India\u2019s leading arsenic researcher Dr Dipankar Chakraborty from Jadavpur University. The preliminary results reveal that 19.1% of the water tested from 241 tubewells in the region had more than 50 mg/l of arsenic in it; 42.3% had more than 10 mg/l. This suggests that the groundwater contains arsenic elements much beyond the permissible level of 0.01 mg/l, as recommended by the World Health Organisation, posing serious health risks. The report brings to light the fact that around 236,302 impoverished villagers in Karimganj district suffer serious skin and kidney ailments. \u201cOut of the 20-50 children I get daily from many villages in southern and northern Karimganj, at least 25 suffer from hair, nail and skin problems,\u201d says skin specialist Dr N Chakraborty. The first visible symptoms of arsenic poisoning are dark spots on the skin known as skin lesions or melanosis, dark and light spots, or leuco-melanosis, followed by localised thickening of the skin and the formation of wart-like painful growths or keratosis, ulcers, gangrene and skin cancer. Over a long period of time, drinking arsenic-contaminated water causes skin, lung, liver, kidney and bladder cancers. \u201cWe have been drinking this tubewell water since the past five years. Only now we discovered that the water here has the highest concentration of arsenic in Assam -- 444 mg/l. We don\u2019t know what to do now as there are no alternative sources of drinking water in our locality,\u201d says Anulal Das of Kayasthagram village in northern Karimganj. Every member of his family of three is pockmarked with \u2018raindrop pigmentation\u2019 (the development of sporadic black and white patches on the back and chest). The team had earlier carried out water analysis of 1,35,000 samples in West Bengal and 55,556 samples in Bangladesh. The analysis revealed that about 60 million people were drinking arsenic-polluted water beyond the WHO recommended value, while 30 million people were consuming water with high arsenic contamination above 505 mg/l. This placed entire populations at risk. The villagers are now preparing to file a public interest litigation against the Karimganj public health engineer (PHE) in Assam\u2019s Guwahati High Court for failing to take adequate measures to stop the mass poisoning (Source: The Statesman, June 26, 2004), 63736=\"The mortality rate is high here\", or \"Many people are suffering from cancer in this village\". During the survey, two cases each of Bowen's disease and stomach cancer were confirmed by pathological diagnosis. In the arsenic affected Shengli village of the Haizhiyan district of Wuyuan county, 40 people passed away during the 11 years from 1986 to 1996 in the sixth, seventh and twelfth hamlets. (Villages consist of hamlets, each hamlet containing around 200-300 people). Among the 40 deaths, 15 were due to cancers. According to the various research reports compiled by the end of 1995, arsenic contamination in Inner Mongolia spreads in 655 villages of 11 counties and 1,774 patients were confirmed (Guo Xiao-juan, 2001)., 70237=The new study blames farm chemicals, which are cheap in Sri Lanka, thanks to government subsidies, and often overused. Cadmium is found in some fertilisers. Arsenic is an active ingredient in some pesticides. Companies that import and sell pesticides and herbicides contest the government's conclusion. They point out that the government and WHO have not yet released their full study. \"We believe the evidence is not scientific enough to say that the pesticide is the main reason for this chronic kidney disease,\" says Senarath Kiriwaththuduwage, research and development manager at Crop Life Sri Lanka, an industry trade association. \"These findings are not published in reputed scientific journals.\"(BBC, 18 September 2012 Last updated at 05:40 GMT ) Aniruddha Padaniya President of the Government Medical Officers' Association The WHO says it will publish the study in the coming months, but are still finalising details., 85400=The contamination of wells with arsenic is one of the greatest environmental disasters being faced today and must rank as one of the worst in recent times. At the request of contacts in West Bengal I researched the matter and found a technology that can get rid of all traces of arsenic. Since then I have tried to mobilise public opinion to find finance for implementation and have also talked to the West Bengal Government, people and authorities in Bangladesh, US AID, UNICEF, DIFID, SIDA and other aid donors My own estimate is that one person is dying every 15 minutes and millions are suffering in illness. But very few politicians and bureaucrats live in the affected villages and the people dying are considered to be of no consequence. Worse still, the token efforts of the World Bank and other aid agencies has added obstacles to solving the problem. If the captain of the Titanic broadcast a May Day message, most of these people would have commissioned studies on iceberg flows and common sense home spun ways of avoiding icebergs rather than sending ships to take the passengers off. My conclusion is that:, 57618=show data prepared by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Brunei Darussalam tops the list with per-capita rice consumption of 245 kilograms a year, according to Faostat, a regular food supply data prepared by the FAO, reports BSS. Vietnam is in second position with an annual rice consumption of 166 kilograms while Laos is one notch ahead of Bangladesh with 163 kilograms per person. Two South Asian nations -- Sri Lanka and Nepal -- are behind Bangladesh in per-capita rice consumption. Higher rates of rice consumption are seen in much of South and Southeast Asia, West Africa, Madagascar, and Guyana. Some of these countries have consumption rates of over 100 kilograms per person a year. Asia, the world's most populous continent, has high rates of rice consumption. China and India alone account for more than 50 percent of the world's rice consumption but they are far behind other Asian countries in per-capita rice consumption, says a report of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The FAO statistics show that each person in Bangladesh consumes 160 kilograms of rice a year, which is more than three times higher than the average global consumption rate of 50 kilograms. Myanmar and Cambodia are behind Bangladesh with annual consumption of 157 and 152 kilograms. India, Pakistan and Bhutan are not on the top 20 list while Sri Lanka and Nepal hold the 11th and 16th positions. Thailand, a major rice-producer, is in the 9th position with an annual per-capita consumption of 103 kilograms, while China stands 18th with 77 kilograms. South Korea is at the bottom of the top 20 list with each person taking 76 kilograms of rice a year. Although per-capita consumption has always been high in Asia, it has more than doubled in the rest of the world over the last 50 years, says IRRI (Daily Star, December 12, 2011)., 56629=Before the beginning of the century there were 15 countries in the world that had arsenic contamination in water.Four countries,Bangladesh,West Bengal \u2014India, China,and Taiwan, had populations that were suffering seriously. In fact, in the time span of only two years (2000 \u20132002) six more nations have found significant ground- water arsenic contamination.These are Cambodia, Lao People Democratic Republic, Pakistan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Nepal.The International Arsenic Conference at San Diego (July, 2002 ) brought out a new aspect of this debacle. For the first time the serious situation of Bihar (another state of India in Middle Ganga Plain), was confirmed. This new discovery reveals that a good portion of the Ganges Plain,with an area of about 530,831 sq.km.,may be contaminated with arsenic.This area has a population of about 450 million (including Bangladesh) (Chakroborti, 2003), 88495=Though a section is aware of the name of PHE water after setting up of an arsenic-free water treatment plant spending Rs 50 crore at Mathurapur in Manikchak block, very close to the village, but there was no sign of campaigning by any NGO group to stop using ground water. Having no alternative, villagers are drinking \u201ca drop of poison\u201d, as it were, every day. But in the next village, another victim, middle-aged Soyeb Ali, who has lost his right hand, collects PHE water for drinking every day, according to the guidance of the state\u2019s school of tropical medicine. Ali had to agree with Kolkata doctors to amputate his right hand and is tying hard to live a new life. Tafajul Hossain (40), a jobless man owing to arsenic-contamination, despite amputation of his right leg fingers is living an uncertain life with four children and wife at Sardaha village near Golapganj in Kaliachak III., 38002=Bangladesh is facing the largest mass poisoning of a population in history because of arsenic contamination of its drinking water supplies. The research by Allan H. Smith, professor of epidemiology at the University of California at Berkeley, said that between 33 and 77 millions of Bangladesh's 125 million population was at risk. Smith predicted a big increase over the coming years in the number of cases of disease caused by arsenic. These ranged from skin lesions to cancers of the bladder, kidney, lung and skin to cardiovascular problems. Bangladesh is grappling with the largest mass poisoning of a population in history because groundwater used for drinking has been contaminated with naturally occurring inorganic arsenic. The scale of this environmental disaster is greater than any seen before. It is beyond the accidents at Bhopal, India, in 1984 and Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 (Smith)., 123618=Ten years back, nobody in the village could understand the reasons behind the strange diseases which affected their skins, eyes, lungs, stomach, and intestines. When they found that their skin was pigmented and ulcerated, they thought that it might be leprosy. Some of them thought that these were symptoms of cancer. But the real reason of the diseases was detected in January,1997 when a team of experts led by Dr. Dipankar Chakraborty, carried out a study at the village. They found at least 330 people infected with skin diseases and identified arsenic pollution as the main reason behind it. They apprehended that the number of affected people is higher than the number detected, 91755=They all had dark pigmentation on their body with lesions on the soles and palms. Some were also detected with skin cancer. Sources said the state government has estimated an expenditure of Rs 324 crore over the next decade to provide a permanent alternative water supply network in the affected areas. Arsenic is erratically present in ground water. One tubewell may draw up highly contaminated water and another, barely 10 metre away, may be totally free of arsenic. After a recent survey, 11 districts starting from Bhagalpur in the east of the state to Bhojpur in the extreme west, all along the Gangetic plains, were declared arsenic-affected by the state government (Times of India, 24 June, 2006)., 114017=Among 64 districts of Bangladesh, 44 districts have arsenic contamination in groundwater (Mitul, 1998). There are reports of deaths and serious infection relating to arsenic poisoning. It is reasonable to believe that widespread areas of Bangladesh have been contaminated. Arsenic poisoning leading eventually to death,. as world-wide poisoning outbreaks are shown as follows (Pearce, 1995, Chakroborti, 1997):, 158614=COMILLA, Mar 20: The arsenic contamination has been detected in the water of 78.93 per cent tube-wells in eleven out of sixteen upazilas of the district, according to an official source. There are 41,943 tube-wells in 16 upazilas of the district. The Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) conducted a sample survey in the water of 3,029 tube-wells in eleven upazilas of the district, and water of 2,391 tube-wells was found arsenic contaminated, said Executive Engineer Mozaffar Ahmed of Comilla PHED. According to Comilla Civil Surgeon office, a total of 2929 people have been suffering from arsenic-related diseases, the sources added. Of them, 480 are in Monohorganj upazila, 562 in Laksam, 48 in Homna, 228 in Daudkandi, 724 in Muradnagar, 120 in Dabidwar, 596 in Chandina, 32 in Barura, 13 in Chowddagram, 91 in Nangolkot and 35 in Titas upazila of the district. The water of tube-wells in Comilla Sadar, Sadar Dakkhin, Burichong, Brahmanpara and Meghna was not affected with arsenic contents, the sources said. In Barura upazila, the PHED conducted the test in the water of 254 tube-wells out of 3,354, in Nangolkot 209 out of 2,420, in Laksam and Monohorgonj 142 out of 4,992, in Dabidwar 210 out of 3,259, in Chandina 208 out of 2,499, in Muradnagar 336 out of 4,582, in Daudkandi and Titas 400 out of 4,964 and in Homna 396 out of 2,619 tube-wells. An arsenic affected female patient in Eruain village, seeking anonymity, said to avoid social harassment she got treatment at her father's house instead of her husband's house. Another patient Faruk Ahmed at Charbaria village of the same upazila said some NGOs distributed medicine earlier but now they are not doing this. He demanded to set up more arsenic free tube-wells in the area. \u00a0Nur Hossain, Kandirpar Union Parishad Chairman under Laksam upazila alleged the Health Department is not giving proper attention to the arsenic affected area. Dr. Md. Salah Uddin, Laksam upazila health officer, said, \"There is sufficient stock of medicine in the health complex. If patients demand medicine, we supply it as usual.\" During the survey, the PHED put red mark on the arsenic affected tube-wells and advised people of the area not to drink water of the those tube-wells. Though the arsenic contaminated tube-wells were sealed off, people are using water of these tube-wells as there is no other alternative source of drinking water in the affected villages of the district. Comilla Civil Surgeon Dr. Mojibur Rahman, said rain water is free from arsenic contamination. A survey recorded that ring well popularly known as \"Pathkua\" is also free from arsenic contamination. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), 0.05 mg arsenic per liter of water is the tolerable limit for Bangladesh. But sample collected from different parts of the district indicated that the high percentage of the arsenic contents like 0.51mg in the tube-well water is extremely dangerous for public health. It may be mentioned here that the test of arsenic contamination in drinking water by the SDC Laboratory of the PHED cost Tk 300 to Tk 500 per tube-well. The government should conduct free tests to detect arsenic contamination in tube-well water for the better interest of (Daily Observer, 21 March, 2015, 7955=What\u2019s going on in Bangladesh is a unique horror\u2014the World Health Organization has called it \u201cthe largest mass poisoning of a population in history\u201c\u2014and it\u2019s partially due to the fact that Bangladesh gets 90% of its water from the ground. But what\u2019s going on there is hardly unique. More than 70 countries around the world have issues with arsenic in their groundwater\u2014 and it\u2019s not just poor countries like Bangladesh (Time, June 19, 2010)., 135737=Far less known is its neurological consequences on people both young and old. However a study of 12,000 residents of Araihazar, Bangladesh threw some light on this aspect that indicated how exposure to arsenic from drinking water was, in relation to the quantity of arsenic found in the water, associated with reduced intellectual function. This study reported a strong association between arsenic exposure and intelligence that is important and tragic, and adds urgency to the need for effective remediation. In addition to the elevated arsenic concentrations found in Bangladesh groundwater, the British Geological Survey reported in 2001 that many of the existing wells in Bangladesh also have manganese concentrations exceeding the WHO standard of 500 \u00b5g/l. This is of concern as occupational manganese exposure has been associated with neurologic sequelae in adults, specifically Parkinsonism., 3488=In the 1980s health problems associated with arsenic poisoning were discovered in West Bengal. Despite these clues, the arsenic problem remained unknown until a 1993 examination of pipewell water n the Nawabganj district led to the discovery of high arsenic concentrations. The number of people drinking water from wells contaminated by arsenic is staggering. 27% of the shallow pipewells have concentrations of arsenic exceeding the Bangladeshi standards of 50\u00b5g/liter, which is five times the World Health Organization\u2019s standard of 10\u00b5g/liter. It is estimated that up to 30-35 million people in Bangladesh and 6 million people in West Bengal are exposed to 50\u00b5g/liter arsenic in their water or more. 57 million people in Bangladesh are estimated to be exposed to 10\u00b5g/liter or more., 84550=The largest mass poisoning of a population in history is now underway in Bangladesh. It is a terrible public catastrophe, asserts Allan H. Smith, Professor of Epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley, and a WHO consultant who has investigated arsenicosis in Bangladesh on several trips. The number of people affected by this arsenic disaster is among the greatest of any disease facing the world today. \"By virtue of its sheer size it is pushing the limits of our knowledge and capacity to respond to it,\" asserts Professor Hans van Ginkel, Rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo (WHO,Friday 22 March 2002), 150799=The danger of arsenic, a fatal metalloid contaminating the water reserves in the entire world is on the rise. The metalloid has poisoned about 140 million people though out the world and has the highest toll in developing countries such as India. The risk has found existence from large-scale tube well drinking water facility initiated in the 20th century. The water program started with the aim of protecting surface water against the bacterial contamination found in high levels. The research done did not pay attention to the fact that arsenic; a soil ingredient leaches into the underground water resulting in vast population effected by the deadly contaminated water mostly in Vietnam, Cambodia and China. The population in North America saved through the utilities that purified this water. The rice cultivation in such areas affected due to high level of arsenic found in the irrigation water. Nearly a majority of population in South and East Asia is exposed to high arsenic poisoning. Arsenic found in pesticides and insecticides also used as wood preservative and for combustion of fossil fuels. Contaminated drinking water forms the base of arsenic poisoning in the human body. Tumor in lungs, skin, kidney and urinary bladder are the result of Arsenic infection. Cancer and skin problems observed in people exposed to arsenic infection found in 0.05mg/L drinking water. The starting effects occur on the skin that worsens to caner conditions. Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and reproductive disorders are some of health problems that occur due to high-level arsenic poisoning in drinking water. Arsenic contamination can lead to a number of problems depending upon the effect on the potassium in the body. High level of Arsenic in drinking water held responsible for hypertension, erectile dysfunction, diabetes, depression, obesity and other conditions leading to alteration of intercellular potassium volume. Long exposure and intake of arsenic infected water has irreversible effects on people. People working in industries have high chances of infected with arsenic leading to premature death and long-term illness. Farmers using pesticides and insecticides have high chances of arsenic exposure. Mining workers often accumulate high level of arsenic in their respiratory systems leading to liver cancer, lung cancer. In India, the first case of arsenic contamination came in West Bengal during 80's when tube wells held responsible for the contamination. The wells were having depth between 20-150 meters. According to Dipankar Chakraborty, head of school of environment studies in Jadavpur universities the situation started by arsenic polluted drinking water in eastern India was of alarming rate. More than 1000 villages in West Bengal infected with arsenic contaminated drinking water. Chakraborty and his team adopted measures to control the amount of arsenic contamination in water such as Thirty five percent of villages in West Bengal have tub wells with safe drinking water, and tested every 3-6 months. Epidemiological research is required to know the arsenic contaminated areas to know the health hazard and report the benefits in exposure of arsenic. People made aware about the danger of arsenic infected drinking water. Arsenic contamination in drinking water reserves both in India and Bangladesh has reached critical levels and needs to be tackled before the situation gets out of control. (Article Source: Jaceline_Peirrera), 163778=Last Modified:21 March, 2015, 40703=While the number of arsenic victims is increasing, so too is the level of acrimony as to who is responsible for this humanitarian disaster. The British Geological Survey is currently being sued by a Bangladeshi non-governmental organization. It allegedly conducted a survey in 1992 which revealed large quantities of arsenic, yet failed to provide thousands of villagers with adequate warning (Sakil Faizullah, 26 September 2002)., 141770=SHERPUR: Arsenic contamination of underground water has become severe in all the villages under 11 unions in Nalitabari upazila of Sherpur district. Some 15,000 tube wells have been tested in Nalitabari upazila where arsenic was detected in more than 6,000 tube wells, said Water Test Proof sources. A further 10,000 tube wells is under process of examination, they said. A total of 81 men, women and children are now suffering from diseases caused by arsenic. Of them, 17 patients are found in Nalitabari Sadar union, which is the most vulnerable of all. Sources said that presence of arsenic was also detected in water of a total of 88 tube wells out of 148 in Nalitabari Sadar union of the district.The arsenic infected patients are demanding safe pure drinking water, nutritious food and proper medical facilities. A human chain was formed in front of the Shaheed Minar in Nalitabari upazila town of the district on May 29. The human chain was organised, by World Arsenic Mitigation Committee in collaboration with Caritas, Mymensingh. After the event, the arsenic infected patients submitted a memorandum containing 12 demands to the Nalitabari UNO, said Abu Jafor Babo, president of Arsenic Affected Patients Association. Caritas monitoring Officer Klodia Nokrek Keya said Caritas Mymensingh has been working to raise public awareness about arsenic contamination in Nalitabari upazila of the district for a long time (The Independent, 05 June 2014 )., 154375=KUSHTIA, Dec 22, 2014, Daily Observer: The number of patients attacked with arsenic-related diseases is increasing alarmingly in different parts of the district. It is alleged that due to lack of regular visit of the field workers of the Health Department, the number of patients is increasing unabatedly. Sources at Kumarkhali Upazila Health Complex said that the number of arsenic-affected patients in the upazila was 242 last year. But the number has increased rapidly with 412 patients this year. It is also alleged that the trained women workers of the upazila health complex had done nothing to detect the arsenic affected patients in the upazila. As a result, the situation has turned worse. The arsenic affected tube-wells were detected marking red signs and the users were asked not to use the water of the tube-wells marked in the year of 2001 in the district for the last time. The red-marked tube-wells were identified for not to drink and use the water. Dr Akuluddin of Kumarkhali Health Complex said that the green marked tube-wells might have already turned into arsenic affected ones. He also said that most of the arsenic free tube-wells installed by the government have already gone out of order due to lack of proper maintenance and monitoring. According to him, there has been a project for setting up new arsenic free tube-wells under Kumarkhali Upazila Public Health Office. But the office has not yet showed any interest to repair the old ones for using. Sources in Public Health Office of Kumarkhali upazila said that 30 per cent water in the newly set up tube-wells has been contaminated. As a result, the inhabitants of Kumarkhali are very much worried about the health hazards caused by arsenic. The menace of arsenic is coming rapidly as the level of the groundwater is going down very rapidly. Scarcity of pure drinking water has gripped the district as most of the groundwater has been contaminated. It was very easy to get pure drinking water from the underground level ten to 15 years back. Some 16,000 tube-wells have been tested in Daulotpur upazila where arsenic was detected in more than 6,000 tube wells, said Water Test Proof sources. More 10,000 tube wells are under process of examination, they added. A total of 100 men, women and children are now suffering from diseases caused by arsenic. Of them, 17 patients are found in Daulotpur Sadar union, which is the most vulnerable of all. Sources said that presence of arsenic was also detected in water of a total of 88 tube wells out of 148 in Daulotpur Sadar union of the district. The arsenic-infected patients are demanding safe pure drinking water, nutritious food and proper medical facilities. At present, the people of the district face problems to obtain drinking water as the contamination has been growing quickly day-by-day. Sources said that the level of contamination is very high in the unions of Shelaidah, Jagannathpur and Chandpur of Kumarkhali upazila. The patients of these areas have been suffering a lot from skin diseases and black marks are visible on their bodies. The inhabitants of Hasimpur and Dayarampur villages under Jagannathpur union said that they feel pain on their chest and backbone. They are absolutely helpless and they do not have any opportunities to prevent the deadly disease. They said that they had been prescribed some medicines in the month of July in the last year. But nobody took any care of them afterwards. Sajida, Kulsum, Vanu and Fatema are among the villagers who have been attacked with arsenic diseases at Hasimpur village. Kulsum Begum alleged that they are passing their days in panic as no government or non-government organisations have come forward to mitigate their sufferings. According to the Department of Public Health of Kumarkhali, the level of arsenic contamination is very high because they are living beside the river Padma and experts of the office said that the level of contamination rises at very high rate when it is boiled. - See more at: http://www.observerbd.com/2014/12/23/62296.php#sthash.HBkpo3d6.dpuf, 99213=ON January 14, 2010, The Daily Star reported an increase in the accumulation of arsenic levels in the topsoil of agricultural lands that are irrigated by arsenic-rich groundwater. The article referred to a recent study by Professor Badruzzaman and Professor Ali (both of Buet). In their study, the professors reported that paddy grown on lands that have been irrigated by arsenic-rich groundwater contain up to 0.3 milligrams (300 micrograms) of arsenic per kilogram of paddy. A relevant but unanswered question is whether this level of arsenic in the grains is a health threat. While the Daily Star article is rather ominous in its tone, some analysis based on WHO and FAO data leads to a less threatening conclusion. World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) have been concerned with arsenic for several decades now. In 1967, Who established the maximum allowable daily load (MADL) of arsenic as 50 micrograms/kg of bodyweight/day. Several years later, these initial limits were significantly revised by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The revision declared provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) of 15 micrograms/kg of bodyweight/week for inorganic arsenic (the harmful form of arsenic generally found in the ground). Note that this translates to arsenic intake of just 2.14 micrograms/kg of bodyweight/day. This stringent limit set forth by JECFA remains in practice even now. It should also be noted here that the minimum lethal dose of arsenic is roughly 1,000 micrograms/kg of bodyweight/day. With the different arsenic intake limits available, we are in a position to examine whether arsenic consumption through rice is a serious threat. Let us assume that the average Bangladeshi man weighs about 60 kg and the average woman weighs about 50 kg. Then, following the most stringent arsenic intake limit set by JECFA, we have PTWI of approximately 900 micrograms (128.57 micrograms per day) and 750 micrograms (107.14 micrograms per day) of arsenic for a man and a woman respectively. If we adhere to the 1967 MADL limit, MADL is 3,000 micrograms for a man and 2,500 micrograms for a woman. The minimum lethal dose would be about 60,000 micrograms for a man and 50,000 micrograms for a woman. It is estimated that for average Bangladeshis, about 70% of daily caloric intake comes from rice. Assuming that a woman of 50 kg weight consumes 1,500 calories and a man of 60 kg weight consumes 2,000 calories, the woman will have consumed 1,050 calories in rice and the man will have consumed 1,400 calories in rice. Since 1 gram of rice produces 4 calories, we can deduce that the woman will have consumed 262.5 grams of rice and the man will have consumed 350 grams of rice per day. If the rice comes from paddy that has 300 micrograms of arsenic (the highest amount found by Professors Badruzzaman and Ali), then the arsenic consumption for our hypothetical 60kg Bangladeshi man is 105 micrograms and for our hypothetical 50kg Bangladeshi woman is 78.5 micrograms per day. These numbers are below even the most stringent arsenic intake limits established by JECFA. Of course, the MADL and the lethal levels are nowhere near the arsenic consumed through rice that came from paddy registering the highest levels of arsenic in the study. Although these levels of arsenic are below the PTWI established by JECFA, the health risks involved with considerable consumption of arsenic should not be neglected. As identified by the WHO, the symptoms associated with arsenic poisoning are abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody \"rice water\" diarrhea. Also, arsenic is classified as a carcinogen and may cause cancer of the skin, lungs, kidneys, and bladder. The health risks of arsenic are greatest for children, elderly, and those whose immune systems are compromised due to disease. In Bangladesh, arsenic intake occurs mainly through drinking arsenic-rich water. Reducing arsenic content in drinking water is an effective way to keep arsenic intake in check. Compared to the threat of arsenic-rich drinking water, the presence of arsenic in irrigation water (because it passes on to food grains) seems less threatening. Being aware of arsenic concentration in water is necessary, but a trace amount of arsenic in paddy is perhaps not as alarming., 16127=Tani, 1999 classified affected villagers as 1 were suffering from malanosis (hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation). Villagers in category 2 were suffering from melanosis and keratosis on the hands and/or feet. Villagers in category 3 were the most severely affected and were suffering from melanosis and developed (late stage) keratosis on the hands and/or feet. This classification is similar to that proposed by A.W Khan (WHO 1997). He suggested that arsenicosis could be categorised into 3 sequential stages:, 95799=MIT study finds ruthless killer in Bangladesh's drinking water is making millions of people sick and may be causing as many as 3,000 deaths each year. That killer--naturally occurring arsenic in the water drawn from family wells--appears to have been released through a process involving crop irrigation, at least in one part of the country. At a research site in the southern part of Bangladesh, scientists calculated that irrigation pumping, which began in the last several decades, has dramatically altered groundwater flow through the aquifer. They show that the resulting changes to the chemistry of the groundwater have the potential to either increase or decrease arsenic levels, in a paper written by an MIT-led team of scientists in the Nov. 22 issue of Science. \"Our data indicate that the arsenic was mobilized largely by degradation of dissolved organic carbon by microbes. Some of the organic carbon appears to have been drawn into the aquifer by irrigation pumping,\" said Charles F. Harvey, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT and lead author of that paper. \"But the effects of irrigation are complex, probably lowering arsenic concentrations in other areas. Curtailing irrigation pumping is not a solution.\" Harvey is also an author of a research paper providing an epidemiological analysis of arsenic-induced illness throughout Bangladesh. That paper will appear next year in the Water Resources Research journal published by the American Geophysical Union. In it, the authors conclude that replacing 31 percent of the country's most tainted wells with deeper wells will eliminate about 70 percent of the illness, assuming that arsenic levels remain low in the deep wells. Arsenic poisoning, usually characterized by sores on the chest, or blackened knotty palms, and cases of skin, lung, liver, bladder and pancreas cancers have been linked to arsenic in the drinking water. In 1998 the World Bank agreed to provide Bangladesh a $32.4 million credit to develop a method of controlling the arsenic. But today, most Bangladeshis continue to drink arsenic-laced water. The World Bank describes the problem as one of the world's primary environmental challenges. The World Health Organization refers to it as \"the largest mass poisoning of a population in history\" in a fact sheet published in March. The mass poisoning began, sadly enough, with a well-meaning attempt to provide clean drinking water for Bangladeshis, who suffered from cholera and other diseases caused by bacteria in water taken from surface reservoirs. To remedy that problem, the Bangladesh government, with the help of international aid organizations, drilled between 6 and 10 million wells at depths ranging from 50 to 300 feet to provide clean, safe water for individual households. At about the same time, farmers in this largely rural country began irrigating land so that rice, the country's main food staple, could be grown during all six of the dry months when monsoon flooding abates. Cholera deaths dropped. But about 10 years into the use of the tube wells, villagers started displaying symptoms consistent with arsenic-related illnesses, and incidents of skin cancer and internal cancers became common., 51637=Affected tube-wells, 1999 Assuming 0.250 mg/litre as the mean content of arsenic in groundwater, a person who consumes 1500 ml of this water each day for 10 years will consume about 6 gm of arsenic only from water. It is reported in the literature that 3 to 25 grams of arsenic when consumed over 1 to 22 years produces hepatic damage in the form of cirrhosis and non-cirrhotic hypertension (Morris, et al., 1974). Considering the poor health situation of the majority of the population in Bangladesh and double the amount of water consumption it is very likely dose-response effects will be more severe and devastating., 37314=\"Another unfortunate and complicating fact about arsenic poisoning,\" Hiroki Hashizume adds, \"is that it generally takes from seven to 10 years, sometimes longer, for the disease to be recognized. When it finally is, it may be too late to treat.\" Professor Robert Goyer, who headed a nine-member commission of the US National Academies of Science, says its findings bolster a 1999 study by the Academy that found that men and women who drink every day water with 10 ppb of arsenic have an increased risk of more than 3 in 1000 of developing bladder or lung cancer during their lifetime. That risk rises to 7 in 1000 at 20 ppb., 59706=A team of scientists led by Dr Parvez Haris from De Montfort University, Leicester, UK is carrying out research to remove arsenic from water and identify ways of reducing human exposure to arsenic through diet. Haris and his team have already demonstrated that exposure to the more toxic inorganic arsenic species is greater in people who eat more rice. In this latest work, the De Montfort University team \u2013 along with Dr Michael Watts from the British Geological Survey, Keyworth, Nottingham, UK \u2013 has identified varieties that are low in arsenic but high in essential trace elements such as selenium and zinc. Earlier studies showed high concentrations of arsenic in Bangladeshi rice, but the rice samples were mainly from regions where the irrigation water contains higher levels of arsenic. The team carried out a detailed study on rice from the greater Sylhet region in the north-east of Bangladesh, which generally has a lower groundwater arsenic concentration. The results showed Sylheti rice to have a far lower arsenic concentration than similar types of rice from other regions of Bangladesh. Results also showed that the arsenic concentration in aromatic rice was 40 percent less than non-aromatic varieties and that it also contained higher concentrations of the essential elements selenium and zinc. \u201cThis is a very important finding since consumption of certain types of aromatic rice will not only reduce human exposure to arsenic, but will also increase their intake of zinc and selenium,\u201d says Dr Haris. \u201cThis is very good news for millions of Bangladeshis who are exposed to high concentration of arsenic through drinking water and rice and are also deficient in zinc and selenium.\u201d For someone consuming 500 grams of non-aromatic or aromatic rice from Sylhet, the daily intake of arsenic from rice would be approximately 48 percent and 69 percent lower, respectively, compared with consuming non-aromatic rice from other parts of Bangladesh. \u201cOur identification of rice with very low arsenic concentration and higher quantities of essential elements is good news for the Bangladeshis and other communities where rice is a staple food but it is important to encourage a more balanced diet that is less dependent on rice,\u201d Haris explains. Aromatic rice is generally cultivated during the wet (aman) season and therefore is less dependent on the use of groundwater for irrigation. It also requires less fertilizer and pesticides. Haris recommends that the authorities in Bangladesh encourage farmers to cultivate more aromatic rice. Although the yield of aromatic rice is lower, the farmers will not need to spend much money on applying chemicals that could pollute the environment and harm their own health. \u201cFurthermore, energy costs (electricity or diesel) will be lower as there will be less need for them to pump groundwater for irrigation,\u201d Haris says (Daily Sun, 17 February 2013)., 42038=KHULNA, June 24, 2008 (UNB): Over 38,000 people in the country were affected with arsenic-related diseases while water of 30 per cent tubewells contaminated with arsenic till 2006, according to a government survey. The number of patients may rise if the latest results of the division wise surveys are published, said a Health Department workshop here Tuesday. Arsenic Programme of the Health Ministry and Department held the monitoring and evaluation workshop on \"Searching of Arsenicosis Patients and Management\". It also said Water of some 1.44 million tube-wells in 270 upazilas of 62 districts were contaminated with arsenic while 66.0 million tubewells identified as vulnerable. Dr AKM Mujibur Rahman, NCD and OPHE Programme Officer, presided the workshop, addressed, among others, by Deputy Secretary (Administra-tion) of Health and Family Welfare Mahfuzul Huq, Divisional Deputy Director of Health Department Dr Zebunnesa Khatun and district Civil Surgeon Dr Maksuda Begum. In Bangladesh, arsenic contamination of ground water was first detected in 1993 by the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) at Sama village of Baroghoria union in Sadar Upazila of Chapainawabganj district. After testing water in different districts, some eight arsenic patients were detected in 1995. The number rose to 23 in 1996 while 42 in '97 and 60 in 98. And the number stood at 38,412 in 2006. Some 5,120 arsenicosis patients were detected in Khulna division due to consumption of arsenic contaminated water. District-wise break up of patients are : Khulna - 420, Jessore - 1,537, Bagerhat - 490, Satkhira - 194, Narail - 107, Magura - 174, Jhenidah - 312, Chuadanga - 815, Kushtia - 637 and Meherpur - 373. The workshop was informed that the government has undertaken different arsenic mitigation programmes. Medicines have already been sent to different district and upazila health complexes through CMSD. The government has initiated to take rehabilitation programme for the arsenicosis patients. (The Financial Express, June 25, 2008)., 137324=The human body excretes arsenic at a rate that depends on the individual but if arsenic is ingested at a rate greater than can be excreted by the kidneys, it builds up in liver, spleen and blood. However, if it can be excluded from the diet, this build-up, with the exception of the portion sequestered in nails and hair, will be excreted within days or weeks. But few are lucky enough to look forward to an arsenic free diet because too many people are still drinking contaminated ground water. This worry is intensified by the fact that 63 per cent of tube-wells are contaminated with unacceptable concentrations of arsenic. But the possibility of arsenic poisoning is the most challenging of all the health problems facing the nation for one simple reason, no one can be sure where it will strike, or when, as it takes between 2 and 20 years for symptoms to emerge. And worse - without any external manifestation of arsenic poisoning, a person can still succumb to its consequences either in the form of cancer or due to acute renal failure. Empirical evidence suggests that some stages of arsenicosis such as Melanosis, are reversible, provided the consumption of contaminated water is stopped. In other words drinking arsenic free water can stymie the deterioration of the patient. But as unfortunately no data related to total recovery has been recorded, this statement cannot be supported with statistics. However this does not detract from the major challenge facing the nation - how to provide millions of people with arsenic free, bacteria free as well as chemically safe, aesthetically acceptable alternative source/s of drinking water. Unless an effective action plan on Health and the Environment is put in place, one that can identify the areas of concern and define all possible solutions, the country is likely to be swamped by this crisis because the average person\u2019s understanding of what is called \u201cthe largest mass arsenic-poisoning case the world has ever seen\u201d is not only limited but generally erroneous. As such, arsenic poisoning will continue to take its toll on the people of Bangladesh. Many people have lost a limb to amputation but under the current programme for screening patients, no provision has been made for surgical intervention, nor is there a plan for rehabilitation. Although the Dhaka Community Hospital Trust is doing a good job, their resources are limited. However, DCH doctors have gone out into the field to train Government and NGO health workers in an effort to improve identification and treatment of cases of arsenic-poisoning as patients with severe acute gastrointestinal signs and symptoms may pose a diagnostic challenge. However ingestion of arsenic is the most common cause of poisoning and in consideration of this, diagnosis is essential, because acute arsenic poisoning can be fatal if it remains undetected. Acute respiratory failure can occur due to severe weakness of the respiratory muscles. Bronchial pneumonia and upper respiratory tract inflammation commonly develop. Central nervous system changes are found, including sudden altered mental status, seizures, toxic delirium and encephalopathic Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet are quite common. Patients may develop an unusual posturing of the hands, brought about by intense dysesthesias in the hands and feet. Severe peripheral neuropathy following several days of exposure to arsenic has also been noted. Dermatologic findings include flushing of the skin, hyperpigmentation and brawny desquamation, as well as dermatitis and folliculitis. Hyperkeratosis, especially of the palms and soles, has been described. White transverse bands across the fingernails and toenails may be observed four to six weeks after exposure. Diagnosis of acute arsenic intoxication should be considered in any patient with gastrointestinal complaints as the hallmark, including epigastric burning, esophageal pain, colicky abdominal pain, and persistent vomiting and diarrhea, which may be bloody. The vomiting and diarrhea frequently manifest as profound dehydration, leading to cardiovascular collapse and possible seizures (Sylvia Mortoza, The Bangladesh Observer, March 21, 2005), 32883=One of the other studies performed in Bangladesh (Paper V; 1481 exposed individuals, 430 exhibiting keratosis) showed a somewhat higher prevalence rate of skin lesions in males (31%) than females (26%) due to chronic arsenic toxicity., 4427=The crisis in Bangladesh and West Bengal highlights the health problems associated with arsenic poisoning. Skin problems such as keratosis, pigmentation and de-pigmentation, and skin cancer are widespread. Patients who have been exposed for a longer period of time have developed internal organ problems such as cancer, and many more have died. The arsenic poisoning was first identified in West Bengal in July of 1983. Since then, the numbers of arsenic victims has grown with each new study., 112560=FARIDPUR, June 8, 2003:\u2013A day-long workshop on \"Community based arsenic mitigation action research project\" jointly organised by Faridpur District Administration and Department of Public Health Engineering in collaboration with UNICEF was held on Wednesday at Faridpur Zila Parishad conference hall, reports BSS. The workshop was organised to review the progress of arsenic mitigation activities in Bhanga Upazila of this district where arsenic problem is very much alarming. According to workshop sources, in Bhanga 91 per cent Hand Tubewell (HTW) is arsenic affected. Out of 21300 HTW, 19127 HTW are arsenic affected and its water consists very high rate of arsenic beyond human consumption (BSS, 2003)., 126010=JUST a few years ago, the Bangladesh (and several international) media were awash with the news of several parts of the country being afflicted by a variety of illnesses brought about, totally or partially, by the drinking of arsenic-rich water. Then, as other news began to dominate the headlines of newspapers and TV channels, and also probably because the dire situation related to arsenic poisoning had improved enough, the news was relegated to the inside pages, and, that, too, on the rare occasion. If the scenario has indeed become significantly better, then that credit belongs primarily to the heroic efforts of a relatively small number of caregivers, both local and international (specifically, Japanese), who have dedicated themselves to tackling a very serious problem. Samta: Arsenic Dushone Akranto Ekti Gram has been written by one of those caregivers, Manjuara Parvin, detailing her own involvement in the programme run by the Japan-based NGO Asia Arsenic Network (AAN), which focuses solely on arsenic-related problems. AAN started working in Bangladesh in 1997, and Parvin joined the organization at the very beginning as an everyday worker. Through this association she got to learn about, in her words, the illness called 'arsenicosis', which originates from drinking arsenic-rich water, come in close contact with people suffering from it, and the opportunity to take care of them. She was born and raised in Samta, a village of Jessore, a number of whose inhabitants had been afflicted with the disease (even she had shown early symptoms, but had been cured), and whose story was carried in the print media in early 1996. The news came to the attention of the National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine (NIPSOM), whose officials visited the village in September 1996 (although, in the Preface, she states that NIPSOM became interested in the then unknown disease --- in Bangladesh --- called arsenicosis in December 1996). AAN then got in touch with NIPSOM, visited various localities of Bangladesh that had been affected by the disease, and eventually settled on Samta, with NIPSOM's concurrence, as the place to center its activities of research relating to underwater arsenic contamination, health issues, and treatment of arsenic-related diseases. Parvin devotes the entire first chapter on giving an account of her village and her family. Parts of it are anecdotal, others recounted from personal experience, and a few are endearing (maybe even enduring for at least some time to come) folklores. Some of the stories deal with the supernatural, which had happened in her village as told by villagers and her elderly family members, and, at least on a couple of occasions, from her own personal encounters. They will strain the skeptic's credulity, while feeding the flight of fancy of the imaginative, sensitive, or romantic minds. Her multiple encounters with poisonous snakes attest to her sagacity and quick reaction in dealing with them. The village was once, when the British raj was still prevailing in India, under the tyrannical dominance of two Hindu zamindars from the same family, who, even though they liked Parvin's father because he had designed the main door of their mansion, did not fail to mistreat him. They went over to India following partition by the raj. One of the striking features of the first chapter is the contrast it presents between the way of life and living conditions in Samta before the mid-1990s, and after, an account that reflects the story of the Bangladeshi society in general. While the differences can be measured in terms of the ushering in of the age of globalization and its principal catalyst, the Internet, they can also be viewed in terms of relative prosperity. Parvin talks in sketchy detail about agriculture, food habit, modes of attire, education, the use of television and shallow tubewells in Samta, and shows how much the lifestyle of the villagers has improved from the time when the age of globalization and the Internet had not yet established its foothold on the village. In this section Parvin evinces the ability of not only being observant about the marked changes that had taken place in the village, but also about the preferences of the audiences of TV shows. For example, the viewers in the village prefer to watch the foreign (read: Indian) channels over the Bangladeshi ones. The females like to watch Poshchimbanga and Indian (read: Hindi) drama serials more than anything else. Particularly interesting in the context of her topic is the section on shallow tubewells. Before the 1970s, the inhabitants of Samta had no knowledge of the use of shallow tubewell water for cooking and drinking purposes. They used the water from ponds, rivers and rivulets, and wells. As a result, they often used to fall victims of water-borne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, and typhoid. Since there was a dearth of qualified doctors, the afflicted villagers went to the lone homeopath who prescribed herbal medicines. Mortality rate was fairly high, and gradually people learnt about the water-borne diseases and their origins. Eventually, they had shallow tubewells dug in almost every family home and used the water pumped out of them. Ironically, in Samta (as in several other places across the country), a new disease, directly linked to arsenic that was mixed in the water coming out of the tubewells, was proving to be more deadly than the other water-borne diseases. The upshot of the appearance of the disease and the knowledge of the carrier was for the villagers to go back to the 1970s and the centuries-old practice before that! They have gone back to the ponds, rivers, rivulets, canals, and wells for water to drink and cook in. They have come full cycle and gone back to the past, or is it the future? Learning from past experience, the villagers now purify the water by using filter, boiling, or using bleaching powder. The author is, nonetheless, apprehensive that even in water from deep tubewells, arsenic would be found. Then, she contends, water (purified) from ponds and rivers would be the only safe means for drinking and cooking. Parvin talks extensively and lovingly about the expatriate Japanese and Bangladeshi doctors of AAN who had given so much of their time and effort to combat the arsenic-related diseases, and to look after those who had been afflicted with them. Among several of these caregivers, the names of Kaguyuki Kawahara, Dr. Sk. Akhtar Ahmed, Sachie Tsushima, Hiroshi Yokota, and Dr. M.H. Faruqee stand out. She extols the Japanese photographer Jin San, who used to help out the families of arsenic-stricken patients with money, something that the affluent of Samta did not do. In a different context, she makes another telling point. In 1997 she was elected a Union Parishad member, and, in that capacity, had proposed that funding be made available for the construction of a paved road from Jamtola Bazaar to Samta Bazaar. She was told that she could have her wish on payment of Taka 40,000 to the local Member of Parliament. She was so mortified that she vowed never to run for public office again. Parvin is convinced that people in Bangladesh run for public office for their individual and party's benefit. They do not much care for the general populace's welfare. However, the author has her own personal moment of success when, in Japan in 1998, as a participant in the 3rd Forum on Arsenic Contamination of Ground Water in Asia, she succeeded in getting her proposals accepted on establishing an arsenic center in her locality for the treatment and service of patients, and for them to receive medicine free of cost each month. The author noted the similarity in Samta's experience with that of the Japanese village Toroku, whose people had also had suffered from arsenic-related diseases. She observes with satisfaction how AAN's project had been expanded to include Dhaka, Jessore, and Sharsha upazilla. She is pleased that, in a traditional society where almost any change is hard to come by, the villagers have agreed that, more than agriculture and pisciculture, uncontaminated drinking water is of greater signifance. Manjuara Parvin has not written a book that will shake the academics or the movers and shakers of the country. It is a story of a person who has been involved with tackling a deadly disease that has affected a good number of people in different parts of Bangladesh, including her own village of Samta. But she writes with feeling and resolve, and this book is as much a story of her own triumph over adversity as it is of a concerted effort at defeating a deadly disease. One can do worse than going through Samta: Arsenic Dushone Akranto Ekti Gram.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 20 Jun 2015 17:21:36 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "There is a theory that Napoleon Bonaparte suffered from arsenic poisoning, and samples of his hair did show high levels of the element.

The case is equivocal, in the absence of clearly authenticated samples of the wallpaper.
