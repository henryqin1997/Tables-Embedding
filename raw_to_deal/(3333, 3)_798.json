Note that the width and height of the viewport in the user coordinate system for the viewport element (in this case, the outermost svg element) are 4000 and 2000, respectively, because processing the \u2018viewBox\u2019 attribute results in a transformed user coordinate system. The topmost rectangle, which is specified in percentage units, is exactly the same size as the middle rectangle, which is specified in equivalent user units. In particular, note that the \u2018stroke-width\u2019 property in the middle rectangle is set to 1% of the sqrt((actual-width)**2 + (actual-height)**2)) / sqrt(2), which in this case is .01*sqrt(4000*4000+2000*2000)/sqrt(2), or 31.62.
