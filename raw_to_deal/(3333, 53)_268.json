TIFIA is the most complex and most far reaching of the credit assistance programs. Because funds can be made available directly to a public-private partnership, it is often viewed as the most critical transportation program created by Congress that is aimed at the public-private partnerships discussed in this report. Certain Federal conditions apply comprehensively to an action that is the beneficiary of a TIFIA loan. These include Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, NEPA, and the Uniform Act. Other Federal requirements would apply to the same extent that would be the case if the TIFIA project were to be funded with grant funds (i.e., Davis-Bacon, DBE). Thus, the extent to which Federal conditions apply depends upon what types of funds are being applied to the specific construction project contract being undertaken by the recipient of the TIFIA loan., 534593=[83] Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Paving the Way: A Review of the Texas Department of Transportation, January 2001,.

As noted in the 2002 AASHTO \u201cGuide for Methods and Procedures in Contract Maintenance,\u201d States are procuring maintenance and preservation services in a variety of ways. Two distinct contracting methods are typically employed by the States. The most common type specifies the means and methods to be used to accomplish specific maintenance activities. This type of contract is referred to as specification-based. The other type of contract is performance-based, in which all risks for the maintenance of certain assets are transferred from the agency to the contractor in accordance with level-of-service requirements outlined in the contract. This form of procurement is often referred to as asset management. Although contracting out asset management may be new to many transportation agencies, a number of State agencies have been using these techniques for more than ten years.

During the same time, maintenance costs fell by 40 percent. The BTCE reports that the cost reduction was accomplished mainly though Boral\u2019s flexible employment practices such as subcontracting and shifting work hours. Another example comes from the Clare District Council in rural South Australia. There, the Council divided its road grading work between public employees and private contractors as part of a pilot test. For the public employees, the cost per kilometer graded was about $60. For the private contractor, cost was a low $30. Finally, the governments of Queensland and the Northern Territory took different approaches to maintenance work on the Barkly Highway. Maintenance work on the Queensland stretch was done by public employees, while work on the Northern Territory portion was done by private contractors.

When those revenues did not materialize, the investors began to miss their quarterly interest payments of $7 million each. However, they won approval from lenders to skip the payments for the rest of the year, avoiding foreclosure through the end of 1997. In December 1997, the sponsors were discussing a further extension of their standstill agreement with the lenders., 22276=Public-Private Partnership: a contractual agreement formed between public and private sector partners, which allows more private sector participation than is traditional. The agreements usually involve a government agency contracting with a private company to renovate, construct, operate, maintain, and/or manage a facility or system. While the public sector usually retains ownership in the facility or system, the private party will be given additional decision rights in determining how the project or task will be completed. The term public-private partnership defines an expansive set of relationships from relatively simple contracts (e.g., A+B contracting), to development agreements that can be very complicated and technical (e.g., design-build-finance-operate-maintain). In the context of this report, the term public-private-partnership is used for any scenario under which the private sector would be more of a partner than they are under the traditional method of procurement. Further, the broad definition used for public-private partnerships includes many elements that are applied fairly regularly on appropriate projects. \u201cPublic-Private Partnerships: Terms Related to Building and Facility Partnerships.\u201d GAO/GDD-99-71, April 1999, http://www.gao.gov/special/pubs/Gg99071.pdf, 105065=State Infrastructure Banks: Pilot Program Participation as of March 2004, 439947=The developers expect the project to be completed in October 2006, years ahead of when it would have been completed with traditional funding.

Private equity and financing have accounted for 78 percent of the project\u2019s costs.[405], 67683=Immediately after World War II, States increasingly recognized that modern, high quality highway systems were needed to meet growing demands for personal and commercial travel. The Pennsylvania Turnpike was the first of the modern highways to be constructed, and it was an immediate success. Between 1945 and 1955, many States, mainly located in the North and East, began to build turnpikes on their primary intercity travel corridors. These turnpikes typically were administered by public turnpike commissions or turnpike authorities that usually were not part of the State highway agency, but were separate State agencies. They were not private enterprises as many of the earlier turnpike companies had been. The tradition of publicly-provided highways had become so deeply ingrained that few thought of involving the private sector in financing and operating highways. But, States also recognized that motorists were willing to pay tolls for the comfort, convenience and speed provided by the new turnpikes. By issuing bonds and charging tolls States could construct the needed highways much sooner than if they had to finance them primarily from fuel tax revenues., 586951=[382] Battelle, Performance-Based Contracting for the Highway Construction Industry: An Evaluation of the Use of Innovative Contracting and Performance Specifications in Highway Construction, Final Report, prepared at the request of Koch Industries, Inc., February 2003, 25-28. http://www.ncppp.org/resources/papers/battellereport.pdf., 575385=[309] Apogee Research, Inc., Summary of the Federal Highway Administration's Symposium on Overcoming Barriers to Public-Private Partnerships, prepared at the request of the Federal Highway Administration, (FHWA-PL-94-026), May 1994, 12., 186619=Innovative ways to manage projects can also result in access to alternative funding and project efficiencies that will result in significant time savings. South Carolina and Louisiana have each developed nontraditional programs to deliver much needed transportation facilities sooner than could be achieved through conventional contracting methods. Through the use of innovative financing mechanisms and private sector management resources, these two States have been able to drastically cut the construction time for transportation projects. In South Carolina, the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) is advancing 27 years of road and bridge projects in just seven years. Similarly, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) is scheduled to deliver 16 specific transportation projects by 2010., 125372=Joint Development is the use of public transportation property originally acquired with Federal grant dollars for transit-related development. This may occur in the form of development in air rights above a transit station, or it may involve the use of land area adjacent to the station. A 1992 study commissioned by the Federal Transit Administration identified 117 projects nationwide, involving a combination of air-rights and ground lease arrangements.[29] These projects have generated ground rent, lease, or one-time access rights revenues for the public transportation provider. In these projects, the public transportation agency makes land or air rights available to a developer. In some instances, the agency is not able, under its charter, to participate in development activity (which would produce lease revenue), so it undertakes a cost-sharing agreement with the developer, who agrees to perform certain functions such as station maintenance, security, or access control, in exchange for the development opportunity. In most cases, however, the transit agency has collected substantial revenues. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) air rights agreement in Bethesda, Maryland for example, produces $1.6 million in rents annually., 171549=In the case of the SR 125 South Toll Road project, a $140 million TIFIA loan is an essential element of the project\u2019s financial plan, which also includes senior bank debt as well as private equity. This project demonstrates how innovative finance can attract private investment to transportation projects. Over $150 million in private at-risk equity was invested in this project. In addition, local real estate developers are donating approximately $48 million of land for right-of-way. If the SR 125 South project had not been advanced as a private financed facility under AB 680, operation would have been delayed to 2020 or later, according to Caltrans., 517391=[25] Federal Highway Administration, Exploring Key Issues in Public-Private Partnerships for Highway Development, Searching for Solutions: A Policy Discussion Series, No. 2, (FHWA-PL-92-023), June 1992 ., 533609=[77] \u201cInnovation Paves the Way for the Massachusetts Route 3 North Project,\u201d FHWA's Innovative Finance Quarterly, Vol. 6, No. 3, Fall 2000, http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/ifq63.htm., 598071=[432] Notice listing Federal environmental laws and Executive Order applicable to the development and review of transportation infrastructure projects, 69 Fed.

For example, the Government Accountability Office found that ownership of SR 91 was returned to the State because the private partner did not want to assume the tort liability for operating the toll road.[274] Because of tort liability, transactions may have to be structured in a way that does not produce the greatest public advantage., 602398=[454] Apogee Research, Inc., Implications of Change in Procedures and Laws to Advance Public-Private Partnerships, prepared at the request of the Federal Highway Administration , (FHWA-PL-95-026), April 30, 1995, 17., 419384=The massive bridge on the Pocahontas Parkway became the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge on Sept. 20, the same day the remaining westbound lanes were opened to traffic; eastbound lanes and a portion of the westbound lanes opened in May. This bridge offers the area's third major James River crossing., 452397=About $800 million of tax-exempt bond financing is required to support the proposed Tacoma Narrows Bridge project. The state has funded $50 million and provided certain tax exemptions and tax deferrals that help to reduce the project costs. Upon opening, a toll will be charged to cross the new Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the eastbound direction. The toll will initially be set at $3.00. Future tolls will be set by the Transportation Commission with recommendations by the Citizen Advisory Committee appointed by the Governor. Citizen Committee members must reside within the project area. The project notice to proceed was provided to the design-builder in September 2002. The project is scheduled to be completed in early 2008., 442627=The $1.4 billion project was financed primarily through senior-lien revenue bonds ($1.079 billion). Additionally, a $120 million in standby Federal line of credit, $91 million in junior-lien bonds, $38 million in project revenue certificates, and other sources helped fund the project. The project\u2019s sole sources of revenue are tolls, development impact fees, and interest earnings. Opening in 1996, the toll road is currently operating at 83 percent of projections., 248811=For example, a poll conducted in January 2004 by the Star Tribune in Minnesota found that those surveyed would be more willing to finance new highway construction with tolls, rather than an increase in the gas tax.[186] Of those polled, 69 percent indicated a preference for tolling to finance highway construction, rather than an increase in the State gas tax.[187] Only 23 percent of those polled indicated a preference for an increase in the State gas tax rather than tolls.[188] This poll was conducted by the newspaper to determine public opinion about the proposed regional \"Fast Lane\" network in the Twin Cities area. Tolls would be charged on new capacity added to existing freeways., 510888=One of the nine exemptions covers trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is obtained from a person and is privileged or confidential (\u201cconfidential business information\u201d).[467] In addition, the courts have ruled that the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905) is co-extensive with the FOIA exemption for confidential business information. Therefore, Federal agencies have an additional basis for withholding trade secrets that form part of a private sector proposal. If, in response to a FOIA request, the agency determines that it may be required to release material submitted that may or may not fall under the definition of confidential business information, the submitter will be notified prior to the agency\u2019s final determination and given an opportunity to specify why these records should not be released. Pursuant to Executive Order 12600, this procedure is universally used across the Federal government and is an integral part of the U.S. DOT FOIA regulations.[468], 408882=The E-470 highway, one of the first roads in the nation built with a public-private partnership, was completed on January 3, 2003. At 47 miles in length, the toll highway runs along the eastern perimeter of the Denver metropolitan area from State Highway C-470 at I-25 south, running north along the western edge of the Denver International Airport, and eventually intersecting with I-25 North. The highway is managed by the E-470 Public Highway Authority, a consortium of local governments having jurisdiction over areas the highway passes through., 65251=Over time private involvement in highway infrastructure investment and operation declined as States and the Federal government increased the pace of road construction to open new lands and increase economic development. In 1806, the Federal government passed legislation to fund the National Road, also known as the Cumberland Road. This road stretched from Maryland through Pennsylvania, over the Cumberland Mountains, to the Ohio River., 536359=[90] \"Technical Corner: Accelerating Highway and Bridge Projects in Louisiana,\" FHWA's Innovative Finance Quarterly, Vol. 9, No. 2, Spring 2003, http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovativefinance/ifq92.htm#tech_corner., 213898=As a new approach to procurement, public-private partnerships create significant challenges to both the public and private sector partners. States using public-private partnerships have experienced an initial sharp increase in workload as they adapt their procedures for guaranteeing the timeliness, efficiency, and safety of a project to fit the unusual requirements of public-private partnerships. Virginia, for example, experienced a noticeable increase in the amount of time senior officials spent on projects built under the Public-Private Transportation Act of 1995. The private sector can also experience difficulties with public-private partnerships. Smaller contractors and designers have expressed concern that it is difficult for them to bid on public-private partnership work because the projects tend to be larger than their firms can manage. Public-private partnerships also tend to shift risks away from the public sector and toward the private sector. This shift in risk can frequently be so significant that smaller firms are not able to absorb it, and as a result, cannot bid on the work., 303117=Finally, the TIFIA program is an innovative example of using public-sector financial participation to leverage private capital. However, few transportation projects are undertaken in many States that meet the current $100 million threshold for the TIFIA program. Some suggest that the project cost threshold be reduced to at least $50 million to broaden the range of projects eligible for TIFIA.[317] Such a reduction in the project cost threshold was proposed by the Administration in the surface transportation reauthorization bill \u2013 the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003 or SAFETEA., 560223=[214] Apogee Research, Inc., Implications of Change in Procedures and Laws to Advance Public-Private Partnerships, prepared at the request of the Federal Highway Administration , (FHWA-PL-95-026), April 30, 1995, 12., 556702=[186] Laurie Blake, \"Minnesota Poll: 69% Comfortable with Toll Roads\" Star Tribune, January 28, 2004, 1A., 599978=[439] See 128 D.C.R.

As of November 24, 2003, 21 States had accumulated $13.2 billion in toll credits. The credits are being applied in a variety of ways, depending on the State's needs. Missouri reserves its toll credits for situations where project matching funds are unavailable in order to effectively increase Federal funding to 100 percent of project costs. Ohio uses toll credits as a match on GARVEE projects and also shares its toll credits with local government agencies for both highway and transit projects. The Florida DOT has been applying toll credits on a statewide basis since 1993. Today Florida is using toll credits on almost every new Federal-aid project, so that most of its Federal highway program is effectively 100 percent federally funded, freeing up State dollars for State-administered projects. However, toll credits do not increase the funding available for transportation., 491623=In section 165 of the Surface Transporation Assistance Act of 1982, Congress required that all steel, cement, and manufactured products used in a project funded with money made available from the Federal-aid highway program must be manufuctured in the United States.[437] Subsequently, Congress amended this provision to include iron products and to remove cement products from its application.[438] In enacting section 165, Congress sought to address the U.S. trade deficit and unemployment, and to ensure that revenues generated by the Federal gasoline tax will be spent on American products.[439] In interpreting this provision, the FHWA has stated that the manufacturing of a product begins with the initial melting and mixing, and continues through the coating stage. Any process which modifies the chemical content, the physical size or shape, or the final finish is considered a manufacturing process. These processes include rolling, extruding, machining, bending, grinding, drilling, and coating. An exception to the Buy America requirements may be made when the purchase of such materials would cost 25 percent more than foreign alternatives; if the cost of such materials does not exceed one-tenth of one percent of the total contract cost or $2,500, whichever is greater; or if the FHWA grants a waiver.[440], 215014=In addition, private sector funding does not always ensure financial solvency when the project financing is secured by tolls or other revenue streams from the project. Sometimes public use is not as high as projected, resulting in revenues that are inadequate to pay off the debt on the project. An example of this is the Dulles Greenway, a project that was initially financed with equity contributions from the TRIP II partnership, bank loans, and long-term, fixed rate notes. After construction costs of roughly $340 million, the project ran into financial troubles. Traffic and revenues were initially lower than expected, in part due to improvements made by the State to a competing road, State Route 7. As a result, TRIP II went into default on its loans and note agreements in 1996. Refinancing occurred in 1996, allowing it to create project reserve funds and issue $370 million in senior bonds and $76 million in subordinate bonds. While the project is still yet to make a profit for its investors, development in the area is increasing and bringing with it increased usage of the Greenway.[121], 588782=[390] Cathy Proctor, \u201cFinal Leg of E-470 Nears Completion,\u201d Denver Business Journal, December 12, 2002. http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/stories/2002/12/16/story1.html., 596522=[426] Congressional Budget Office, Innovative Financing of Highways: An Analysis of Proposals, January 1998, 9. http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=320&sequence=0., 437457=In April of 1999, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) began a project to build a new interchange at the intersection of Washington State Road 500 and Thurston Way. The new interchange was aimed at reconfiguring SR 500 traffic in an effort to improve safety, create better road conditions, improve pedestrian and bicycle connections, increase intersection capacity, and decrease congestion. This project became the first design-build endeavor in the State of Washington, allowing the WSDOT to accelerate the construction schedule and minimize construction costs., 435276=The Greenway opened to traffic in September 1995. Initially, the toll was $1.75 each way, but when traffic fell short of projected levels, the toll was reduced to $1.00. Lowering the toll attracted more users but not enough to increase total revenues. Consequently, in July 1997, the Greenway's operators raised the toll to $1.15., 129365=The public-private partnerships do not always involve the public transportation agency directly. In Washington, DC, for example, the Union Station redevelopment took place through an act of Congress, under the leadership of the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. In 1981, Congress enacted the Union Station Redevelopment Act of 1981, which called on Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole to develop an ambitious plan for the commercial development of the station with the goal of making it financially self-sufficient. A unique public-private partnership was formed to faithfully restore the building to its original state and create a viable mixed use transportation center., 226974=The Act Concerning the Private Financing of the Construction of Certain Parts of Highways came into force in 1994, providing the legal basis for privately financing highways and establishing the right of investors to charge toll fees. Yet the limited scope of the legislation only allowed such partnerships to be utilized in the construction of bridges, tunnels, and mountain roads. Proponents of public-private partnerships in Germany have called for the relaxation of laws so that private funding can finance more projects, and private entities can not only construct highways, but operate them as well. The private contractor could then either charge a toll for road use, or be paid by the State on a \u201cshadow toll\u201d basis.[135], 114604=The FHWA\u2019s dialogue on public-private partnerships explored a very broad array of opportunities and challenges, with discussion ranging from \u201chow-to\u201d issues, such as the public sector\u2019s role in overseeing subcontracts, to visionary possibilities of the private sector building and operating most projects and the public sector taking a subordinate role.

By the time FTA signed a Full Funding Grant Agreement for the project, it had evolved into a rapid rail system, with projected ridership of over 100,000 per day in its opening year. The project was procured by the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority as a Design-Build contract. Siemens Corporation is the prime contractor, responsible for 60 percent of the total project, including right-of-way, track, systems, and vehicles. The 17 stations, accounting for 40 percent of the project, are the responsibility of several local subcontractors to Siemens. The project was originally scoped at $1.375 billion.

Beginning in the early 1900s, States and the Federal Government have increasingly relied on fuel taxes and other user fees to finance highway construction programs. The first Federal fuel tax was levied in 1932 at the rate of 1 cent per gallon. The rate varied between 1 and 2 cents per gallon until 1956 when the Highway Trust Fund was created. Since then, the Federal tax rate increased to its current level of 18.4 cents per gallon on gasoline, but the last excise tax increase was more than ten years ago. State fuel tax rates have followed a similar pattern.[11] During the era of Interstate Highway System construction, motor fuel tax increases were much easier to get approved than during the post-Interstate era when many States have had difficulty getting fuel tax increases approved by the electorate. The use of Federal user taxes like the fuel tax did not begin until July 1, 1956 (the first day of FY 1957). While the Federal fuel tax has indeed existed since 1932 and vehicle related taxes began even earlier in 1917, there was no connection between the revenue raised and highway funding., 555198=[182] Apogee Research, Inc., Summary of the Federal Highway Administration's Symposium on Overcoming Barriers to Public-Private Partnerships, prepared at the request of the Federal Highway Administration, (FHWA-PL-94-026), May 1994, 9., 603863=[463] Apogee Research, Inc., Implications of Change in Procedures and Laws to Advance Public-Private Partnerships, prepared at the request of the Federal Highway Administration , (FHWA-PL-95-026), April\u00a030,\u00a01995, 25., 447417=Thus far, all construction projects have come in between 7 percent and 20 percent below the engineer\u2019s estimates.

A non-compete clause was included in the project agreement for SR 91 to protect the investment of the private investor\u2014the California Private Transportation Company (CPTC).[200] In the non-compete clause, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) agreed not to make improvements or add capacity to the existing general-purpose lane on SR 91 without consulting CPTC.[201] When Caltrans sought to add capacity to the existing lanes in 1999, CPTC objected.[202] This objection raised public opposition and ultimately led to a lawsuit seeking nullification of the non-compete clause.[203] In public-private partnership projects, it is important to ensure that the public does not perceive the private partner as maximizing profits through excessive peak tolls, while the public agency does nothing to relieve congestion on free facilities., 19735=Build-Own-Operate: a private contractor constructs and operates a facility while retaining ownership.

For example, according to an analysis prepared by a law firm that represents various State and local transportation agencies involved in projects utilizing private sector participation, as of February 2004, 23 States have legal authority for private sector participation in transportation projects.[166] (See Appendix G) Of these 23 States, however, only 21 have legal authority to utilize private-sector participation in highway projects.[167] The law authorizing California to enter into public-private partnerships for transportation projects was repealed in 2004 and New Jersey let its authority expire in 2002.[168], 122639=The private sector often bids for the provision of park and ride services, particularly for start-up commuter rail or commuter bus operations. In large urban systems peak-hour express services may be contracted out. Today, most paratransit services for the elderly and persons with disabilities are provided under contract, as are van-pool services. Finally, some cities contract for their fixed-route, local service. In some cases, this includes commuter rail services, such as in Dallas/Ft. Worth or South Florida. In rural public transportation service, over 57% of obligations ($48.9 million) were expended for contracted service in 2003., 401129=WSDOT and the City have identified a favored plan.

These impediments include State laws and policies, local opposition, private sector concerns, Federal requirements attached to Federal funding, and Federal financing. This chapter serves as a compilation of the impediments that have been identified by the commenters to the report and in the information used in this report and is not necessarily suggesting changes to Federal law. The Administration's SAFETEA proposal contains recommendations that address some of these impediments. Others will require further analysis to assess the most effective way to respond. A discussion of Federal funding and financing is included because it has been cited as a possible barrier due to the requirements that must be followed when a State or locality elects to use Federal money on a project. The literature on public-private partnerships notes that the complexity of Federal laws can limit private-sector participation in highway and transit projects., 407803=The project was constructed at a cost of $2.4 billion by the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority\u2014a joint powers agency known as ACTA and governed by the cities and ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The Alameda Corridor opened on time and on budget on April 15, 2002. It was funded through a unique blend of public and private sources, including $1.16 billion in proceeds from bonds sold by ACTA; a $400 million loan by the U.S. Department of Transportation; $394 million from the ports; $347 million in grants administered by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and $130 million in other state and federal sources and interest income.

The purpose of the workshop was to focus attention on the broad range of issues and tradeoffs that may be associated with changes in public and private roles in the provision of transportation facilities and services., 170950=After signing a noncompete clause with project developers, California was barred from making improvements on competing roadways. But when public pressure forced California to make improvements to the nontolled lanes of SR 91, the Orange County Transit Authority (OCTA) reached an agreement to purchase SR 91 for $207.5 million. OCTA took possession of the road in January 2003. The sale was contingent on State legislation authorizing OCTA to buy and operate the toll road, eliminating the noncompete clause from the agreement.[63], 236988=In the 1997 edition of the survey, firms projected a median 80 percent increase in the gross revenue they would derive from design-build projects in the following three years.[160] However, the 2000 survey found that firms see a more moderate 25 percent increase in the gross revenue they expect to derive from design-build work in the next three years.[161] The 2000 survey attributed these results to design-build's sluggish expansion into public sector work, an area that many companies consider to be a source of future growth for design-build.[162] The percentage of firms that reported procurement laws in their State effectively shut them out of acquiring public sector design-build work increased from 35 percent in 1998 to 41 percent in 2000.[163], 240836=In 2003, Texas enacted House bill 3588, which provides a myriad of new tools to assist in the delivery of transportation projects and in the formation of public-private partnerships. House bill 3588, among other things, allows the formation of Regional Mobility Authorities (RMAs), expands the tolling authority of the State, authorizes Comprehensive Development Agreements (CDAs), and provides flexibility in funding the Trans Texas Corridor. The RMAs allow individual or multiple counties to develop a regional approach to transportation needs. RMAs may issue bonds or collect tolls, including converting an existing segment of the State\u2019s highway system to a toll road with the approval of the Texas Transportation Commission. RMAs have the authority to purchase rights-of-way and may lease portions of the land for non-transportation related purposes. The RMAs also may use surplus revenue for other transportation projects.[170], 525274=[39] Virginia Department of Transportation, \u201cVDOT Opens Final Portion of the Pocahontas Parkway, Route 895,\" press release, October 22, 2002. http://www.virginiadot.org/infoservice/news/RICH10232002-poca-ramp.asp., 400632=The Authority is preparing a program-level EIR/EIS which will be available to the public in August 2003., 243054=Georgia also enacted legislation in 2003 allowing the formation of public-private partnerships. Senate bill 257 allows private entities to bypass the State's typical bid procedures and instead to submit unsolicited, sealed proposals for projects already in the State's transportation plan. The State then is required to ask for competing proposals on the project. In early 2004, the GA DOT announced that it had received the first proposal under the new law to turn Ga. 316, which runs from Atlanta to Athens, into a toll road.[174] The project would include HOV lanes, new interchanges and overpasses, and miles of access roads.[175], 190486=Initially, it was anticipated that the 16 specific projects included in the TIMED program would all be let for construction by 2005 before a $.04 per gallon tax would expire. However, in light of higher project costs, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) estimated that the TIMED program would not be completed until at least 2031 using traditional pay-as-you-go funding. Recognizing that completion of the TIMED projects was vital to the State\u2019s economic development, DOTD commenced a plan to accelerate completion of the remaining projects of the TIMED program. The goal of this stepped-up plan is to complete the TIMED program in 10 years. It is estimated that the remaining cost of the TIMED program from April 2003 is approximately $2.5 billion in 2003 dollars.[90], 543690=[118] Battelle, Performance-Based Contracting for the Highway Construction Industry: An Evaluation of the Use of Innovative Contracting and Performance Specifications in Highway Construction, Final Report, prepared at the request of Koch Industries, Inc., February 2003, 13. http://www.ncppp.org/resources/papers/battellereport.pdf., 516860=[21] Congressional Budget Office, Innovative Financing of Highways: An Analysis of Proposals, January 1998, xi. http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=320&sequence=0., 569751=[279] Apogee Research, Inc., Summary of the Federal Highway Administration's Symposium on Overcoming Barriers to Public-Private Partnerships, prepared at the request of the Federal Highway Administration, (FHWA-PL-94-026), May 1994, 23., 571663=[288] John R.

DBE requirements may require contractors to subcontract a certain portion of the work. In addition, prime contractors may have to reach out to business entities with which they do not have a prior or on-going relationship. According to a 2001 GAO Report, 13 State departments of transportation and transit agencies reported incurring $250,000 in litigation costs attributable to the Federal DBE program.[447] Although it has been asserted that the DBE program may have contracting costs, 99 percent of the State departments of transportation and transit authorities surveyed by GAO in 2001 had not conducted surveys or analyses to determine the impact of the DBE program on contracting costs.[448] The USDOT has not conducted such an analysis and the DBE program has never been raised as a bar to the implementation of the projects by public-private partnerships., 476459=While Federal conditions attach when a project is constructed with Federal funds, the operation of a number of Federal laws also results in these conditions applying to a much broader scope of projects. Most environmental laws, and particularly the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321, et seq., often apply to the entire action, even if only a small portion receives Federal funds. The reason is that actions must be analyzed between \u201clogical termini\u201d and cannot be segmented.[418] Moreover, environmental reviews must consider the \u201ccumulative and secondary impacts\u201d of actions.[419] \u201cConnected actions\u201d must be considered together.[420] Even when no funding is involved, these laws can come into play because they normally apply to approvals and permitting actions as well as to grant decisions. Some laws apply to recipients of Federal funds, no matter where those funds are used. The civil rights laws, and particularly title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, apply in this way. Some highway safety requirements, such as the standards set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, normally must be applied on a system-wide basis., 589577=[394] Battelle, Performance-Based Contracting for the Highway Construction Industry: An Evaluation of the Use of Innovative Contracting and Performance Specifications in Highway Construction, Final Report, prepared at the request of Koch Industries, Inc., February 2003, 31-32. http://www.ncppp.org/resources/papers/battellereport.pdf., 557056=[189] Rick Pearson, \"Tolls Not a Big Issue, But the Traffic Is, \"Chicago Tribune, May 16, 2001, 1., 64940=In 1792, the first turnpike was chartered and became known as the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike in Pennsylvania.

The company will be responsible for the road for a period of 25 years. Under the contract, tolling will be run by a State-owned, non-profit company, and the private partner will be paid solely based upon the terms of the public-private partnership contract. The Ministry estimates that the construction period has been reduced by 50 percent\u2014from 4 years to 2 years., 439221=A 9.25-mile section of SR 125 is being constructed as a privately financed and operated toll road, featuring electronic toll collection. In accordance with legislation passed in 1989, San Diego Expressway LP holds a franchise with California and will finance and build the highway, then transfer ownership to the State. The partnership will then lease it back from the state, operating and maintaining the highway for 35 years. The 35-year franchise will allow the developer to set market rate tolls, with a maximum of 18.5 percent return on total investment. Control of the highway will then revert to the State. Other portions of the highway, providing connections to the toll road, are being through public funds., 253946=The I-15 toll lanes in San Diego, California, also illustrate the importance of local support. Based on the growth of vehicles using I-15 over the last decade and the success of the HOT lanes, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and Caltrans have broken ground on a project to expand capacity in the I-15 corridor.[204] An 800-person telephone survey of I-15 users conducted in fall 2001 indicated that the majority of motorists supported the lanes, and that motorists with the most extensive experience with the FasTrak lanes were the most ardent supporters.[205] Ninety-one percent of users supported having a time-saving option on I-15, and 66 percent of I-15 users who did not use the FasTrak lanes supported them.[206] Moreover, I-15 users overwhelmingly supported the facility\u2019s expansion with HOT lanes, and tolling of new lanes was preferred over providing new free lanes. The tolling option was preferred over adding regular lanes by a wide margin (37% for priced lanes vs. 26% for regular lanes). It appears that a large share of the public in San Diego have grown to understand the value of priced lanes, and that simply providing new general purpose lanes, without fees or other restrictions, will not help much in relieving congestion due to continuing increases in traffic., 152103=Pocahontas Parkway (Route 895): The Commonwealth of Virginia experienced the cost-saving benefits that can be achieved by the use of a public-private partnership on the Pocahontas Parkway (Route 895), the first project constructed under Virginia's Public-Private Transportation Act of 1995 (VPPTA).

A final report was issued on March 17, 2004, summarizing workshop discussions and conclusions.[26] Workshop participants included State and local elected officials, State and local transportation officials, and private sector representatives who have been involved in public private-partnerships. At the workshops, State transportation departments indicated the need for Federal leadership to forge and implement successful public-private partnerships. Despite significant experience with public-private partnerships since the 1991 workshop, some State transportation agency staff remained uncertain about public-private partnership basics, including how to select and define candidate projects, develop project solicitation documents, and negotiate with private entities. While some participants saw great revenue potential, others perceived public-private partnerships as the public sector abdicating its infrastructure responsibilities to private companies., 77105=The FHWA established SEP-14 in 1990 at the recommendation of the Transportation Research Board. The purpose of SEP-14 is to identify, evaluate, and document innovative contracting practices that have the potential to reduce the life cycle cost of projects while maintaining product quality. Within the regulatory requirements of the Federal-aid highway program, there is some degree of flexibility and thus SEP-14 was developed to provide the States with a vehicle to explore new concepts in construction contracting. These concepts often involve new and expanded roles for the private sector, and many also provide strong performance incentives for the private sector. Most projects undertaken under the SEP-14 program, however, have not involved private sector financing of highway projects. Even when no private money is directly involved in the construction and operation of the SEP-14 projects, many of the special construction techniques used place far greater responsibilities on the contractor. Thus, because of the greater role assumed by the private sector, they are considered public-private partnerships in this report., 559286=[208] Apogee Research, Inc., Implications of Change in Procedures and Laws to Advance Public-Private Partnerships, prepared at the request of the Federal Highway Administration , (FHWA-PL-95-026), April 30, 1995, 7., 82701=Therefore, in two cases, the FHWA again used SEP-14 to allow States to try alternative approaches. On February 27, 2004 the FHWA approved the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) request for a waiver of many of the FHWA\u2019s design-build requirements for the I-35 High Priority Trans-Texas Corridor Project. This waiver is significant in two important aspects. First, it will allow TxDOT to proceed with the procurement of the project developer in advance of the conclusion of the NEPA review process. To maintain an independent, unbiased NEPA review process, the TxDOT has contracted with an independent consultant to assist in the development of the NEPA document. Secondly, the I-35 waiver will also allow TxDOT to proceed with the procurement of the corridor developer at a very early stage in the project development process. It is expected that the final executed development agreement will contain provisions for the negotiation of scope and price as the project develops. Prior to executing the development agreement, the TxDOT and the FHWA Texas Division will develop formal procedures for verifying price reasonableness and developing an independent estimate. This procedure should ensure fair pricing for all work done under the development agreement. In addition, the FHWA allowed the Virginia DOT to proceed with the procurement of the I-81 corridor project subject to compliance with NEPA requirements., 591696=[402] Congressional Budget Office, Innovative Financing of Highways: An Analysis of Proposals, January 1998, Chapter 5, 4-6. http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=320&sequence=6.

ISTEA permitted the use of tolls to a much greater degree on Federal-aid facilities, including allowing Federal-aid to be used to construct new, non-Interstate System toll highways. This expansion of the use of tolls also included a congestion pricing pilot program. For the first time, private entities were allowed to own toll facilities and States were allowed to loan the Federal share of a project's cost to another public agency or private entity constructing the project. This trend in giving States greater flexibility in utilizing innovative financing and operating methods continued with subsequent surface transportation acts. These further advances will be discussed later in this chapter., 429175=The project includes a 1.5-mile tunnel under the MSP airport runways and taxiways, 26 light rail vehicles, and a total of 17 stations, with 12 stations on the Hiawatha Corridor, three stations in Bloomington, and a station serving the Mall of America. The project expects to serve 24,800 average weekday boardings by 2020., 84433=In response to Executive Order 12893 (\"Principles for Federal Infrastructure Investment\"), which establishes cost-effective infrastructure investment as priority for Federal agencies, and in recognition of the need to explore new financing strategies, the FHWA announced the Innovative Finance Program\u2014Test and Evaluation Project (TE-045) in a Federal Register notice dated April 8, 1994. The term \"innovative finance\" describes techniques that supplement traditional highway financing methods. These techniques can provide mechanisms for the direct investment of private sector funds in a surface transportation project. They also may lay the foundation for a public-private partnership by providing a ready and secure source of funds that make a project more likely to attract private involvement. Alternatively, these financing techniques might precipitate the creation of a public-private partnership by providing funds for such a large project or number of projects that private sector involvement is needed to provide additional management and staff to supplement State resources., 558083=[198] Ibid., 28, citing State of California, Department of Transportation, Continuation Study to Evaluate the Impacts of SR 91 Value-Priced Express Lanes: Final Report, December 2000., 574181=[301] Karen J.

Endorsed by Colorado voters, the design-build project aims to replace aging highways with more modern, efficient highways, as well as a light rail system. T-Rex will widen 14 miles of I-25 and 4 miles of I-225. The project also includes a new drainage system, the reconstruction of several interchanges and bridges, and improved pedestrian and bicycle access. Ultimately, the project will link the two largest employment centers in the region (the Southeast Business District and the Denver Central Business District). A design-build contract was awarded in June 2001, with construction beginning September 2001., 411466=In August of 1999, the Massachusetts Legislature authorized $385 million for Route 3 North to make a number of improvements to this busy highway, which stretches from Burlington, Massachusetts to the New Hampshire border. These improvements included an additional travel lane in each direction, improvements on 13 interchanges, the replacement of 40 bridges, and the addition of a median shoulder and 30-foot clear zone.

LVMC was responsible for the issuance of $650 million in revenue bonds to finance the construction of the first phase of the Las Vegas Monorail, running 3.7 miles from Sahara Avenue to Tropicana Avenue and serving seven stations in downtown Las Vegas. Design, construction, maintenance and operation are the responsibility of the Master System Developer. The actual project sponsor is the Regional Transit Commission (RTC), which is the transit provider for Clark County and the city of Las Vegas. This project is the first totally privately financed public transportation project in the U.S., although it is seeking Federal funds for its second phase. The project went into revenue service in July of 2004, within budget although several months late., 527349=[47] New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department New Mexico Corridor 44 Project: A New Paradigm in Highway Construction, July 1998., 130543=Today, Union Station is one of the most visited destination in the nation's Capitol with over 25 million visitors a year. World-class exhibitions and international cultural events are hosted here for the public to enjoy.

Of the respondents, 17 were rail systems and 12 were bus only systems. While the rail system projects predominated, nevertheless, 18 joint development projects were identified around bus facilities. These included mixed-commercial development, office, institutional, residential, and civic facilities. One such example is the Center Station at John Deere Commons in downtown Moline, Illinois. Developed around the MetroLINK bus transfer center, it includes offices, a convention center, hotel, parking structure, and various pedestrian amenities.

Even today, tolling on the Interstate Highway System is prohibited except for two pilot programs that allow tolling of Interstates in limited situations\u2014the value pricing pilot program established in 1991 and reauthorized in 1998, and the Interstate System reconstruction and rehabilitation pilot program authorized in 1998.[183] The public view towards tolls must change before the private sector will feel confident enough to pursue public-private partnerships and be able to gain financing and community support.[184], 72719=Another activity that continues is the development around public transportation facilities.

Specifically, Section 3(a)(1)(D) provided Federal assistance for:, 506225=Although the design-build regulation represents a significant step in facilitating public-private partnerships, it also contains a provision that has been cited as an impediment to public-private partnerships. The design-build regulation prohibits a State from issuing a \"request for proposals\" (RFP) until the NEPA process is complete in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 112(b)(3)(B), which states that design-build projects \"shall not commence before compliance with section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).[462] States have criticized this provision as being a cumbersome restriction that discourages innovation and causes delays. Some States also believe that the NEPA process will be enhanced by having the private developer supply engineering studies, technical information, and other support to the transportation agency during the NEPA process. Because the NEPA analysis is typically accomplished as part of preliminary design, when many key, large scale design decisions are made by someone other than the design-build contractor, this process can discourage or prevent the use of innovative ideas and solutions proposed by the design-build contractor., 573666=[296] Ibid., 1; citing Federal Reserve Board of Governors Statistical Release G. 13, March 13, 1998., 98028=Colorado is advancing a multi-billion dollar program of strategic statewide projects, including the multimodal Southeast Corridor project, through GARVEE financings.

The roles and responsibilities of each partner in financing the project are specified in contracts between the parties, as illustrated by Figure 2.1. In the majority of cases, the private sector risks some capital and is rewarded if the investment is successful. The partners often form a new entity\u2014either a special-purpose government agency or a private, nonprofit corporation\u2014to finance and oversee the project. Another nontraditional arrangement is that of a government contracting with a private firm to operate and maintain a roadway that the government has built. Great Britain is experimenting with such a form on a limited basis, but the United States has yet to explore its possibilities in any systematic way. [9] Some partnership arrangements may involve several or all of these functions. Regardless of the specific functions involved, partnership arrangements are intended to provide greater flexibility to achieve transportation program objectives by altering traditional public and private sector roles to take better advantage of the skills and resources that private sector firms can provide.[7] However, even when the private sector has a high level of participation, the government will continue to play a role in granting permits, ensuring safety, verifying fulfillment of environmental requirements, or even exercising its power of eminent", "textAfterTable": "Dulles Greenway (Virginia).
