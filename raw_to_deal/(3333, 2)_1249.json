Interestingly, the area was developed back in the early 1890's by the, then, president of the Georgia Power Company, who also ran a streetcare line to the Confederate Soldiers Home at the time. Because of that streetcar (a common visual landmark for residents) line, there was a giant residential building push, which consisted mostly of the Craftsman bungalows that were popular at the time (and today). This charming neighborhood close to eclectic Litle Five Points is just east of downtown Atlanta and is filled with Southern charm and hospitable people. You'll find a wide range of single-family, one, two, and three bedroom houses as well a variety of new condo developments.
