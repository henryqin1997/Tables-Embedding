It is a long dress - hitting almost to my ankles. And it is very tight across the chest - order a size up and be prepared for extra material everywhere else. I had to return mine due to the bodice fit., 104834=June 20, 2014 - The dress is beautiful. The problem is that it is completely see through. You will need to wear something under this dress otherwise you might as well be naked. Also the material feels cheap and low quality. The sizes are also smaller than the dimensions show in the size chart. The dress is beautiful but I recommend going one size up from what you normally wear., 102940=August 23, 2014 - I love this dress. I haven't worn it anywhere yet, but I tried it on when it came, and it fits perfectly. I love buying clothes from here. They are so unique, and everyone always compliments me. Plus, I get to do some good in the world, too. I tell everyone about the site, and Greater Good., 104168=June 26, 2014 - This is a very lovely dress but as said in another review it's very see thru. Not lined at all. And the model must be 6 foot because I'm 5'8\" and it comes to my ankles. I'm still going to wear it but just slightly disappointed in how long it is and how see thru. Good thing I have slips! And I personally found it to be true to size., 105526=August 14, 2013 - It is very beautiful and was a nice fit except I did find it to be just a tad too long for me. I do very much like it though and have worn and enjoyed it., 162580=\u00a9 2000-2015 GreaterGood stores. All rights reserved. Trademarked, owned and operated by CharityUSA.com, LLC.
