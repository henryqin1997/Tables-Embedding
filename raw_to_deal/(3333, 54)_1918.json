Before then the center of power was a succession of cities, trending historically northward along the L\u025bn. The earliest B\u00e9 civilization actually began in the P\u00e0n area, in the city of H\u00e9j\u00f9s. Each of the successive capitals had an influence on the L\u00e9 language; besides Jans\u025b\u0300 the most important dialect is that of the previous capital K\u00eak\u00e8. Some have described literary L\u00e9t\u0254\u0302\u014b as the language of K\u00eak\u00e8 spoken with a Jansene accent. This may be accurate as regards literature per se, but the vocabulary of administration and commerce is largely Jansene. The language described in this sketch is the written standard, which is also used as a lingua franca for government, commerce, and science. The study of the dialects, and indeed the Beic languages, is impeded by the writing system, which was first devised in the 1800s under the Men\u2019s Empire, adapted from the syllabographic Uyse\u0294 script. The glyphs were borrowed both phonetically and semantically, and the writing system does a fairly poor job of representing L\u00e9 phonology. This is an advantage to the B\u00e9, since the system can be shared (with a huge caveat, below) by all Beic languages, but it\u2019s an annoyance for the foreign linguist. Only Kebreni and Verdurian sources (supplemented by some vague L\u00e9 descriptions, and some evidence from rhymes) allow us to give the standard Jansene readings of the glyphs. In some cases", "textAfterTable": "mid-high e o mid-low \u025b \u0254 low a English speakers should be careful not to lax their \u025b or u, nor to diphthongize e or o, while those who suffer from the cot/caught merger should clearly distinguish \u0254 and a. Unstressed, low tone final -e, as in the clitics re and je, is often laxed, but to [I] not [\u025b]. Especially in Jans\u025b\u0300, there\u2019s a tendency to nasalize vowels before n or \u014b: P\u00e0n [p\u00e3n52]. This may even contaminate later vowels in the word; Jans\u025b\u0300 itself is often pronounced [d\u0292\u00e322 s\u025b\u030352]. In words ending in -r the vowel + r acts as a diphthong\u2014 there\u2019s a smooth transition from the vowel to the r. Tone There are five tones, transliterated a \u00e1 \u00e0 \u00e2 \u01ce; the base contours in Jans\u025b\u0300 are 22 24 52 453 213. These vary spectacularly by region even within L\u00e9.
