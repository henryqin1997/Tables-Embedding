Log in to the My Oracle Support site. In a Web browser on the machine that is connected to the Internet, download the ZIP file that contains the GlassFish Server repository for the operating system on which GlassFish Server is running. The repository ZIP files for GlassFish Server are distributed as patches through the My Oracle Support Web site. The Pre-Installed Toolkit Image has been installed as described in To Install the Pre-Installed Toolkit Image Inside a Closed Network. The machine that is connected to the Internet can write to some type of removable medium, such as CD, DVD, USB drive, or flash memory card. You have access to a machine that is connected to the Internet. Ensure that the following conditions are met: Before You Begin A local repository server makes it possible for a GlassFish Server installation to obtain packages and updates from within a closed network, rather than from the default public repository servers. To Configure a Local Repository Server Inside a Closed Network Display the pkg version. ./pkg version Output similar to the following is displayed: 1.122.2-38.2791 The directory that contains the unzipped Pre-Installed Toolkit Image. toolkit-dir Click the Patches & Updates tab.", "textAfterTable": "A list of patches appears at the bottom of the page. Download the ZIP file for the latest version of the desired patch. Copy each ZIP file that you downloaded from My Oracle Support onto a removable medium that you can physically transport to the local repository server. Each My Oracle Support ZIP file is approximately 270 Mbytes in size. Copy each My Oracle Support ZIP file from the removable medium to the local repository server machine. The directory used for the My Oracle Support ZIP files should be different than the directory in which the Pre-Installed Toolkit Image was copied, as described in To Install the Pre-Installed Toolkit Image Inside a Closed Network. Unzip each My Oracle Support ZIP file that you copied in the preceding step. The My Oracle Support ZIP files are wrappers that contain a GlassFish Server repository ZIP file, a README file, and a license file. For example, the My Oracle Support ZIP file for Linux contains the following files: LEGAL_LICENSE.TXT README.145093-01 ogs-3.0.1-repo-linux-i386.zip In this example, the GlassFish Server repository ZIP file is named ogs-3.0.1-repo-linux-i386.zip. Unzip the My Oracle Support ZIP file. For example: unzip 145093-01 Change to the directory that was created when the My Oracle Support ZIP file was unzipped. For example: cd 145093-01 Unzip the GlassFish Server repository ZIP file. For example: unzip ogs-3.0.1-repo-linux-i386.zip On the local repository server machine, start the repository server daemon.
