The user simply defines the regions of interest, or xyz points, to track through the sequence on the 3D surface of a single 3dMD reference frame and the 3dMD software will generate a coordinate map throughout the sequence within a correct temporal context. The 3dMDtempus Software provides the bridge between automated traditional point tracking and sparse meshing techniques to expressing movement in terms of dense surface deformation and classification enabling a new paradigm of tools which permit comparative regional behavior to be enumerated. Feature points to track can be uniformly sampled, detected for generic facial features, or defined by a mesh mask. This capability enables a user to quantify and model the essential subtleties of human behavior and/or reactions to stimuli. The 3dMDtempus Software generates thousands of individual surface points to be transitionally tracked as xyz coordinates from one 3dMD frame to another in six degrees of freedom within the context of the subject\u2019s yaw, pitch, and roll movements. This level of anatomical tracking precision enables clinicians and researchers to accurately measure and quantify anatomical function, expressions from extreme to micro, and soft tissue deformations in a sequence or isolated.", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
