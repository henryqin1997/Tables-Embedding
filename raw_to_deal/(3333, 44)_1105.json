AL-6XN alloy is an austenitic stainless steel alloy with high nickel, molybdenum, and nitrogen content. AL-6XN alloy has a face-centered cubic crystal structure similar to other austenitic stainless steels. The alloy is non-magnetic and its magnetic permeability remains low even after severe cold forming. AL-6XN alloy has exceptional resistance to chloride corrosion, pitting, crevice corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, and excellent general corrosion resistance to various acid, alkalis and salt solutions. The high strength and corrosion resistance of the AL-6XN alloy make it a better choice than the conventional duplex stainless steels and a cost effective alternative to more expensive", "textAfterTable": "If you have a question or need more information about AL-6XN alloy, give us a call today at 800.654.5635 or 417.831.1411.
