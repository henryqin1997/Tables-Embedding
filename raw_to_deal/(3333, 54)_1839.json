Remember the significant column for promoting a build is the left-most project column. If some component within a project has not (or can not) be tested, the Project Lead should either make sure someone does the test, or make a judgment call on if the build (from their project's point of view) can be promoted or not. If the smoke test could not be performed, a note should be made in the comments section that it wasn't performed, why, and why that should prevent promotion. If a build can be promoted and no issues were found, simple use the green check mark and include the initials or names of who performed the test. If a smoke test does not pass but the build can still be promoted, use a green check mark (ok) icon () but then document in the comments bug numbers, how the smoke test fails, workarounds, or cautions about the build. Use a red X (fail) icon () to signify that the build should not be promoted, that a respin is required. In that case, please provide bug number and be sure those that need to fix something are aware of it, and can arrange for a respin.
