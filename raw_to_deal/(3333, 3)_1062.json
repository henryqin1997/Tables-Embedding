The value of \u0394 H \u00b0 suggests that S experiences more stabilizing intramolecular interactions than C . These are presumably \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the phenyl groups of the handles and the porphyrin plane, and additional van der Waals interactions. The entropic parameters suggest that C is more disordered than S , which could be the result of a restricted motion of the handles in S as a result of the intramolecular binding interactions (entropy-enthalpy compensation [ 45 ]). Another possibility is that S needs to organize more solvent molecules in a defined shell than C , which would result in the release of solvent to the bulk upon switching from S to C , thereby accounting for the entropic gain. The observation that C dissolves significantly better in the used solvent mixture than S could validate this hypothesis, although solubility depends on more factors.
