Jim Berkland, who predicted the Loma Prieta quake, which occurred in the Bay Area in 1989, has done work with the gravitational force of the moon and how that can trigger quakes., 68543=Although rubbished by seismologists, the theory gained traction as word spread that the \"Moon Man\" appeared to have predicted both the initial September quake, and the February disaster which killed about 182 people., 70226=The lunch passed without incident. The sceptics were satisfied. But that night, at 9.47pm, the city was shaken by a 5.1-magnitude aftershock. It was about a thousand times less powerful than the killer that Mr Ring had prophesied, and it came 10 hours late. But it was the biggest aftershock since the February disaster and, for many of Mr Ring's supporters, it came as the most public of vindications., 48558=The USGS has updated the magnitude of the March 11, 2011, Tohoku earthquake in northern Honshu, Japan, to 9.0 from the previous estimate of 8.9. Independently, Japanese seismologists have also updated their estimate of the earthquake\u2019s magnitude to 9.0. This magnitude places the earthquake as the fourth largest in the world since 1900 and the largest in Japan since modern instrumental recordings began 130 years ago. The Japanese TV pictures where bad enough but this scatter plot of quakes and aftershocks around Japan hit home. A week after the quake, on Friday March 18, there were a dozens aftershocks between +5 and +6 magnitude., 54226=A pod of whales stranded themselves hours before a massive earthquake hit New Zealand on February 21., 52491=Tuesday, March 15, 2011 2:50, 59046=Important to note are that Russian, [Ukrainian]\u00a0and British scientists are at the forefront of predicting earthquakes based on these subtle electromagnetic signals and have joined in an effort to put satellites in space to detect more of them. (see my blog post from 2010 http://bit.ly/8DPbym\u00a0), 67843=A maverick \"lunar forecaster\" who claims to have predicted both New Zealand's major recent earthquakes provoked fear and outrage when he warned that another devastating jolt would strike Christchurch last Sunday. Scientists made a public bet that it wouldn't \u2013 and were then left exasperated as the city was shaken by the biggest aftershock since the February catastrophe., 60692=At the moment we have Jupiter and Saturn on either side of the Sun and creating a tug of war with Earth in the middle. That started last September and will continue until about May. In September the Earth was right in line with Jupiter, Saturn and the Sun too., 48163=\u00b9 Based on observations since 1900.

Working backward, a line of large earthquakes taking place over the last 18 months can be drawn. On February 21, New Zealand suffered its worst natural disaster for 80 years when a 6.3 earthquake struck Christchurch, killing more than 200 people and causing much devastation. The same area was already weakened by a 7.0 quake that struck a few months before on September 3, 2010, 60972=That\u2019s why there were several 7+ earthquakes around, it wasn\u2019t just us. For instance there was one in Pakistan on the same day as Christchurch. This Jupiter/Saturn alignment continues until about May, and the Earth comes back into line as well in March. It is why there may be an extreme event, perhaps a large earthquake, around 20 March, which is when the Moon may be again in a trigger position.\u201d, 56295=Berkland notes that the Moon will make its closest approach to the earth in the last 18 years from between 16-26, climaxing at its closest point on March 19th. Many respected periodicals such as Space.com are quoting astromomers in their reporting of this \u201cSupermoon\u201d event. However, Berkland holds several degrees in the credible science of geology and has taught the subject in universities, as well as having working the field for decades, which makes his warning one to heed., 63209=Interesting to note in all of these events is the United States Army announcing this week that it is holding a rare training event involving the US Military, the CIA, Canadian officers, US Treasury and State departments, the US Agency for International Development, the Defense Threat Readiness Agency and the International Red Cross between March 21-25 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and which should the worst happen they will certainly be prepared for it., 54347=Thousands [actually millions] of sardines suddenly died on March 8 in King Harbor, California. While scientists cannot give a reason for the incident, some point to the mass stranding of 107 whales that occurred less than 48 hours\u00a0before New Zealand was hit on February 21 as an indication that something big is about to happen off the coast of California., 57862=Saturday, March 12, 2011 11:14, 51248=See Jim Berkland on Youtube, talking about the next critical seismic window in March 2011 and increased probability of earthquakes:, 49215=UPDATE: a +6.2\u00a0aftershock was registered in Japan on Saturday March 19, 2011 http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usc00023fx.php\u00a0, 54728=These incidents are not without precedent. The UK Mirror points out another 170 whales stranded themselves in Australia and New Zealand prior to the devastating Christmas 2004 quake that struck in the Indian Ocean, resulting in a tsunami that killed more than 250,000 people across the region.
