In that FLA file, you specify which symbols you want to share with other files by checking the sharing checkbox for each item in the Library panel. You create a project in the Project panel and create a FLA file in the project. Sharing symbols using the Project panel works like this (CS5.5 only): The symbol in the destination document retains its original name and properties, but its contents are updated or replaced with those of the symbol you select. Update the symbol in the destination document as you author the document.
