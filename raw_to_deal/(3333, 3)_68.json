Substitution Variables in iSQL*Plus System variables specified in the Preferences screens can affect iSQL*Plus behavior. The Substitution Variable Prefix, Display Substitution Variable, Substitution Variable Reference Terminator and Escape Character preferences affect variable substitution behavior. iSQL*Plus will only prompt for input when scripts are invoked from the Workspace and output is being displayed in the browser (Below Input Area option). iSQL*Plus will not prompt for values when output is set to any of the other three options, or when invoked using the iSQL*Plus dynamic URL syntax. iSQL*Plus prompts for each substitution variable as it encounters it by displaying a separate Input Required screen. To synchronize variable substitution, set the Substitution Variable Prefix preference ON to set iSQL*Plus to always prompt for substitution variables before running any further scripts. Click the Execute button to execute the command. Enter your script using '&' and '&&' as the prefix for variables. Click the Execute button to execute the script. iSQL*Plus prompts you for values for the substitution variables in your script. At the end of script execution, any double ampersand substitution variables in the script remain defined.
