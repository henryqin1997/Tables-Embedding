Panel Toolbar Break On Mutate The \"Break On Mutate\" button ( ) gives you the possibility to stop JavaScript execution when any mutation of the HTML via the script occurs. If a mutation occurs, Firebug halts the script execution and jumps to the Script Panel to the line where the change happened. Edit Enabling the \"Edit\" mode by hitting the appropriate button lets you edit the HTML directly. Therefore it opens a text editor, which is filled with the node and its contents you currently had selected in the formatted (tree view) mode. After turning the edit mode off again the display switches back to the formatted mode, which now displays the changes made to the source code. Element Path Inside the panel menu there is a list of nodes, starting with the currently selected node and going up the element structure up to the root node of the document. The list looks like what some Web sites call a \"breadcrumb\" list.
