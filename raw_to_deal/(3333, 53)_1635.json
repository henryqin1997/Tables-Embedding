Perform this task at the master controller to configure PfR to use route observe mode instead of the default route control mode. In route observe mode, the master controller monitors prefixes and exit links based on default and user-defined policies and then reports the status of the network and the decisions that should be made, but it does not implement any changes. In route control mode, the master controller coordinates information from the borders routers in the same way as route observe mode, but commands are sent back to the border routers to alter routing in the PfR managed network to implement the policy decisions. Enabling PfR Route Observe Mode", "textAfterTable": "Disabling Automatic PBR Route Control Perform this task at the master controller to disable the default route control behavior when a RIB mismatch is found and allow PfR to use a single protocol to control a traffic class.
