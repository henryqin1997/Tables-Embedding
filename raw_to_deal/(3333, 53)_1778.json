In the public defense the doctor is notified if the thesis has passed or not passed; if the doctor is granted the Apto Cum Laude mark, this will be notified by letter or e-mail after the public defense as it is the result of a private votation (even between the panel members): closed votes are checked and verified by the University after the public defense. Doctors granted \"Apto Cum Laude\" can be nominated for an \"Extraordinary Award\" (Premio Extraordinario de Doctorado) if all the panel members vote so. There is also a numeric mark up to 50 (10 points per scholar in the panel), but it is only communicated to the candidate, the thesis director and the department., 403292=Upon the completion of the habilitation thesis (Habilitationsschrift) a different type of a doctorate (Dr. habil. or only: habil.) is awarded. This doctorate is known as the Habilitation. It is not considered a formal degree but an additional academic qualification. It qualifies the owner to teach at (German) universities (\"facultas docendi\"), plus the holder of the \"habil.\" can apply for the authorization to teach a certain subject (\"venia legendi\"). This has been the traditional prerequisite for attaining the title Privatdozent (PD) and employment as a Professor at universities. With the introduction of Juniorprofessoren \u2013 around 2005 in Germany \u2013 as an alternative track towards becoming a professor at universities (with tenure), this has changed partially, and the Habilitation is no longer the only career track at universities., 352245=The doctorate (Latin: doctor, \"teacher,\" from doctum, \"[that which is] taught,\" past participle of docere, \"to teach\") appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach (Latin: licentia docendi) at a medieval university.[3] Its roots can be traced to the early church when the term \"doctor\" referred to the Apostles, church fathers and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible.[3] The right to grant a licentia docendi was originally reserved to the Catholic church which required the applicant to pass a test, to take oath of allegiance and pay a fee. The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed the access \u2013 by that time largely free of charge \u2013 of all able applicants, who were, however, still tested for aptitude by the ecclesiastic scholastic.[4] This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the slowly emancipating universities, but was granted by the pope to the University of Paris in 1213 where it became a universal license to teach (licentia ubiquie docendi).[4] However, while the licentia continued to hold a higher prestige than the bachelor's degree (Baccalaureus), it was ultimately reduced to an intermediate step to the Magister and doctorate, both of which now became the exclusive qualification for teaching.[4], 383111=In Denmark, there are four levels of degrees: 1) a three-year Bachelor's degree (e.g. Bachelor of Arts = B.A.); 2) a two-year Candidate's degree (e.g. candidatus/candidata magisterii = cand.mag.), respectively a three-year extended research graduation, leading to the Magister's Degree (e.g. magister/magistra artium = mag.art.), the latter of which has recently been phased out in order to meet the international standards of the Bologna Process \u2013 both the cand.mag. and the mag.art. are generally compared to a Master's Degree (MA); 3) a Ph.D. Degree (ph.d.), which replaced the licentiate in 1988, and finally; 4) a Doctor's degree (fx doctor philosophiae = dr.phil.), which is the higher doctorate., 369057=The French, German and Polish habilitation (a formal professorial qualification with thesis and exam) is commonly regarded as belonging to this category. However, in some German states, the Habilitation is not an academic degree, but rather a professorial certification (\"facultas docendi\") that the person concerned holds all the qualifications needed to teach independently at a German university. In other German states, the \"Habilitand\" is awarded a formal \"Dr. habil.\" degree. In some cases where such degrees are awarded, the holder of the degree may add \"habil.\" to his or her research doctorate such as \"Dr. phil. habil.\" or \"Dr. rer. nat. habil.\" The French academic system used to have a higher doctorate, called \"State doctorate\" (doctorat d'\u00c9tat), but it was superseded by the habilitation in 1984., 419055=The traditional academic system of The Netherlands provided four basic academic diplomas and degrees: propaedeuse, kandidaat, doctorandus (drs.) and doctor (dr.). After successful completion of the first year of University, the student was awarded the propaedeutic diploma (not a degree). In some studies, this diploma was already abolished in the 1980s: in physics and mathematics, the student could obtain directly a kandidaats degree in two years. The kandidaat (candidate) degree, which was all but abolished by 1989, used to be attained after four or five years of academic study, after which the student was allowed to begin work on his doctorandus thesis. The successful completion of this thesis allowed one to use the doctorandus title, attainment of which means one's initial studies are finished. In addition to these 'general' degrees, a number of specific titles for certain subjects are available, each of which is equivalent to the doctorandus degree: for law: meester (master) (mr.), and for engineering at a technical university like Delft: ingenieur (engineer)(ir.). In the last few years, the Dutch have incorporated the Anglo-Saxon system of academic degrees into their own. The old candidate's degree has been revived as bachelor's degree, the doctorandus' by the master's degree. However, Dutch regular university programmes tend to include subject matter which, e.g., at Harvard is only taught in PhD-courses (for instance advanced quantum mechanics or general relativity in a Dutch course for the master's degree in theoretical physics)., 396611=During the preparation of the doctorate, the candidate has had, since 2002, to follow a limited number of courses, but there is no written examination for the doctorate. The candidate has to write an extensive thesis which is read by two external reviewers designated by the head of the institution. According to the reports of the reviewer, the head of the institution decides whether the candidate can defend his thesis or not. The members of the jury are designated by the head of the institution and must be composed of external and internal academics. The supervisor of the candidate is generally a member of the jury, as well as the reviewers of the thesis. The maximum number of members in the jury is 8. The defense lasts generally 45 minutes in scientific fields and are followed by 1h \u2013 2h30 of questions from the jury or other doctors present in the assistance. Defense and questions are public. At the end of the series of questions, the jury deliberates in private for 20\u201330 min and comes back to declare the candidate admitted or \"postponed\". \"Postponement\" is very rare. The admission of the candidate is generally followed by a distinction: \"honourable\", which is not highly considered, \"very honourable\", which is the usual distinction, and \"very honourable with the congratulation of the jury\" (Tr\u00e8s honorable avec f\u00e9licitations). Because there exist no national criteria for the award of this last distinction, many institutions have decided not to award it. New regulations concerning this distinction were set in 2006. Many institutions have decided not to award any distinction, as it is now permitted by the law., 370151=In Sweden, a title roughly corresponding to the Habilitation is Docent. This was also commonly used in Poland but as of 2005 was changed to a formal \"Dr hab.\" (doktor habilitowany) degree. See below (Poland section) for more details., 415300=Until the 1990s, most doctorates in the natural sciences and engineering in Japan were earned by industrial researchers in Japanese companies. These degrees are awarded by the employees' former university, usually after many years of research in industrial laboratories. No matriculation is necessary, only submission of a dissertation with some articles published in well-known journals . This program, called ronbun hakase (\u8ad6\u6587\u535a\u58eb, ronbun hakase?), represented the majority of engineering doctoral degrees from national universities. With the expansion of university-based doctoral programs called katei hakase (\u8ab2\u7a0b\u535a\u58eb, katei hakase?), however, the proportion of these degrees earned is decreasing. By 1994, more doctoral engineering degrees were earned for research within university laboratories (53%) than industrial research laboratories (47%).[56] Since 1978, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) provides tutorial and financial support for promising researchers in Asia and Africa to earn their PhD degrees through this route. The program is called JSPS RONPAKU.[57], 410270=The first institution in Italy to create a doctoral program (PhD) was Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in 1927 under the historic name \"Diploma di Perfezionamento\".[46][47] Further, the research doctorates or PhD (Italian: Dottorato di ricerca) in Italy were introduced with law and Presidential Decree in 1980 (Law of February 21, 1980, No. 28 and the Presidential Decree No. 382 of 11 July 1980), referring to the reform of academic teaching, training and experimentation in organisation and teaching methods.[48][49], 461535=Professional doctorates were developed in the United States in the 19th century during a movement to improve the training of professionals by raising the requirements for entry and completion of the degree necessary to enter the profession.[81] These first professional degrees were created to help strengthen professional training programs. The first professional doctorate to be offered in the United States was the M.D. in 1767 by Columbia University[82] which was nearly one hundred years before the first Ph.D. was awarded in the U.S. in 1861.[83] The Juris Doctor (J.D.) was subsequently established by Harvard University for the same reasons that the M.D. was established.[84] A Doctor of Pharmacy is awarded as the Terminal/Professional degree in Pharmacy replacing BS in Pharmacy. It is the only Professional Pharmacy Degree awarded in the US and the Pharmacy School needs accreditation of American Council on Pharmacy Education (ACPE). Pharmacy programs vary in length between 4\u20136 years depending if a matriculating student has earned a BS/BA or not., 398907=Before 1984 three research doctorates existed\u00a0: the state doctorate (doctorat d'\u00c9tat, the old doctorate introduced in 1808), the third cycle doctorate (doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle), created in 1954 and shorter than the state doctorate, and the diploma of doctor-engineer (dipl\u00f4me de docteur-ing\u00e9nieur), created in 1923, for technical research. Since 1984, there is only one type of doctoral degree, simply called \"doctorate\" (Doctorat). A special diploma has been created called the \"accreditation to supervise research\" (habilitation \u00e0 diriger des recherches), which is a professional qualification to supervise doctoral work. (This diploma is similar in spirit to the older state doctorate, and the requirements for obtaining it are similar to those necessary to obtain tenure in other systems.) Before only professors or senior full researchers of similar rank were normally authorized to supervise a doctoral candidate's work.[43] Now the habilitation is a prerequisite to the title of professor in university (Professeur des Universit\u00e9s) and to the title of Research Director (Directeur de recherche) in national public research agency such as CNRS or INRA., 463227=Recently there has been a trend for introducing professional doctorates in other fields as well, including the Doctor of Audiology in 2007. Advanced Practice Registered Nurses are expected to completely transition to the Doctor of Nursing Practice by 2015, and physical therapists to the Doctor of Physical Therapy by 2020., 446789=The PhD itself is a comparatively recent introduction to the UK, dating from 1917. It was originally introduced in order to provide a similar level of graduate research training as was available in several other countries, notably Germany and the USA. Previously, the only doctorates available were the higher doctorates, awarded in recognition of an illustrious research career., 396325=Doctoral candidates can apply for a three-year fellowship, the most well known being the allocation de recherche du minist\u00e8re de l'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur et de la recherche (4000 granted every years, gross salary of 19,740 euros in December 2012)., 390185=Prior to introduction of Bologna process, Finland required at least 42 credit weeks (1800 hours) of formal coursework of doctoral students. The general requirement was removed in 2005, leaving the decision on the scale of coursework needed to individual universities, which may delegate the authority to faculties and even to individual professors. In fields of Engineering and Science, the required amount of coursework varies between 60 and 70 ECTS., 454134=The most common research doctorate is the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). This degree was first awarded in the U.S. at the 1861 Yale University commencement.[14] The University of Pennsylvania followed shortly thereafter in 1871,[72] while Cornell (1872),[73] Harvard (1873),[74] and Princeton (1879)[75] also followed suit. Unlike the introduction of the professional doctorate M.D., there was considerable controversy and opposition over the introduction of the Ph.D. into the U.S. educational system, even through the 1950s, as it was seen as an unnecessary artificial transplant from a foreign educational system (that of Germany), which corrupted a system based on the Oxbridge model of England.[76], 442054=Complutense University was the sole university in Spain authorised to confer the Doctor degree on any scholar. This law remained in effect until 1954, when the authorization was extended to the University of Salamanca in commemoration of its septecentenary. This made the degree of Doctor all the more unique and prestigious in social circles. In 1970, the right was extended to all Spanish universities, ending the monopoly of Complutense University over this distinction.[68], 356936=It is not until recently that Universities began to accept female students in their Doctorate programs. In the year 1785, Complutense University became the first University to grant a Doctorate to a female student, Mar\u00eda Isidra de Guzm\u00e1n y de la Cerda.[7] In comparison, University of Oxford did not accept female scholars until the year 1920,[8] and the University of Cambridge did not grant a Ph.D. to a female student until the year 1926.[9], 442967=All Doctorate Degree holders are reciprocally recognised as equivalent in Germany and Spain (\"Bonn Agreement of November 14, 1994\").[69], 428779=The Polish system is similar to the one adopted in Germany, with Ph.D. as a first level doctorate and habilitation (habilitacja) as second. The award of the title of doktor (Ph.D.) is usually preceded by 4\u20135 years of doctoral study (a post-graduate study offered at most universities, during which candidate is employed by this university and is usually obligated to teach some classes) and a doctoral exam. Doctoral studies usually consist of seminars, lectures, research and teaching. In order to become a doktor habilitowany (i.e. to be awarded a second level doctorate) a candidate has to publish a dissertation that is the culmination of several years of deep field studies, as well as have a recognized research record. While, according to current Polish law, candidates without habilitation are theoretically eligible to become professors, in practice it is extremely rare. Since 1993 only Master-degree holders are allowed to become a doctor, while prior to that time it was possible (but rare) to gain doctorate without Master studies (for example Stefan Banach).}", "textBeforeTable": "Recently there has been a trend for introducing professional doctorates in other fields as well, including the Doctor of Audiology in 2007.
