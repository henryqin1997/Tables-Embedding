The older MVAPICH, based on the MPI-1 standard, is installed on Glenn only. MPI is a standard library for performing parallel processing using a distributed-memory model. The Glenn and Oakley clusters at OSC use the MVAPICH implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI), which is based on MPICH and optimized for the high-speed Infiniband interconnects.

The default on Oakley is the build corresponding to the currently loaded compiler. The default on Glenn is the MPI-1 build for the PGI compiler. Usage Set-up To set up your environment for using the MPI libraries, you must load the appropriate module. On Oakley this is pretty straightforward:  module load mvapich2 You will get the default version for the compiler you have loaded. (Be sure to swap the intel compiler module for the gnu module if you're using gnu.) On Glenn you should load the module shown in the table below for the compiler you're using.
