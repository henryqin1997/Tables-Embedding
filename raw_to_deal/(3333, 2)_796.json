Here\u2019s a look at the Band structure and the broad roles that fall into each band. Take a Look at the Bands Our old grade structure was right for its time. But in today\u2019s environment, grades can function as barriers that don\u2019t allow us to achieve our organizational objectives\u2014like the need for people to have a greater breadth of knowledge of our Global Network University, and to move between assignments and across job functions, whether in New York City or across the globe. \u2022 Reduce Layers and Support a More Transparent Organization. Level of responsibility is an important element in Bands. It influences Scope, Reporting Relationship and Accountability, which are all key factors in determining how a job is banded. So in your career development, you\u2019re likely to focus on aspects of your current job (and potential new jobs) that increase your level of responsibility. \u2022 Focus Attention on Increases in Responsibility. With the more flexible structure that Bands provides, hierarchical barriers to teamwork are eliminated. The new structure allows for greater collaboration among peers on a variety of teams. \u2022 Facilitate Team-Building.", "textAfterTable": "*Please note that while the titles above are meant to provide a general representation of the types of titles found at a given band level, title differences may exist across regions and specific global locations. NYU's Approach to Pay Each band has associated market rates based on job family or functional discipline\u2014e.g., finance, technology. The scope and range of jobs in each band is so wide that setting salary ranges would offer no benefit. Instead of salary ranges, competitive market rates, which are much more accurate references for the value of a job, are used for individual positions. That means: \u2022 The highest pay level in a band may be twice as high as the lowest pay level for that same band. So people in the same band may be paid differently based on the level and scope of responsibility of their specific job, as well as their own experience and performance... \u2022\u00a0 Market ranges from one band can overlap with another band.
