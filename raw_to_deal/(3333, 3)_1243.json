Not in photo quality, but with features, shooting performance, and overall value. For 2011, though, Canon snapped back thanks to the addition of backside-illuminated CMOS sensors in all of the new Elph models. It even changed the naming system, dropping SD and IS from the products and adding HS. They all take SD cards and have image stabilization so those were no longer necessary, and they now feature Canon's HS System that combines the aforementioned sensor with the Digic 4 image processor to product better low-light photos and faster shooting performance.}", "TableContextTimeStampAfterTable": "{17191=Joshua Goldman is a senior editor for CNET Reviews, covering cameras, camcorders, and related accessories. He has been writing about and reviewing consumer technology and software since 2000. See full bio, 8108=One of the biggest benefits to CMOS sensors is their fast speed compared with CCD sensors. That's certainly true of the 300 HS, getting a noticeable performance jump from the CCD-based SD1400 IS. On the other hand, it is slightly slower than CMOS-based ultracompacts from other manufacturers. The camera goes from off to first shot in 1.5 seconds, with shot-to-shot times averaging 2.2 seconds without flash and 3.6 seconds with flash. Its shutter lag--the time it takes from pressing the shutter release to capturing a photo--is 0.5 second in bright lighting and 0.9 second in low-light conditions. The camera's burst mode is capable of capturing at 3.2 frames per second, with focus and exposure set with the first shot. It can shoot until your memory card fills up, though, which is nice; competing cameras have a burst limit and make you wait while images are stored before you can shoot again. The camera also has a high-speed burst mode that can shoot 3-megapixel photos at up to 8.2fps. The results are very good compared with similar modes on other cameras I've tested, suitable for small prints and definitely for Web use.}", "lastModified": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 01:38:22 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "", "textAfterTable": "Image stabilization type Optical and digital Battery type, CIPA rated life Li ion rechargeable, 220 shots Battery charged in camera No; wall charger supplied Storage media SD/SDHC/SDXC cards, Eye-Fi SD/SDHC cards Bundled software ZoomBrowser EX 6.7/PhotoStitch 3.1 (Windows); ImageBrowser 6.7/PhotoStitch 3.2 (Mac); Map Utility 1.0 (Windows/Mac) The Elph 300 HS produces generally excellent snapshots. Photos do get softer and noisier above ISO 200--typical for point-and-shoots--but ISO 400 and 800 are still very usable. The noise and noise reduction are well balanced so you still get good color and detail at these higher sensitivities. Colors desaturate some at ISO 1,600 and 3,200, subjects look very soft, and detail is greatly diminished. While you might not want to view them at larger sizes or heavily crop them, the high-ISO results should be satisfactory for Web or prints at small sizes. Sample photos: Canon PowerShot Elph 300 HS Compared with a camera with a similar sensor and lens, the Sony Cyber-shot WX9, the Elph 300 HS may have a slight edge. Both drop off in quality at ISO 400.
