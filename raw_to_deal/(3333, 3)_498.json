Moreover, for AAA games you need at least tech level 3 to increase technical expertise (note that for AAA games, k is indeed calculated with 5 as a base level but clamped to 3). Experts have an effect on the technical expertise factor only for AAA games.\u00a0 Calculating Target Game ScoreEdit To calculate the game's review score, we compare it to a \"Target Game Score\" and if we achieve that, we get maximum possible review score (determined by technical expertise factor), and if not, we get a portion of that based on how close we came to it. Three values are used to calculate the Target Game Score: Top Score is the highest game score (g, above) ever achieved (updated only when the review score s>=9)", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
