Or are these still good ideas that just haven't worked out yet? What's behind door No. 3 According to money manager Wally Weitz, it's either one or the other. And since not many stocks go up -- and keep going up -- from the day that you buy them, the key to investing successfully is to separate the mistakes from the good ideas.

How now, brown cow The way to separate good ideas from investing mistakes, for Weitz, is to track his investing thesis against the progress of the business he's invested in -- not the stock price. He says, \"What we really look at is to see that our businesses are performing the way they're supposed to -- and that the business value is going up even if the stock price isn't.\" To really maximize profits, he told shareholders in a recent call, \"We really can't wait for the 'all-clear signal'\" from the market to buy a company like Lowe's (NYSE: LOW\u00a0\u00a0)", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
