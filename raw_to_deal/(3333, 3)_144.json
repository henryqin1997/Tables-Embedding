These funds are not mutual funds and are not open to individual investors. As such, there are no tickers for the funds reported in the financial press. Government Securities Investments. The \"G\" Fund is invested in very short-term U.S. Treasury securities (bonds) guaranteed by the federal government. These are unique government securities, backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government, available only through the G Fund. This is equivalent to a high-yield stable value fund, so there is no possibility of a loss of principal, and there is no risk of loss. As set forth by law, the interest paid by this fund is equal to the average rate of return on outstanding Treasury securities with four or more years to maturity. There is no ticker symbol for the G Fund. Fixed Income Index Investments. The \"F\" Fund is invested in high quality securities (Barclay's US Debt Index Fund), which track the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate (LBA) bond index. This index represents a diversified group of U.S. government, corporate and mortgage-related securities. It will also perform similarly to the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (ticker symbol: VBMFX). For tracking purposes, one can either use the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (ticker symbol: VBMFX) or the IShares", "textAfterTable": "Posted by DQ at 2:46 AM 1 comment: Rich Collins said...
