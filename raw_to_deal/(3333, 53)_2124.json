Here are the numbers from last week: This week you could really feel the year starting to wind down. \u00a0 Activity dwindled, and between the few homes that sold this week and the others that were taken off the market for the holidays, the inventory of homes for sale was pushed down to 16 \u2014 I can\u2019t remember when I\u2019ve seen it that low. \u00a0And it will likely drop below this mark as additional homes are pulled from the market for the holidays. \u00a0It\u2019s evident now that most buyers are simply going to have sit on the sidelines until the Spring market to get a new influx of homes to choose from.
