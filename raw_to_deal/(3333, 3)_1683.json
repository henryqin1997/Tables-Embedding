On most tables, there\u2019s a \u201cBar 12\u201d for the Don\u2019t Pass (rarely does a casino have a \u201cBar 2\u201d instead of \u201cBar 12\u201d). If you bet the Don\u2019t Pass and the shooter rolls a 12 on the come-out, then it\u2019s a tie, so the number 12 is effectively eliminated as a win-lose option for the Don\u2019t Pass on the come-out roll (i.e., it\u2019s like a non-roll; it\u2019s meaningless in terms of a win-lose decision). Continuing down the article, we see that the term \u201cBar 12\u201d is defined so you know exactly what it means. And then a little further down the article, we talk about the Don\u2019t Pass odds on the come-out. Remember, the 12 is a tie for the Don\u2019t Pass on tables with \u201cBar 12,\u201d so that means you win with a 2 or 3 on the come-out. There are two ways to make a 3 and one way to make a 2, which equals three ways to win on the come-out. Comparing that to the six ways to lose for the 7, and 2 ways to lose for the 11 (i.e., a total of eight ways to lose on the come-out), you get the odds of 3:8 (or 8:3 depending on your perspective). We suggest that you go back read the article again for clarification., 3197=For the point of 5 or 9, the true odds are 3:2 (i.e., six ways to make a 7 versus four ways to make a 5 or 9), which means you lay a multiple of 3 to win a multiple of 2.\u00a0 For example, suppose you make a $5 Don\u2019t Pass Flat bet and the shooter rolls a point of 9.\u00a0 You have a gut feeling that the dice are cold and a 7 will appear before a 9, so you decide to lay maximum Odds on the point.\u00a0 Suppose the table maximum allowable Odds for the 5 or 9 is 4x; which means, with your $5 Flat bet, the most you can win for an Odds bet is $20 (i.e., 4 x $5 = $20).\u00a0 Therefore, to win $20 on a Don\u2019t Pass Odds bet, you must lay $30 because the true odds are 3:2.\u00a0 Remember, there are six ways to make a 7, and four ways to make a 9 (hence, the odds of 6:4 or 3:2).\u00a0 With a Don\u2019t Pass bet, you have the advantage after a point is established, so if you want to lay an Odds bet, you have to lay your fair share., 21393=On your 8:3 odds, how come it is not 8:4 with a roll of a twelve being the fourth way to win on the \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d side?, 17177=15.\u00a0 The shooter rolls a 7.\u00a0 The stickman shouts, \u201cSeven\u2011out!\u201d\u00a0 The game ends.\u00a0 But a 7 is good for you because you bet the Don\u2019t Pass!\u00a0 Woohoo!\u00a0 A 7 showed before the point so your Don\u2019t Pass Flat bet and Odds bet win.\u00a0 You want to jump and scream, but that wouldn\u2019t be cool, so you pretend to be calm.\u00a0 You fantasize, \u201cJust call me Bond, James Bond.\u201d\u00a0 The dealer pays you $5 for the Flat bet (pays even money) and $25 for the Odds bet (pays 1:2, or $25 for a $50 bet).\u00a0 You pick up all your chips and put them in your chip stack with a bit more emphasis trying to get her attention.\u00a0 You think, \u201cIs she looking?\u00a0 Did she see me win all that money?\u00a0 I\u2019m such a stud.\u201d, 1281=Remember, for a Don\u2019t Pass bet after a point is established, the bet wins if a 7 is rolled before the point, and loses if the point is rolled before a 7.\u00a0 Therefore, like the Pass Line bet, odds are based on the number 7.\u00a0 For example, if the point is 6, the odds of rolling a 7 and winning the Don\u2019t Pass bet are 6:5 (i.e., six ways to roll a 7 and win versus five ways to roll a 6 and lose; therefore, 6:5).\u00a0 If the point is 5 or 9, the odds of winning are 6:4 (which reduces down to 3:2).\u00a0 If the point is 4 or 10, the odds of winning are 6:3 (which reduces down to 2:1)., 4174=For the point of 4 or 10, the true odds are 2:1 (i.e., six ways to make a 7 versus three ways to make a 4 or 10), which means you lay exactly double what you expect to win.\u00a0 For example, suppose you make an $8 Don\u2019t Pass Flat bet and the shooter rolls a point of 4.\u00a0 Suppose the table maximum allowable Odds for the 4 and 10 are 100x, which means for your $8 Flat bet, the most you can win for an Odds bet is $800 (i.e., 100 x $8 = $800).\u00a0 The true odds of rolling a 7 versus a 4 are 2:1; therefore, you have to lay $1,600 in Odds to win $800 (i.e., you have to bet your fair share, which is $1,600 in Odds to expect to win $800).\u00a0 Remember, for a Don\u2019t Pass bet after a point is established, you have the advantage so your Odds bet must be the higher amount to win the lower amount., 8371=In this example, assume the point is either 6 or 8. \u00a0With your $5 Don\u2019t Pass Flat bet, you lay 4x Odds for $24.\u00a0 For a Don\u2019t Pass Odds bet, you lay the bigger amount to win the smaller amount.\u00a0 In this example, you lay $24 to win $20 (i.e., the true odds of 6:5 with 4x odds means multiply each by 4 to get the equivalent 24:20).\u00a0 Because the Odds bet payoff (i.e., $20) doesn\u2019t equal the Flat bet payoff (i.e., $5), you \u201cheel\u201d your Odds bet chips.\u00a0 Notice that the higher denominations are on the bottom of the heeled stack to avoid a \u201cbarber pole.\u201d, 9222=If you\u2019re still a bit mystified, that\u2019s okay, it took me a while to get the hang of it, too.\u00a0 You\u2019ll get it after a while.\u00a0 If you\u2019re uncertain about whether to bridge or heel your Don\u2019t Pass Odds bet, just tell the dealer, \u201cI want Odds but I don\u2019t remember how to do it.\u201d\u00a0 The dealer will ask how much you want to bet.\u00a0 Suppose the point is 4 and you tell him you want to lay $20 to win $10 (i.e., true odds are 2:1, so you lay the bigger amount to win the smaller amount).\u00a0 He\u2019ll tell you to drop $20 in chips on the table, and then he\u2019ll pick them up and properly stack them next to your Don\u2019t Pass Flat bet.\u00a0 The key is don\u2019t be shy and don\u2019t be afraid to ask the dealer for help.\u00a0 That\u2019s what he\u2019s there for., 6024=Let\u2019s use the above figure as example to clarify this concept.\u00a0 Suppose the table is really cold with lots of 7-outs.\u00a0 Instead of your normal $5 Flat bet, you feel frisky and decide to double it to take advantage of the cold table.\u00a0 You make a $10 Don\u2019t Pass bet and the shooter rolls a 6 on the come-out roll; the point is 6.\u00a0 You know from our article on basic craps math that the true odds for the 6 are 6:5 (i.e., six ways to roll a 7, and five ways to roll a 6).\u00a0 You decide to lay single Odds (i.e., 1x).\u00a0 So, with a $10 Flat bet, your single Odds bet would be $12 (i.e., 6:5 equates to 12:10, and we learned earlier that you must bet the bigger amount to win the smaller amount; 12 is bigger than 10, so the Odds bet is $12).\u00a0 In this example, if the shooter were to roll a 7 before rolling a 6, you\u2019d win $10 for the Flat bet and you\u2019d win $10 for the Odds bet.\u00a0 Because your Flat bet and Odds bet would win the same amount (i.e., $10 each), you bridge your $12 Odds bet by placing two $5 chips (i.e., $10) directly next to your $10 Flat bet, and then placing the remaining two $1 chips so they bridge (i.e., straddle) the two stacks as shown in the figure above.\u00a0 Let\u2019s review.\u00a0 In this example, with your $10 Don\u2019t Pass Flat bet, you decide you want to lay 1x Odds.\u00a0 For a Don\u2019t Pass Odds bet, you lay the bigger amount to win the smaller amount.\u00a0 In this example, you lay $12 to win $10.\u00a0 Because the Odds bet payoff (i.e., $10) equals the Flat bet payoff (i.e., $10), you \u201cbridge\u201d your Odds bet chips by putting $10 next to your Flat bet and then straddle the two $10 stacks with the two $1 chips.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 02:30:55 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "The Don\u2019t Pass Odds bet against the point is based on true odds, or the odds that a\u00a07 will appear compared to a point number.\u00a0 Let\u2019s review the data our other article about basic craps math. Unlike the Pass Line bet where the chips are all stacked in one pile behind the Flat bet, the Don\u2019t Pass Odds bet is either heeled or bridged.\u00a0 To understand what \u201cheeled\u201d and \u201cbridged\u201d mean, we should first review true odds and how much Odds we need to lay on the Don\u2019t Pass.
