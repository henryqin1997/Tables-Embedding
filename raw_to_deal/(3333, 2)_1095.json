Overseas research ( Jaffe, 1990 ; 1992 ) also confirms that children are often involved directly and indirectly in family violence and that this is likely to have damaging consequences for them both immediately and in the longer term., 46590=At present, custody orders can be made without those conducting inquiries being required to ascertain whether or not there has been a history of violence in the relationship between the adults and the children involved - these practices should be reviewed. Recently Justice Sir Ronald Davison ( 1994 ) has proposed that a primary concern in all dealings with situations where family violence has occurred should be - are the children safe? He specifically proposes that a parent who has used violence against a spouse should not be granted custody or unsupervised access until they can show that the child will be safe with them. Other North American jurisdictions are currently considering or have developed codes that include a concern for the potential physical danger to children ( Hart, 1992 ). Such proposals deserve consideration in relation to Family Court proceedings and in relation to all other inquiries about the placement of children., 6037=From the written files we were able to create a computer database of 528 records of police incidents collected by Haipp between July 1991 and April 1994. This included all police incidents which involved a physical assault involving family or people in a close relationship and on which Haipp Advocate Forms had been collected. From the database it was possible to determine whether or not the victims of family violence had children in their care who were present and who were caught up in the violence; the type of violence that the children witnessed and experienced; and how the children reacted at the time. This paper presents these results, discusses the possible longer term effects of the violence on these children and suggests options for us as a society to protect the children more effectively., 52261=Pocock, T (1994) Unpublished thesis. Masters degree in Psychology, University of Auckland, 1994., 45594=Domestic Protection orders are currently available only to those in a spousal relationship (although a woman's children may also be named on protection orders). Restraining orders are available under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989 to protect children but they are not readily available on the first occasion an incident of violence involving a child is reported. Alterations to the Domestic Protection Act which are currently being considered could protect children in families where violence has occurred or been threatened and orders to protect children could be made available on an ex parte basis in the same way as they are available to an adult partner ( Office of the Commissioner for Children, 1994 ). Further, the police should be included as a party able to make application for orders for the protection of a child where there are grounds to believe that the child may be in danger., 42921=The data described in this paper come from records of incidents that came to police attention because of a primary focus on men's violence towards women. The fact that there were so many cases where the violence towards children during these incidents remained in the background, raises the question of how much more violence towards children goes unrecorded. Certainly it seems reasonable to assume from this data that, despite the growing awareness of the need to call the police when men hit women, there is not the same recognition of the need to call the police when children are the victims. To beat or belt a child, or even to punch them, is still seen by many as a legitimate part of parenting. A recent study from this Office ( Maxwell, 1993 ) showed that 2% of a random sample of over 300 current parents said that they had given their child \"a really severe thrashing\" and 11% reported that they had \"hit with a strap, stick or something similar\". Such behaviour is likely to continue to be seen as acceptable parenting rather than violence towards children so long as it is supported by the fact that Section 59 of the Crimes Act 1961 exempts from a charge of assault parents who use \"reasonable force\" towards their children., 2362=Copyright \u00a9 1994 Gabrielle M. Maxwell, 9454=The victim sample was made up of Maori or Pakeha in equal percentages (each group made up 48% of the victim population whose ethnicity was known). This indicates that the victims in this sample are 3 to 4 times as likely to be Maori as would be expected from the 1991 census data on the ethnicity of the population of Hamilton city. However, it is important not to assume from this data that family violence is more likely in Maori families - overseas research ( Sherman, 1992, p. 7 ) suggests that there are considerable differences in the likelihood that the police will become involved in family violence in different groups in the population., 44351=Not only is there too little information in New Zealand on the incidence and prevalence of family violence that involves children, but we also know too little of the impact that family violence has on children who are caught up in it. Locally the only research on the effects on children of involvement in family violence comes from a recent thesis by Tanya Pocock ( 1994 ), which compares children in refuges with children who are not., 53858=Copyright \u00a9 1995\u20132008 Minnesota Center Against Violence and Abuse.

Overseas research ( Jaffe et al, 1992 reviews much of this work) increasingly suggests that children who have witnessed family violence demonstrate adjustment difficulties in a number of areas including health problems, cognitive deficits, adolescent hostility and aggression and difficulties in adult relationships with the opposite sex. Research ( Straus and Gelles, 1990 , Jaffe et al, 1990 and 1992 )) also suggests that these are the children who are likely to grow up to fight and bully their peers, to beat their wives and to commit violent crimes; or, especially if they are female, who are likely to acquiesce in victimisation and accept violence from their friends and partners.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 02 Nov 2012 20:40:32 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "Table\u00a02.\u00a0Table 2: Types of injuries sustained by the victims and the part of the body injured: percentages (N=476) These were traumatic scenes for children to be watching.
