The self-tailing mechanism means that one crew member can quickly and easily trim or raise sails. Winches are two-speed self-tailing winches. Two-speed winches enable quick grinding in first gear out of a tack or jibe. When the sheet loads up, the reverse direction gives more power in second gear. All have Harken's \"super holding\" jaws and one-piece sculpted line guide and peeler. Use with: Halyards, sheets and control lines.
