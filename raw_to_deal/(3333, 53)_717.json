It takes full features of this processor and supports up to 256MByte DDR SDRAM and 256MByte NAND Flash as well as high-speed USB2.0 OTG function. The board has exposed many other hardware interfaces including RS232 serial port, LCD/TSP, DVI-D, S-Video, Ethernet, SD, keyboard, camera, SPI, I2C and JTAG. The board has two methods to boot the system from either SD card or NAND flash. It is able to support WinCE and Linux OS and provided with WinCE6.0 BSP and Linux2.6.28 BSP. Embest also provides demos of Google Android OS, Angstrom (GPE) and DVSDK for user experience., 53734=24-bit LCD display, can output true-color RGB signal, R:B:G=8:8:8, can support resolution up to 2048*2048 pixels.
