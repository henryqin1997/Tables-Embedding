The gross and net statutory allocations are 2.3 trillion and 3.4 trillion naira respectively. The breakdown of the two allocations for all the states showed that Kano State had the highest Gross Statutory allocation of N95.3 billion. It was followed by Lagos State, N89.7 billion. The least was Bayelsa, N48.5 billion. Seven states earned between N70 billion and N78 billion as Statutory allocation. The states are: Kaduna, Katsina, Borno, Oyo, Benue, Niger and Bauchi. Others are in the sixty and fifty billion categories. However, after adding 13% share of derivation, crude oil excess proceeds and VAT, and adjusting for various deductions; the distribution pattern changed completely. Delta (N299.9b), Rivers (N266.2 billion), Bayelsa (N244.3 billion) and Akwa Ibom (N224.2 billion) led other states with incredible wide margin. Going by this analysis, these four states which are also from the South-South geo-political zone could be regarded as the richest. The next after these four was Lagos State which got N116.6b which was just about half the amount for Akwa Ibom and one-third of Delta. Plateau state got the least (N48.1b) total net statutory allocation and it was the only state that had total net to be smaller than total gross.

This amount constitutes about one quarter of the total net allocation to all the 36 states. The oil producing states constitute one quarter of the states in the federation. Among all the non oil producing states, Plateau had the highest amount which was just about half a million for a period of 80 months. Surprisingly, Lagos state did not receive a dime as share of derivation for the entire period. Crude Oil Excess Proceeds A total", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
