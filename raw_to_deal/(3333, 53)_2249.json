You can change the selection method from QoS groups to ToS or EXP only if no PVC bundle member has QoS groups or Inverse Address Resolution Protocol (InverseARP) configured. Note The selection methods are mutually exclusive. This means that when the selection method based on QoS groups is specified on any PVC bundle member, no other selection method is allowed on the same PVC bundle. Similarly, if the selection method based on ToS or EXP is specified on any PVC bundle member, no other selection method is allowed on the same PVC bundle. ToS or EXP--Use ToS", "textAfterTable": "Configuring the QoS Group-Based Method for Selection of PVC Bundle Members Perform this task to configure the method for selection of PVC bundle members that is based on QoS groups.
