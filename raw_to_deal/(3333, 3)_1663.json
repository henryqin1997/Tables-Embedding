A TE port is specific to switches in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family. An industry standard E port can link to other vendor switches and is referred to as a nontrunking interface. Trunking enables link transmitting frames in the EISL format to carry (trunk) multiple VSAN traffic. PortChannel enables several physical links to be combined into one aggregated logical link. Trunking is a commonly used storage industry term. However, the Cisco SAN-OS software and switches in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family implement trunking and PortChannels as follows: Trunking configurations are only applicable to E ports. If trunk mode is enabled in an E port and that port becomes operational as a trunking E port, it is referred to as a TE port. The trunk-allowed VSANs configured for TE ports are used by the trunking protocol to determine the allowed-active VSANs in which frames can be received or transmitted. Trunking, also known as VSAN trunking, is a feature specific to switches in the Cisco MDS 9000 Family. Trunking enables interconnected ports to transmit and receive frames in more than one VSAN, over the same physical link using extended ISL (EISL) frame format.

The interface configuration as seen in the show running-config CLI command is no longer consolidated. Common Troubleshooting Tools in Fabric Manager The following Fabric Manager navigation paths can be useful in troubleshooting any issues with PortChannel and trunking: Choose ISLs > PortChannel to access the PortChannel configuration. Choose Switches > Interfaces > FC Logical and click the Trunk Config tab to access the trunking configuration. Common Troubleshooting Commands in the CLI The following commands can be useful in troubleshooting PortChannel and trunking: show port-channel compatibility-parameters show port-channel summary show port-channel database show port-channel consistency detail show port-channel usage show interface show interface trunk show trunk protocol PortChannel Issues This section describes common PortChannel issues.
