For all of these cases, si_code contains a positive value reflecting the reason why the system generated the signal: System Signals si_value contains the application specified value, which is passed to the application's signal-catching function at the time of the signal delivery if si_code is any of SI_QUEUE, SI_TIMER, SI_ASYNCHIO, or SI_MESGQ. The signal was generated by the arrival of a message on an empty message queue. See mq_notify(3C). SI_MESGQ The signal was generated by the completion of an asynchronous I/O request. SI_ASYNCIO The signal was generated by the expiration of a timer created by timer_settime(3C). SI_TIMER The signal was sent by sigqueue(3C). SI_QUEUE The signal was sent by _lwp_kill(2). SI_LWP The implementation sets si_code to SI_USER if the signal was sent by kill(2), sigsend(2), raise(3C) or abort(3C). SI_USER If the signal was generated by a user process, the following values are defined for si_code: zoneid_t si_zoneid /* sending zone ID */S ctid_t si_ctid /* sending contract ID */ uid_t si_uid /* sending user ID */ pid_t si_pid /* sending process ID */ If the value of si_code is less than or equal to 0, then the signal was generated by", "textAfterTable": "Signals can also be generated from the resource control subsystem.
