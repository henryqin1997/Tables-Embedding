Genetic heterogeneity of nonneoplastic cells has not yet been sufficiently investigated. However, genomic instability in normal cells could be a potentially important issue, in particular when these cells are used as reference in LOH and MSI analyses of tumor samples. In order to investigate possible genetic abnormalities in normal colorectal cells of tumor patients, MSI analyses of normal colonic mucosa were performed. Up to 15 different laser-microdissected normal regions containing 50-150 cells were investigated in each of 15 individual microsatellite-stable, sporadic high microsatellite-instable (MSI-H) and hereditary non-polyposis coli cancer (HNPCC) colorectal cancer patients. Frequent MSI and heterogeneity in the MSI pattern were found both in normal and tumor cells from 10 HNPCC and sporadic", "textAfterTable": "Intestinal Mucosa/pathology MESH Lasers MESH Microsatellite Repeats/genetics MESH Rectum/pathology MESH Dewey Decimal Classification: 600 Technology > 610 Medical sciences Medicine Status: Published Refereed: Unknown Created at the University of Regensburg: Unknown Deposited On: 17 Jun 2010 08:07 Last Modified: 17 Jun 2010 08:07 Item ID: 15368 Owner Only: item control page Altmetric Altmetric Altmetric University University Library Publication Server Contact person Gernot Deinzer Telefon 0941 943-2759 Contact", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
