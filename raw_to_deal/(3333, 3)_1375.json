Reaching the Sudan Temple, he discovered that a Nazi digging team had set up camp at the base of the structure, and found a back way through a narrow canyon and a tunnel into the temple. After recovering the Ram's Head Bust, Jones was confronted by his former classmate, Magnus V\u00f6ller, who took the treasure from him at gunpoint. Thinking fast, Jones tossed the artifact at a soldier, who caught the relic, but nearly fell into a pit, prompting V\u00f6ller to try to rescue the relic. Jones sealed his attackers into the temple, and ran into the camp, where he fought against several German desert commandos before escaping in a truck.

She balked that she had to stand around doing nothing, but quickly agreed. Indy worked his way across the catwalks the Nazis had built at the site. He noticed that Magnus had stationed scouts there, and it wouldn't be easy getting in. On the way down he activated a crane he knocking a German off the catwalks but alerted his presence. He fought his way through the Germans who were then trying to stop him from reaching the bottom. Pushing boxes down, eh was able to reach the ladder to the next level of catwalks and worked his way further down. When he reached halfway he yelled to Maggie his position. When he reached the bottom, the germans figured out where he was heading and demanded that he take them to the Shepherd. When he refused, the officer ordered the guards to capture Jones. Indy quickly defeatedt hem, and turne dhis attention to a wheel near a nearby gate. Turning it he raised the gate, and made his way to the Waterways. Indy had to figure out how to get past gates blocking passage tot he Cistern he was after. According to the Chronicle the Cistern had been commissioned by a Roman proconsul who had been worired about being poisaned, so he built the gates to prevent saboteurs. The shepherd was hidden behind one of the gates. Indy carefuly worked his way accross the waterways until he reached the first gate. He noticed the area had a system of water pipes. He noticed a lever, pulling it he drenched himself as water fell from above, but turned on the ancient plumbing system and a nearby fountain. Searching further into the room he found a valve laying on the ground. He returned it to its rightful place and turned the wheel, which caused a pipe above to move around the room. He moved it until it filled a basin to the right of the gate filling it, and causing it to lower, while raising the gate. He only had a short time to get through as the water drained from the basin. He made his way through but noticed that another gate blocked his passage. He quickly brought down a pillar on that side, this destablied the roof causing the room to shake, Indy knew he had to hurry up. He quickly moved the base near the gate, and worked his way back to the valve. Using the vavle he opened the gate again, quickly moved the pillar under it to keep it open, and then worked the valve this time filling the basin on the leftside of the first gate, raising the second gate. He quickly ran through. Following, the Chronicle he found the location where the Shepherd was held; a large open chamber with a timekeeping pendulum in the center. According to the Chronicle it served as a kind of time lock, and had to be sunwung accros the right sequence of numbers to reveal the Shepherd. Indy discovered an inscription below the pendulum with a riddle pointing how find the pendulum. The clue said to activate six and fifty and nine and ten, 9:10. Indy noticed that hte room was built like a clock with numbers one to twelve on the walls. With that he figured he needed to swing the pendulum at the correct sequence tof numbers on the wall. Getting on the Pendulum he started to swing it around the room, causing it to crash into the wall. Each time he hit the correct numbers a niche on the wall opened a little. While he was swinging on the pendulm Nazis began to enter the roo, which he took out by swinging the pendulum into them. afAfter hit last the last number, the Shepherd was revealed he grabbed and escaped back to the entrance of the cisterns. However his damage to the waterworks and creashing pendulm started to cause the site to collapse. He carefully made his way back up the catwalks, Maggie asked him what he had done, Indy told her had no time to explain. He carefully made his way up the ladders avoiding short circuiting crane, and jumping or swinging over broken or collapsing sections of the catwalk until he reached the top. Along the way Maggie told Indy to hurry up before the place collapsed. Finally making it to the exist Indy had a chance to examine the Shepherd., 40018=Returning from Sudan, Jones received a note from his friend Archie Tan, summoning Jones to Chinatown in San Francisco to discuss the disappearance of Charles Kingston in 1933, and his connection to the mysterious Jade Sphere.

A merchant named Archie Tan was requesting that Indy see something from his old friend and archaelogy professor Charles Kingston. After Kingston had disappeared a few years before, Indy had assumed he had died on a dig somewhere. Indy didn't know why it was so urgent, but was told to come right away. Indy quickly travelled to Chinatown and reached his office, but found the door partially open, and heard strange sounds behind it. Sensing trouble he slowly opened the door, and found a chinese man rummaging inside of Archie's desk. He called out to the man, who started escaped through the window, to the fire escape. Indy gave chase following the man up to the rooftops (the \"San Franscisco Skyline\"). Indy jumped accross to another building, finding the man around a corner. The man yelled, telling Indy to stop following him, and fire his gun hitting a pipe, causing steam to escape. Unperterbed Indy continued to chase the man accross the roof. Around another corner he saw the man had reached the roof of another building. Seeing no other way across he pushed an antenna over and quickly made his way across. Following the path the man had taken indy came across a short circuiting fuse box that was sending arcing bolts of electricty between the fuse box and a couple of barrels. Indy carefully made his way past the electricty, finding a gun, that the man had dropped. Looking across to the next building, he saw the man standing on a roof watching him. Indy quickly shot a at flat of crates being held up by a crane. Hitting the rope the crates fell, giving Indy room to use his his whip to swing across to the next building via the crane. Once over, Indy had cornered the man or so he thought and started to question him as to Archie's location. However the man was waiting for him and came at him with his fists ready. After Indy had taken care of the guy, more of his friends started pouring out of the doorways on the roof trying to stop him. Indy quickly dispatched them. Having knocked them all out he couldn't question them, but found a business card on one of the thugs from the Lao Che Lounge. Indy discovered that the lounge was controlled a local gang, the Hip Chen Tong. Indy suspected they were the ones who had kidnapped Archie, and travelled to the lounge to find him., 32762=Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings is a video game published by LucasArts for the Wii, Nintendo DS, PSP and PS2 on June 9, 2009.
