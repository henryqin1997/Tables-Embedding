Klitschko broke his left middle finger in the first round. Brewster's trainer, James (Buddy) McGirt, asked the referee to stop the fight after the sixth round. Mandatory defense for Klitschko, due to Brewster being the highest available contender in the IBF rankings. Brewster entered the bout having not fought in 15 months as he recovered from a detached retina suffered in his previous bout against Siarhei Liakhovich.", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
