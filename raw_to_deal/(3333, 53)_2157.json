The problem was that ever time I boot my machine the pin 4 led would not shut off, and all other leds could not be turned on or off by echo or lights.o. All of this was caused by modules lp,parport,and parport_pc. The solution was to comment out the lines that load the modules in /etc/rc.d/rc.modules-[kernel version here]. There pretty hard to miss. Add the modules to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist did not help though I did that t and it may be part of the solution., 229295=I have the problem that in order to compile the module to work on the target embedded device I must be in Kernel version 2.4.20-20. Despite my efforts my network card only works in 2.4.20-8SMP and when I compile the drive in this mode it will not run on the embedded target. The solution currently is to reboot after every build into the 2.4.20-8SMP, which is not great., 163191=make -C /usr/src/linux/kernel M=`pwd` modules make: Entering directory `/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.6.15/linux-2.6.15.i686/kernel' make: *** No rule to make target `modules'.

This is shown in Table 1, which is, at this point, empty. It will be filled when the different device drivers concepts are introduced. On the other hand, in kernel space Linux also offers several functions or subroutines to perform the low level interactions directly with the hardware, and allow the transfer of information from kernel to user space. The kernel offers several subroutines or functions in user space, which allow the end-user application programmer to interact with the hardware. Usually, in UNIX or Linux systems, this dialogue is performed through functions or subroutines in order to read and write files. The reason for this is that in Unix devices are seen, from the point of view of the user, as files. Interfacing functions between user space and kernel space Figure 1: User space where applications reside, and kernel space where modules or device drivers reside All of this is shown in figure 1.

The first driver: loading and removing the driver in user space I\u2019ll now show you how to develop your first Linux device driver, which will be introduced in the kernel as a module. For this purpose I\u2019ll write the following program in a file named nothing.c <nothing.c> =  #include <linux/module.h> MODULE_LICENSE(\"Dual BSD/GPL\"); Since the release of kernel version 2.6.x, compiling modules has become slightly more complicated. First, you need to have a complete, compiled kernel source-code-tree. If you have a Debian Sarge system, you can follow the steps in Appendix B (towards the end of this article). In the following, I\u2019ll assume that a kernel version 2.6.8 is being used. Next, you need to generate a makefile. The makefile for this example, which should be named Makefile, will be: <Makefile1> =  obj-m :=", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
