The FieldInfo class does not have a public constructor. FieldInfo objects are obtained by calling either the GetFields or GetField method of a Type object. Fields are variables defined in the class. FieldInfo provides access to the metadata for a field within a class and provides dynamic set and get functionality for the field. The class is not loaded into memory until invoke or get is called on the object. Notes to Inheritors When you inherit from FieldInfo, you must override the following members: GetValue and SetValue. Examples The following example uses the Type.GetFields method to get the field-related information from the FieldInfo class, and then displays field attributes.
