I typically use cruise control every day. When I attempted to use it on 7/27, the indicator light showed \"on\" but it would not engage when I tried to set the vehicle speed. I turned the cruise off and retried - again the control failed to engage. After 4 attempts I gave up and left the control off. A few minutes later the car accelerated on its own (on a slight uphill incline), hard enough to drop from 4th to 2nd gear, as if the cruise control engaged. I hit the brakes and the acceleration stopped. Operation then seemed normal. After a few minutes of thought, I decided to (cautiously) check the cruise control again. It engaged and operated properly. After checking though, I turned it off. Later that day I took the car to a Toyota dealership. The service department scanned the electronics, but found no errors. See all problems of the 2008 Toyota Corolla., 29889=While driving west on highway 50 at 65 mph at approximately 7 pm, I turned off the cruise control and the motor stopped at the same time. The car immediately began to slow down and I attempted to restart the motor, which was impossible with the car in gear (automatic transmission). The emergency lights were then turned on as the cars behind were honking their horns and other cars were passing right and left. We were in the second lane with the headlights, also on, of course. I tried starting the car in neutral and that didn't work. When we came to a full stop, I put the car in park and started the car. Everything went well after that. See all problems of the 2013 Toyota Corolla., 16900=The contact owns a 2004 Toyota Corolla. The contact was driving with the cruise control set to approximately 70 mph. When the brakes were applied to disable the cruise control, the vehicle would not respond and instead, accelerated abnormally. The brake pedal fell into the floorboard and the contact applied the emergency parking brake but the vehicle still would not respond and the contact crashed into the rear of a vehicle. The vehicle was towed to a dealer and the manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The manufacturer had an engineer inspect the vehicle who was unable to duplicate the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The approximate failure mileage was 66,771. See all problems of the 2004 Toyota Corolla., 27249=Once a month or so when I am at highway speeds the car does not decelerate as normal when I take my foot off the gas petal. The car tend to stays at the speed it was at until I use the break. It is almost like the cruise control has been turned on without notice (it is never turned on during these cases). This sometimes includes the slight acceleration like some car get when they are going back on cruise control. Luckily I keep a good distance between me and the car ahead of me. I can see this issues causing accidents. See all problems of the 2011 Toyota Corolla., 26070=While driving on route 30 east in PA, I experienced a scenario where I was on cruise control and pressed the brake. The car continued to accelerate at it's speed and subsequent pressings of the brakes did not slow the car. I shifted the car into neutral and the brakes still were not slowing the car enough. I had to drive into the left shoulder and grass beyond that in order to slow the car down enough to let other cars pass so I could go into the right lane. The next business I took my car to the dealer and after driving 7 miles and looking for error codes, reported that they \"could not reproduce the issue\". My car already had all the fixes for the unintended acceleration issue that Toyota had a number of recalls for done in December 2013. This issue needs to be further investigated by Toyota because if the reported fixes do not work, then there could be a significant number of accidents/fatalities yet to come. I never had experienced this issue before. See all problems of the 2010 Toyota Corolla., 2467=I was driving on cruise control on a highway (approx. 60mph) in my 2003 Toyota Corolla s. Suddenly, it started accelerating on its own and started swerving. I hit the brake pedal and attempted to counter-steer but lost control of the car and crashed front-end into the guard rail, then the car started spinning and I believe it must have hit the guard-rail further down. The front is demolished, the driver side was bent in so could not open the door fully, the back bumper was gone and the passenger side was heavily scratched. The airbags never deployed., 6320=2010 Toyota Corolla. Consumer writes regarding problems with cruise control the consumer stated during the first few months when the cruise control was activated and set at 60 and 70 mph, the vehicle would surge . She immediately shut off the cruise control to stop the acceleration. The unexplained acceleration not only happened when gong up small hills, but it also happened once on a level highway. The consumer stated the speedometer rose above the cruise control speed setting., 4445=Driving 2010 Toyota Corolla manual trans on interstate on 8/2/10 at 2:30 p. M. Had cruise control on going 70 mph. Engaged clutch, shifted to neutral and braked in preparation to stop for traffic jam ahead. Brake did not engage and vehicle continued at 70 mph without touching accelerator. Continued attempts to brake, downshift, turn off cruise control with no decrease in speed. Initially unable to downshift but then did get into lower gear but with no resulting decrease in speed, nor did the engine make any noise indicating that I had downshifted. I was able to get onto shoulder where I continued to go 70 mph. I then got off at an exit that had an incline. Part way up the hill felt something disengage and the car slowed- not just due to the incline I think. I was then able to put on emergency brake and the car stopped. After several minutes I tried the brakes again and they worked. I did not reengage the cruise control after this. Please note that this occurred after I had taken the car in for both Toyota recommended recalls regarding the floor mats and putting a modification in the gas pedal. When I went in for recalls I asked about placement of a computer brake override system and was first told that fix was not yet available, then told it was not relevant to my car, and, after the above event told again that Toyota did not yet have the technology available to do this fix on Corollas. The dealership have thus far been unpleasant and suggesting that I might not be telling the truth., 11421=The contact owns a 2011 Toyota Corolla. The contact was driving approximately 55 mph and as he removed his foot from the accelerator pedal in anticipation that the vehicle would decelerate, the vehicle continued to maintain speed. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and they explained to the contact that the failure was a normal occurrence for the vehicle when driving with the cruise control engaged. In addition, the contact stated that when driving downhill with the cruise control activated, the vehicle would decelerate abnormally, causing a slight jerk. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was 800 and current mileage was approximately 5,600., 5367=The contact owns a 2010 Toyota Corolla. The contact was driving with the cruise control set when the vehicle accelerated independently. The contact stated the failure had occurred twice prior to the most recent failure. The dealer advised that the ecm was defective and would need replacing. The vehicle was left with the dealer where the contact was awaiting repairs. The VIN was not available. The failure and current mileage was approximately 1,600., 15556=2011 Toyota Corolla maintains the speed/rpm when the foot is off the accelerator pedal. It happens at all speed, but it mostly visible at 60mph and above. The car will maintain the speed, as if the cruise control was engaged! when going downhill, even braking is not enough and I had to resolt to placing automatic transmission into neutral, in order to drop the speed. Lawrence Toyota (NJ) technician/mechanic test drove my car and confirmed that vehicle was not operating normally. Yet, after they (dealership) contacted Toyota support in California, I was told that vehicle operates normally?! Toyota refuses to take responsibility and fix/recall 2011 Corolla's. This is a big safety issue. Someone will crash their car and possibly die because the car won't decelerate, when foot is of the accelerator pedal. Here is a link to a forum where owners of 2011 Toyota Corolla describe exactly the same safety issue with the car. . Read more..., 28592=On a trip to south carolina from new jersey interstate driving I experienced an issue with the cruise control. Issue is : when I come up on slower traffic and hit the brake the cruise control disengages as it should but when I let up off the brake pedal the vehicle accelerates rapidly on it's on without hitting the resume lever. Thinking quick I turned the cruise off. This happened 6 times on the round trip I finally quit using the cruise. The Toyota dealer said there is no recall or anything for this issue. I'm telling you this is unsafe as hell! I have an extensive mechanical background, I don't care what anybody says! I know what happened my wife and daughter saw it happen to. See all problems of the 2005 Toyota Corolla., 19981=The contact owns a 2008 Toyota Corolla. The contact stated that while attempting to activate the cruise control, the cruise control button and arm separated from the base due to defective material. The vehicle was taken to dealer, where the cruise control switch and arm were replaced. The manufacture took a complaint and offered to reimburse the repair cost. The failure and current mileages were 39,436. Sm., 19107=Just leased a 2011 Toyota Corolla. When at a steady cruising speed, anywhere above 35, there is a scary intermittent dragging or resistance, and then surge in speed, along with crazy fluctuation in rpm\u00bf\u00bfs, that is uncontrollable. In addition, when letting up on the accelerator to prepare to stop, the car locks in on the current speed, even at high speed and going uphill, and does no\u00bf\u00bft slow until the brake is firmly applied. It feels like the car is being controlled by a malfunctioning cruise control, except the cruise control is turned off. I a\u00bf\u00bfm scared to drive this car!., 24438=The contact owns a 2009 Toyota Corolla. The contact stated that the cruise control failed to work. The dealer diagnosed that the spiral cable assembly needed to be replaced due to the cable not being connected. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who replaced the spiral cable assembly. The contact was later notified of NHTSA campaign number: 14v168000 (steering). The vehicle was repaired. The approximate failure mileage was 100,000., 31367=The high beams on the headlights come on without the control being touched. This began when I first bought the car & still does. At first it would happen at any time of the day but now it happens only when it is dark or getting dark. This could impair the vision of the driver of an oncoming vehicle. It is most dangerous on narrow streets. There are other electrical problems that occur from time to time such as the cruise control, power mirrors, air conditioner, driving & dash lights not working. Also the dome light has remained on causing the battery to run down . These latter problems do not seem to pose the threat that the headlights do but they seem to be connected & they are a distraction that could cause problems. I have taken my car to the dealer many times but they never corrected the problem. See all problems of the 2009 Toyota Corolla., 14113=Letter from congressman on behalf of constituent re sudden uncontrolled acceleration of a Toyota Corolla automobile dot/I#2011-2068. The consumer stated she was traveling at the posted speed limit, when the sign ahead indicated to reduce speed ahead. The consumer reduced her speed to the posted limit by pressing down on the brake. As she attempted to brake, the vehicle continued to increase in speed and a loud noise was present. The consumer stated she continued to press harder on the brake and she could feel the abs activating. The abs sounded like a high pitched noise and pulsating very fast. The consumer finally came to a complete stop, before going through an intersection. However, the engine was emitting a loud roaring sound. The consumer shifted the gear from drive 1 to drive 2 and the vehicle shuddered. She tried to shift to park, but as she got to reverse the vehicle tried to buck, so she put the gear in neutral and turned off the vehicle. The consumer stated her cruise control wa activated at the time of the incident. However, the dealer stated the problem had nothing to do with the cruise control. See all problems of the 2003 Toyota Corolla., 10287=Sudden acceleration on 2003 Toyota Corolla. Just returned from first road trip with this car, from oregon to colorado, and car suddenly accelerated. It happened 5 times - 3 of the times while the car was in cruise control. In particular - while going up hill -- the car picks up speed to get over the hill but after reaching the top, car fails to slow down and only after hitting brakes several times would the acceleration stop and car would begin to slow. In one instance, I had to take the car off the freeway and onto an uphill on-ramp to get it to slow and brakes finally worked at top of hill. I could actually feel the gas pedal pushing down on its own - without my foot applying pressure. The first couple of times it happened, I thought it was because the car was going down hill and was just naturally picking up speed. It was only after putting the car in cruise control that I noticed the problem was the car, not the environment. In the first incident, the car went from 52 to 83, the second incident - 57 to 90, the 3rd incident - 65 to 88, the 4th instance 75 to 84 and the scariest incident of all - the car went from 70 to 105 mph!! I could have been killed and the only thing that slowed the car down (besides my continual braking) was that I started climbing a large hill. One of the incidents was witnessed by a wyoming highway patrol officer - out in the middle of nowhere and many miles to a town - who thoughtfully gave me detailed instructions how to get the car to stop safely (turn on your emergency flashers, put the car in neutral and apply even pressure to brakes - putting car in neutral gives more power to brakes). This car has 60,000 miles on it and had never been on a long trip before and very rarely on a freeway. I had never used the cruise control before and will not be using it again. Toyota needs to add the 2003 Corolla to the recall as it obviously has the same problem as the 2005 - 2010. Toyota will be hearing from me tomorrow.}", "textBeforeTable": "Other Common Vehicle Speed Control related problems of Toyota Corolla Next page \u00bb When set on cruise control and going uphill the car accelerates excessively to more than 5 mph over set speed limit. Failure Date: 06/26/2010 \u00a0 Cruise Control problem of the 2010 Toyota Corolla 25 Cruise control can be activated at typical road/highway speeds even when car is in neutral (on a manual transmission). As a result, the accelerator is electronically depressed, causing the engine to rev and hit the rev limiter. There are multiple ways to deactivate the cruise control, but the stress could be damaging on the engine and the scenario could a major distraction to the driver.
