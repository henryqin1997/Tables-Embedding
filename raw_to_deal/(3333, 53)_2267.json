I had a Japanese flatmate in London who told me about a disappointing afternoon where he was in Chinatown and went to a massage place. He studies bodywork and was disappointed to get a bad massage and an offer of sexual release. When he told me about his experience I listened sympathetically and said that Chinatown has some sleazy places (which sent us to his English-Japanese dictionary).

An interesting word in this connection is job, which once meant (as the stately OED has it) 'a public office or position of trust which is turned to personal gain or political advantage; a transaction in which duty or the public interest is sacrificed for the sake of such an advantage.' This is first recorded in 1667 and for the last time in 1888 (though a few outliers in scare quotes, showing that they are abnormal usages, appear in 1915, 1936, and 1979)., 164434=As a BrE speaker the first time I remember hearing the corruption sense was in Kenya, in about 2003, on a news report on their corruption commission.

My 1929 Funk and Wagnall's has this citation: \"The boodler sells his official vote or buys official acts contrary to the Law. He is a grafter, but a grafter is not necessarily a boodler. Grafting may or may not be lawful. It is either a special privilege exercised contrary to law or one the law itself may give.\" Gov. Jos. W. Folk, NY Evening Post, Nov. 23, '05. I don't think \"boodler\" ever made it to Britain, and is nearly forgotten in the US., 158940=In Br.English there is of course the verb 'graft' = 'to work (hard)'; and noun grafter = 'one who works (hard)' is also not uncommon. The only sense for the latter in the American corpus appears to be the 'one who takes part in corruption, deceit' sense. The spade sense looks to derive from graft/graff v. 'dig' (ultimately related to grave) acc. to the OED. OED suggests that grift 'obtain money by deception etc.' is a modification of graft, and hence grifter 'swindler, con artist' etc., cf. the novel 'The Grifters' and its 1990 film adaptation.}", "lastModified": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 21:39:44 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "graft from each corpus, the use of particular senses breaks down as: Taking a sample of 100 sentences containing a noun hard graft.

A quick look at our (chiefly AmE) Glossary of Words of County Glouster lists it as meaning 'work', so perhaps it has dialectal origins there. Neither of these senses of the word, then, seems to be terribly old, but because they're colloquial and dialectal, they'll have unwritten histories going back further. hard graft in 1853. An 1890 'slang' and the first citation is in the phrase graft; the OED lists them separately and doesn't have an etymology it trusts for the 'work' sense either.

Most of the 'work' uses in BrE were also modified by an adjective, but in addition to hard, there was honest, sheer, real, tireless etc.\u00a0 Second thing to notice: the 'corruption' sense is hardly unknown in BrE--but about half as frequent as in AmE. In both corpora, tissue grafts (on trees, skin, veins, bones, etc.) are the most common kind of graft. Third, the 'spade/shovel' sense is particular to BrE. The OED defines it as 'a narrow crescent-shaped spade used by drainers', and its only citation is from a 1893 Worcestershire dialect glossary. One of the corpus examples mentioned it as a Norfolk term--these are not particularly close to each other, but who knows what was really happening dialectally 100 years ago or what changed in the 100 years till the BNC. (I mention shovel because of the American tendency to use the term instead of spade, discussed back here.) And then there are more people or at least more famous people named Graft in the US than the UK (probably the former, it's a German name).
