Not all cameras have an ND filter; all cameras of the Ixus series have a ND Filter instead of a real aperture, also some other ones, e.g. the A450, A460, A530, A550, A560, A1000, TX1. Notes: 'Out' means the ND filter is not in. 'In' means the ND filter is swung in. 'Off' means the camera is in control of the ND filter state. Just select one of the options from there: Off/In/Out Extra Photo Operations -> ND filter state With CHDK, you can keep the ND filter out, and just select a faster shutter speed to compensate. In CHDK, you can perform this operation by going to: With the ND filter in, the camera can select a slower shutter speed without over-exposing the entire scene. Also, with the ND filter swung in, the camera will capture an image with an aperture of f/8 - This is a fake aperture value caused by the ND filter swinging in. When your camera detects a really bright scene, it'll swing", "textAfterTable": "(* Per platform/(model)/platform_camera.h - CAM_HAS_ND_FILTER) Resources A disassembled IXUS800 (SD700) with photos of lens and ND Filter - http://chdk.setepontos.com/index.php/topic,548.0.html External Resources Learn more about Neutral density filters - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ND_filter Learn more about Minimum/Maximum Apertures - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture#Maximum_and_minimum_apertures Understanding Camera Lenses - http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/camera-lenses.htm Retrieved from \" http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/ND_Filter?oldid=31750\" Categories: Help Around Wikia's network Random Wiki", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
