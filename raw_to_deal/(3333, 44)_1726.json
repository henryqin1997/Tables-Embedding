Only the ASUS A8000 is tested, though. The floppy disk controller, the parallel port, the serial ports (COM1 + COM2), and the keyboard should work for all chips. More advanced stuff may need more work, though. 13 The ASUS A8000 Super I/O seems to be a rebranded SMSC DME1737. 14 Working, but not widely tested, yet. Works with single DIMM DDR2. 15 The Intel 3100/EP80579 UARTs and watchdog timer are integrated as a Super I/O-like device; only the UARTs have been tested so far. 16 Two implementations: Rev B-C supported in coreboot, Rev D-E support via AGESA 17 MCP55 and CK804 are supported, but no open documents are available from NVIDIA. 18 Partially supported, but not all features implemented. 19 Only support for serial port 1 implemented, everything else is unsupported so far due to lack of datasheet. 20 Working, but not widely tested, yet.

Also, coreboot v1 should be avoided (if v4 can be used instead for your board), as it has been unmaintained for a long time. However, it is definitely desirable to port boards from v1 to v4 whereever possible. In general it is not recommended to use coreboot v3 \u2014 this was an experimental development tree which is gradually being merged into v4. If a device is not supported by coreboot v4, try checking coreboot v1 or coreboot v3 for support. coreboot v4 is the current stable coreboot tree recommended for productive use and for porting new boards.
