Collaborating with Hangao Electronics Co., Ltd., we deployed our systems in two cities and tested our systems over a three-month period. The data of 2024 electricity meters were +collected.

From November 3\u201318, 2009, collectors could broadcast RMs without any limit. As shown in Figure 7, the network structure does not seem very good. All the DtA values of collectors are less than 3, and the average transmission success rate is relatively low. That is because child and parent nodes are too far from each other and the bit error rate is relatively high. Therefore, we reprogrammed the collectors with a hand-held device in the 470 MHz wireless channel. When the value of DtA was smaller than DtA_Max + 1, the collector could only broadcast the RM three times. On Deceber 24, 2009, we reprogrammed the devices and made the EMMNets dynamically choose the limited times that RM packets were broadcasted according to the transmission success rate. At first, the limited-times value LT was set to two; if the performance was poor, the LT was increased by two. Figure 8 shows that average transmission success rate is improved due to the advantage of the network topology. And Figure 9 plots the corresponding network structures of the EMMNets deployed in Zhiyang residence community. With the EMMNets, customers can obtain the energy flow amount at any time through internet and the maintainers can control the parameters of the electricity meters if necessary. The meter monitoring task can be done at the management department by using this system. What should be emphasized is that the operational cost of EMMNet is relatively low, compared with other existing remote meter monitoring systems based on GPRS. Meanwhile, EMMNets can realize automatic charge if they are connected to bank systems.}", "textBeforeTable": "Table 3.
