Living room is very cozy and is the best place for relaxing. It is big and many cards and board games are provided. Free sauna room is recommended after a long day walk. Free canola oil can get at the reception. The staff are very helpful. 100% Bhathra, Wed 22 Apr 2015 Great spot. Well set out hostel. Good facilities.Friendly staff who were generally helpful. Improvements: perhaps bench in front of food cubby holes to take bags out to sort and not a table where people are sitting. Edges of carpet in bedroom were not clean next to walls. 90% Lynette, Mon 13 Apr 2015 pratiques environnementales: acceptables car \u00e0 force", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
