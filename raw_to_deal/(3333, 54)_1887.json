For general information about zone installation and related operations, see Chapter\u00a019, About Installing, Halting, Cloning, and Uninstalling Non-Global Zones (Overview). This chapter describes how to install and boot a non-global zone. A method for using cloning to install a zone on the same system is also provided. Other tasks associated with installation, such as halting, rebooting, and uninstalling zones, are also addressed. The procedure to completely delete a zone from a system is also provided.

How to Boot a Zone in Single-User Mode Installing and Booting Zones Use the zoneadm command described in the zoneadm(1M) man page to perform installation tasks for a non-global zone. You must be the global administrator to perform the zone installation. The examples in this chapter use the zone name and zone path established in Configuring, Verifying, and Committing a Zone. (Optional) How to Verify a Configured Zone Before It Is Installed You can verify a zone prior to installing it. If you skip this procedure, the verification is performed automatically when you install the zone. You must be the global administrator in the global zone to perform this procedure. Become superuser, or assume the Primary Administrator role. To create the role and assign the role to a user, see Using the Solaris Management Tools With RBAC (Task Map) in System Administration Guide: Basic Administration.
