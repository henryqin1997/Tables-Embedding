When calling the CDeferredCommand::Invoke member function, the calling application gets an interface pointer that is reference-counted, and the CCmdQueue object also holds a reference count on the deferred command. Calling the IDeferredCommand::Cancel member function takes the deferred command off the command queue and thus reduces the reference count by one. Once taken off the queue, the command cannot be put back on the queue. A CDeferredCommand object represents a single deferred command and exposes the IDeferredCommand interface as well as other methods that permit time checks and actual execution. A CDeferredCommand object contains a reference to the CCmdQueue object on which it is queued. Deferred commands are queued by calls to methods on the IQueueCommand interface and are exposed by the filter graph manager and by some filters. A successful call to one of these methods returns an IDeferredCommand interface representing the queued command.
