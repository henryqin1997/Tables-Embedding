Prerequisite More information Management point Clients will contact a management point to download client policy, to locate content, and to connect to the Application Catalog. Important If clients cannot access a management point, they cannot use the Application Catalog. Distribution point Before applications can be deployed to clients, you must have at least one distribution point in the hierarchy. By default, the site server has a distribution point site role enabled during a standard installation. The number and location of distribution points will vary according to the specific requirements of your enterprise. For more information about how to install distribution points and manage content, see Configuring Content Management in Configuration Manager. Client settings Many client settings control how applications are installed on the client and the end user experience on the client. These client settings include the following: Computer Agent Computer Restart Software Deployment User and Device Affinity For more information about these client settings, see About Client Settings in Configuration Manager.
