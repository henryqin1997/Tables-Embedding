Camille passed around a sheet prepared by Dr Robert W Matthews, Dept of Entomology, University of Georgia, Athens GA 30602.\u00a0 She used that laboratory experiment as a guide for a fascinating demonstration of the strength of bess beetles, which are easily located on the floor of oak forests during the fall of the year.\u00a0 Or, you can purchase a Bess Bug Penny-Pull Kit:\u00a0 http://shop.store.yahoo.com/insectlore/besbugpenkit.html.\u00a0 Camille rigged a harness for these beetles using dental floss, attached the other end to a petri dish, and put pennies in the dish to see how many pennies the beetles could pull while under harness.\u00a0 It was important to have a rough surface [paper towels], so that the beetles could develop traction.\u00a0 She described measuring the speed, amount of weight pulled, and the distance traveled, as well as computing the coefficient of friction, work done, and power.\u00a0 This is quite a novel illustration of basic ideas of mechanics, using beetle power! Amazingly, the beetles could exert a force of more than 20 times their body weight in pulling this dish across the table.\u00a0 For for a U-tube video see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NbBMvJoiU4\u00a0 But, does this also work with cockroaches??, 7184=19 February 2002: Fred Schaal (Morgan Park HS Math -- Visitor) Redwings and Grackles On a long bike ride last weekend, Fred was surprised that he didn't see any Redwings and Grackles, which habitually arrive here in the early Spring.\u00a0 Can anybody explain this?\u00a0 [It may be that 15 February is still part of meteorological winter, and even though there is a warming spell here, that may not be sufficient to attract these birds.], 20494=4 May 2004: Walter McDonald passed around the article Internal 'clock' steers butterflies, scientists find by Mark Sappenfield (Christian Science Monitor).\u00a0 For more information, see the CBC: Canadian Broadcasting news article:\u00a0 Monarchs need clock and compass to navigate:\u00a0 http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090924/full/news.2009.946.html., 5632=21 November 2000: Chris Etapa (Gunsaulus Academy) brought us a surprise (something alive!) in a cardboard (Xerox paper) box. It was something from her \"zoo\" at home, and she uses it to teach geometry, observation skills, what animals want versus what they need, etc. She then introduced us to Pythagoras, a male, red-tail boa constrictor snake, about 5 years old and 6 feet long!! Chris said that if she would turn off the heater that keeps him warm, he would go into hibernation for about 3 months. He sheds his skin in one piece, and collecting and saving the shed skins provides a record of growth., 11929=10 December 2002: Jyotiben Desai [Du Sable HS]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dinosaurs for Sale\u00a0 Jyotiben concluded our semester's program by telling us how to put together dinosaurs that are available from Walgreens\u00ae, as well as Dollar Stores\u00ae.\u00a0 thin slabs of wood contain different parts of the dinosaurs, that have been stamped out, which can easily be pushed out and reassembled to make small standing figures., 2735=28 April 1998\u00a0 Fred J Schaal [Lane Technical High School] Fred asked why slugs leave a trail of material [slime] when they cross the tennis courts, and why that trail is thicker in some spots than in others. The answer is that the leave as much slime as they must in order to proceed, and if their travel becomes more sluggish [so to speak] they leave more slime. Also, slugs respond to certain chemicals [NaCl: salt] by producing more slime., 4385=05 September 2000: Lilla Green (Hartigan School) brought bugs to class! She had crickets in a plastic box, along with a little lettuce and a leaf hopper (brought in by a student) and a fish in a small bowl. Lilla told us how these are examples that serve as a source of activities at her school resource center. The crickets are used for salamander food! An inspiration for each of us. It doesn't take much to involve our students. Thanks, Lilla!, 255=28 April 1998\u00a0 Chris Raymond [Gallistel Language Academy] Chris described a project in her school of raising butterflies from larvae, and observing their metamorphosis from the caterpillar [pupa] stage into full adulthood within a few weeks. There is a fairly large enclosed region [about 2 meters on a side] in her classroom., 9580=05 November 2002: Frana Allen [Skinner School]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SQUIRMY WORM Frana Allen (the inimitable) then led us through an exercise, starting with the culinary version involving gummy worms and \"soil\" made from crumbled Oreos\u00ae she bought on sale. Then, having gotten us interested and having touched the gummy worms, she brought out the live night crawlers, with rubber gloves for the ultra-squeamish (\"But the worms should be more afraid of us than we are of them\", many of us thought.) We did two types of experiment with the live worms: reaction to different surfaces (sandpaper, waxed paper. white paper, brown paper, and warm wet cloth) and light (using a flashlight as our research instrument). There seemed to be agreement that the worms tried to leave the dry rough surface of the sandpaper, and seemed more relaxed on the wet towel -- which is consistent with their native underground habitat. Three cheers for your down-to earth, phenomenological activity, Frana!., 21013=07 March 2006: Lee Slick (Morgan Park HS, retired)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cricket Temperature Lee described how to estimate the temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) from the frequency of cricket chirps. (handout by Tom Skilling, Chicago Tribune, February 5, 2006.\u00a0 http://wgntv.trb.com/news/weather/weblog/wgnweather/archives/ATW020506SUN.jpg ) Count the number of chirps\u00a0 a cricket\u00a0makes during\u00a0 a 15 second interval, and add 39 to that number.\u00a0 You get a remarkably accurate reading. This works because crickets are \u201ccold blooded\u201d (poikilothermic), so that their metabolism (and thus frequency of chirping) will increase as the temperature increases. For more details see the website Oecanthus:\u00a0 Pulse Distribution and Temperature Effects:\u00a0 http://facstaff.unca.edu/tforrest/ASA 98 Seattle/sld005.htm. Keep on chirping!\u00a0 Thanks, Lee!, 10714=19 November 2002: Winifred Malvin [Carver Elementary] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Investigating Snails Winifred passed around a handout Investigating Land Snails, which was recently developed by Gordon R Will, Science Consultant, Chicago Teacher's Center, Northeastern Illinois University. She applied some of the ideas in the handout, which related to the behavior of \"land snails\", whereas she used\u00a0 \"water snails\".\u00a0\u00a0 Winnie placed one snail in each of 6 plastic dishes, which contained about 100 mL of water, along with a small patch of lettuce.\u00a0\u00a0We added a small amount of crushed ice [20 mL, say] to stimulate the snails into motion.\u00a0 However, we were unable to get these snails to \"wake up\", so that we were unable to perform experiments with them.\u00a0 [Perhaps we should contact a snail personal trainer.]\u00a0 The idea was to determine the strength of the snails, by seeing how much weight they could pull [determined directly\u00a0 in \"paper clip\" mass units, which are easily convertible into grams].\u00a0 Interesting topic, good ideas --- nice shot, Winifred!, 8149=22 October 2002: Erma Lee [Williams School]\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Animals or Whatever? Erma passed around a zoo book to groups of four teachers.\u00a0 We each picked an animal (or whatever), and wrote down 3 facts about it gleaned from the book, which we shared with the class.\u00a0 For example, elephants are the largest land animal, apes have arms that are longer than legs, skunks can spray 15 feet, and lions 12 feet in length became extinct in North America in 8000 BC, etc.\u00a0 We will continue this exercise later in the term to learn and discuss interesting facts about animals as diverse as whales and butterflies.\u00a0 Comment by Porter Johnson:\u00a0 You can learn a lot at the zoo, as evidenced by these lyrics excerpted from the song At the Zoo by Simon & Garfunkel\u00a0 http://www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/raisinghelen/atthezoo.htm., 15152=06 May 2003: Ed Scanlon [Morgan Park HS, Biology]\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dissecting Owl Pellets Ed passed out a handout that contained the following information:, 3207=01 February 2000: Therese Donatello (St Edwards School) reviewed skeletal/bone issues; eg. hemoglobin from marrow, hinged joints (like a door), gliding joints (vertebrae), ball & socket (thigh/hip). They need attachment. How are they held together, and how do they work? (handout) We then used an index card, paper clip, two pieces of string and some tape to build a model of the leg/foot interaction. We discovered that when the muscle (string) in front of the \"ankle\" contracts, the one behind stretches (and vice versa). A simple but effective way to build understanding!, 3819=11 April 2000: Pam Moy (Morgan Park HS) gave us a handout titled \"All About Mike.\" Mike (circa 1945) was a chicken with its head cut off that didn't seem to miss his head, and behaved pretty much like any other chicken, except feeding and watering was done with an eyedropper. He lived 18 months in good health, going from 2.5 lb to about 8 lb! See the website http://www.miketheheadlesschicken.org for details. Interesting biology here, about how this was possible. Thanks, Pam!, 4855=12 September 2000: Glenda Ellis (Williams School) marked a 30 meter course around the perimeter of the room, gave us stop watches, and we measured the time it took for each of us to walk the course. From this, the walking speeds for each of us were calculated and compared. Speeds ranged from 1.20 to 1.67 meters/second. Ken Schug recalculated the speeds in miles/hour! And we then had an interesting discussion about how our speeds compare with walking and running speeds of various animals:\u00a0}", "lastModified": "Sat, 21 Jul 2012 17:01:59 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "the word for \"butterfly\" is strikingly different in many closely related languages: Comments by Porter Johnson: Ever attentive to scatology, Fred Schaal asked for the word for butterfly droppings [frass, from German fressen = \"devour\"].
