See below for how to do that. Domain: radi08.segad.lab.sjc.redhat.com Kerberos Realm: RADI08.SEGAD.LAB.SJC.REDHAT.COM If you're on the Red Hat internal network, there's an Active Directory server available for testing. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether this can be made available to the public at this time. In addition this works poorly for testing if you're on a VPN. Because the VPN connection must be up before the Active Directory domain is accessible. Red Hat Active Directory Test Bed Make sure to Setup a Local Caching Server and verify that the access is AOK. Note that the Active Directory will need to be appropriately discoverable via DNS, as it would be \"in real life\". If DNS is not setup for your Active Directory domain, you can also use steps 8 and 9 in the linked setup instructions above to make DNS work appropriately on your test machine for your domain. You can setup your own personal Active Directory domain.

Install bind like so:  # yum install caching-nameserver After the install completes, edit /etc/named.conf and add the following line to your main options section:  forwarders { 8.8.8.8; /* ... or the address of your ISP DNS server */ }; And add this to the end of /etc/named.conf. In the example below 'ad.example.com' is the Active Directory domain, and 'A.B.C.D' are the octets of the IPv4 address that the Active Directory controller is listening on. Note that in the second line, you use the first three octets of this IPv4 address in reverse.  zone \"ad.example.com\" { type stub; masters { A.B.C.D; }; }; zone \"C.B.A.in-addr.arpa\" { type stub; masters { A.B.C.D; }; }; For the above Red Hat Active Directory Test Bed, the snippet to add is as follows. You can also use this as a guide for how to munge the IPv4 address on the second line.  zone \"radi08.segad.lab.sjc.redhat.com\" { type stub; masters { 10.14.5.60; }; }; zone \"5.14.10.in-addr.arpa\" { type stub; masters { 10.14.5.60; }; }; Restart the named service with:  # systemctl restart named.service", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
