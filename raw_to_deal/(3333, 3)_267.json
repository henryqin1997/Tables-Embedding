Alloy (#86) boasted an impressive 35% gain in catalog and online product sales largely because of its September 2001 acquisition of BMX supplies title Dan\u2019s Comp and its March 2002 purchase of teen girl\u2019s apparel book Girlfriends L.A. Alloy\u2019s December 2002 acquisition of Old Glory Boutique Distributing will give the catalog a similar bump this year. Meanwhile, new entrant to the list 1-800-Flowers.com (#82) increased its sales significantly by acquiring The Popcorn Factory in May 2002., 4522=Conversely, women\u2019s apparel cataloger/retailer The J. Jill Group (#72) grew direct sales 4% last year. That growth can be considered disappointing, however, in light of the company\u2019s 26% circulation hike in 2002, to 78 million catalogs mailed., 5065=For instance, sales at multititle apparel and home goods mailer Blair Corp. (#33) dipped 2% last year. But its net income more than doubled, from $9.3 million in 2001 to $19.1 million last year., 8638=Acquisitions aided some of the computer resellers. Most, if not all, of PC Connection\u2019s (#20) 4% sales growth last year can be credited to the company\u2019s April 2002 purchase of MoreDirect, an e-procurement provider that targets large corporations. For instance, PC Connection\u2019s total fourth-quarter sales rose 18% in 2002. But if you exclude MoreDirect, year-over-year sales for the quarter actually fell 8%., 9410=Conventional wisdom holds that business-to-business marketers are slower to feel the effects of an economic downturn than their consumer counterparts, and slower to recover. Indeed, of the 51 companies on this year\u2019s Catalog Age 100 that sell primarily or exclusively to businesses, 16 \u2014 or 31% \u2014 had lower direct sales in 2002 than the previous year. In comparison, 13 of the 49 consumer marketers, or 27%, saw direct sales fall last year., 10076=Collectively the companies in this year\u2019s Catalog Age 100 increased their direct sales 4.6%, to $118.39 billion. That\u2019s a welcome change from last year. The catalogers that made last year\u2019s list actually suffered a collective 1.9% decline in sales in 2001., 5285=The consumer marketers on the Catalog Age 100 had their own ups and downs. But some of the companies that posted lower sales in 2002 than in 2001 actually performed better last year than the year before., 6202=And despite a flood in October that destroyed its headquarters and central network, Tessco Technologies (#63) managed to increase sales 8%. The marketer of wireless communications supplies credits much of its growth to its affinity-marketing programs, in which it sells cell phones, pagers, and related services directly and \u201cinvisibly\u201d to consumers on behalf of manufacturers and local dealers., 644=With sales of $120 million in 2002, gifts and home decor cataloger Miles Kimball fell off the list as well. Last year\u2019s #95 saw sales fall 13%; the company, which was acquired by Blyth earlier this year, shut its Exposures Home title in late 2001., 3122=Another marketer of outdoor sporting gear, The Sportsman\u2019s Guide (#81), also increased its sales, by 6%. The cataloger\u2019s Buyer\u2019s Club is responsible for at least some of that growth. Introduced in fall 2000, the club now has approximately 300,000 members, who pay $29.99 a year to receive discounts and special offers. Sportsman\u2019s Guide executives have said that members spend two to three times as much with the company as nonmembers. Sportsman\u2019s Guide has also returned to its value-pricing roots, which has no doubt helped the company during this recession., 7799=The industrial supplies market fared somewhat worse. As David Sandler, executive vice president/chief operating officer of MSC Industrial Direct Co. (#29) said in an April earnings call, \u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that the economic recovery has not yet reached the industrial sector\u2026.

In those cases, or when companies would provide only approximate sales, an asterisk indicates that the figure is an estimate.

Several companies report their results on a fiscal year different from the calendar year. When the fiscal year varied from the calendar year by more than one month, Catalog Age backed out the financial data to obtain calendar-year sales., 8583=Total 2002 direct sales of the Catalog Age 100: $118.39 billion ($118,385.0 million)}", "lastModified": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 14:11:34 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "The Catalog Age 100 is dominated by several product categories: apparel, gifts, home goods, computer-related products, general merchandise, sporting goods, and industrial/maintenance, repair, and operating supplies. Below is a breakdown by product category of companies ranked in this year\u2019s chart. Because some of the catalogers listed sell products in multiple categories, the total adds up to more than 100: WHO SELLS WHAT In two cases \u2014 Crosstown Traders and Sears \u2014 year-over-year comparisons include the sales of their core catalogs\u2019 former owners, Arizona Mail Order and Lands\u2019 End. For parent companies such as Staples and Mattel, the sales figures listed are for their catalog/Internet divisions only. Likewise, for cataloger/retailers such as The Sharper Image and The J. Jill Group, sales figures are only for the company\u2019s direct divisions, unless otherwise indicated. Several computer and industrial supplies mailers, including Dell Computer Corp., Fisher Scientific International, and Corporate Express North America, use direct response or telemarketing to augment or complement their catalogs. The Catalog Age 100 sales figures include all direct channels for those marketers because the catalog remains their main sales vehicle. Similarly, sales generated through electronic media are included for both consumer and business-to-business marketers. Wherever possible, sales are net of sales taxes and other extraordinary fees such as personalization. Because of accounting differences, some figures may include that extra revenue. Many companies that make money on shipping and handling record the fees as sales rather than as a reduction in expenses.
