He has been writing about and reviewing consumer technology and software since 2000. See full bio, 2919=Now, if your subject isn't moving rapidly, the 1080/30p resolution is worth using because scenes actually look high-definition. There's a bit too much sharpening that causes ringing artifacts, but that's mostly noticeable when viewing at large sizes such as on an HDTV. Color is good and exposure is generally OK, too, but we found the Playfull clipped highlights in bright lighting--indoors and out. Low-light video, while noisy, is pretty good without a lot of detail loss. The Playfull doesn't have autofocus or macro focus, so no close-up shooting; its fixed-focus lens needs to be at least 3.3 feet from your subject. It also has nothing but a 4x digital zoom, which I recommend using sparingly. I've seen worse results from a digital zoom, but it's still not good., 2027=As we've said many times before, a pocket video camera such as the Playfull can't compete with a full-fledged HD camcorder costing hundreds of dollars more. There are other factors that go into creating great video beyond high resolution. For its size and price, though, the video is very good. The default resolution is 720p at 30 frames per second. At this setting, clips look soft and not what I would consider \"HD\" but more like good DVD-quality standard definition. If you're shooting moving subjects, like someone running, you'll likely see ghosting trailing behind. Quickly panning the camera will result in noticeable judder. The same is true of the 1080/30p setting. However, these things are typical with minicamcorders and changing to the 720/60p setting helps some to smooth things out.}", "lastModified": "Sat, 01 Aug 2015 15:34:07 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "", "textAfterTable": "As we've said many times before, a pocket video camera such as the Playfull can't compete with a full-fledged HD camcorder costing hundreds of dollars more.
