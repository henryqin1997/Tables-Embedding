Support for these high-speed interfaces will therefore be re-evaluated in 2 to 3 years time, and a future version of this standard created when a large proportion of available embedded CPUs have these or other high-speed interfaces that are available at the time., 31230=There are also other options such as the use of a MAX2322 RS232 buffer IC.}", "textBeforeTable": "Table of EOMA-68 pinouts Note also: for factory-install purposes, cards are of course permitted to use all and any pins, ports or methods required to carry out factory-installs and testing, as long as after factory-install the 68 pins are capable of EOMA-68 compliance. Examples of such uses would include a test-bench with an SD/MMC interface for first firmware boot, a JTAG interface and other diagnostics. Pin 22 is available for implementations to use for any special non-EOMA68-compliant purpose. I/O Boards MUST NOT rely on any specific card implementation providing any specific functionality on pin 22. Examples of appropriate uses for Pin 22 include start-up selection of a boot mode that is specific to a processor so that it is more convenient for a factory install to be able to re-flash and test an Operating System without needing to open up the case. Inappropriate uses are for example using Pin 22 as a 9th GPIO or as a One-Wire Bus, because not all I/O Boards will provide this exact same functionality. The option for a CPU Card to provide USB3 is also available, if a given system has it. If, however, a particular system does not have USB3, the pins must not be used for other purposes, and must be left unconnected (floating). Additionally, I/O Boards must not use the unused pins for any other purpose and must leave them unconnected (floating). This is to ensure that automatic down-negotiation of USB2 occurs correctly and that damage does", "textAfterTable": "Start-up procedure It is required that all pins be disabled (floating tri-state) with the exception of the I2C Bus, the 5.0v Power and the Ground Pins. I2C Bus Master is then enabled, to search for an I2C EEPROM at address 0xA2. This EEPROM contains Linux Kernel \"Device Tree\" data, which specifies the devices available on the motherboard, as well as the actual pin-outs. The exact format of the EEPROM data is yet to be decided. One important aspect of reading the I2C EEPROM is that the CPU card can then correctly access and initialise on-board devices. It also defines the purpose and use of the GPIO pins (if any are required). Also, the format of the LCD data is specified. For example, the pinout diagram on this page assumes 24-pin RGB TTL, but some motherboards may have LCD panels which only have an 18-pin RGB/TTL interface. The data in the I2C EEPROM therefore provides clear specifications on all the motherboard's peripherals. Discussion of the startup procedure is here on arm-netbooks Future Versions All LCD and GPIO pins must be tri-state floating in order that future versions of this standard can provide faster (or merely alternative) interfaces. At the time of writing (2011), the interfaces in the 1.0 Specification are \"Lowest Common Denominator\" yet are still present across the majority of 2011's powerful embedded SoCs (OMAP4440, Enyxos4210, Tegra 3, iMX53, iMX6, Allwinner A10, A20 etc.) However, in the future,", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
