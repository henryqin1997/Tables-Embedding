In giving each selected item a weighting, the following chart shows the overall rating of difficulty and frustration for each item. Problematic items identified are (in order, with most difficult/frustrating first): Complex page layouts Content that becomes unreadable when enlarged Poor contrast CAPTCHA - images presenting text used to verify that you are a human user Pop-up windows or dialog boxes Complex or difficult forms Too many links or navigation items Missing or improper headings Poor keyboard accessibility Complex data tables Lack of skip to main content links Complex page layouts were by far identified as the most problematic item. While 69% of respondents found skip links very or somewhat useful, lack of skip links was the least problematic item identified. 47.5% of respondents always or often use a keyboard, yet they also found poor keyboard accessibility a low impact issue.

Respondents used a wide variety of assistive technologies, with most respondents using multiple technologies.
