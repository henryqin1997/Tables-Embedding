This guarantees that the rational function is, in one sense, close to the given function. A stronger requirement for a good rational approximation would be to require that the rational function be close to the given function over the entire interval. This type of rational approximation is produced by MiniMaxApproximation. This approximation is so named because it minimizes the maximum value of the relative error between the approximation and the given function. This means that minimax approximation to a given function is the rational function of the given degree that minimizes the maximum value of the quantity over the interval under consideration. Note that the term minimax approximation is also sometimes used for the rational function that minimizes the absolute error rather than the relative error used here.", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
