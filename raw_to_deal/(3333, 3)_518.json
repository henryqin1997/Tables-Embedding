Step 1: Obtain the Necessary Skills Although the minimum education needed to become a receptionist is a high school diploma, many employers prefer to hire applicants with some experience and administrative skills. Certificate programs in clerical studies or office assistance are available at many community, technical and vocational colleges. These programs can usually be completed in about a year and consist of training in data entry, switchboard operation, word processing, payroll accounting, business math, customer service, office management and specific software programs like Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. It's worth noting that some companies prefer to hire individuals with bachelor's degrees. Communication, business and education are all applicable majors. However, it is relatively easy to find jobs without this requirement. Success Tips: Focus on obtaining proficiency in word processing programs and other common office software. Students who do not wish to enroll in a formal education program can find training online for some of the more commonly used office software. For example, tutorials and webinars in the Microsoft Office software programs are available through the Microsoft website free of charge. Develop office and communication skills by volunteering.
