To define columns and constraints", "textAfterTable": "Note:On Windows, all object names, such as databases and tables, are converted to lowercase. In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, the case is preserved. More on case- senstivity in other lessons. Here, we actually specify the character set and collation to use: Code Sample: CREATE DATABASE sakilakubili DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 DEFAULT COLLATE latin1_bin; Deleting Databases A database is dropped via the DROP DATABASE statement. Syntax DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] <database name> Code Sample: DROP DATABASE sakilakubili; Warning: When a database is dropped, the tables and their data stored in that database are also deleted. Exercise extreme caution executing the DROP DATABASE command. Creating Tables We will now create additional tables in the sakila database using CREATE TABLE. First, we must specify the database we will be working with. The USE database sets the default database to which further commands will be applied. In other words, the USE command selects an active database among several databases under MySQL management. Tables provide a structure for storing and securing the data. All data exists within the structure of the tables, and tables are grouped inside of the database. In addition to creating tables, you can also modify the table definitions or drop the tables from the database. The CREATE TABLE statement includes appropriate column definitions and constraints to be used for the entity associated", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
