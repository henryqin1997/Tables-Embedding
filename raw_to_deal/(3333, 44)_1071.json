The drill program, funded by Badger Minerals Ltd, was designed to test several 3D IP chargeability anomalies, some of which were also geochemical anomalies. During the program four holes totaling 727.87 metres were drilled to test the Bolas, Trojan, Raven and Eagle anomalies/showings. The chargeability anomalies are now explained by pyrite mineralization. While intrusive rocks were encountered in the drilling there was little evidence of wide spread alteration typical of a porphyry system. Trace chalcopyrite was observed in several places in the drill core. Selected assaying has confirmed some anomalous but no potentially economic copper values. Based on visual inspection of the core, which tested several wide spaced targets, and confirmed by assay results, Badger elected to discontinue funding of the planned 2,000 metre program. As a result of early termination, Badger has not yet completed the $250,000 property expenditure to earn a 25% interest. Should Badger not complete the property expenditure by November 15, 2014, the company will retain its 100% interest. No further expenditures are planned at this time. There are several MINFILE documented showings of gold and platinum on the northern half of the claim block and Goldcliff is investigating an early stage program to examine some of these targets., 7801=Goldcliff Resources Corp. announced that the annual general meeting to be held on April 29, 2015, to approve and authorize an alteration of the Company's Articles to give the board of directors the authority to alter the authorized share structure of the company., 8410=Goldcliff Resources Corp., Annual General Meeting, Apr 29, 2015., at 10:00 Pacific Standard Time.
