Somatic delusions involve a false belief about the functioning of the body. Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by a belief that the body is deformed or defective in a specific way. Apraxia is the inability to carry out motor activities.", "Therefore, the nurse first must establish a trusting relationship to elicit the client's feelings and thoughts. The anorexic client may spend many hours discussing nutrition or handling and preparing food in an effort to stall or avoid eating food; the nurse shouldn't reinforce her preoccupation with food. Although cultural stereotypes may play a prominent role in anorexia nervosa, discussing these factors isn't the first action the nurse should take. Exploring the reasons why the client doesn't eat would increase her emotional investment in food and eating.", "B Rationale: Clients with anorexia can refuse food to the point of cardiac damage. Tube feedings and I.V. infusions are ordered to prevent such damage. The nurse is informing her of her treatment options. Option A doesn't tell the client about the consequences of choosing not to eat. Because a client with an eating disorder usually has a distorted self-concept and low self-esteem, options C and D are incorrect because they won't change the client's self-image.", "A Rationale: Caffeine should be avoided because it increases urine output. Clients need to maintain adequate fluid intake to avoid lithium toxicity. Clients should remain on medication even though they're feeling better. Don't limit or increase salt intake because the kidneys will hold onto lithium or excrete it if salt intake varies.", "C Rationale: Both benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, and barbiturates, such as phenobarbital, are addictive, controlled substances. All the other drugs listed aren't addictive substances.", "C Rationale: Establishing a consistent eating plan and monitoring the client's weight are important for this disorder. The family should be included in the client's care. The client should be monitored during meals \u0097 not given privacy. Exercise must be limited and supervised.", "B Rationale: The goal of crisis intervention is the resolution of an immediate problem. The client must learn to solve his own issues. Although some clients do enter long-term therapy or are admitted to an acute care facility, long-term therapy isn't the goal of crisis intervention.", "A Rationale: Option A is the most supportive statement. The nurse acknowledges the client's traumatic experience and pain as well as encourages her to talk. Option B ignores the client's need for reassurance. Option C indicates that the nurse isn't capable of helping the client deal with therapeutic issues. Option D could make the client feel guilty for being upset about the trauma.", "B Rationale: Stimulants produce mood swings, weight loss, and tachycardia. The other symptoms indicate CNS depression.", "A Rationale: MAO inhibitor antidepressants when combined with a number of drugs can cause life-threatening hypertensive crisis. It's imperative that a client checks with his physician and pharmacist before taking any other medications. Activity doesn't need to be limited. Blood dyscrasias aren't a common problem with MAO inhibitors. Aspirin and NSAIDs are safe to take with MAO inhibitors.", "B Rationale: The correct answer is waxy flexibility, which is defined as retaining any position that the body has been placed in. Somatic delusions involve a false belief about the functioning of the body. Neologisms are invented meaningless words. Nihilistic delusions are false ideas about self, others, or the world.", "B Rationale: Total abstinence is the only effective treatment for alcoholism. Psychotherapy, attendance at AA meetings, and aversion therapy are all adjunctive therapies that can support the client in his efforts to abstain.", "A Rationale: Displacement is a defense mechanism by which the client discharges anger and rejection in a manner that he perceives as safe \u0097 in this situation, by displacing anger over work and car problems onto family members. Projection involves attributing one's own emotions to others. Regression is a retreat to earlier levels of developmental behavior to relieve anxiety. Sublimation is the socially acceptable discharge of psychic energy or anger, such as through exercise or some other productive activity.", "B Rationale: A sore throat and fever are indications of an infection caused by agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening complication of clozapine. Because of the risk of agranulocytosis, white blood cell (WBC) counts are necessary weekly, not monthly. If the WBC count drops below 3,000/\u00ecl, the medication must be stopped. Hypotension may occur in clients taking this medication. Warn the client to stand up slowly to avoid dizziness from orthostatic hypotension. The medication should be continued, even when symptoms have been controlled. If the medication must be stopped, it should be slowly tapered over 1 to 2 weeks and only under the supervision of a physician.", "D Rationale: Extrapyramidal effects and the muscle rigidity induced by antipsychotic medications is caused by a low level of dopamine. Dopamine receptor agonists stimulate dopamine receptors and thereby reduce rigidity. They don't affect norepinephrine or acetylcholine.", "B Rationale: Studies indicate that children who are rejected by their peers are more likely to behave aggressively. Aggression and conduct disorder are represented in all socioeconomic groups. Schizophrenia and an overbearing mother haven't been associated with aggression or conduct disorder", "B Rationale: Memory loss is the primary symptom of dementia. Loss of short-term memory (retaining new information) is more prominent, but long-term memory (recollection of events that occurred in the past) may also be affected. Psychosis, neurosis, and loss of impulse control aren't symptoms of dementia.", "C Rationale: Establishing a consistent eating plan and monitoring the client's weight are important for this disorder. The family should be included in the client's care. The client should be monitored during meals \u0097 not given privacy. Exercise must be limited and supervised.", "C Rationale: Bulimic behavior is generally a maladaptive coping response to stress and underlying issues. The client must identify anxiety-causing situations that stimulate the bulimic behavior and then learn new ways of coping with the anxiety. Controlling shopping for large amounts of food isn't a goal early in treatment. Managing eating impulses and replacing them with adaptive coping mechanisms can be integrated into the plan of care after initially addressing stress and underlying issues. Eating three meals per day isn't a realistic goal early in treatment.", "B Rationale: Manipulative behavior and inability to tolerate frustration are important assessment clues. Low self-esteem \u0097 not inflated feelings of self-worth \u0097 are more likely in clients with personality disorders. The other choices are more likely to be assessed in clients with eating disorders", "A Rationale: The nurse should designate times during which the client can focus on compulsive behavior or obsessive thoughts. Frequency of the compulsive behavior should be reduced gradually, not rapidly. The nurse shouldn't call attention to or prevent the behavior; doing so may cause pain and terror in the client. Encouraging the client to verbalize anxieties may help distract his attention from the compulsive behavior.", "A Rationale: As individuals become older, their livers metabolize drugs at a slower rate. Cumulative effects can occur and increase the risk of adverse effects. Elderly clients typically need lower doses not higher. Level of activity typically doesn't affect a person's reaction to medication", "B Rationale: Antipsychotic medications exert an effect on brain neurotransmitters that lowers the seizure threshold and can, therefore, increase the risk of seizure activity. Antipsychotics don't affect insulin production or coagulation time. Heart failure isn't an adverse effect of antipsychotic agents", "A Rationale: Signs and symptoms of PTSD include hyperalertness, sleep disturbances, exaggerated startle, survival guilt, and memory impairment. Also, the client relives the traumatic event through dreams and recollections. Hostility, violent behavior, and anorexia aren't usual signs or symptoms", "Rationale: Circulatory as well as skin and nerve damage can occur within 15 minutes. Checking every hour, 2 hours, or 8 hours isn't often enough and could result in permanent damage to the client's extremities.", "A Rationale: Getting the client to leave the house is the goal of therapy. Sweating palms is a sign of tolerable, mild anxiety. Shortness of breath indicates intolerable, moderate- to high-anxiety. Using anxiolytic agents to control anxiety regularly isn't desirable because of their addictive potential. Standing outside the door and holding onto the doorknob may be an early intervention, but it isn't the ultimate goal.", "D Rationale: A compulsion is a repetitive act or impulse. Carrying out a compulsion helps a person to reduce anxiety unconsciously. An obsessive-compulsive client doesn't want to call attention to himself and can't control his thoughts. This client's priority is to reduce anxiety, not maintain the safety of his home.", "B Rationale: According to the DSM-IV, schizoaffective disorder refers to clients suffering from schizophrenia with elements of a mood disorder, either mania or depression. The prognosis is generally better than for the other types of schizophrenia, but it's worse than the prognosis for a mood disorder alone. Option A is incorrect because personality disorders and psychotic illness aren't listed together on the same axis. Option C is incorrect because schizophrenia is a major thought disorder and the question asks for elements of another disorder. Option D is incorrect because clients with schizoaffective disorder aren't suffering from schizophrenia and an amnestic disorder.", "C Rationale: Haloperidol is the drug of choice for treating Tourette syndrome. Prozac, Luvox, and Paxil are antidepressants and aren't used to treat Tourette syndrome.", "D Rationale: The nurse should begin with the simplest interventions, such as pillows or snacks, before interventions that require greater skill, such as relaxation techniques. Sleep medication should be avoided whenever possible. At some point, the nurse should do a thorough sleep assessment, especially if common-sense interventions fail.", "B Rationale: Option B is correct because allowing a paranoid client to open his medication can help reduce suspiciousness. Option A is incorrect because the client doesn't know that it's his medication and he's obviously suspicious. Options C and D aren't supportive and don't offer the client reassurance.", "c. Rationale: Dextroamphetamine is a psychostimulant and acts on the CNS. It would increase anxiety and elevate mood. CNS depressants and antianxiety agents would worsen the symptoms of narcolepsy. Mood stabilizers aren't indicated for narcolepsy.", "D. Rationale: A reliable genetic marker hasn't been determined for schizophrenia. However, studies of twins and adopted siblings have strongly implicated a genetic predisposition. Since the mid-19th century, excessive dopamine activity in the brain has also been suggested as a causal factor. Communication and the family system have been studied as contributing factors in the development of schizophrenia. Therefore, a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors are thought to cause schizophrenia.", "4. the most therapeutic nusing communication technique is restatement.", "1. open-ended ?'s and silence are strategies used to encourag eclients to discuss their problem.", "4 this lets client focus on the emotion underlying the delusion but does not argue with it.", "Notify Physician if an increase brusing occurs", "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome. a rare but potentially fatal condition of antipsychotic medication.", "blocking the cholinergic activity in the CNS.", "A sore throat or fever.
