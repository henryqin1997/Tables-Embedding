Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions Both the Jevtana Injection and the diluent vials contain an overfill to compensate for liquid loss during preparation. Do not use PVC infusion containers and polyurethane infusions sets for preparation and administration of Jevtana infusion solution [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. \u200bJevtana Injection single-use vial requires two dilutions prior to administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Jevtana should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic medicinal products. Appropriate management of complications is possible only when the adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. Premedication is recommended prior to treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. The individual dosage of Jevtana is based on calculation of the Body Surface Area (BSA) and is 25 mg/m2 administered as a one-hour intravenous infusion every three weeks in combination with oral prednisone 10 mg administered daily throughout Jevtana treatment. General Dosing Information 2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Jevtana\u00ae is a microtubule inhibitor indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel-containing treatment regimen.

Dose Modifications for Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A inhibitors \u200bConcomitant drugs that are strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole) may increase plasma concentrations of cabazitaxel. Avoid the coadministration of Jevtana with these drugs. If patients require co-administration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, consider a 25% Jevtana dose reduction [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Premedication Premedicate at least 30 minutes prior to each dose of Jevtana with the following intravenous medications to reduce the risk and/or severity of hypersensitivity: antihistamine (dexchlorpheniramine 5 mg, or diphenhydramine 25 mg or equivalent antihistamine), corticosteroid (dexamethasone 8 mg or equivalent steroid), H2 antagonist (ranitidine 50 mg or equivalent H2 antagonist). Antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended and can be given orally or intravenously as needed. Administration Precautions Jevtana is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and caution should be exercised when handling and preparing Jevtana solutions, taking into account the use of containment devices, personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves), and preparation procedures. Please refer to Handling and Disposal (16.3). If Jevtana Injection, first diluted solution, or second (final) dilution for intravenous infusion should come into contact with the skin, immediately and thoroughly wash with soap and water.", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
