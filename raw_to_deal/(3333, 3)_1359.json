The Italian operation continued through May 1, 1945. Such German looting as had been conducted in Italy was investigated thoroughly by the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives (MFA&A) Branch of Allied Forces Headquarters and of the Allied Control Commission. Continuing liaison was established with these agencies, and the Director of the Unit was able to advise MFA&A officers on outstanding problems. The detailed interrogation of Mohnen revealed little new information concerning German art looting, and was chiefly productive for broad intelligence purposes., 161163=The Unit was composed of 10 field representatives and analysts.

The Director and the Operations Officer conducted interrogations of German and Swiss nationals who had been active in the official German interest, and collaborated with U.S. diplomatic representatives in endeavoring to persuade the Swiss Federal Government to make available to the Allies all information bearing on the subject. Pertinent information gained in the course of the German operation was presented to the Swiss federal political department for use of the federal customs and Office of Compensation.

On January 29, 1943, at the initiative of Waldo G. Leland, the Director of the American Council of Learned Societies, the ACLS Executive Committee appointed William B. Dinsmoor, President of the Archaeological Institute of America, to chair the ACLS Committee for the Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas. With the assistance of Charles R. Morey, Dinsmoor co-opted additional members to the committee, including Sumner McK. Crosby (Executive Secretary), Paul J. Sachs, Francis H. Taylor, John Walker, and others who later became involved in the work of the Roberts Commission. Together with the American Defense- Harvard Group, an ad hoc body of scholars with a similar goal, the ACLS Committee was instrumental in securing the formation of the Roberts Commission. The ACLS Committee\u2019s principal activity thereafter was the production of maps and handbooks identifying cultural materials in war areas, as well as the compiling of lists of monuments and artworks in areas likely to be occupied by elements of the United States armed forces. These materials were channeled to the War Department\u2019s Museum, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFA&A) Section through the Roberts Commission, with which the ACLS Committee remained closely associated throughout the war., 82149=Card File on Looted Art Objects, 1943\u20131946 (A1, Entry 28) [M1944, Roll 51], 67074=Published Works Relating to Cultural Materials in War Areas, 1943\u20131945 (A1, Entry 19) [M1944, Rolls 40\u201341], 89584=This series consists of a card file in which each card may contain some or all of the following information: alphabetical, alphanumeric, or numeric code designator; how and date the material arrived such as \u201cLondon Pouch XX 005-622 \u2013 22 June 1945\u201d; file where material may be found; and disposal of the material., 56198=Reports from Advisors Overseas, 1944\u20131945 (A1, Entry 13) [M1944, Rolls 33\u201334], 200863=The Inter-Allied Commission for the Protection and Restitution of Cultural Material (Vaucher Commission) was established in April 1944, under the chairmanship of Professor Paul Vaucher as a subcommission of the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education. Composed of representatives of the various Allied governments, the Vaucher Commission had as its purpose the study of problems relating to protection, restitution, and reparations, as well as the collection and organization of information relating to looting, for the eventual use of SHAEF and particularly of its Civil Affairs Section. The Vaucher Commission was the body with which the Roberts Commission\u2019s representatives abroad were at first chiefly concerned. The Vaucher Commission\u2019s secretariat functioned as a central bureau for information on looted objects for the use of Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives officers until its dissolution in November 1945.

Finley, Director of the National Gallery of Art and a member of the Commission of Fine Arts, was appointed Vice-Chairman of the Roberts Commission on August 20, 1943. He had been intimately involved in the Commission\u2019s establishment, and his files contain correspondence of this process. He served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Definition of Works of Cultural Value and Property and of the Subcommittee on Art Instruction in Military Government Schools, and with Huntington Cairns composed the Subcommittee on Administration.

Hell also suggested the appointment of \u201cThe American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in Europe\u201d to advise and work with the School of Military Government, and included a list of prospective members. During the war, the Commission was to work with the Army to protect works of cultural value in Allied-occupied areas, and to compile lists of property appropriated by the Axis powers. After the war, the Commission was to urge that restitution in kind be made by the Axis powers for such works as might have been destroyed, to compile a list of equivalent works in Axis countries that could be used as compensation, and to urge that property appropriated by Axis powers be returned. The Commission would be quartered in the National Gallery of Art in order to facilitate contact with the Departments of War and State.

This operation was continued intermittently through May 8, 1945. One case of major importance was developed by the Operations Officer during this period: namely, that of the art holdings of Alois Miedl, a German banker, speculator, and financial agent of Hermann G\u00f6ring.
