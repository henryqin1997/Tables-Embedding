If your music is stored on a portable device, like an\u00a0iPod,\u00a0Android smartphone\u00a0or\u00a0USB\u00a0stick, the front panel's\u00a0illuminated USB and Aux-in\u00a0gives them a direct connection to your car speakers via the DEH-X3500UI's sound system. The DEH-X3550UI's in-built amplifiers produce\u00a0pristine sound\u00a0delivered at 4 x 50W of pure, proven MOSFET power. If that isn't enough, you can always use the\u00a02 RCA pre-outs\u00a0to hook up another stereo component, like an extra amp for the rear speakers or a subwoofer, for example.
