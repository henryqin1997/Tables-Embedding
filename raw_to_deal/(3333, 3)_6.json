This set of gauges results from binding one gauge component to a data collection (WarehouseStockLevels). This data collection contains a row of data for each warehouse. Each row produces one gauge in the set. Notice that all gauges in the set share the same range values of minimum (0) and maximum (1500) with thresholds set at 500 and 1000 and 1500. Each gauge in the set displays the name of the warehouse that it represents and the stock metric for that warehouse in its bottom label., 228845=Shapes can also be specified using CSS style properties.

In the Structure window, right-click the dvt:mapPointTheme tag and choose Insert inside the dvt:mapPointTheme > Point Style Item. To add point style items to a map point theme to represent low, medium, and high data value ranges: The following procedure assumes that you have already created a geographic map with a point theme. In a point theme for a geographic map, if you do not specify a value for Category, you can still use the mapPointStyleItem child tags of the mapPointTheme tag to specify ranges of values (such as low, medium, and high) and the images that are to represent these ranges. If you do this, then each point will be represented by an image that identifies the range in which the data value for that point falls. Alternatively, if you specify a value for Category in the Create Point Map Theme dialog, then you should also create a set of point style items to determine a separate image that represents data points in each category. In this case, you do not use the minimum and maximum values in the point style item tags. Instead, you set the itemValue attribute of point style item tags to a value that matches entries in the data column that you", "textAfterTable": "If you defined a data value range for a low data value range in Steps 1 and 2, then repeat Steps 1 and 2 to define medium and high data value ranges with appropriate values. Note: The use of mapPointStyleItem child tags to customize the style of points is a declarative approach that lets you provide custom point images.
