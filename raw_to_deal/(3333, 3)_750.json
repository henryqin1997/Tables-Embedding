Primers should be designed with close adherence to the following criteria: A Hot-Start Taq polymerase is recommended to minimize the risk of non-specific PCR products. The control primers included in the kit are specific for the human or mouse RPL30 gene and can be used for either standard PCR or quantitative real-time PCR. If the user is performing ChIPs from another species, it is recommended that the user design the appropriate specific primers to DNA and determine the optimal PCR conditions.
