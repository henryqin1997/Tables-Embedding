Steve King of Kiron, mirrors Iowa's three other districts. There are some key differences, however. King's constituents, most of whom live in northwest Iowa, tend to be older and less racially diverse. But a somewhat higher percentage are Hispanic or Latino than elsewhere in the state. They also are more likely to be native Iowans. They enjoy the lowest unemployment rate of any of the four districts, but the median incomes they earn are about $5,000 less annually than in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd congressional districts. Slightly more also have incomes below the federal poverty level. While nearly the same percentage of 4th District residents are high school graduates as other Iowans, the percentage who also graduated from college with at least a bachelor's degree is the lowest rate among all districts and trails the statewide average by more than 6 percent.
