The grain of this dimension is the Date Pattern Type, which identifies the Calendar in the Oracle Business Analytics Warehouse.

For example, the natural account 1210 is mistakenly classified under 'AR' group account number when it should be classified under 'AP' group account number. When this happens, the ETL program will charge all the GL journal lines to account 1210 and try to reconcile these GL journal lines against subledger accounting records in the AR fact table (W_AR_XACT_F). Since these GL journal lines did not come from AR, the ETL program will not be able to find the corresponding subledger accounting records for these GL journal lines. In this case, the ETL program will insert 'Manual' records into the AR fact table because it thinks that these GL journal lines are 'Manual' journal entries created directly in the GL system charging to the AR accounts., 516057=For example, if REFRESH_PERIOD=MONTH, NUM_OF_PERIOD=1, and the date is May 15, 2005, then all records for April and the current month (May) are deleted in the W_PRODUCT_XACT_A table., 67523=131939, 67102=101010, 788659=HIER1_AXIS_SET_ID - 1001, 533460=This applies to all extracts done for Accrual Module from Oracle E-Business Suite 11.1.10 and R12.x.x., 70192=In Table B-3, in the first row, all accounts within the account number range from 101010 to 101099 that have a Chart of Account (COA) ID equal to 1 are assigned to Current Asset (that is, CA).
