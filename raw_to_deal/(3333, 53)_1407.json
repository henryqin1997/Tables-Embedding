For example, the protecting LSP is in standby mode. When the protecting LSP is required to recover normal traffic from the failed working LSP, the extra traffic is preempted. Extra traffic is not protected, but it can be restored. Extra traffic is transported using the protected LSP resources., 165729=In this example, the attribute-set named MYSET is specifying affinity as 0xBEEF. The signalled bandwidth has not been configured in this MYSET. The tunnel 10, meanwhile, has affinity 0xCAFE configured. LSPs computed from path-option 1 uses the affinity 0xBEEF/0xBEEF, while LSPs computed from path-option 2 uses the affinity 0xCAFE/0xCAFE. All LSPs computed using any of these path-options use signalled-bandwidth as 1000, as this is the only value that is specified only at the tunnel level., 646270=Frequency in minutes for the automatic bandwidth application.
