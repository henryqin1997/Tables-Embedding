After full or partial decommissioning or other change in operating status of the facility, the electric generating station\u2019s tax obligation shall be based, on an annual basis, on tax receipts, including payments in lieu of taxes or other compensation that have been negotiated in good faith by the electric generating station and municipality on or before January 30 of the current tax year; provided however, that if the electric generating station and municipality have not negotiated in good faith payments in lieu of taxes and other compensation in the nature of property tax payments by said January 30, then the facility\u2019s tax obligation shall be determined by an independent third party assessor paid by said facility, but selected jointly by the municipality and the facility, or if they are unable to arrive at a joint selection, by the department of revenue. The municipality shall be entitled to reimbursement for the difference between the amount called for in such assessment and the amount of the tax receipts, including payments in lieu of taxes or other compensation paid in the year prior to the full or partial decommissioning or other change in operating status of the facility, provided that such independent assessment is filed with any request for funds under this clause.

Each person so licensed shall file a sworn statement with the state treasurer every January providing the gross premiums charged for insurance procured or placed and the gross return premiums on such insurance cancelled under such license during the year ending on December 31 last preceding. At the time of filing such statement, each person licensed as a special insurance broker shall pay to the commonwealth a fee, less such return premiums so reported, as follows: (1) if the insurance covers properties, risks or exposures located or to be performed in the commonwealth and not in any other state, an amount equal to 4 per cent of such gross premiums; (2) if the insurance covers properties, risks or exposures located or to be performed both in and outside of the commonwealth: (i) an amount equal to 4 per cent of such gross premiums allocated to the commonwealth; plus (ii) an amount equal to the portion of the premiums allocated to other states or territories on the basis of the tax rates and fees applicable to properties, risks or exposures located or to be performed outside of the commonwealth; and (3) to the extent that other states where portions of the insured properties, risks or exposures are located have failed to enter into a compact or reciprocal allocation procedure with the commonwealth, the net premium tax collected shall be retained by the commonwealth. (e) Notwithstanding subsections (b), (c) and (d), the commissioner may enter into a cooperative agreement, reciprocal agreement or compact with another state or states in order to: facilitate the collection, allocation and disbursement of insurance premium fees and taxes attributable to the placement of unauthorized insurance; provide for uniform methods of allocation and reporting among unauthorized insurance risk classifications; and share information among states related to unauthorized insurance premium fees and taxes.

The commissioner may participate in any clearinghouse established pursuant to any such agreement or agreements for the purpose of collecting and disbursing to reciprocal states any funds collected pursuant to clause (3) of subsection (d) applicable to properties, risks or exposures located or to be performed outside of the commonwealth. In determining whether to enter in to such agreements or compacts, the commissioner may consider: (i) the efficiencies to be achieved in the reporting, payment, collection, allocation and disbursement of insurance premium fees and taxes attributable to the placement of unauthorized insurance; (ii) the amount of revenue to be generated through participation in any such agreements or compacts; and (iii) any other material factor relevant to the reporting, payment, collection, allocation or disbursement of insurance premium fees and taxes attributable to the placement of unauthorized insurance, as determined by the commissioner. Prior to entering into such an agreement or compact, the commissioner shall provide public notice and an opportunity for comment thereon.
