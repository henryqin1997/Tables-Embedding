Note: report of ndisgen process causing a faulty situation. Description: Wireless is active, but when trying to connect to the network, the screen goes dark and the system stops responding. The black screen can be removed by restarting, but after reboot PC-BSD\u00ae does not enter the boot loader section. The system shows a prompt FreeBSD (Amnesia mode). Likely solution: FreeBSD problem report and patch[3] for \"Unregistered use of FPU in kernel\" panic caused by miniport driver adapted via ndisgen.
