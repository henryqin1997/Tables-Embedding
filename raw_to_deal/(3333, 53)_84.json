The power consumption of the server. 2. The energy efficiency of the data center in terms of powering cooling and other server support functions (PUE). 3. The carbon footprint of the electricity generation fuel. What is the carbon footprint of a server? It turns out that the answer can vary by a factor of 10x, depending on three key factors. ict-footprint Green data center Submitted by Matt on Thu, 10/15/2009 - 16:54 Carbon Footprints of Servers Can Vary By 10X Green Biomed Green e-Devices Green Comm Green Office Green Data Center Why Green ICT?
