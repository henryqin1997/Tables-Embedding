With a 9.1:1 compression ratio, the Poncho with the 6X cylinder heads only required a maximum spark timing of 32 degrees BTDC. By any measure The Mule was an impressive engine. But we knew that the cylinder heads were at their maximum power potential, if the dyno needle were to move upwards, we needed to increase the volumetric efficiency of the engine., 67433=Casting number: 6X Combustion chamber volume: 96.2 ccs Compression ratio: 9.1:1 Valves: Manley SS 2.11/1.77-in Angles used in valve job Intake 45, 60, 75, and 82-deg, 82 is hand-blended into 75-deg., Exhaust 45-deg, 12mm radius Retainers: Comp Cams, steel, 10-deg Beehive Keepers: Comp Cams 10-degee, 11\u204432-in Valveguides: K-line bronze liner Valve Seals: Steel/Viton Rocker Studs: ARP 7\u204416-in Rocker Arms: Comp Cams aluminum full roller, 1.65:1 Pushrods: Manley 3\u20448x8.900-in, 46297=The Edelbrock D-port fully assembled castings can be purchased from many retailers. Summit Racing has them under part number EDL-61575 for hydraulic roller cam for $2,319 or EDL-61579 for hydraulic flat-tappet cam for $2,199 per pair. They come with 87cc chambers, 2.11/1.66 stainless steel valves, valvesprings, retainers, locks, 7\u204416-inch studs, and pushrod guide plates.

The cam with the 1.65:1 rockers lifted the valve to around 0.550 inch. If we average the airflow between those two lift points, we come up with around 243 cfm, which then calculates to 499 hp to our 492 hp actual reading. Extremely close, especially since we are not taking into consideration any flow loss from the intake manifold., 52751=With the Edelbrock castings, the smaller combustion chamber raised the compression ratio to 9.98:1 from 9.1:1. When going from cast-iron to aluminum, even with the exact same chamber design, the compression ratio needs to be at least one point higher to maintain the same thermal efficiency. Aluminum transfers more heat to the coolant and thus, has a lower thermal energy conversion. So in theory, forgetting about the different combustion chamber design and spark plug orientation, the just shy of one point more compression ratio almost makes things equal in that sense., 66346=Engine Displacement: 467 ci Bore/Stroke: 4.185 / 4.250-in Bore/Stroke ratio: 0.98:1 Rod/Stroke ratio: 1.6:1}", "textBeforeTable": "Edelbrock D-Port As Shipped Flow in cfm at 28-in/H2O Port Flow Regardless, the D-Port E-heads performed well and contain even more potential to be tapped.

I may be wrong, but the cam grind may need the intake valve opened a little earlier and the duration increased along with the overlap to help scavenging. But this is only a guess on my part. The other wild card is the exhaust flow. If I had to guess, I would say that it had a minimal impact on the pumping losses in the engine, but would help to limit the engine\u2019s ability to fill the cylinder bore with charge if energy is being used to push the inert gases out. A possible explanation may lie with the larger intake port volume that may create lower port velocity as the valve starts to lift along with the lower exhaust flow rate.

Now take the 492 (6X hp) and multiply it by 1.020 = 501.84 hp. It is almost the exact number we saw on the dyno for the E-head (502.8). A possible explanation may lie with the larger intake port volume that may create lower port velocity as the valve starts to lift along with the lower exhaust flow rate. In theory if the port velocity at low lift is lower then the VE will suffer in the beginning stages of the cylinder fill. The other wild card is the exhaust flow.
