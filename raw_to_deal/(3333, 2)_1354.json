We have found that this can be alleviated by reducing its running voltage down to around 7 volts by using an RC56 in-line resistor cable or two, and cooling performance is not significantly affected. Please consider ordering this resistor along with the CNPS20LQ if PC running noise is a strong consideration. CPU block installed onto a LGA1155 motherboard CNPS20LQ shown with two fans installed The CNPS20LQ Liquid CPU cooler is fully assembled, factory filled and sealed, making it as easy to install as an air cooler and chassis fan. Factory sealing eliminates the extra user maintenance common with component-built liquid cooling systems. The pump is built into the CPU block and is powered by a 3-pin fan header. The radiator can accommodate two 120mm fans (one supplied) for ultimate performance.
