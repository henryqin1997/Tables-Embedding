Venue: Vintage Inn, 6541 Washington Street, Yountvilla, CA 94599, United States., 16498=An indefinite strike by Deutsche Post delivery workers will be gradually phased in later on June 8, 2015, the trade union Verdi announced. Verdi said the firm had not moved a millimetre towards a solution in the pay dispute during six rounds of negotiations and had ignored an offer from the union. Millions of letters and packages are expected to arrive late in the coming days. Verdi wants pay to remain under Deutsche Post's remit., 14460=Deutsche Post dismissed the demands made by the trade union ver.di in the sixth round of collective bargaining negotiations on June 9, 2015. Ver.di's proposal does not contribute to a sustainable future for employees or the company. By demanding that the regional parcel delivery companies, which have been operating for months, be disbanded, the trade union is challenging its own regional collective bargaining agreements for the freight and logistics industry. Now they are calling on 130,000 Deutsche Post AG employees to go on strike in protest against regional companies, in which 6,000 employees work under collective bargaining agreements. This so-called proposal, which came with the ultimatum that it be accepted immediately, and was therefore not even open to negotiation, does not resolvethe union issues. Additional costs of around EUR 300 million would considerably exacerbate. The latest demands from ver.di are shortsighted and are an obstacle to finding a sustainable solution. The proposed improvements to the special payments and the automatic age-related wage increases do not reflect the regional ver.di collective bargaining agreements in any way. Furthermore, the proposals are for a limited period until 2020, with no after-effects. There is also no accounting for the different cost of living from region to region. The demand for five years' protection against dismissal goes far beyond all current regulations as well as the agreements ver.di has made with other industries. Indeed by demanding the complete integration of parcel delivery into the company collective agreement, this proposal actually falls short of the special provision agreed to years ago.}", "textBeforeTable": "Industry Average DPW Industry Analysis \u00a0 // ]]> } document.write(BW_adsys('Right3')); if (window.BW_adsys) { // <script type=\"text/javascript\"> <div class=\"\" style=\"width:300px; margin: auto; \"> <div class=\"ad\"> </div> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td class=\"noDataRR\" style=\"border:none;\" colspan=\"3\"><a class=\"link_xs\" href=\"../../sectorandindustry/industries/industrydetail.asp?code=203010\">View Industry Companies</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"negData\">-0.11</span></td> <td align=\"right\">$102.64 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">USD</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=UPS:US\">United Parcel Service Inc</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"negData\">-0.01</span></td> <td align=\"right\">\u20ac7.62 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">EUR</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=TNTE:NA\">TNT Express NV</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"posData\">+0.10</span></td> <td align=\"right\">SFr.133.70 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">CHF</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=KNIN:VX\">Kuehne + Nagel International AG</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"posData\">+1.30</span></td> <td align=\"right\">&yen;781.00 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">JPY</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=6501:JP\">Hitachi Ltd</a></td> <tr> </tr> <td align=\"right\"><span class=\"posData\">+8.50</span></td> <td align=\"right\">kr243.00 <span class=\"xSmGreyTxt\">DKK</span></td> <td><a class=\"link_xsb\" href=\"../snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=DSV:DC\">DSV A/S</a></td> <tr> <tbody> </thead> </tr> <td width=\"50\" align=\"right\">Change</td> <td width=\"75\" align=\"right\">Last</td> <td>Company</td> <tr> <thead> <table class=\"colRight\" width=\"100%\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"> <div class=\"clear\"></div> </div> <p class=\"note fLeft\" style=\"width:64%; text-align: right; padding: 5px 0; border-top: 3px solid #6B7B84; margin-top: 20px;\">Market data is delayed at least 15 minutes.</p> <h2 class=\"sectionTitle fLeft\" style=\"width: 35%; border-bottom: 0;\">DPW Competitors</h2> <div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; overflow: hidden;\"> <div class=\"\"> </div> </table> </tbody> </tr> <td width=\"75\" align=\"right\" class=\"noBorder\"><img src=\"/cgi-bin/upload.dll/file.png?z04ae100azcb474b8f5a5e408b8870ea874edaffcd\" width=\"60\" height=\"15\" galleryimg=\"no\" symbol=\"DE;DPWX.N\" /></td> <td align=\"right\" width=\"45\" class=\"noBorder\"><span class=\"negData\">-0.063</span></td> <td align=\"right\" class=\"noBorder\">\u20ac27.91", "textAfterTable": "View Detailed DPW Financials \u00a0|\u00a0 View Sector Analysis Sponsored Financial Commentaries Sponsored Links Browse Companies A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z \u00a0|\u00a0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Report Data Issue To contact DEUTSCHE POST AG-REG, please visit www.deutschepost.de.
