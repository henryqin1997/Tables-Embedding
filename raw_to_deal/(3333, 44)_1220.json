The different fonts recommended by a given LanguageFontGroup, exposed as separate LanguageFontGroup properties, correspond to different usage cases. Each LanguageFontGroup property returns a LanguageFont object, which provides the details for that particular font recommendation. Those details include a font family as well as font weight, style and stretch attributes. The weight/style/stretch attributes are significant for some usage cases but not others. For instance, the font recommendations for the various UI usage categories may use fonts from the same font family but differ in weight (for example, Segoe UI Semilight for UITextFont, but Segoe UI Regular for UICaptionFont). But for some usage cases, the weight/style/stretch attributes might always indicate a \"regular\" font (regular weight, normal style, normal stretch). In those cases, apps might want to apply other weight/style/stretch formatting as may be appropriate for the app scenario. See the remarks for each LanguageFontGroup property for additional information. For some languages and scripts, the LanguageFontGroup may not provide a font recommendation for every usage case. For instance, fixed-width fonts are not provided in Windows for every script. See the remarks for each LanguageFontGroup property for additional information.
