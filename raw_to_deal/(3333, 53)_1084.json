I should point out that i am sick of the negativity on other boards. I think its kind of rediculous to be throwing trash at the players right now. They are still implementing a new system under Renney and at least 4 guys are feeling their way into the full time NHL game, with another 3 feeling their way with a new team. Yes Penner looks slow and out of gas quickly but who knows why. He looked like a beast opening night so it might be flu. Also, the players havent been able to get into much of a groove having a month off in between games. Khabi was spectacular and i hate the thought of giving other goalies any time in between the pipes. Peckham i think is becoming very dependable and knows the targets that he wants to finish hits on\u2026rather than trying to nail everyone. He rarely allowed Iginla to stand, once he closed in. I dont know if its consistent but he seems to not care about getting out of position to finish off guys like Stajan etc which i feel is alright. Pick your spots. The boards arent a dangerous tactical area anyways. Whitney and the rest of the defence continue to have me shaking my head. I dont know why we have so many lapses. If the choice is to eat board or pass an easy reception to cogs for a breakout\u2026 i feel you brace to eat boards. Brule had some good intensity but i really do wish that the most effective player of that line wouldnt always be the rookie thats put with them. Hell the rookie even had to glove down a waist high pass in order for the line to accomplish anything on the night. (Intersting to see im not the only one who uses his thigh as fulcrum on inclose one handed shots) Gags and Hemsky continue to impress me game after game. Ive bashed both for years. I dont know how the trash thrower on other boards are perceiving Hemmer and Gags as culprits for our losing. As a long time hater of Hemsky and Gags\u2026 if they had fault in their games i would have jumped on them by now\u2026 but i really dont see any. I must be blind. Still not sold on Foster nor Fraser. To think that Morrison was available. Perhaps like Malhotra Morrison just didnt want to be in a rebuild? I always liked the guy., 73195=Thats really weird. I wonder why Smid isnt with Foster. Perhaps it is IT management to keep his minutes low for PK? I know i call VAndermeer Douche but he is the lesser of two evils when compared to Struds. I think the SJ collapse was more about his partner than him. Its like when Ulanov got benched for the rest of the year after playing with Cross for 6 games. Cross couldnt handle the new speed in the game and i felt Ulanov kept his game simple but always had to cover for Cross AND had to eliminate Cross from his options since COry was screwing up everything. Ulanov wasnt exactly great in those games but i remember the big interceptions that everyone pointed to for him being scratched the rest of the year werent even his fault. One was a simple out let to HOrc but Horc chose to change rather than accept the pass and it went by him onto sakics stick just outside the blue and well\u2026 its sakic catching us on a line change\u2026back of the net. The other was a simple in zone cross to Cross, an average everyday play and it was on fresh ice and it stopped suddenly in a bit of water right at the hash marks. Forechecker got their first even though Cross was far closer. Boom. goal. If Cross had skating ability he would have easily gotten to the puck and played it off the wall or back to Ulie.

I\u2019m going to have to figure that the Oilers put up a much better effort against Calgary tonight than the last game (both their last game \u2013 against SJ \u2013 and their last game against the Flames). I still question whether that will be enough. So I\u2019m going to go with a 4-2 Calgary win here, although I think the Oilers will show a very spirited effort (oh god, please). The Oilers had back into Calgary tonight to take on the Calgary Flames. The last outing was a pretty poor one, as the Flames beat us 5-3\u2026 although the score probably shouldn\u2019t have been that close. The Oilers played a good half of a game,", "textAfterTable": "LIVE GAME CHAT Closed. POST-GAME RANT Well, fantastic 25-ish minute game played by the Oilers tonight. Too bad they didn\u2019t show up until the 3rd period. The first two periods were god awful to the point that I think many Oilers fans were seen researching the top draft picks in 2011. But credit to the Oilers for battling hard in the 3rd period. You have to wonder where that fight was in the first 2 periods though. Did the Flames just tire themselves out? At any rate, Jordan Eberle scored yet another beauty. This kid only scores gorgeous goals, apparently. Taylor Hall had an average game, at best. Paajarvi scored a wonderful partial-breakaway goal. Khabibulin was solid, if not stellar in goal for most of the night and held the fort long enough for the team to rally back. This is one of those games where maybe you can chalk it up to growing pains, however even guy\u2019s like Whitney were making huge mistakes. Smid and Peckham, however, each looked very solid. I thought that even Strudwick wasn\u2019t too bad out there. But it just wasn\u2019t the night for Foster and Whitney, early on, as they both seemed very scary defensively. I know Whitney will bounce back, but I do question Foster\u2019s risk vs. his reward. He did score a goal tonight, be also created one on a poor pinch, as well as got burned pinching again later on (although no goal was scored", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
