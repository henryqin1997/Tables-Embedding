We are delighted to see this effort moving forward and expect great results from these planning grants.\" WASHINGTON, DC - The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Higher Education for Development (HED) announced today 40 paired winners of the Africa-U.S. Higher Education Initiative Planning Grant Competition. Nearly 300 applications were submitted for capacity-building partnerships between U.S. colleges and universities and higher education institutions in Sub-Saharan African nations. Paired winners will receive planning grants from USAID of $50,000 each. 202-712-4320 USAID Press Office Monday, April 13, 2009 For Immediate Release", "textAfterTable": "These paired institutions will use the grants to develop plans to address regional and national economic development priorities such as engineering, health, agriculture, environment and natural resources, science and technology, education and teacher training/preparation, and business, management and economics. HED manages the competition which grew out of the Africa-U.S. Higher Education Initiative (www.aplu.org), a collaborative effort between a number of higher education associations and other organizations, led by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (A\u06f0P\u06f0L\u06f0U), formerly the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC). \"We were elated by the astounding number of highly qualified applications received, and even more pleased by how many applications demonstrated a strong understanding of higher education needs in Africa,\" said Dr. Tully Cornick, executive director of HED. \"The top 40 winners represent the best of these applications, and plans that are developed as a result of the grants will address a variety of critical development needs. It is our belief that if funding is found to implement these plans, we will see tangible, measurable and sustainable impact made in these African countries.\" \"This important initiative continues to illustrate the enormous unmet need for higher education partnerships in Africa,\" added Peter McPherson, president of A\u06f0P\u06f0L\u06f0U. \"We see this as just the beginning - this is an ongoing campaign to accomplish much more in engaging higher education institutions in Africa.\" HED, funded by a cooperative agreement with USAID, was founded by the six major U.S. higher education associations to engage U.S. colleges", "hasKeyColumn": true, "keyColumnIndex": 0, "headerRowIndex": 0}
