Broadly, a language has a collection of tokens (words, or the vocabulary) and rules, or PRODUCTIONS, for generating sentences using these tokens (grammar). A grammar describes an entire language using a finite set of productions of tokens or other productions; however this finite set of rules can easily allow an infinite range of valid sentences of the language they describe. Note, helpers cannot directly be used in productions.
