Coupled with network management tools, Cisco AVC provides a powerful and pervasive integrated solution for discovering and controlling applications within the network. Empowered with these tools, network administrators can gain a much deeper insight into applications running in their networks and their performance characteristics, while applying policies to further improve performance and control of network resource usage., 29695=Cisco Prime Infrastructure can also configure AVC monitoring for both the ISR G2 and ASR1000.

In addition, there are specific engines which analyzes performance metrics for voice, video, and TCP applications. All information is aggregated and then exported through open export format such as Netflow Version 9 and IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX). Classic NetFlow (also called Traditional NetFlow) and NetFlow version 5 are not suitable for AVC because they can only report layer 3 and layer 4 information.
