We have newly added to the PSF series a product that features large capacitance of 1,200 \u03bcF at 2.5 V, while keeping an ESR of 5 m\u03a9. This will contribute in reducing the number of VRM bulk capacitors used in PC, which will take up less space of the substrate. It is also suitable for use in power supply outputs for noise absorption.
