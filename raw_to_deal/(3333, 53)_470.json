But their newly gained respect could fuel the only thing capable of beating this team right now -- itself. That is exactly what to worry about. The offense is grooving like Rosie O'Donnell at 24-hour Ponderosa and the defense is still the nation's best. What's there to worry about? There's some \"Why Not Boeckman\" chatter for the Heisman and we've even gone so far as to -- gasp -- favorably compare the current crop of skill players with last year's set. Fresh off a resounding victory in Happy Valley and the accompanying props from most of the college football punditry, Buckeye fan is feeling better than Alex Boone in an end zone.

Their head coach is all of 37 years old, is a master of the rulebook and is the only active Big Ten coach with a better winning percentage than the Vest. Did I mention that the Badgers also have history on their side? They've won the last three matchups in Columbus and 4 of the last 6 overall. Tressel is a scratch-your-eyes-that-can't-be-true 1-3 against Wisconsin, his worst record against any Big Ten team and if that wasn't enough, Cris Carter's brother plays for the Badgers. Even when Wisconsin was craptacular in the early to mid-eighties, they gave the Buckeyes fits. They haven't played in three years, but all I can remember from the Barry Alvarez squads is that they used to hurt Buckeyes and they liked to come back on OSU in the Shoe. In the three most recent meetings in Columbus, the Buckeyes have squandered leads of 17-0 twice and in the last meeting, Ohio State lost an early 10-point lead before Anthony Davis and John Stocco got it going and put the Buckeyes away 24-13.
