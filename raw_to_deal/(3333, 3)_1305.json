During the third year of the program, students are permitted to elect courses in either school, as they are in the earlier years if they place out of \u201ccore or foundation\u201d courses. Students are generally not restricted in their choices beyond fulfilling the requirements listed. Students admitted to the combined program are required to complete the first year courses at one school during the first year, and to complete the first year courses at the other school in the second year. The purpose of this is to give students some coherence in their programs and gain a sense of belonging to a community. Students may begin at either school. Each school will apply its own deferred admission standards to students who elect to take the first year in the other school.
