Health points are somewhat more complicated, and there is an entire section devoted to it, you start the game with a certain level of health per level based on your resolve. Feats are a further way to customize your character. Each character starts with 7 Talent points to distribute amongst various talents, which are purchased in the same way as skills, except that each talent has a certain number of ranks available.
