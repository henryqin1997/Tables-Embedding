SGP: Each student who participated in the MCAS ELA or Mathematics tests in grades 4-8 or 10 and who also took the last MCAS test in that subject receives a Student Growth Percentile (SGP) score. The SGP compares a student's MCAS score with the scores of all students in the state at that grade level who received similar MCAS scores in prior years. SGPs range from 1 to 99, with 50 being average; higher numbers represent higher growth and lower numbers represent lower growth. An SGP of 75, for example, means the student's progress is higher than 75 percent and lower than 25 percent of the students in the state with similar prior test scores. This method works independently of MCAS performance levels. Therefore, all students, no matter the scores they earned on past MCAS tests, have an equal chance to demonstrate growth at any of the 99 percentiles.
