(AP) -- Romero Osby's free throws with 2:58 remaining put Oklahoma ahead to stay and the Sooners rallied to beat Oral Roberts 63-62 Wednesday night. Buddy Hield scored all 11 of his points in the second half to help the Sooners (5-1) come back from a 54-44 deficit in the final 9:07. Amath M'Baye led Oklahoma with 12 points and nine rebounds, and Osby finished with 11 points. \"When they were up 10, I thought our guys did toughen up a little bit defensively and got some big stops,\" Sooners coach Lon Kruger said. \"But I really thought ORU outplayed us for the most part.\" Amath M'Baye led Oklahoma with 12 points and nine rebounds, and Osby finished with 11 points. Warren Niles led the Golden Eagles (3-4) with 21 points and Shawn Glover added 17 points. The Sooners are 3-0 in games decided by seven points or fewer. \"I feel our team has a great ability to show up in the clutch,\" M'Baye said. After Osby's two free throws made it 61-60 with 2:58 to play, Steven Pledger's driving basket increased the Sooners' lead to 63-60 at 1:12. Steven Roundtree scored with 18 seconds left for ORU, but missed a free throw that would have tied it. Glover scrambled for the rebound and the Golden Eagles called time out. Glover missed a 10-foot shot with 1.4 seconds remaining and Osby got the rebound. \"Shawn's a good player and we wanted him to take that shot,\" Roundtree said. Osby was fouled and missed both free throws but Oral Roberts' Niles missed from half-court as time expired. Glover's jumper gave the Golden Eagles their biggest lead at 54-44 with 9:07 to go. But Roundtree, Oral Roberts' top rebounder, was on the bench with four fouls and the Sooners took advantage with a 12-2 run, tying it on Hield's jumper with 4:54 to play. \"Roundtree is a key for them and with him getting in a little foul trouble, that helped us,\" Kruger said. Roundtree, who had 14 points and eight rebounds, responded with his first basket of the second half, but Pledger answered with a 3-pointer to give the Sooners a 59-58 edge -- their first lead since 7-6. Glover's jumper gave ORU its last lead at 60-59 with 3:22 left. \"It's a tough loss, it never gets easy losing these type of games,\" Oral Roberts coach Scott Sutton said. \"You can't get outrebounded like we did in the second half, we gave up 18 offensive rebounds (in the game) and commit the careless turnovers that we did and expect to win. I told our guys I was proud of how we competed. I thought they played with great energy.\" Oklahoma has won 13 in a row over Oral Roberts since losing the first two in a series that began in the 1975-76 season. It was the Sooners' first game at Oral Roberts since 1995 and the fourth time the Golden Eagles have hosted the Sooners overall. \"We were fortunate to learn a lot from this ballgame and still have it be in the right column so I feel good about that, but we still have a lot of work to do,\" Kruger said. The Sooners outrebounded the Golden Eagles 37-33. Oral Roberts shot 47 percent from the field while Oklahoma made 40 percent. Niles had 12 points and Roundtree scored 10 to spark the Golden Eagles to a 35-31 lead at halftime. A sloppy start to the second half resulted in each team managing only two points in the first 4\u00bd minutes. Niles then sank three throws after being fouled on a long-range shot and added a basket off a steal to give Oral Roberts its biggest lead at 42-33. The Sooners responded with a 6-0 run that was stopped by Damen Bell-Holter's dunk as the Golden Eagles responded with six straight points. \"We should've closed it out,\" Niles said. \"We had it under control and let it slip away.\"}", "textBeforeTable": "\u00a0 \u00a0 (3-4, 0-0) \u00a0 Stats (PDF) | Notes | Quotes | \u00a0Photos |Replay \u00a0 62 27 35 \u00a0Oral Roberts 63 32 31 \u00a0Oklahoma F 2nd 1st \u00a0 (5-1, 0-0) \u00a0 \u00a0", "textAfterTable": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Individual Leaders \u00a0Stat \u00a0Oklahoma \u00a0Oral Roberts \u00a0Points \u00a0M'Baye -12 \u00a0Niles - 19 \u00a0Rebounds \u00a0M'Baye - 9 \u00a0Roundtree - 14 \u00a0Assists \u00a0Cousins - 3 \u00a0Jackson - 5 \u00a0Steals \u00a0Two with 2 \u00a0Roundtree - 2 \u00a0Blocks \u00a0Osby - 1 \u00a0Three with 1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Performance of the Game \u00a0 Freshman G Buddy Hield The freshman had 11 points, all with less than 15 minutes remaining that sparked a 2nd-half rally on the road.
