Chopard offers the following services for jewellery: cleaning, polishing and size alterations. Tips on caring for your product Cleaning Before cleaning your watch, make sure the crown and pushers are correctly pushed back in and/or screwed depending on the model. We advise washing the watch with soap and regularly rinsing it under running water, especially if it is often used in salt water. Moreover, the use of chemical products for cleaning a watch is definitely not recommended, since it could damage the strap/bracelet and the water-resistance gaskets. Jewellery models with mobile elements (e.g. diamonds, gold letter, etc.) between one or two sapphire crystals are not guaranteed water-resistant. This means it is advisable to avoid any contact with alcohol-based products (perfumes, creams, etc.) as well as immersion in fresh or sea water. \u00a0 Checking the gaskets Chopard watches are equipped with security gaskets that guarantee their water-resistance. Over time, these gaskets may deteriorate and the case may be less resistant to water. We kindly recommend having the water-resistance of a Chopard watch tested by an official service centre once every year, before engaging in any prolonged aquatic activity or after a violent shock. \u00a0 Condensation", "hasKeyColumn": false, "keyColumnIndex": -1, "headerRowIndex": 0}
