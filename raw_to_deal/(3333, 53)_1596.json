TextFormatter can handle different text character formats and paragraph styles, and includes support for international text layout. Unlike a traditional text API, the TextFormatter interacts with a text layout client through a set of callback methods. It requires the client to provide these methods in an implementation of the TextSource class. The following diagram illustrates the interaction of the text formatter client and the text layout client. Interaction between the text layout client and the TextFormatter object Text Formatting Services TextFormatter provides support for text features, such as OpenType typography, as well as support for text run, line, and paragraph level features. The following table is a list of the key TextFormatter supported services for text features. Feature Description Background brush The Brush that is used for the background color.
