Every such binding must indicate indicates the SOAP version that it uses, this is done with the property version (with a value \"1.2\", for example, meaning SOAP version 1.2). Every binding also must specify specifies with the property protocol the underlying protocol that is uses., 90472=Each SOAP binding operation must specify specifies the SOAP message exchange pattern it uses \u2014 the appropriate URI from the SOAP specification is pointed to using the property soapMEP. The ontology also introduces range of this property is the SOAP\u00a01.2 class SOAPMessageExchangePattern http://www.w3.org/2006/02/soap12/abstractions#classOfMEPs that contains all the SOAP MEPs. Some bindings (especially those that are not specific to any interface) will rely on defaulting to set the SOAP message exchange pattern, this default is captured using the property defaultSoapMEP., 80114=All MEPs are identified by IRIs, and the RDF ontology for WSDL only puts the MEPs in the correct classes; assigns classes to MEPs; for example http://www.w3.org/2006/01/wsdl/in-only http://www.w3.org/ns/wsdl/in-only is an instance of the class NoFaults. The message labels, however, are plain string names, and the RDF ontology for WSDL gives each of them an IRI formed by the MEP IRI, the hash sign '#' and the actual message label, and these IRIs are referenced from the MEPs with the property definesMessageLabel. Any newly created MEPs should also provide IRIs for the message labels, as the RDF mapping depends on being able to identify the message labels on interface message references.}", "lastModified": "Fri, 23 Mar 2007 22:11:23 GMT", "textBeforeTable": "problems --> multiple WSDL documents are merged and that section 4.2 points out some normative part of the RDF mapping do not consider the case where 293: agree with Karl that the text is unclear; clarify that the to define a mechanism achieving the same results. group is better to define it normatively.

WSDL interfaces can extend other WSDL interfaces, which is indicated by the property extends. Interfaces may have operations and faults, represented as instances of the InterfaceOperation and InterfaceFault classes classes, and each pointed to with the properties interfaceOperation and interfaceFault, respectively. There are a number of properties applicable to InterfaceOperation instances: instances (corresponding to the properties of the WSDL Interface Operation component ): messageExchangePattern property points to an instance of the class MessageExchangePattern and thus indicates the message exchange pattern (MEP) used by this operation; there can be only one MEP on one operation operationStyle property points to an instance of the class OperationStyle and indicates that the operation adheres to the given style; there can be multiple operation styles on a single operation interfaceMessageReference and interfaceFaultReference properties point to instances of InterfaceMessageReference and InterfaceFaultReference classes respectively, which are described later.
