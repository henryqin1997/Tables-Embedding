However, for data and map production purposes (capture, revision and maintenance) all sections of the specification should be read together, as specifications for one product impact on the others. Similarly the specification covers 1:25 000, 1:100 000 and 1:250 000 scale products. Elements specific to one scale or the other are identified within the specifications., 8690=Section 1 clarifies the aspects of the feature based models used for TOPO250K and TOPO100K National Topographic Databases (NTDBs) as well as the model used in the 1:25 000 data capture program.

Each Section and Appendix provides a link to all areas on the left hand side of the page, to gain a heading description for each Section and Appendix merely rest your mouse on the link. Users should always refer to the Feature Type Cross Reference Tables in Appendix R as a first step, to ensure the entity they are dealing with is listed as a feature type, many feature types are known by various names by different individuals, organisations and States. The column titled 'Commonly used term' of the Feature Type Cross Reference Tables lists the known names for features while the 'Feature Type' column guides the user to the name used for the feature type in the specifications. These specifications and the associated table below represents the Production geodatabase schema. This schema differs in structure and precision to the Distribution geodatabase schema supplied by Geoscience Australia to the public via on-line downloads and packaged products. A distribution schema to production schema cross reference, as well as a production schema to distribution schema cross reference is provided to assist in translation by users. This cross reference details both the TOPO250K GEODATA product and the future TOPO100K Geodata Lite product distribution schemas against the production schema.
