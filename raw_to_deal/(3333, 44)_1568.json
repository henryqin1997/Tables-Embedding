But in reality, these companies leverage their buying power to reduce local costs. Additionally, in many developing countries, a local guide will secure much cheaper prices than you can as a foreigner. With that said, be wary of \u2018local payments\u2019 and other extras.", "Tour companies take care of all local planning. The only things left are visas, flights, vaccinations, and gear. With a packaged tour, you could conceivably enter a country without even knowing what currency they use. As sterile as this sounds, it\u2019s a godsend in some bureaucratic countries.", "Packaged tours benefit from the safety of larger groups and guides with local knowledge. That means you\u2019re much less likely to stroll into dangerous areas, offend the local people, or get up to mischief with local bureaucrats. Most people would agree that packaged tours are generally the safer alternative.", "Packaged tours tend to follow fixed itineraries, which means they\u2019re travelling along relatively well-trodden paths. However, local guides can leverage their knowledge to help you interact with the local culture. We\u2019ve been invited into the homes of local people in remote areas due to the local connections of our guide.", "Our experience is that packaged tours (of the grass-roots variety) are more \u2018hit\u2019 than \u2018miss\u2019. That means, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll get along with your fellow travellers than not. We\u2019ve kept in touch with many fellow travellers from packaged tours and have had a ball along the way. But when you\u2019re with other people (especially local guides), locals are less likely to approach."], ["Independent Group", "When you plan your own trip, you only pay for what you want. You\u2019re not paying for entry into a museum that doesn\u2019t interest you or for food you don\u2019t plan to eat. However, you tend to lose out on group discounts and savings available to those with local knowledge. The most grass-roots tours tend to cost less than your best efforts, but most other tours will cost more.", "Planning a trip yourself can be very rewarding. It teaches you about the country before you even arrive and it prepares you to deal with issues once there. But many independent trips never even depart because the planning gets too overwhelming. In some countries, it just makes sense to leverage the local knowledge of a guide.", "Some of the independent trips on Globetrooper have 20+ people, which is more than the average grass-roots adventure tour. But that isn\u2019t the norm. Generally, the lack of local knowledge and smaller group sizes make independent trips less safe. There are exceptions, but they\u2019re rare.", "Independent trips have the potential to be much more authentic, since you can go anywhere you choose and interact with the locals by yourself, without the safety net of a seasoned guide. However, safety concerns and shyness can actually keep people from delving deep into local cultures. The opportunity is certainly there, but in confronting places it takes daring people to really get an authentic experience.", "If you travel in a group of existing friends, it\u2019s quite difficult to make new friends. People are less likely to approach, and you\u2019ll be less likely to approach others too, even other travellers. But if you travel with strangers (woo hoo, Globetrooper), your chances are much higher. Of course you risk being stuck with crazy people, but that\u2019s the risk you have to take to meet new people. The best chance to meet locals is on your own."]], "pageTitle": "Packaged Group Tours vs Independent Group Trips", "title": "", "url": "http://globetrooper.com/notes/group-tours-vs-independent-trips/", "hasHeader": true, "headerPosition": "FIRST_ROW", "tableType": "RELATION", "tableNum": 0, "s3Link": "common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042990611.52/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002310-00222-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "recordEndOffset": 104555167, "recordOffset": 104541382, "tableOrientation": "HORIZONTAL", "textBeforeTable": "The following table compares packaged group tours and independent adventure trips across five areas: cost, preparation, safety, authenticity and friendships. Under the Microscope Lauren in Egypt on a packaged ATV Trip through the Desert. We\u2019re not suggesting you become Alexander Supertramp and self-realize yourself to starvation. We\u2019re talking about trips with other people, planned by groups themselves, and adjusted along the way as the group sees fit. One of these independent trips may even include a guided tour or two, but mostly, the group does the planning. Many of the trips on Globetrooper are independent, but many also use tour operators. See, we\u2019re unbiased :) What is an Independent Group Trip? We\u2019re not talking about those coach tours with 30+ participants that fly through towns and stop only for photos of churches and American fast food outlets. We\u2019re talking about grass-roots tours, typically with 5 to 15 people, designed with sustainability in mind, and structured to take you far from the comforts of home.

Or", "textAfterTable": "Conclusion It all depends on where you\u2019re going and what your objectives are. If you\u2019re going to a developing country with a vastly different culture to your own, then joining a packaged group can be more rewarding. However, if you have lots of time and you\u2019re looking for a challenge, going it alone can feel like a real adventure. Personally, if I could build a good-sized group (say 6+ strangers), I\u2019d prefer to travel to most places in an independent group. However, it\u2019s not easy to orchestrate a trip like that, so in most developing countries, I\u2019d at least join one packaged tour even if I planned to stay by myself much longer.
